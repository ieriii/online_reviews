I waited two hours in line for the hot dogs and fries here. And you know what? I'd easily have waited two more. This was, bar none, the best tubed meat I've ever eaten. I went here thinking this was just a place for a good Chicago-style hot dog. No no! It's so much more. To give you and idea: after whipping out my iPhone to see the menu (yes, it's online complete with the daily specials), I had to make the hardest decision of my life. Alligator sausage or hot dog with foie gras? I chose the latter. It was probably the richest, most extravagant hot dog I'd ever eaten. Sausage with foie gras on it with truffle aoili on it. Dear gods, it was amazing. And the fries! The FRIES! Duck fat french fries. This, my dear Benjamin Franklin, is proof that god loves us. Right there. And how much did all this artery clogging goodness cost? Not even $15 for 2 dogs (the fancy and a non-fancy one), splitting the fries, and a drink. Have I found heaven? I think I may have. I will be going to this place every time I go to Chicago. It's worth it.
