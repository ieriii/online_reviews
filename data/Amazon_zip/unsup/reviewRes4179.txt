It took a lot of work to get a reservation and the place looks closed from the outside. The service was great. I can't say I loved every flavor and bite, but this was a culinary adventure I truly enjoyed. I had textures, flavors and foods I'd never experienced before Schwa. A gray Spanish cheese sauce, rutabaga balls, pine essence and horseradish foam were just few examples of the artful elements of their dishes. Schwa also reminded me that a good dessert doesn't need to have chocolate. I'll go back.
