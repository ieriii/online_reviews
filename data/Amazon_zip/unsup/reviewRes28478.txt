After reading good reviews on Yelp, I decided to order carryout from the Pasta Bowl's online menu. The dish itself was ok, however my interaction with the staff was not. According to the menu, the dish "Ravioli with Bolognese Sauce" costs $8.50. Summary of conversation in the restaurant after they try to charge me too much: (I see they are charging me over $10 after tax) - me: That price seems higher than it should be. - staff: Oh, it's tax. (obviously I know what tax is, and see that they were charging me $9.50 pretax for the dish) - me: That's not the price that's listed on the menu currently on your website. It should be $8.50. - staff: The menu online is old. - me: That doesn't matter. You are trying to charge me a different price than I looked at when I decided to order. I'm paying what's listed online. (even though they acknowledge they are trying to charge me a higher price than advertised, they make me get out my phone to show them the menu) - staff: Our website says that prices are subject to change with no notice - me: The price hasn't changed, its still listed for $8.50! After 5 more minutes of arguing and making it clear that I would walk out of the restaurant with no food before paying the higher price, they eventually gave me the correct price. When you are aware that you are charging a different price than listed on your menu, you should apologize, give the customer the food at the price listed, and change your menu. If you did that, I wouldn't be writing this review. You shouldn't argue for over 5 minutes. Luckily I had previously read the review by Rick T. talking about servers rounding up the bill so I paid close attention to the bill and was able to catch this. Even weeks after this experience, their online menu still hasn't been changed. I wonder how much money they have made by advertising one price, and duping people into paying another.
