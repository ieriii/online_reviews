This place has the honor of probably having my favorite meal in Chicago.....the Peking Duck!!!! That being said their other dishes, roast pork, Chinese broccoli, and even the infamous bittermelon are awesome! This is quite an authentic Hong Kong BBQ place, and its you probably get more "bang for your buck" here than anywhere.  Now to discuss the Peking duck. I have been to Beijing many a time for work, and after having the duck from there I fell in love with it. I have tried the dish in other parts of China, and frankly it didn't live up to the authentic version in Beijing. The GF talked me in to trying it in Chicago, and I am soooo glad she did! It tastes very very authentic here, and I actually prefer the steamed buns over the pancake. Additionally, for the $35 you pay for this not only do you get the sliced duck with the buns, but you get duck fried rice, and duck broth soup as well! Talk about a value! To sum up now, I recently went to a beer dinner there in collaboration with Goose Island, and it was Greg Hall's last dinner as brewmaster with Goose Island. The pairings were excellent with the food, and I highly recommend pairing the Peking duck with Matilda. The beer really compliments the dish nicely! Go and check out Sun Wah now!!!!
