I moved in to a place a couple blocks from this place back in October. I had gone a couple times and thought it was pretty decent and priced very well. However, this evening I went to get dinner to go and was very disappointed. They have recently raised their prices and reduced their portions considerably. My friends and I ordered dinners that had black beans as a side. We received containers that appeared to be more like bean soup. There were roughly 19 beans in a half pint container. Ridiculous. The food was still pretty good, but I felt very cheated considering what I paid. $9.99 dinner platter has been increased to $15.99. I wouldn't complain so much, but for the fact that the portions are smaller. I MIGHT go back for the Saturday pig roasts when the weather is nicer, but right now I am looking forward to trying some other Cuban restaurants.
