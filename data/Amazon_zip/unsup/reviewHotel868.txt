Large, very clean, new enough decor, staid new mission style decor but not too overdone. Solid and tasteful enough. Good architecture. Mostly nice, professional and informed staff. The wireless internet works well and fast. In-room single-serve Starbucks. Wake-up call gives weather. Good linens but hard thick pillows, they need new ones. Nicer than comparable hotels in SF. Not shabby. I could hear the trains but was far enough away that it sounded pleasant like a wave--ask for a back room if you hate noise. Very downtown Chicago atmosphere but not chaotic or overly commercial, near the Art Institute. Interior room had view of courtyard/walls but nice windows (not openable), good light. You can regulate your room's digital thermostat. I would have given it a 4 except for a few flukes. My bathroom ceiling leaked (I was under the roof air conditioner) and it smelled damp and was always too cold despite my changing the temperature. There was a panel cut in the bathroom ceiling probably to fix this leak previously, the water dripped in around it. Obviously this room has a moisture problem from that. They moved me graciously and the new room was great. The second morning my coffee maker spurted the water it heated spurted all over, and when I called the desk to ask for a replacement I was told there were no rooms left therefore no more coffee makers and I would have to go get my own coffee in the restaurant as the staff had not arrived (6:30am). No spare at the front desk? Big hotel for no night staff. I managed to fix it myself--when it was cleaned the hosing was disconnected.
