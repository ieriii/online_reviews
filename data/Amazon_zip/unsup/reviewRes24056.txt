So it was cool to eat in a restaurant that obviously has a lot of history and regulars and is generally an establishment (my friend pointed out a man eating dinner alone with a glass of wine and commented that that's the sign of a truly legit restaurant), but I just didn't enjoy my food all that much. Tried the spinach and feta pie, a lamb dish, dolmades, and baklava and found it all generally unimpressive. The dolmades themselves were good, but they were covered in a cream sauce that I was not expecting and found very strange. Probably wouldn't go back, though I get why people like it.
