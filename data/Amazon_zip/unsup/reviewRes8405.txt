Oh my gosh! This is a carnivores dream, but also a salad lovers. You go there for the meat, but definitely save room for the salad. It's fresh, not overly done, raw vegetables in their simplistic forms with just the right seasoning or cooked just right. If you want to just buy the salad bar and skip the meat you can. You won't be sorry, but we did eat meat. You never run out of meat. It's an endless supply of all you can eat meat. Make sure that you haven't eaten all day so that you can get your money's worth. You just flip your paddle over and they are over immediately to refill your meat. It's fresh and at the perfect temperature. It's very pricey, but what we found is that if you go for lunch instead of dinner, you get the exact same thing and save quite a bit. They just assume that you will eat less during the day. Wrong, but you save a lot of money for going earlier. (I think that it's close to $20 per person less). Anyway, you won't be sorry for going here whether you love salad or meat, although it's known for it's meat.
