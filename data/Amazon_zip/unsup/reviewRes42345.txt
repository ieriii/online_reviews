OK, so laugh at me: lived in the neighborhood for a year and I just discovered the deliciousness of Tank Noodle last Thursday. Today is Monday and I have been their three times since Thursday, always ordering two soups (for just one person). I am officially obsessed with their soup. I don't know about their entrees, but their chicken stock is fantastic, natural and fresh. The only thing I didn't like was the beef stock, as I thought it was too salty. So I order their Pho with chicken broth and they look at me like I'm crazy but do it with a smile. Very cheap for all the fresh ingredients.
