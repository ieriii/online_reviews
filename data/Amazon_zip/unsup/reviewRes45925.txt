I love Grand Lux! One of my favorite restaurants to go to. We were in the Chi for a brief spell and it was on Michigan Ave, right in our paths. The wait wasn't long at all, we were seated within 10 minutes. The waiter was very nice, he explained a lot of the menu items to my mother-in-law to be, lol, and was very patient with her. The decor is always deluxe, no matter which one you go to. The menu is very extensive, lots to choose from, and the desserts are off the chain. Must have the beignets, they are my favorite.
