Owned by the same company as the Cheesecake Factory it seems, they have a similar motif and menu. The food is great but the lines are not.. If you are sitting at the bar.. You can go straight upstairs to the restaurant, if not, you will likely have to wait downstairs for a table. The food and service has always been OK.. I just preferred to go to the Cheesecake Factory since the line, even for sitting a the bar to eat, was shorter,,. Actually not there at all.
