I loved the location of this hotel! I loved the staff of this hotel! We had a suite, so it was spacious! I heard other guests talking about how small the regular rooms were, so I'm glad we upgraded! The bartenders were really cool at this hotel! Try the Barry White shot (rasberry kamikaze) and the cucumber mojito! Delicious! If it's raining, the bell desk will check out an umbrella for their guests!! This came out handy for us! Right by Magnificent Mile and all the cool restaurants on Rush Street! Subway is also near by! The lake is blocks away!
