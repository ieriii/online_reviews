I've been here once.. after trying 4 times. it was great! The server was so kind, we ate awesome food, the inexpensive wine was fabulous. But, honestly...the schedule is just irritating to me. It makes no sense. It's not like it's Schwa or anything. Personally I am really looking forward to the organic oven roasted pizza place on Division to open, then I can stop constantly day dreaming of Spacca Napoli pizza..then being disappointed by the fact that they are never open and I can never eat it and walk down the street where hopefully normal hours will prevail.
