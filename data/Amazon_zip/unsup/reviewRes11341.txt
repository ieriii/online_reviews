I love this place for unique thin crust. It can be crowded, but I know to have a light snack or come early if I want to eat at a decent hour. I learned the hard way! We had the anti ranch experience; I personally loathe the idea, by OOT brother was so confused by it. I kind of feel like the pizza is enough on it's own without this (it's not like it's frozen). It's probably like going to a fine steak restaurant and asking for A1--offensive. I've been many times; the last time I was there we didn't get the best service, but we did get three kinds of yumminess. Chicken BBQ, sausage and goat cheese on plain, and another concoction that I didn't order. everyone swore they wouldn't eat my goat cheese, but everyone loved them. The apps we had left some to be desired on our last trip. "the artichoke and tomato dip" sounded like a good idea but all it seemed to be just a piddling amount of artichoke cheese and three small pieces of tomato tossed in last minute. I don't know what we were expecting... maybe more tomatoes? or maybe them sauteed into the cheese or something? I'm not sure why it's such a big surprise that they don't have energy drinks. Do most restaurants serve energy drinks? Have I been missing out? Or are we talking red bull and vodka style? Don't even bother going on a Friday or Saturday night. tooo long of a wait.
