Nothing outstanding, just meh eh... not really sure how I feel about this place as a whole so I'm going to break it down. Greeting, very friendly. Service..can I get you a drink, spot on fast. Blue Moon- on tap, nice. The salad- a small 4.50, was large. The pasta- decent, 7.95. So, if you like to get salad with your pasta, as I do. Go to Salerno's the pasta is much better, more choices and the same price, the salad just comes with it. If your an ala carte person, Pasta Bowl will cost you less. I wasn't overwhelmed, nor underwhelmed by this place. I'd go back if I were in the area and wanted pasta, however a special trip is out of the question, especially in Chicago with so many choices. I'd go two stars on food. With the extra star for the friendly staff and quick service.
