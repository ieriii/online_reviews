This place is right around the corner, so I go often. As in almost every day. My lattes are a little inconsistent (sometimes not enough caramel, sometimes too much, sometimes a little heavy on the milk, and -wait- is it sour? next time i'm getting soy... etc.) But who needs a latte everyday anyway? I love the vibe and the cakes in the window and the outdoor seating area, which is superb hipster (and otherwise) watching.  I used to give a thumbs-down to their pastries (and it's very hard for me not to like something sweet), but I think they recently changed ownership and, perhaps, pastry chef as well? Either way, I've had some wonderful treats there over the last couple months. The cupcakes are adorable, although the icing on all but the vanilla one tasted a bit oily to me. and most of the items with coconut have done me right. As for savory, on a Sunday morning, I'll usually find myself there enjoying either a turkey and swiss croissant or a slice of spinach quiche. None of it leaves me feeling exactly slim, but that's what i get for hitting up a bakery nearly every day. maybe staying in logan square's solitude wasn't such a bad idea afterall...  There's also a big room to the left of where you order (enter from the street), which smells like a library (love it) where you can eat, drink, read and/or web surf. You can almost always find a spot, even on its most crowded days.
