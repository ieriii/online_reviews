I used to live in this area and have been here quite a few times. Love it. Mostly go for the beer and the atmosphere. You cannot beat their beer selection. You drink 2 beers and leave with a nice little buzz! This is a great date spot :-). Also, the food is not too shabby as well! Although the food is not what draws me to the place...it is good! Try the wings and the burger...excellent. And to top it all off...I have never had bad service here. The servers are always great! Very friendly and accommodating.  Go here. It is a party in your mouth. Tell them I sent you...it won't mean anything to them...but you can still tell them.
