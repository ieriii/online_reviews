came out here for a quick bite. saw this restaurant on food netwrok and decided to give it a try. we got drinks and a couple appetizers but it was the flaming saganaki that stood out to me. well worth the visit. i'm sure other greek restaurants have this on their menu. i'm no expert on greek food either as this was only my third time. however, i would return if ever in the area.
