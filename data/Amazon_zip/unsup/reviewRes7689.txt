Fogo de Chao is still the BEST! My family and I have been making yearly homage to gluttony since 2004. We are a party of 10+ and our frequency defaults our seating at the same table. Best Lamb Chops in town. The gauchos happily serve as much as they can. Excellent Customer Service -- easy to get reservation, showed up WITHOUT reservation once for a party of 10+ and we were still seated, and the staff is always happy to GIVE more meats. As the family grows, kids play at the bar area when they get restless. For a moment, I thought we will be prohibited. The person who looked like a Manager reminded and cautioned us to keep shoes on in case there is a glass particle from breakage. Superbly generous in many ways! Meat. Chocolates. We are happy to pay.
