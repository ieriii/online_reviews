The food is good, but not no where near great. I have respect for their vegetarian dishes since we have our own section yet, like always, wish they had more seitan options. The service is very prompt since the place is always packed. Seating though is sometimes not the best due to this very reason. I once had to sit next to the entrance with a minus 2 windchill blowing on me forcing my coat to stay on the whole time. If you are in Chicago and want a good Vietnamese dinner at a reasonable price you should definitely go here.
