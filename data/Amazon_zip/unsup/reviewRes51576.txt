I hadn't been here in a number of years. Last time I went (before the remodel) I enjoyed the food very much. This time...the service was horrible and the food not much better. My burrito was terribly greasy and consisted only of meat. Usually there is a bit of vegetable in with the meat. My friend did not care for the food either and actually spent the rest of the day with a stomach ache and feelings of queasiness. If you want tasty Mexican in the area I suggest going a block or two down Western Avenue to Los Nopales. Small, cozy and the food is quite delicious!
