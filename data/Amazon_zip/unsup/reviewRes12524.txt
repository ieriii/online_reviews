I have eaten here twice and both times felt there was something a little lacking. It was like, half of the dish is good and the other half is bad. This is perfectly exemplified in the bread basket. Let me preface this by saying that I really and truly find the bread basket to be a key indicator of how the rest of the food is going to be in terms of quality and taste.  Now, the bread basket: it comes with very boring, stale-ish white crusty bread. Lame. BUT what you get to put on the bread is oh-so-delicious honey chipotle butter. Yum! I could have just taken a spoon to it. That being said, the rest of the meal was kind of like that. The entrees were half good..Pistachio crusted chicken was enough to feed a small army (or...just me) but was soo rich. The corn bread that came with the sea bass special was good, but the bottom was burnt; and the sea bass was a little bland. My margarita was good, until I got to the bottom and it was all salt. Hmmm. So, I would say, it was good but maybe not worth your pretty little penny.
