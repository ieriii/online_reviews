Fantastic Pizza! Took the whole family and were treated very well. Even the 4 year old loved the deep dish cheese pizza. Great servers and fun environment. Be prepared to wait for a bit for the pizza, but once it gets there you won't be disappointed. We were looking for a great Chicago style pizza and we found it. Reasonable prices and easy parking.
