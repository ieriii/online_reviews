Got the churros with dipping chocolate. Dipping chocolate had a strange sour afternote - maybe that's authentic, but we just found it offputting. There's a reason why chocolate yogurts haven't taken off very much - it's just funky to have sour and chocolate together. Churros were not nice and crisp... sad to say we like Costco churros more (sorry). Prices are reasonable though, and I did get to see Rick, so maybe not all is lost.
