The Amalfi Hotel is a nice, independent and comfortable hotel. To start with, the rooms are extremely spacious, clean and well-maintained with comfy beds and a large rolling desk in the room. Nice and huge bathroom with lots of counter space and AVEDA toiletries. The staff is very friendly and welcoming . Housekeeping guys are fantastic and quick. All the rooms have fast and FREE wifi and the password is given to you during check-in. You'll be served amazing continental breakfast in the morning on EACH floor. Happy Hours and the Open Bar are my personal,favorites. Definitely try the Amalfitini. Each evening there is cocktail party in the Ravello Lounge on the top floor which is always pretty popular. This hotel is centrally located. The State/Lake and Clark/Lake 'L' station are stone's throw away. There are many restaurants and bars in the area. The check-out was very quick and efficient. Thumbs up to this Hotel. Highly recommended.
