this is the best place for lunch in andersonville. i have only had dinner here once or twice, and i really enjoyed it. my friend, who lives in andersonville, and i usually choose calo's for lunch whenever we get together. their lunch specials are usually never disapointing. prices usually range $8-12 for the lunch special and it comes with a good serving of soup or salad as well as a nice-sized pasta side. i always wind up taking half my lunch home, which means 2 days worth of lunch for these prices! we always get great service and there's even free parking across the street for their customers.
