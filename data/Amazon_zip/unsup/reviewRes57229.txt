This is by far one of my favorite restaurants. The ONLY thing I hate are the prices....ouch! The decor is creative & fun, the food is breath-taking & the service is so so. My absolutely favorite menu item is the ropa vieja. I dream about this at night! It is so fabulous & delicious & just thinking about it makes me want to go there now. I also recommend the arracheras, rice & beans....very very good. My friend (who is a very picky eater) ordered the pollo estilo billy which comes with papas fritas otherwise known as french fries & I was curious how they would taste so I tried one and even those were delicious! Everyone in our group of 10 was impressed & we will definitely be going back again soon!(The only reason I am rating it a 4 instead of a 5 is because of the prices)
