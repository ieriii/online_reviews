l must say, l wasn't as impressed with this place as most people seem to be. Don't get me wrong, the food was good. lt just didn't send me into any fit of delight. The saganaki was ok... and my meal, l had a gyro platter, tasted like any other l have had before. The salad was good, the gyro good, l cannot complain about it, it just didn't have that YEESSSS factor. THe service was good, we went at non peak hours so l can't say if it is any different under stress.l am going to have to try it again to see if l didn't miss something. l hope so since l do love a good Greek place!
