Is there a category for 6 stars? I had a smoked rattlesnake sausage with blueberry-port sauce and smoked gouda cheese....what? Hot Doug's is culinary genius. From timing the ordering and seating, to the complete insanity/clarity of the sausage combinations there are more layers to this place than most 5 star establishments even think about. You can also go traditional with a red hot or italian or bratwurst or... If there is a line to get food there is a reason.
