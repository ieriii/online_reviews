Someone tell Yih that he missed the point with the restaurant. Poor guy has no idea what he's talking about. I've been here three times and had the same experience almost every time. Perfect. I love that there's no winelist (bring your own, prepare to share). I love the music (most enjoyable when you see people in suits looking around confused because they came for a 5-star without reading the fineprint). I love the food (dude trained in Italy, worked with and for some awesome names, and knows his shit). I love the chef. My first dinner here, back in 2008, had me seated with my back to the room. He was at a table behind and to my left explaining the dishes he'd just set down to the couple. As with most of us Italian-types, he talks a lot with his hands. I heard a clink and then a crash as a glass shattered against the back of my chair. He'd accidently slapped it off the table while talking. I whipped around and he looks at me, says "Fuck, did I do that? Sorry." and goes back into the kitchen to have a guy come clean the glass and see if I was cool. When he came out a few minutes later with our next course, he apologized again, but it was unnecessary considering how perfect an environment that makes. You'll have random, sometimes angry music. You'll have great items (maybe including the poached quail egg raviolo with truffle butter - fuck yes!). You'll taste some random wines (because he'll pour every bottle around every table unless you ask him not to, which would be lame of you). The price is solid at just over $100 per person. Bring a little something as a gift for the kitchen and it'll be appreciated. I usually bring some WI beers. On one of our visits he did an extra course with a foam from a New Glarus Fat Squirrel. The man has talent and a personality. I'll take this over a Trotter dinner any time.
