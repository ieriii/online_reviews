I really liked this spot. The red checkered tablecloths and the large dining room full of happy munching people gave a good vibe from the start. We were there at lunch time during the week and we got seated in less than 10 minutes. They served local beers on tap and had a huge menu of Italian pastas, pizzas and fried apps. We went for the zucchini sticks and a veggie stuffed pizza, and we were not disappointed. The pizza was delicious, not too soggy in the middle(as deep dish pizzas are prone to be), not too well done on the edge, just perfect. I got a great taste of Chicago at Giordano's.
