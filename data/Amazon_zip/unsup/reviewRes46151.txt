The Grand Lux is at a perfect position amidst the wondrous Magnificent Mile in Chicago. I went here a friend's birthday dinner, but didn't leave completely satisfied with the meal aspect of it. The service was wonderful, as were the prices, but the whole meal just lacked uniqueness to it. Perhaps it was the dish I had. But the thing is, I don't remember what I had (it was about two months ago). I even looked through the menu again, but nothing looked like it was put in front of me. I just remember it being only mediocre for the price and "lux"urious atmosphere it exhibited, and if I can't even remember what I had, it wasn't good enough. If I could give three-and-a-half, sure. Four for the atmosphere, three for the meal.
