I think I'm going to have to come here a few times to decide if I really like it or not. The interiors are absolutely fantastic, and it is the perfect place for cocktails on a hot summer night. However, I can see it becoming cheesy pretty fast. Plus, I don't like Asian fusion. I got here at around 11pm on a Saturday night, and it was completely packed. However, we were able to get a table at the front of the house. The seating is very wide... it is almost like you are sitting on tatami mats. This does not work well if you are wearing a dress or a short skirt. Overall, the space is gorgeous. The crowd is basically 20's-30's girls who are severely under dressed and their dates who wear too many hair products. I had a pear sake cocktail, and my friend had a mai tai. Both drinks were very strong. The food menu looked great, but we just came in from dinner at Blackbird and were too full to indulge. I will update my review once I've tried the food. I would not recommend this place for a date. The music is way too loud, and you'll be screaming over each other. Come with a group of girlfriends. This is the place to wear your five inch CFMs.
