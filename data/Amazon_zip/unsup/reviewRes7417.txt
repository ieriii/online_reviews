Feel free to go any night for a great meal, but make it a Monday if you love a good deal. I've been here on two prior occasions and enjoyed everything including the seafood risotto, but thought it wads slightly pricey for Italian. Went last night when reading a little bit about their Monday pre fix special. For $20 per person you get 2 apps, 2 soups/salads, 3 entrees, and a dessert to share. I recommend any of the gnocchi dishes and the tiramisu for dessert. Everything is scaled down slightly depending on the size of your party. Don't be afraid to get it even if you're just a party of two!
