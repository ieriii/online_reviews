This place is my FAVORITE Vietnamese food! The people are super nice, the prices are very reasonable and most importantly, I haven't had a single thing there that I didn't LOVE! Every time I come here with my friends (VERY frequently) we are greeted by the owner and when we leave he always makes sure to shake our hands and tell us thank you!I highly recommend going here for the lunch specials! I don't know where else you can get a drink, salad, soup, appetizer (spring roll), Banh Mi (most delicious Vietnamese sandwiches) and fruit for under $7! This past time I was there, a friend and I ordered one of the soups to share and it was DELICIOUS and the presentation was so wow that people were stopping and looking at our table through the window as they were walking by! Another friend that was with us ordered the pineapple calamari and it was served in a half pineapple! This place is BYOB! So grab your favorite bottle of wine and head to Simply It...NOW!
