Yay! I AM a fan! So many of my reviews are geared towards carnivores and this trend will continue. All you can eat meat...where is the downfall? Well there is one...$$$  It's a bit pricey and you have to make sure you can eat about $50 worth of food (or in my case have a friend who can eat $100 worth). I like this place better then Fogo mainly because they have the fried pineapple and the jumbo shrimp (which I did not see at Fogo). The only other downside to this place is that it is kind of sensory overload and there is a crazy salad bar and you have to be a really experienced eater to know how to pace yourself. So come prepared and you will not be disappointed. Oh, and you may want to wear loose pants because you will have a gut for about one hour following the meal.
