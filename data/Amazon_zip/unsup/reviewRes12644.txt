So... I disagree with those that said Texas de Brazil is better than Fogo de Chao. That is only true in some respects... Texas de Brazil's salad bar is by far better, well-stocked with high-quality items like hearts of palm, artichoke, quinoa salad, etc. etc. However, the quality goes down from there. Yes, the idea of lobster bisque is cool, but it was way too salty, with no hint of lobster in it. They could've basically put some wine, cream, salt, and orange-reddish coloring in there for all we know. Much of the meat that came around were SUPER SALTY, some too dry, and some too oily. It's not the same caliber as meat I've had from Fogo de Chao. Really though, the worst part is the service. We went in with a reservation, was NOT greeted by the hostess, who was standing there chewing gum and doing something else. We sat there for 20 minutes and were finally seated. Seriously --- what's the point of making a reservation if I have to wait 20 minutes??? We got to our table and waited for another five minutes before being acknowledged by anyone around us. Not sure I would go back without that 50% coupon everyone keeps talking about.
