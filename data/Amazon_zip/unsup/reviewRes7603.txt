A vegetarian's nightmare! LOVE, LOVE Fogo! Many of my friends have been to Brazzaz. I have not, they say it's better, I say "I doubt it!" A Brazilian steakhouse can't get any better than this! I've only been to Fogo three times, but it is truly meat heaven! That oh so succulent meat made it really hard to keep my little round card with the red facing up! Before turning it to green, I always looked around to see what every one else was doing so I would not appear to be greedier than everyone else at my table. But it quickly became a matter of who could turn their card over to green the fastest! The place truly made me feel guilty about eating! All of the meat was tender, juicy, with a ton of flavor. If you didn't like the meat, and I don't know who wouldn't, you could probably find something on the massive salad bar to satisfy you. The wine was good, the decor was nice lighting with a subtle waterfall near the window. You could tell people were enjoying their meat because there was very little talking going on!
