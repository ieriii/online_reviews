I absolutely adored Cafe 28. After YEARS of wanting to try it - I finally just was able to. Cute store-front type atmosphere tucked away near the brownline @ Irving Park Road. The tropical cocktails (mostly Cuban) were phenomenal! Fresh lime juice in all the margaritas/mojitos, and a lot of good South American white wines on the wine list. There were so many amazing-sounding appetizers - it was really difficult for me to decide what to try. I tackled the Green Tamales - which were a delicious little treat w/ fresh pico and sour cream! Lovely! I also tried my friend's coconut shrimp app which was out-of-this-world w/ curried rice!  Not like a traditional fried/battered coconut shrimp at all - not fried at all. So good tho! I had the Cuban Roast Pork for my entree. It had congri (rice/beans) with it and some kind of cheesey croquettas. Sooo tasty! The pork itself was smothered in a carmelized onion/mojo sauce - which had the best tang to it. Almost a cider-y/pickled-tasting tang. So complimentary to the pork and to the wine we were having with it! The profiteroles I had for dessert weren't over-the-top or anything. Decent, but I know they didn't hand-make those pasty -which kinda irritated me a bit. I will ABSOLUTELY be back for a date night w/ the boyfriend because I know he we love it! Really a good date spot!
