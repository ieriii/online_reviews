This place is pretty solid. My wife and I aren't big fans of cream cheese so we order all our rolls without it. But if you cream cheese you would love their rolls. However, they do have some great rolls without cream cheese. Make sure to try their sauces, they are very interesting. Here are the rolls we tried, all the rolls are great, but the Honey Roll is what stood out to us. Red Dragon Roll Honey Roll Megatron Crab Ragoon: very creamy  Spicy Tuna Godzilla The miso soup was comparable to most places, nothing mind blowing. Their scallops were a little too mushy and slimy for our taste. They don't offer real wasabi. The restaurant is pretty small and doesn't open until 5pm so plan accordingly. They only accept RSVPs over 10 people.
