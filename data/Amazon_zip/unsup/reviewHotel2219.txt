Loved it! Ok...it has best location...right on Mich ave right across from the yummiest food place, the Purple Pig. This was our second time staying here for one of our anniversary. Long line to check in but we got there n checked in. Got our room but found it to be wrong. They upgrade us to historic room. Best deal ever. We got totally isolated within one corridor, there was just our room and one other. There were even steps up to our door which had its own personal door bell. Cute. Loved the huge entry way and separate shower and bath. Room was twice as big as the previous room with a great view. Service was just awesome. Will have to return next time. Oh, our room was supposed to be $1500 and we got it for less than $200? AWESOME!
