I have been here on two occasions and have enjoyed the food immensely. It's a very nice price point for very creative food and Bayless has created a true Chicago landmark. I have has choriqueso, pork pibil, and have taken bites out of many other creations. You won't be disappointed. The only downside is seating and long waits, which is what keeps me from going back often. I think every owner of every stomach-turning taqueria needs to walk into this place and get a little inspiration. For those who haven't mastered a late-night hangover menu, think about ways in which you could do better. For such a big city with so many options, I can't believe how bad the mexican is in chicago.
