It's no secret that Chicagoans are serious about their Pizza; well ladies and gentlemen...Let me introduce you to Pequod's. Pequod's is by far the best deep dish Pizza in Chicago, by a long shot. My first visit to Pequod's was in 2005 and I was immediately hooked, until they burned down...fortunately for us they re-opened bigger and better than ever. Although the restaurant resembles a dive bar the dcor is a preview of the rustic goodness of Pequod's Pizza. What makes Pequod's so special is the caramelized crusty edges. The crust is buttery goodness while the cheese and sauce are top notch. The service is friendly, quick and efficient, all of things I look for in a good Pizza joint. I would like to make one suggestion...order the fresh garlic on your pizza; it makes all the difference in the world. In the words of Dean Martin, "When the moon hits your eye like a big Pizza Pie that's Amore." And here is my rendition, "When the moon hits your eye like a big Pizza Pie that's Pequod's Yum."
