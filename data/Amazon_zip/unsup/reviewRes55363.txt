The BEST I've had, in my opinion. I usually order the combination plate and get the dill rice. The portions are huge, they give you more than enough and you will basically have two meals for the price of one. Definitely worth the money. I've tried the sword fish and it was excellent, considering I really don't eat seafood.  I recommend this place to everyone.
