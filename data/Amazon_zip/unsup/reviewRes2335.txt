We had the foie gras dog, some sort of mushroom dog special, and the duck fat fries. The duck dog was delicious, the foie gras was a little over the top but hey if the option's available, you gotta try it. The foie gras wasn't the best I've had, I think this dog would be better with grilled onions on top instead. The mushroom dog was delicious. I wish I paid more attention to what was actually in it. The duck fat fries were great. I had to give this place 3 stars because the standing in line in the cold was not fun. I not really a stand outside in the cold kind of girl for any kind of food. This place is good, but it's not a 45 minute wait good let alone 2 hrs.
