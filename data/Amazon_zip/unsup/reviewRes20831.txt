I've heard a lot about this sushi restaurant and I made it up there with some friends. The place is nicely decorated inside. The service was wonderful and the food was delivered in a timely fashion. The maki rolls seemed kinda small, yet tasty. The specials were excellent. If they have the Crab on a stick with a ginger sauce, i would get 2 orders. That was delicious.
