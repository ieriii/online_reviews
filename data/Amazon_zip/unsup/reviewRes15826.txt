It's a lounge with some eats, but since you have to get a table and you have to wait for one to open, get ready to stand in a line that might not have too many people in it but is still one that is definitely long. They don't let you make/take phone calls in here, but you'll still need the light from your cell phone screen to read the menu. My favorite drink that I've tried here was the Pimms Cup. The Juliet & Romeo was over-hyped to the EXTREME by two other people I went here with... apparently the third best cocktail in the universe but what-ever. My boyfriend really enjoyed his Six Corner Sling but to me only tasted like watered down whiskey and who likes the taste of that? :) The Berliner is definitely interesting and I enjoyed Slim as well. We also had a small side of the Roasted Shallots and Bleu Cheese Dip with Crispy Waffle Fries - what a description for cheese fries..so much that you're willing to pay 300% more than you would elsewhere. I do wish I could have tried other food plates.  I think no matter what you get, you'll enjoy whatever the unique concoction.. Plus our server was way friendly and helpful. I did really enjoy my night here, but wouldn't frequent it.
