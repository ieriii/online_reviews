I have only ever been to Shaw's Oyster Bar and I must say I love it. I'm sure there is more to the restaurant, but every time I go into Shaw's I see the bar area and the Oyster Bar. I have no idea where (or if) they have an actual restaurant. The Oyster Bar is decorated as a little 50's diner/lunch counter. They have some awesome beers on tap and the oysters...oh the oysters...swoooon! I'm a sucker for some fresh yum-o-licious oysters and an ice cold beer so Shaw's has been a favorite happy hour spot of mine. I have been in for lunch a couple of times and I love the caesar with calamari on top. It's not on the menu, you have to ask for it. I was there a few weeks ago and noticed that they have live jazz in the Oyster Bar some evenings, which sounds super fun! I'm going to have to check that out too. Who's in?!?
