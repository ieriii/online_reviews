I was really impressed by the incredible service at the Publican. Everyone was attentive, but not annoying. We just stopped by for one drink and a couple apps., and they got us in and out quickly but we didn't feel rushed. It was great! We had a couple beers with the bacon sampler plate (don't remember the name). Salty goodness! We also had the fries with eggs. Weird but delicious.  I'll definitely go back for dinner when I have more time!
