I've always heard about this place but I finally FINALLY got the chance to go. This was my first time here and lemme just say. It was WELL worth the wait. Just go with a couple of friends and chat while waiting. It makes it feel like the wait is nothing. And by the time you get to the front, you're hungry and ready to eat! When you get inside... Doug? takes your order and lemme just say. For some guy thats only spending about 1-5 minutes taking your order... he's the friendliest person you'll meet. The hot dogs are about $7-8 and can get pretty crazy. Since this is my first time, I felt like I had to try some crazies. So I went with the crazy thai chicken thing. It had seaweed salad on top of a chicken sausage and spicy mayo. Strangely enough, it takes like a giant sushi roll... but it was good enough to make me want to go again.
