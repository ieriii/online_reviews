I've been going to Garcia's for a long time and they never disappoint me! Their salsa and chips are good. If you're a meat lover, I highly recommend getting anything with AL PASTOR in it! Its really good!! Steak lovers - definitely get the Tampiquena. Only con would probably be service. Depending on how busy, sometimes the waitresses get off track.
