How many Italian restaurants can you honestly say have nailed (and I mean REALLY nailed) both the pasta AND the sauce? I challenge you to eat here and tell me they haven't nailed it. Last time I was there, they also had a very nice wine bottle on special. This place is so affordable for the quality of food you get. They have it down to a science. Go here, shell out less-than $10, and get some delicious pasta in your tum!
