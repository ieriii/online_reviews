Absolutely everything it's cracked up to be. All of the 14 meats were delicious (I think I tried them all?), although I may have liked the bottom sirloin the best. Or maybe the bacon wrapped filet. Or bacon wrapped chicken. Actually the mashed potatoes were amazing. And the risotto salad at the salad bar was definitely the best I've had. So basically, it's all awesome. The grilled pineapple, which is listed under the 15 meats on the menu, might as well be meat. It comes out hot off the grill and is much more fulfilling than you thought fruit could be. Be careful though. When you turn your rodizio card to orange, the meat dudes will literally line up at your table and not stop until you flip if back to black. It's a beautiful thing.
