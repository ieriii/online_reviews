Game of the Week: ANTELOPE...awwww yeah! i never knew a sausage could be more than a football tailgate of oscar mayer, ketchup and mustard. and yet it was. it thankfully was. who thinks to add blackberry creme fraiche, smoked gouda, or foie gras mousse as toppings? i admit, it took awhile for my tastebuds to recalibrate from the shock, but after a couple of bites i was all about these crazy delectable artery cloggers. high marks for the "Curry Lamb Sausage with Spinach Raita and Feta Cheese" good stuff.
