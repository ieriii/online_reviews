this place reminds me of a 4'11" dude with a 13" penis. packing the goods, but short on the wow factor to your friends. awesome food. awesome fish for the midwest. simple recipes to highlight the catch of the day. the clam chowder is on point, creamy, rich and tickles that soft spot just behind the hoohaw(if i had one;p) small. quaint, and is great in so many ways, but sometimes feels too kitschy to be 5 stars all around and gets too small really fast as the locals and tv watchers flock to this place at the same time. come off times, early dinners, late breakfast to catch the quiet side and get intimate with your food selections in an almost naughty way...you will get vocal and have fun the way you should when it comes to pleasurable dining.
