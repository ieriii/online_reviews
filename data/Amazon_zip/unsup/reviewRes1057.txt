Hot damn, that Hot Doug's is delicious! I loved my fancy schmantzy dogs, the duck fat fries, the coke and even the freaking visit to the bathroom. It was just a great meal at a fair price and worth every penny. My favorite part was how welcome I felt - I am definitely the farthest thing from a hipster that exists. (Unless my actual generous sized hips would somehow count.) Yet, Doug and the whole ambience of the place made me feel happy I had come, welcome and hoping to return. Really cool hip places are usually not this "retired school teacher friendly" as evidenced by the next stop on our culinary journey today but that's a different review. The wait was only about 20 minutes on a Friday a bit before noon. Doug was super friendly and nonjudgmental and talked a bit about his upcoming voyage to France. He provides a really great vibe and an outstanding encased meat product.  Bon voyage! Enjoy your trip to Paris, Doug, where le hotdog franais will not equal yours!
