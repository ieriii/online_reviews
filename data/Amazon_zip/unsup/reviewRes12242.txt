I almost don't feel right reviewing this place because I was so unbelievably drunk when I arrived. Luckily (for my sake) the food sobered me up and I did not completely miss out on the Cafe 28 experience. I definitely remember eating the chicken goodness off of Lynda's plate, and I think I got the quesadilla which was amazing. I will definitely be back the next time I am in the Windy City, and eating here sober next time! Possibly the most unhelpful review I have ever written, so you will just have to trust me that it was good!
