Wow! As soon as I got in my car and smelled my food, I knew I was in for a tasty treat. I JUST finished eating half a Baby Buddha Bowl with Beef (their version of bi bim bop). It was so good. Actually, it was GREAT and hit the spot perfectly. If I had two stomachs, I would finish the rest cuz that 'baby' was big (for me). The vegetables and egg were cooked perfectly and the beef had a nice mild, smoky flavor. My rice was on the side since I got it to-go. Is it authentic Korean? I don't know, and frankly, I really don't care. It was damn delicious! I also ordered 5 Seoul Sassy Wings not knowing I was going to get a sweet surprise. These wings are HUGE! They are not your typical bar wings that are puny and laden in grease. The drumstick and wing together count as 1 wing. They have an interesting and totally different taste that is not common amongst your KFC or BW3-type joints. Score! I was only able to eat one even though I tried in vain to have another. But I couldn't. I'm so full! Honestly, if you're having a get-together at your house get your wings from here and invite me please! =) Your friends will not only thank you, but they'll be thoroughly impressed. They're amazingly good. The staff was very friendly and my food came out quickly. I'll definitely be coming back to try the other sauces. Thanks for the great suggestion yelpers!
