I really wanted to like this place. When I lived in the area, I did. It was one of the reasons for me to shlep all the way north to visit the arctic regions of Chicago. Unfortunately, the service was so bad the last time I went with several friends, I don't think I will ever go back. The food is adequate - other gastropubs have the upper-hand these days. The beer selection is good, but when you have to wait 30 minutes for your beer, only to have noticed that the other half of your party is still waiting for their beer, the cordial atmosphere is ruined. Sorry Hopleaf! I'm sticking to the pubs in Logan Square and de-friending you.
