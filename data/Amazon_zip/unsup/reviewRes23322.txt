When I lived in ChinaTown I would eat here at least twice a week. This may even be the best place in China Town. They have really good fried rice and the portions are huge. The service is really friendly. I *really* like their Chili Chicken, but everything on the menu is good really. Also, it seems to be authentic, which is always a plus in my book. My only complaint(s) is that the location is small so a reservation is (probably?) required if you want to eat there. I also wish it were open a bit later.
