I was taken here for my birthday and enjoyed it very much. The french martini, wine and spinach cheese pinwheels were great! Service was good- attentive but not overly so. The restaurant looks like it was converted from an old house- it has 1 main room which was very loud but also several other rooms father back which were much quieter. The probably allows them to cater to both louder groups and couples with a yen for quieter conversation. We signed up for the email notifications and we got a coupon for $14 off our next visit! We'll definitely be going back.
