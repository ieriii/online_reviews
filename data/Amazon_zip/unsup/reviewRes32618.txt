I travel a lot for work and have visited every state except for New Mexico, thanks to my speaking engagements throughout the country and i was a strict vegan for a long time, though now i am transitioning and eating a little bit of everything in moderation....however....i have to say that The Chicago Diner is by far one of the BEST Vegan restaurants in the country and also one of the best diner type food spots i've eaten at (vegan or not). though it is mostly vegan there is the option of getting non-vegan items if you go with a cheese eating vegetarian. Somewhat pricey but you will leave happy! This is def. a place to go hungry. Appetizers are fantastic, the entrees are gourmet and unique and please, be sure to leave room for dessert! Some lot parking but mostly street parking. Patio seating in the back. Might have to wait a while to get seated during peak times. My only negative on this place: Don't expect to eat healthy here! The delicious vegan fare is highly caloric and plenty-fatty yumminess from the vegan mac n' cheez to the cream covered desserts and hearty carob chip cookies. Come here for vegan treat, not for vegan healthy.
