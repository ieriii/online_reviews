this is way more of a lounge than a club with culinary chefs making your drinks. amazing blends and spices but be careful; two will get you more than buzzed. so sip baby, sip. i prefer anything there that is made with a tea. they brew it extra strong using extracts to create the most wonderful concoctions. ladies, if a man is taking you out for drinks suggest this place. it is great for first dates or to take friends that are visiting from out of town because you an actually hear each other, getting acquainted or reacquainted. they also always make sure that every patron has a seat, which is an added bonus even though sometimes you may have to wait.
