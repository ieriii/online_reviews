I have been coming here for years, and just realized I NEED to review it. I eat a lot of sushi, and this is top of the list. There are two things about Coast that annoy me (and I'm listing them off the bat so I can move on to praise), and even they are not enough to knock off any stars. #1 No matter when I call, I can never seem to secure a reservation between the hours of 7-9pm on the weekends (I'm almost convinced it's a big secretive ploy). #2 This new "1 bottle per couple rule" really puts a damper on things, as I almost love my wine as much as my sushi. On to the things I like...there are lots. Spicy miso, asparagus beef app, seaweed salad, spicy tuna roll, "special" popper roll (I've yet to go when it's not on special), white dragon roll (I literally daydream about this), the freshness of all the fish, and of course, the prices. Very reasonable for the quality of sushi.  Oh, and if you don't like rolls that you can't take down in one bite, make sure you ask about some of their specialty rolls because some of them are definitely more than a mouthful...and not recommended on a first date. ;)
