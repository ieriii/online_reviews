Rick Bayless strikes gold again in Chicago with XOCO. Went here for dinner so there was less of a wait than lunchtime. For entrees, XOCO specializes in two things: Tortas (Mexican sandwiches) and Caldos (meaty soups). I had the Pepito torta which had Braised Tallgrass shortribs, caramelized onion, artisan Jack cheese, black beans, and pickled jalapenos. If that sounds awesomely good, it's because it is. The meat was so juicy and tender and the pickled jalapenos added a kick that made me wanting more. The tortas were cooked in a wood-burning oven which added a nice rustic taste to the sandwich. I also tried the Carnitas caldo which was just as good. With the temperature below zero, this definitely hit the spot. The soup was so hearty with meats, veggies, and dumplings in a spicy broth, it puts Campbell's Chunky Soups to shame. The party didn't stop there. The stars of the evening were the churro and the hot chocolate. Hands down, BEST CHURRO EVER. It was even better than the ones at Great America and those were hard to top. The hot chocolate was so deliciously rich I felt like covering myself with a blanket and taking a nap after drinking it. Thanks Mr. Bayless for bringing the street foods of Mexico a little closer to us.
