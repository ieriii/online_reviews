This place is barely ok. I like that they have lots of variety, but I honestly wasn't impressed with the food I had. We started with the flaming cheese, tsatsiki, melitzanosalata (mashed grilled eggplant), meatballs, and grilled octopus. I like the presentation of the flaming cheese, but found the taste to be too salty and oily. The tsatsiki and the eggplant were both pretty good but not too much different from what you would buy at the store. My friends claimed that the meatballs were gamy, so I suspected that there was lamb in the meatballs and didn't try them. The octopus was pretty good, smoky and tender. They were out of the fresh American red snapper that I wanted so I chose the fresh Mediterranean seabass instead. At $18, it was a good value and tasted fresh and light. I chose to get the entire fish instead of having it filleted for me. The baked vegetables that it came with were sort of overcooked and oily though. We later saw the trays of cooked food (including those vegetables) sitting under heating lamps, almost like buffet-style but behind a glass window, on our way out. My friends who tried some other dishes found their food decent but not amazing. The baked shrimp with feta and rice was apparently seasoned well, but the shrimp was lacking in freshness. The fried calamari was just like any other fried calamari. Our meal ended on an especially sour note for me because the waiter splattered fishy olive oil from my plate all over my white top as he was clearing the table. Though he apologized, he offered nothing to make up for it. In general, I found the service kind of lacking - my iced tea was hardly ever refilled, and we watched the waiter stand around for 10 minutes doing nothing after we had asked him to break a $20 bill for us. Not sure if I want to come here again. I hope those oil stains come out!
