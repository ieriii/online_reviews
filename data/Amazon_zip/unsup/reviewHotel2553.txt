Ok, if you read the other reviews I'm sure you can get a good feel for the place. Went there last night for Maryanna's opening and def wasn't disappointed! Good place to go relax, music was so-so... probably because I'm more into R&B/Rock/Hip-hop and the place played more House than anything else. Drinks were on par with the scene (Upscale decor... higher prices) . This isn't the place to go if you just want to grab a few drinks with your friends... but is if you want to come out, meet a few people, and have a decent conversation. The crowd was very diverse (big plus) and friendly (def a good thing).  Will probably go back next week is something is going on. Lata
