Totally over-rated! I will never return to this establishment. Unless you want a 2x your daily requirement, calorie intake, there is nothing good to order off of the menu. Not only did we wait forever to get a table, the egg white omelet I ordered was by far the WORST omelet I have ever eaten. They did not cook the spinach, just stuff it in the omelet. It was overloaded with cheese and I basically couldn't finish it. Over-rated, over-priced. Will never return.
