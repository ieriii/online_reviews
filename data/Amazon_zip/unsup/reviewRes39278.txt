My lil buddy, Jessica C., would not stop raving about this place. It was a Sunday afternoon and the family was looking for somewhere to eat. S suggested SSGS. We were seated immediately at one of the awesome tables. They took our order and the service was decent. Not top notch by any means, but they were good. They answered all of our questions and didn't attempt to step in during our meal. I was pleased. We ordered the fried dumplings, the chicken and one of the beef dishes (I can't remember which one). There were 3 of us, at the suggestion/recommendation of other Yelp reviews and my friend, we only ordered 2 dishes knowing that would be more than enough food. and it was. The dumplings were very tasty! But I was excited to cook some meat! They brought that out and then bombarded us with 20-something little dishes - I knew what to expect but my dining companions were taken by surprise. It was fun trying to figure out what everything was. The cute little grill was brought to our table and then we went wild! The meat is nicely marinated and in small enough pieces that they cook very quickly. We cooked half of our meat. Devoured it and then a little later cooked the rest. I did appreciate our server stepping in at that point - as soon as we were done grilling they promptly removed our grill. Both the beef and chicken were delicious! Tender and cooked just the way we liked :) hehe This place is all about the food and the experience, not about top notch service. Just keep that in mind and you'll love this place. We also had no trouble finding a spot in their parking lot.
