A bakery in Wicker Park with a mouth-watering selection of French Macarons? Yes please! Very charming storefront! The window display proudly showcases some of their cake creations, including a -- hold the phone -- MACARON TOWER! Amazing! Mental note to snag such a treat for my next special occasion. Or, a random Saturday night.. Alliance is above all, a bonafide mecca for macaron lovers. If I lived closer, I would flock to this place daily - with my cash as an offering to the macaron gods. Their flavor listing has something for everyone - from the tried and true Pistachio (with some brandied cherry for a perfect twist), to the slightly savory Maple Bacon. Some of my personal favorites include the 'Coconut Lime' (which, topped with toasted coconut shreds, tastes just like a key lime pie) and the 'Salted Caramel' (which reminds me of a salted hot chocolate). I tend to get one of each of the flavors they happen to have remaining that day, and aside from some of the fruit-inspired flavors (whose filling is more akin to a jam - not quite my style) - Alliance has yet to disappoint!  I usually get a cupcake for good measure, and they can certainly hold their own - even with all the macaron excitement that is happening in the neighboring display case. The Red Velvet (my go-to cupcake benchmark) measured up to my standards, with a perfectly moist cake and an unmistakable traditional cream cheese frosting. Yum! With ever-smiling service and quaint outdoor seating to boot - Alliance takes the cake (couldn't resist - pun intended!) as far as my favorite spot to score some macarons!
