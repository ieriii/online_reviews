This place was fantastic! Coming from Charleston, SC I generally expect "southern style" restaurants in Chicago to suck, but this reminded me of "Jestine's" from back home (if ever you are in Charleston, you MUST go to Jestine's). We started with Sweet Tea (not as sweet as what I make for myself, but spot on for the general public), then had Fried Green Tomatoes (a summer staple during my youth) which were perfect and came with an interesting sauce and shrimp for some reason (I'm not complaining though, lol). I had the special of the day: Fried Chicken. I must say it reminded of me of my grandmother's chicken and that's no mean feat. The portion was huge: a half chicken (a great deal of it is currently in my fridge in a take-away box), tasty mashed potatoes, and some fantastic fried okra (this came with a sauce on the side that I didn't use because I thought it tasted like Ranch Dressing and Mayonnaise, two things that I don't like despite my South Carolina heritage). We finished up with the Red Velvet cake which is made to order and comes with a scoop of frozen cream cheese frosting on the side rather than as a topping. The cake was nothing to write home about, but was a decent size for one or two people and ended the meal quite nicely. The employees were extremely friendly (which I believe to be a Midwestern quality because it is surely not a Southern one despite rumours of "Southern Hospitality") and service was very quick. The decor was sophisticated but not pretentious and overall quite comfortable. I will definitely be returning to Big Jones.
