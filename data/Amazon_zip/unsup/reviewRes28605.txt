One of the most reasonable priced and best tasting pasta places in Chicago! Hands down. A great casual place that is good for a date, meeting up with friends, or coming with a small group. By far the pasta chicken farfalle ever! It is amazing. Their shrimp alfredo is also amazing. What is nice too is that they have a decent wine selection that pairs nicely with their dishes. I drink more red than white these days; however, the Brancott Sauvignon Blanc works well with some of their pasta dishes.  The place gets kind of packed because it is small and it is best to arrive early. It is attached a bar called "the other side." Once again, casual place that is good for getting a drink while waiting for your table.
