While I really wanted to love this place--Meh-not that impressive. I did not find the staff to be welcoming at all. The staff did not hold the door for us despite standing next to it outside. They also did not hail a cab for us when we were leaving. The check-in process was cold and not very welcoming. Front desk was not even close to assisting you to find your next attraction. Concierge was MIA.  The room was spacious, but cold temperature-wise. We happend to go on a very cold weekend, and our bathroom was constantly ice cold. The tile floor was like standing on ice, and it didn't matter if you turned the bathroom heat on either. It just never got warm. We were on the 10th floor and had a considerable amount of street noise in our room. The bar was a total rip off, and they played lousy music. It has so much potential too... Overpriced drinks and terrible DJ will drive anyone away. I don't know why they bother to stay open to 3 am... ZERO novelty there. I don't think I will ever stay there again. It was considerably far enough away from everything, that any *savings* on your room rate will be quickly eaten up in cab fares. And while they attempt to be a cool hip hotel, the reality is anyone off the street can walk in and take an elevator to any floor. There's no one standing between the MI Ave entrance and the elevators to the room. No key-control on the elevator. Even my JOB has that after you walk past security for crying outloud!
