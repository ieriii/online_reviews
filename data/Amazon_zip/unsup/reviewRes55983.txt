Good location to go to an event at the Harris Theater or the symphony. It's loud but if you can tolerate a consistently high noise level, the lively atmosphere is fun.We each ordered a burger. The gage upgrade hamburger was good, if just a touch over done for medium. The venison burger was terrific. Ordering the two and sharing highlighted that the kaiser roll for the hamburger was just a waste of space while the pretzel roll for the venison burger was tasty and the perfect texture. Flavor on the venison burger was great but it's a huge burger with all the toppings. Plenty of good fries on the side and nice pickles as a garnish. Scallop appetizer was pretty tasty. Bread served to the table had good flavor but dry and crunchy. Good service every time.
