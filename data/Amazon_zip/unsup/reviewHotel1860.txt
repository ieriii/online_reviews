My experience in this hotel was not very good. If you want a good W in chicago the lakeshore one is better. My room was looking into some other building and the bathroom has a weird setup. Not that great for a W. Lobby is pretty neat though and i love the bar here. Actually to my liking the bar here is better than at the Lakeshore.
