What a huge disappointment! After reading (mostly) favorable Yelp reviews and having heard it was a good spot, a friend and I tried it for breakfast one weekday morning. The service was great, and the place itself is cozy and warm. The prices are fairly inflated, but I would not even mention this if the food was worth it. Unfortunately, it was not - not by a long-shot. (The coffee was good, however.) My classic eggs benedict was fairly tasteless: hard muffin, so-so eggs, lousy hollandaise, and ham I could find better at any sandwich joint. The accompanying potatoes were lukewarm and tasteless. The plate had looked so pretty, though, including a big slice of melon.  Also tasteless and hard - not nearly ripe. I did not finish the dish, and my friend who had a frittata did not finish his either; his verdict was mediocre all around. At the price of ten plus for each, this is a terrible value. Because the location is convenient and the restaurant itself inviting, I was very disappointed. I will not be back.
