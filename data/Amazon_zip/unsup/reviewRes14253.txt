So authentic, so delicious, so tantalizing and what an atmosphere - if I just close my eyes and hear the cars puttering by, I think I'm right in the heart of Havana. Next time you're thinking about heading down to the same ol' burrito place, STOP, and go Cuban instead. You won't be disappointed! Viva 90 Miles!
