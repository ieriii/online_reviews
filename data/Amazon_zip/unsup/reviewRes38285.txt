For the tourist in all of us, this pizza place is a good place to get some food if you don't know your way around the Windy City and are exploring the downtown area...and chances are, with it's 41 locations, you're probably more likely to yell "Cubs suck!" and live than to not find one of these places. This is serious stuffed pizza. Two slices and you should be throwing in the towel. Three and you're just going to be regretting it later. Heavy on the cheese and fairly generous on the toppings, it's quite a meal...though expect a wait, especially if you're at one of the locations in or near downtown. Sure, uppity foodies and locals hate chains, but in its defense it is a *local* chain....and chances are you'll leave satisfied.
