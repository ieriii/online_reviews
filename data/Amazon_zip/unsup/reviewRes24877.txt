A friend recommended this place to me. They don't take reservations so the wait can be definitely long. Luckily, there are a few local bars that they suggest hanging out at until your table is ready. They called us after about an hour wait. We loved that it was BYOB. The food was superb! We've ordered take out a few times since our dining experience.
