Bill Dec, you've outdone yourself again. Sunda is an amazing fusion of east meets west. Came here for brunch several times and loved every experience! The staff are always professional and the service is top-notch. For the value and flavor that you get from this place, the prices are completely worth it. I try to order a different item on the menu every time I return but there's always 1 item on the brunch menu that I must have each time -- sunda signature sushi with kobe beef. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. This maki is not like your ordinary maki. The sushi rice is out of this world. It's crunchy on the outside yet soft and flavorful on the inside -- just magnificent.
