a bit price-y, but totally worth every dollar! this place is better than any indian buffets in california. their garlic naan was the softest, warmest, fluffiest, perfect amount of garlic ever! and the waitors kept it coming! even to this day my girlfriend would just want to fly to chicago for some garlic naan here because everything we have in cali- is blahhhh! the best part is that their buffet options were endless- there was so much food, we didnt even get to try half of it- this place is a must come back :)
