There are some places you eat at where it's not all about the food...but not in a bad way. Purple Pig is every bit an experience as much as it is a great place for food. On our first trip to the famous restaurant, we arrived just 30 minutes after they opened and were hearing rumblings of a 45-minute wait. The very kind hostess told us 30 minutes originally, but then she was able to sneak us a couple seats at the end of the bar. This turned out to be a wonderful treat, because we were face to face with the chefs the entire time! We tried the Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs, which was a tiny bit underwhelming. As a concept and trend, you'd expect a lot of flavor, but it was more of a unique experience. Definitely tasty (comes with grilled fresh bread and a cilantro and onion salad with a lemon vinaigrette) but not a life-changer. Next we had the Eggplant Parmesan Balls, which were fried goodness. It's a very interesting and delicious take on the traditional eggplant parmesan. Finally, we had the Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg. My husband was super pumped about this dish, considering it's something you rarely ever see on a menu, but again it wasn't so much that it was a flavor or taste we had never had before, but it was a delicious way to eat an ingredient we'd never eaten before. The environment is very loud and bustling, but again, not in a bad way. Sitting so close to the kitchen staff, we felt like we were witnessing an episode of Top Chef, and it was truly an unforgettably wonderful experience, even if it wasn't ALL because of the food.
