My birthday, our anniversary and Valentines day all fall within a 2 week span of each other. So where can we go to celebrate all three with the right amount of romance, deliciousness and fun? well Geja's succeeded. we went on Valentines day and it was dark and romantic. i got a rose at the door. We had never done fondue before and it was fun. we got a decent amount of food, which was delicious, and there was a violinist traveling to each table. It may have been a bit overpriced, but you pay for ambiance...and i would pay for it again!
