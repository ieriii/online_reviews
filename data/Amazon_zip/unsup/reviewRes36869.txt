Food is great. Decor is great too; the paintings are very interesting and memorable. Things I've tried: Drunken Udon - noodles (Japanese food): Good. Portion is smaller than I had hoped. Crocodile - sushi rolls: Great. They cook a whole eel and underneath it they put the sushi rolls. The eel is delicious and cooked to perfection. Tom Yum Soup: Great (Thai food), but the portion is small. Thought it would be bigger. Tom Yung Kung Fried Rice: Good (Thai food). Everyone seems to like the crab rangoon, but I think its just as good as the ones in any small and local Chinese carry-out restaurant, except more expensive. It's good, but there's nothing too special about it. Overall, great place to eat. Try it out sometime.
