This place was great, we went in Wednesday around 6:00 and the place was already slightly full but we got a table immediately anyways. They kept refilling my water glass, even if I just took a single sip, which caused me to keep drinking it because it was full. The saganaki was awesome and so was the vinaigrette on the salad. My brother had a dish of fish tail which looked really really good and he said was really tasty as well. I didn't see the bill but the prices themselves were pretty reasonable. The complimentary valet parking was a nice sweetener to the experience too!
