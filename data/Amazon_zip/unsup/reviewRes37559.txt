This place is great.  A small gourmet grocery with lots of potential. Hard to find items, great pre-made food and very fresh produce. They have a great selection of cheeses, homemade bread and desserts and a wondeful selection of wines. It's worth a trip if you want something a bit different, just beware of the prices!
