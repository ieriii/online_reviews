I only went here for dessert. I've heard a lot about the churros that are made here so i tried the churro w/chocolate. The churros were uniquely shaped and not a stick churro like most. The churro was very good as it was very crisp and warm. I had the chocolate dipping sauce that is bittersweet but compliments the churro it self very well! I can't wait to go back for a meal and of course another churro.
