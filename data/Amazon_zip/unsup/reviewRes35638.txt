This is my favorite place in Chicago to celebrate a special occasion (more pricey than this is out of my range). All of the seafood is always first rate, the servers are not only polite but very knowledgeable about fish, and the key lime pie and creme brulee are probably the best in Chicago. Decor is not intimate, but does a pretty good job of making you think you are in the 1930's if you don't look up at the modernized ceiling details.  Soft shell crabs here are first rate when they have them -- truly soft and not ones beginning to harden. Love their popcorn shrimp too.
