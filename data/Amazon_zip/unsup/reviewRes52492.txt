WAY TOO MUCH FOOD- WAY TOO MUCH MONEY All you can eat meats served table side, salad bar, sushi, fruits = sick to stomach afterwards! If you are a light eater, just skip this place it isn't worth it. Although everything was tasty, it was overwhelming - they are at your table every second asking if you want more and I could barely put the last slice of food in my mouth or finish a conversation. Not good for a romantic anniversary dinner. Plus the price is huge - $49 each. Luckily we had a special coupon for buy one get one free, so we could splurge on a bottle of wine. :)
