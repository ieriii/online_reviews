This was the most amazing dinner experience I have ever had. I am not going to say it was my favorite meal, but that is not why I was there. Alinea offers something that few other places could even imagine. Every course is a study in flavor, temperature, and texture. The combinations are brilliantly creative and it may have been the most fun I have had at any restaurant. Each dish seemed to be more amazing than the last and by the end, I was sad it was over. I also had the best wine I have ever tasted, but will probably never taste it again. Alinea lives up to its expectations and possibly even exceeds them. It is a wonderfully designed restaurant with a great staff and they offer an amazing vision of what food is.
