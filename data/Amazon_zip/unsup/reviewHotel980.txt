I stayed here in 2004 and thought it was incredible, and I was very excited to return. I was a little worried that I had overhyped it to myself, and it wouldn't quite live up to the expectations of the younger, more easily impressed me. I was wrong. The Amalfi is one of the best hotel experiences a person can possibly have (outside of the people who drop like 5k a night on rooms). Upon entering, the lobby is nice with music playing, and the checkin is very smooth. The rooms are great. The bed is the most comfortable bed I have ever been in. the mattress, sheets, pillows, everything. I can go on and on about these beds, they are that comfortable. Nice LCD TVs and they leave a few books and jazz CDs in your room which is really cool! I read they have a library of DVDs and CDs if you want. I didnt check out the minibar but from my last experience i think i really liked it. There's not much of a view, but who cares. Nice robe and slippers in the rooms also. The hotel as a gym which is basically a few treadmills, but it helps. USA today at your door every morning. Each floor has a breakfast station which is really cool. Juices, bagels, pastries, etc. The hotel as a complimentary happy hour also, from 530-7 with free alcohol (tip the bartender because they are very nice and hook you up) and some food. cheeses, foccaccia, salami, brushetta, etc. The $ for the hotel is very good for where it is. In the area, there are plenty of bars, grills, restaurants etc. For business travelers, its about a $7 cab ride to the sears tower. The hotel is perfect for business or for traveling to visit chicago with a spouse. I will definitely be returning here!
