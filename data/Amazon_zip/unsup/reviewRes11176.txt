Giving three stars is not a bad thing. It's a solid choice. Good pizza, decent brews and drink specials. I wouldn't say I love it, but I definitely will go back again. In a town full of deep dish and pan pizzas, this is a great thin crust place. You're talking to a Wisconsin person, and I thought there was barely any cheese, but I was surprisingly not upset by this. Def. different than what I'm used to. FYI - New Haven people, you do eat your pizza weird. :P
