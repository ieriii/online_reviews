HELLO! NEW CHICAGO FAVORITE! The illustrious Ashley B., Annie T., and Jessica S. picked up roomie and me on a blustery, c-c-c-cold night outside of Midway after our flight from KC. Wine and food, stat! Luckily, a small 5 top had been tucked away in the corner for us at Davanti Enoteca and upon looking at the menu, I almost passed out from happiness. Dark and cozy, the dining room was overflowing with people waiting to sample VERY fair prices on wine bottles and TASTY small plates. My ladies and I split the following: * ricotta + honey comb spread + toast = orgasmic to everyone at our table...but me. I just couldn't do it. DO NOT put this off because of my review...I have really weird texture issues. Everyone else loved the mild flavor/creamy texture * Uovo in Raviolo: HUGE ravioli stuffed with egg, ricotta and spinach. I can't wait to attempt to replicate this at home. Since were splitting it 5 ways, I only got a little wedge but it was so simply delicious. Perhaps one of my favorites. * Pizza D.O.C.: HELLO, BASIL! * Pizza della Terra: I thought I hated taleggio. Then I tried it on this pizza with mushrooms, leeks and truffle oil. Then I passed out from the deliciousness. * Truffle egg toast + fontina + asparagus: a fancy, tasty version of comfort food I like to make at home We also split a meat and cheese board (lay off me, we're 5 hot ladies who had been awaiting this reunion all day!) which was delectable. We split 2 bottles of red (not sure which one...at the moment I could have downed Carlo Rossi and been happy) and our server was super nice and catered to everything we needed.  It took ::slightly:: longer than I expected for us to get our tab settled...but if I lived in the area, I'd be verrrrrrry obsessed with this place. What an awesome way to be welcomed back to the Windy!
