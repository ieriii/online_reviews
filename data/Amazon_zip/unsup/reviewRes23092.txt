WHAT is up with the clear plastic chairs at Lao Sze Chuan now? I'm not one who pooh-poohs modern decor, but really, come on. I'd prefer some more substantial and comfortable seating. Despite my disdain for the chairs, I still heart this place. On my most recent visit, I got to try the house special fried noodles, which was a lot spicier than the one chili pepper next to the dish (on the menu) would suggest. Luckily we also ordered a dish of chicken with vegetables, which was not spicy, which I ate in between bites of the noodles. We also ordered the sole fillets with tofu. This was just the right amount of spice and worked well over rice.
