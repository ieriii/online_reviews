great pho broth, and yummy meatballs. i've always had a good experience here, but lately, every time i go there there's been at least a 40 minute wait. that's great they are busy but when i finally got a chance to sit, i ordered the spring rolls, which took less than two minutes to come out, and they tasted majorly old, like they've been pre-made and have been sitting out. the rice wrapper was so hard.. but other than that, i love the big cafeteria feel of the place, it's a great location.. if the line is too long, check out pho 777 down the alley.. also try the combination fried rice here, nicely seasoned, very tasty.
