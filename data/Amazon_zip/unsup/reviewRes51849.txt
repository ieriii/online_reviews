I would only say that Gino's East is overrated because it has the reputation of being the Mecca of Deep Dish/Pan/Stuffed Pizza in Chicago. I don't think that this reputation is deserved. I think it comes from the many suburbanites who flock here regularly who are often afraid to venture to other "less safe" parts of the City. The pizza is indeed good, but I would hesitate to rave about it. We had a large stuffed pizza, I believe it cost $30 or so. Kinda pricy for what you get.  I think that a lot of that comes from the location.  Right off Michigan Ave, right around the corner from Water Tower Place.  The crust was a bit "bready", in that there was a lot of it and it was a bit bland. The sauce was also a bit bland. I prefer a spicy sauce, not necessarily hot, but with some real Italian spices--oregano, basil, etc. A little red and or white pepper wouldn't hurt either.  So, good, but not great pizza, somewhat inflated price due to its location and naive suburban clientele.  You might instead seek out Edwardo's on or near Division for better pizza at a more reasonable price.
