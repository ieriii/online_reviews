Hands down my favorite bar in Chicago. Coconut curry mussels and a forty great beers on tap...need I say more? It gets crowded on the weekends, but what good place doesn't. It's well worth wading through the crowds in my opinion. Their beer list is the best in the city and their bistro style food is second to none.
