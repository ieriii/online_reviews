I just moved from upstate NY, the home of the Buffalo wing. These are some of the best wings and sauces I've ever had. Especially the Asian sauce and the traditional hot sauce. The fries are OK, kind of like fresh MacDonalds' fries. One thing to keep in mind: Each "Wing" is actually 3 pieces (tip, wing and drumstick) so order like half as many wings as you usually would. In other words, 10 wings is like the normal 20 wings, divided up like you get everywhere else. Oh, the Bi-Bim-Bop is not that great. We got the Big Boy and the vegetables were not that good and the rice was the wrong kind of rice (cheap and puffy.) Still 5-stars because the wings are great. Seating is a big problem though - there are only 2-3 large tables in the whole place and you have to share with others in a cramped environment. This would be OK, but there are ALWAYS people just chillin' after they eat, and talking and hogging all the tables. I've had to wait a while each time I went just to sit down, which really sucks, and it's the fault of the establishment, in my opinion. They should just get a bunch of 4-top tables and fill the place much more efficiently and comfortably.
