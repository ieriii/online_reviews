After the rave reviews on Yelp and Chef Tony being interviewed on the news, I had to come check this place out. Going to lunch here before the Chinese New Year parade hit the spot. It was perfect. They have good tea here, and they placed a plate of spicy cabbage on the table as well. I'm not sure if this was typical or for the new year. My interpretation was that it would make for longevity, hence the long slices of cabbage and the spiciness adds to an interesting year! Of course, it meant that I had to eat some so that I could have some of that spice in my life. I had to be selective of the items to eat since my friend doesn't love Chinese food the way that I do, and she has specific allergies. The crab rangoons here are some of the best in the city. You actually see the pieces of the crab in there when you take a bite out of them. They added broccoli to our orange chicken per our request and made salt and pepper shrimp for us even though the shrimp wasn't really an option on the menu. As large as the menu was, they were very accomodating. The food came out piping hot, and the presentation was terrific. They totally impressed me, and I can't wait to take my family here the next time they are in Chicago. My friend said she'd come back and even try something new. The boss came out to pour us each a cup of hot tea and wish us a Happy New Year as well. I'm very tempted to try the new Lao Beijing and Lao Shanghai now. Oh my fortune cookie says that I will be showered with good luck before my next birthday. What a way to start the New Year!
