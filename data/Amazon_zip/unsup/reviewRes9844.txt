OK. So I REALLY wanted to like this place. I REALLY did. We waited two months for a reservation on the patio, which is, in all honesty, quite beautiful, but let's set it straight, the scene is more than it should be, especially considering its' location. Too many hipsters, too many Ferrari-driving old men in suit coats and 'real' housewives. Too many pretentious gladhanders and wanna-be wiseguys. The most real people in the place were the gents clearing the tables. The panzanella was good, the fettucini was good and the desert was fair, I've eaten plenty of food in Rome and, well, this ain't Castro Pretorio. Overall the selection is good, not great, the prices are a little high but manageable. No one left hungry, but no one left satisfied I'm sure many people can enjoy this place, but there are better places with better food and less attitude than this joint.
