The boyfriend, a couple friends and I came here last Saturday night. Food was tasty, but a bit overpriced for what we got. I was terribly envious of the bison burger; my shepherd's pie was decent, but I could have made it at home! The curried mussels were also really good. Ambiance was nice--dark woods, bookcases full of books--and our waitress was awesome. We'd probably give it four stars, except for the fact that the beer was really expensive for some reason--one to two dollars more per pint than at similar pubs. It was enough of a difference that we left after dinner instead of staying for another round.
