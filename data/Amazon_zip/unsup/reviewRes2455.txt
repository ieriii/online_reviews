I want to meet my wife here. If you are going to order a plain hot dog......DON'T come here. You won't get it. Same goes for a typical Chicago dog. That's not what this is about. The specials. Go for the specials. Order 3. Go crazy. Take a nap afterwards. An afternoon at Hot Doug's is about all the happiness I need. But I do have to admit....all the publicity this place gets has given it a bit of a novelty feel, and I think it gets busier and busier because it's the "thing to do". So, if you are going to be a member of the block long "line party", do me a favor......don't order a plain hot dog. Take a leap. Try something different....and you'll forever be a member of something special. Again. Order 7 different hot dogs. Then nap. Trust me. Heck, order 10. I won't tell anyone. I promise.
