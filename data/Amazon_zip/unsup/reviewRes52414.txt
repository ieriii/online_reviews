Went last night because my wife received a "Two for" coupon as a gift. So we figrued we'd check it out. I must say that I was not impressed at all. Service - Very attentive, very courteous, lots of servers and different wait staff helped us, so it got a bit confusing.  Drinks - they made a very good manhattan. They know how to make a drink ok.. FOOD - I've had waaay better. The salad bar has a decent selection and it was nice that they had Oysters. The rice was wattery and the black beans were flavorless. The fried plantains could have used some sweetness to them. The mashed potatoes.. cold. The meats were pretty bland and tasteless. The only thing that stuck out to me was the broasted chicken. Very tastey and I hardly ever go for the chicken at these places. The top and bottom sirloins were halfway ok, nothing to rave about. They could use a tastier and more flavorful crust. The picanha was so so, again more flavor! it was bland. I am still yet to find one of these restaurants that surpass Texas De Brazil(Schaumburg). Not only is the food and service amazing there but it is even less expensive than the over priced Fogo de Chao and Brazzaz. Waay over priced, I feel I paid too much for the quality food I ate. If you're paying $50 a plate.. it better be damn good, I dont care how much if it your hustling out of the kitchen, if it doesn't taste good it doesn't matter. Quality over Quantity, if I wanted a ton of food, I'd go sit at a China Buffet or an Old Country Buffet and shovel food in my face.
