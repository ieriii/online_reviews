My office crew and I hit this spot and while I dig the community seating and the great beer list, the small plates concept is overdone. The food was pretty good but at the costs I don't think I'll be back anytime soon. While we managed to get enough to eat, swine and cheese is fairly greasy and didn't leave me feeling so great by mid-afternoon. Thank God for the beer!
