This place is phenominal. I live around the corner, and it's by far the best deal in an insanely overpriced area. Want a quiet dinner? Go to 3rd Coast. It's 7pm on a Saturday, and you don't have reservations anywhere? Go to 3rd Coast. Don't want to spend $50 a plate like most places in the area? Go to 3rd Coast. My favorite time to go to 3rd Coast is on the weekend brunch. Half of my friends don't care for contemporary brunch, prefering to eat at Denny's. The other half craves the more unique and adventurous. 3rd Coast is very often the great compromise.
