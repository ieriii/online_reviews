HOW IS THIS PLACE STILL IN BUSINESS??? Is everyone on crazy pills? Was I at the right restaurant?!  I was SOOOOO underwhelmed with my dinner last night. I'm honestly mad cause I feel like my boyfriend and I were swindled out of $140 for a craptastic meal. My girlfrends raved about this place (" OMG! Get the veal ragu, it's lifechanging" - one of them said) - EW! It looked like catfood on top of green and cream pasta. So gross. I had one bite and pushed it towards my boyfriend (who will eat anything) and he immediately said, "I don't like this at all". I had the beef short ribs, decent (and I'm being generous) - had to put a TON of salt and pepper on the plate to give it flavor. My boyfriend got the Lamb Meatball pasta.. again , looked like catfood in ball form, but he didn't seem to mind so whatever. Our apps were equally boring - granted, we got the classic prosciutto with melon and they get one star for not mucking that up. We also ordered the squash blossoms "stuffed with fontina cheese" - what cheese?! Again - they really must hate salt because there was NO flavor whatsoever!!! Oh, wait.. I'm forgetting - my boyfriend's soup was actually good (it was the cauliflower and something else special of the day.. whoop-dee-do for getting soup and packaged meat appetizer right...) I don't even wanna type the rest of what we ordered. Thank God the manager came over and took the veal off of our bill - he took our critique of the food to heart and said, "I'm glad you mentioned this because who knows if another 8 people in the restaurant thought the same". Sorry buddy, Absolutely WILL NOT go back again.
