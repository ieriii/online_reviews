Hands down Chicagos best tacos !!(they were actually voted Chicagos best tacos last year )Juicy tender steak tacos that make my mouth salvate thinking of them .Warm soft tortillas ,gooey chihuahua cheese ,what a real taco should be .This review is for the shack location nest to the car dealer .The restuarant location across the street offers a "parillada "which is a huge sizzling skillet with many cuts of meat ...Skirt steak ,chicken ,ribs ,sausage ..comes with beans and rice and tortillas for about $20 (feeds 3-5 people easily ) they also have really good guacamole .
