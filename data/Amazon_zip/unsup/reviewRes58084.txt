The food here was incredible. The spicy cabbage appetizer sent to our table on the house was how cabbage should be served. The restaurant is unpretentious and focuses on the basics...serving delicious food. The host kept things moving efficiently, and while gruff was also extremely welcoming and ensured that patrons got to experience a great dinner as soon as possible.
