This isnt my first review of Grand Lux, but it'll be my last.We've been probably 20 times since it opened. When it was new, it was so very nicely done, with items on the menu that were definitely more ambitious than the Cheesecake Factory, and pretty well done. Never had an item I didnt think was well executed. Unfortunately, all that is over. I cant tell any difference between Grand Lux and the Cheesecake Factory as to the level of the food. And whereas they used to prepare it well....it's definitely gone downhill. Mediocre. Grand Lux has been packing in the crowds for 3 years now and the wear and tear is showing. Two large pieces of wallpaper were dangling from the wall going up the escalator-amateurish attempts to stick it back up with scotch tape had failed. Light fixtures were a little askew. The bathroom was in great need of attention. Little, telling signs. Why arent they getting a maintenance crew in there to spiff it back up? But the worst is the people going there. WAY too many kids and teenagers. I like kids and teens, I have two of my own, but too many is ...too many. Hate the strollers. And worst of all...the Grand Lux is attracting the riff raff. The first time, I was hoping it was just one of those nights, but unfortunately it's one of those nights every night.Wish they'd open another GL in the northern 'burbs with the original menu. I wont be returning.
