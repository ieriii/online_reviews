The food was delicious, I had a falafel sandwich..yum! There's something about their falafel...seems like there is an extra hint of spice in it. Their decor is different and pretty.. Next time, I'll probably try their spinach pie (yummo!) or their salad bar, which looked very healthy and fresh! :) Great, casual place for friends to hang out to grab something rather than the same old fast food joints :)
