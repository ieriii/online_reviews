I'm impressed. After hearing it was "all right" I never really thought about ordering sushi from here. I work almost every Saturday night, my co-worker and I get hungry and every week we treat ourselves to something special (see Indian House review from last week)...This week it was sushi! I ordered "American style" sushi-- The Philly (salmon and cream cheese) and the vegetable tempura roll -- both great!  He ordered a couple vegetarian rolls. I was super surprised that 5 rolls delivered only cost about $30.00 and thought that was pretty cool... AND...we ordered from the West Loop..it arrived in 20 minutes! I do prefer more traditional Japanese sushi, but for a quick fresh fix of some fun rolls..This is an awesome option! -- EDIT 9.07 I went here to lunch with the boss...(i've only had carry out till then) It's kind of weird inside..especially during the day...it was a super sunny day out, we walked into a black hole..I felt like my boss and I were on a romantic date..it was weird.. I still love love their food.. but wouldn't really recommend going there on a summer afternoon... carry out and delivery is fast!
