The Violet Hour is a cocktail venue that served me up with some stellar cocktails. My husband and I went there for the first time in December '09, I want to say. We sat right at the bar which gave us an opportunity to witness the mixologist concocting our drinks. The first drink I had was made with blackberries and I do not know with what liquor but it was big and definitely packed a punch! The second I tasted was made with whiskey and it was great great great, but unfortunately I asked the bartender if I could try another before I realized its great potental :(. All I can say is wow wee these drinks are strong and worth every bit of $12! For apps we had some cajun shrimp which were a little fishy tasting but flavorful nonetheless. We also had some tempura battered and fried reese cups which were theee best reese cups. Ever. Lol. But I do not think they are still on the menu. My husband does not remember what he drank but he did enjoy his drink. All in all I would say definitely go to Violet Hour, have a couple (or few) drinks and try some of the food.
