I have been here twice and had the falafel both times based on friends' recommendation. Damn tasty and decently sized food option for $3.75.  Loved it (meaning I would not throw it against the wall if handed one). Falafel is a pretty new concept to me (I know, shame on me) but it's one that I am interested in exploring. Let's call it "Falafel Quest". And I'm off...
