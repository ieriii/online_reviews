I work very close by and we'd been anticipating the opening ever since "Feed the Beast" (the previous place) closed down. I think we're going into week 2 of the Bad Apple being open so it should definitely be visited if you really want to know for yourself, but given that I didn't find too many kinks that you normally do that early. I had the steak frites burger and my wife had the veggie burger concoction (the something famous) and went nuts over it. She's a veggie burger snob and said this may be her favorite - very high praise. We LOVED the fries, very fresh and tasty. Our only food complaint was that both our buns were a little burned when toasted, but it didn't ruin it for us. BEER - thats why you come to this place. They have Belgians, Unibroue and an amazing variety of cool beers that I hadn't even heard of. Some are pretty pricey but the draft menu is really reasonable for craft beers. NOTE: THIS IS NOT THE PLACE TO GO FOR A BUD LIGHT. We also dug the atmosphere, it feels exactly how I want a neighborhood spot to feel. I know we'll be back on a pretty regular basis - so many burgers so little time.
