Bad Apple definitely reminds me of Kuma's (minus the ridiculously long wait). There's a huge selection of gourmet beers and burgers (including vegetarian & vegan options). I had the Late Breakfast, which is everything you'd want on a breakfast platter sandwiched between a pretzel bun with garlic fries (75 cent upgrade was totally worth it) paired perfectly with a Goose Island Matilda (gotta love those Belgian pale ales). Outside of the food, the place is beautifully decorated and suits the atmosphere. Our server was pleasant and helpful. And I recall hearing some really good music being played, like Depeche Mode, some Sublime... I'm definitely coming back to try out more of what they have to offer, and you should too!
