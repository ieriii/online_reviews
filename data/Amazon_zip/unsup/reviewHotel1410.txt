The best 12th Night party in 105 Years (Jan 29th)... Thanks Knickerbocker! Our group had a beautiful suite with a bathroom that was almost as big as the living room. The party was wonderful, the staff fun and friendly as 300 costumed, crazy-people took over their hotel. The bars were serving hurricanes which helped to fill the lighted-up-disco-dance-floor. We had a great time. Hopefully, they'll let us come back next year.
