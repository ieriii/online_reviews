I wanted to take my wife to a fancy joint for our anniversary but we could not find a babysitter so we opted for Grand Lux after hearing that it's kid-friendly and pretty nice. We were a bit disappointed about the decor. Only thing that's grand is that this is a huge restaurant. But as stated in previous reviews, it's really not much better than Cheesecake Factory. Its menu and the price are pretty much the same too. We got there around 7:15PM (9/16 Wed) and were seated right away. Our server was great. He checked up on us regularly and was very friendly. Food was very good but again we always thought food at Cheesecake is great too. We ordered an appetizer, 3 entrees, one side mac & cheese, two $12 mixed drinks(pricey but really good) & the drinks for the kids. Portions are large so we took home some doggy bags and skipped out on the dessert. With the tip(22%), I ended up paying about $135. Paid $14 plus tip for valet parking which is good for 3hrs so afterwards just walked up and down the Michigan Ave which was nice to burn off some calories and enjoy the beautiful evening. Don't know why but we had to wait good 20minutes for our car. You can enjoy pretty much the same for less $ at Cheesecakes but overall, we were pretty satisfied. However, we probably wouldn't make an effort to return to this place unless we happened to be in that area.
