Fun yum! The honey and I dragged my dad to Hot Doug's, and even he (the old-fashioned foodie curmudgeon that he is) loved it! We tried the foie gras duck sausage, the swiss cheese stuffed pork and beef knockwurst (surprisingly, this was even more overwhelming and rich than the foie gras) and some large (unfortunately not duck fat) fries. All were delicious. I love that all of the encased meats seem to be made in-house. Price point for non-specials is excellent. ($2 for a Chicago dog!!) Mr. Hot Doug himself took our orders and he was patient, kind, and humble when the honey mentioned that we've been wanting to try Hot Doug's for a long time! I'm a fan. Go!
