As a party of two from out of town my friend and I arrived with nothing other then other yelpers reviews and a vague impression that we were about to get our swine on. We were seated immediately (at about 5pm on a Wednesday) but within the half hour the place was packed. To the gills. I was pretty impressed at how quickly the evening went from mellow and quite to roaring.  I was not a huge fan of the space itself, something just did not mesh for me with the decor and the type of food I was expecting. the music was great. Our server was also attentive and informative about the best order practice. Portions are intended to be shared and 3 probably would have been enough for the two of us.  Neither of us are drinkers so I can not attest to the wine list or cocktail options, although every single other table in the restaurant was imbibing wine. We started off with Shaved Brussel Sprouts, Pecorino Noce & Parmigiano Reggiano, delicious and fresh with a nice kick to the cheese. Next we had the Purple Pig Platter, a sample of all the cured meats on the menu. It was simply fantastic, as usual the sopressata was my favorite but all were remarkable. When the platter was brought to our table the food runner did tell us what meat was what, however he was a little difficult to understand. Next we had the Cesear salad that had a pleasantly strong anchovy flavor. This was followed by the Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs. By far my favorite item of the meal, rich and creamy marrow spread onto crusty bread with herbs and a dash of sea salt. I could have ended the meal here, especially since this was the largest portion of bone marrow I have ever been served. We finished off the meal with the milk braised pork shoulder in mashed potatoes. this was soft and rich and a close second to the bone marrow. Our server offered dessert but after looking at the menu we decided we couldn't possibly and waddled out of The Purple Pig full and sleepy and content.
