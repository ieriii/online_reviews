Tonight my boyfriend and I went for a late dinner and got there around 9:15. I had called ahead and the host who answered the phone told me they didn't take reservations but said that by that time of night, we shouldn't have to wait more than half an hour. We got there at 9:30 and were quoted a 1 - 1 1/2 hour wait. We figured that since we were there (from the North side) we would stick it out and have a drink at a bar across the street while we waited - no problem. The restaurant called us after 45 minutes that our table was ready so we headed back - and frankly, it was downhill from there. While the food and wine were all great, that was unfortunately overshadowed by the worst service I've experienced in a restaurant. The hostess who sat us walked about thirty feet ahead of us and we could barely see her when she dropped menus at a table and practically sprinted in another direction. Keep in mind it's now almost 10:30 and the restaurant is no longer very busy. Water glasses were filled promptly but it was a good 5-10 minutes before anyone acknowledged that we were there. Someone finally came to take our order, we ordered a bottle of wine, bruschetta and then a cheese/charcuterie plate. The appetizers arrived before our wine did and we had to flag down another server to actually get the wine. Then our entrees (we both had the same pasta, the rigatoni with sausage, tomatoes and parm) arrived about 3 seconds after the bruschetta et al. So after waiting maybe 15 minutes for our drinks, we felt very rushed with our food. We probably only saw our actual waiter twice - the first time he took our order and at the end when he presented the check. The food was good, but I wouldn't go back. There are better Italian restaurants in the city that won't make you jump through hoops.
