On the recommendation of my cousin and the never ending thumping buzz around town about XOCO, I thought I would give it a try. I went just for dessert - churros and mexican hot chocolate. The wait wasn't too bad for a weekend night and our party of 4 managed to be seated in about 10 minutes. The churros were really delicious. Incredibly sweet as you'd expect but soft and warm and really good.  I was expecting more out of the aztec hot chocolate. Much to my sadness I've had better (at Hot Chocolate and a chocolatier in Toronto) and I found XOCO's version to be hard to swallow. The consistency was too gritty for my taste and the spice level just overwhelming.  I will definitely come back to try some of the actual food and hopefully forgive Rick for his hot chocolate fail.
