Three friends and I stopped by Mercat for dinner. We started at the bar and asked the bartender for her favorite spicy red wine. It was very good and went well with all the food we ended up getting. When it came time to eat, everything looked so good we couldn't decide so we had the waitress bring all of her favorites. Everything we had was delicious especially the bacon wrapped dates and chocolate dessert. Our first order of food was delivered to the wrong table (some of the servers seemed to be distracted by the presence of a former baseball player) but the waitress made up for it by buying us a round of drinks.
