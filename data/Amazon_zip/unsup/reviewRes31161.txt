Yum! My friend and I have started to go out for brunch every Sunday, and this was our next pick. Boy, were we happy! My nemesis of Chicago brunch spots is a long wait (I'm looking at you, m Henry), so we were beyond pleased when we walked in today and had NO wait. That could have been because of the Chicago marathon, but details, details. It was an unusual, blazing 84 degree October day today, and we chose to sit inside. There was a lovely breeze coming through. For drinks, I wasn't much in a hot coffee mood. I chose the lemonade, and my friend got the iced apple cider. Both tasted homemade and fresh. I'm not surprised since Nana prides themselves on using organic and local food. I always have the brunch dilemma, savory or sweet? Today, I went for sweet. My friend and I both ordered the stuffed French toast. It was awesome...and I'm not even a huge fan of French toast. It was light and fluffy and covered in a raspberry sauce and almonds and "stuffed" with strawberry cream cheese.On the side was a big dollop of whipped cream and a couple pear slices. It was absolutely fab. We also both ordered a side of home fries. They were ok, nothing special. Overall, really friendly service, great food, really comfortable atmosphere, easy street parking and reasonable prices. There is so much more on the menu I want to try, so it is definitely a place to return!
