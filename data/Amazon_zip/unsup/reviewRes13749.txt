Went here today for a late lunch, and glad we got there at an odd time since I had no idea how teeny-tiny the place was. There is a small parking lot that had plenty of spots available, so that was good. Staff was super friendly and helpful as I ordered a Cuban sandwich, Ropa Vieja dinner, goat cheese empanada, mango and mamey (never heard of that, but counter girl suggested it) shakes. We were lucky enough to get two of the 10(ish) stools in there. It would kinda suck to go there and order food and not be able to sit down and eat it. Food came out quickly. Presentation was fine, and food was excellent. I've never had a Cuban sandwich and it was yum, but I think a few more plantain chips would've been good...there were like 8 small chips on the side. Ropa Vieja was really great, served with rice, black beans, and plantains. The empanada was smallish for the price and we got beef instead of goat cheese as ordered, so bummer, but we ate anyway it and it was tasty. They aren't giving anything away here...$32 for lunch, so it was a bit pricey considering the small space. Nothing against a dive-y place, but they don't even have a bathroom. I suppose it would be nice to sit outside there, but again, there's the bathroom thing. Since the food was so great I would love to go back, but I would try the other location which looks like it has more seating...like a regular restaurant. I'm sure I will be craving that Ropa Vieja sooner than later...
