The best pizza I've had in Chicago...yet. Surprisingly inexpensive taboot. For $16 plus toppings you can get a large pizza. At 8 slices, this can feed 4 people. 4 PEOPLE. I can put away a lot of food for a skinny guy, but I had no desire to eat more after 2 slices. Carmelized crust? F*cking forgettaboutit. Too good.
