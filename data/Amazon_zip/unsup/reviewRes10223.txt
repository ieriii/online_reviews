After about 3 years of looking longingly at Piccolo Sogno in passing I finally got to try it! The place was packed for a Thursday night so I didn't get to experience the enchanting patio seating, but inside was enjoyable and comfortable so I guess I'll have to use that as an excuse to return. There was a great selection of salads on the menu and I loved the option to select an appetizer portion of any of their pasta offerings. It was nice to have room for dessert and not feel like my pants were cutting into my waist as I waddled out. The wine selection was vast and overwhelming but I guess with that respect I'd rather be overwhelmed than under. It's definitely a neighborhood gem!
