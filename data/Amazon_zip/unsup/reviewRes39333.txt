Ok people, let's talk. Considering that half of my family is Korean, I have seen my fair share of KBBQ. This is one of the best. Partially because the food is bomb, you get TONS of panchan, and it's open 'til 5am. There is a reason for the wait (as there usually is one especially come weekend).  Let me let you in on a little secret: Koreans don't care about service. They do however, take their food SERIOUSLY. I've found that the lack of good service is part of the charm at San Soo. I'll be honest about something else...if you want decent service, you go with one of your Korean friends. That's just how it is. So people, don't come here if you're expecting fine dining. It's all about the food. Nothing more, nothing less. Cheers!
