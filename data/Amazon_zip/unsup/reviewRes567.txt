The food was excellent! The presentation was even better! However, I left still very hungry and the service was terrible. Our waiter was high or something! When he was describing our plate we started telling us what was in it and then said "and some other stuff". With almost every course! If I'm paying a nice chunk of my weekly paycheck to eat here, I want to know what that other stuff was!
