This place really angers me. My girlfriend and I take a trip for our anniversary to Chicago and her #1 thing to do is eat at this restaurant. We're in town for 3 days and every time we try, we fail. Not open Sundays or Mondays, and any other time expect to wait. What type of high-end restaurant flat out refuses to accept reservations?! The pretension of this place is offensive. I hate you Rick Bayless.
