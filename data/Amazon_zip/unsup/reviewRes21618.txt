Tried this place for the first time today. Not a fan of waiting in line, but it actually wasn't too bad and the hostess was super nice, even letting us know that we could order drinks, chips, or salsa while we were in line if we wanted. I had the jamon torta with egg. It was pretty good, but I don't think I was a fan of the chipotle sauce that was in it. Gave it a different flavor that I wasn't expecting in the torta. My friend loved the Cubana. Chips and guacamole were awesome, and I LOVED the churro with a small side of soft serve homemade vanilla ice cream. Delicious :) The best treat was actually seeing Rick Bayless himself come into the kitchen and working in it, while a camera crew filmed.
