i love this place. located conveniently off the diversey el stop on brown line, this place sells pizza by the slice and also brasilian-style rotisserie chicken (with the fixings) as well as kibe and coxinha. the owner is a doll. really sweet guy. when you buy large pizzas on Tuesdays (?), he donates a large pizza to the homeless. class act all the way. i only wish they were open late night.
