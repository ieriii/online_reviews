I've been to this restaurant numerous times. I used to live in the neighborhood and come here for dinner twice a month at least. The food here is cheap and the portions are big. My favorite items are all the fajitas, the barbacoa and the burritos. I also love the spicy pickled veggies. Refried beans are a little greasy but super yummy too. This place is great for big groups and becomes quite loud during peak hours in the weekends, so don't come here with your girlfriend for a romantic date!
