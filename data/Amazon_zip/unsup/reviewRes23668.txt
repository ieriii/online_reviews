Let's just give you an overall impression with this: I have friends from the far Northwest suburbs who I've shown this place to, who will actually make a special trip for brunch JUST to have some crepes here!!! Very authentic Algerian crepes, unlike the greasy bland filled ones just down the street at the typical place that I won't name. You'll find very fresh ingredients in both the gourmet savory (not-sweet) crepes to the dessert delicacies. I've had each of their "dinner" crepes with the various fillings ranging from roasted peppers or escargot to refreshing fresh herbs of cilantro or basil. The combinations in each crepe are delectable!!! For dessert, instead of the typical Nutella, try to dulce de leche (caramelized milk) or Cajera (sweetened condensed milk). With bananas or any fresh fruit is the most special taste you'll ever have in your life. My suggestion; come with friends and SHARE!! Have a round of "meal crepes" and then order a few for dessert. They're fairly large, so half of one followed by half of another will definitely fill you up! (And also easily filled up my "all u can eat non-stop"-boyfriend! Just a heads up, it's a pretty small place, and not the most comfortable as far as atmosphere. Also, the fact that you have to go through the kitchen to a pretty gross bathroom is kind of a turnoff. Finally, the artwork and maps on the walls could offend some.
