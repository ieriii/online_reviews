Ok, so after passing Hot Doug's and seeing a line down the block so many times I finally found a day where very few people were in... my opening at last! lol  I've visited many hot dog joints since moving to Chicago that I feel I have some expertise. The menu of variously prepared sausages was entertaining and alluring. I ended up ordering two gourmet dogs (Foi Gras and Alligator). Although they were tasty I expected better buns. Am i wrong but their buns were straight out of Jewel's. I think the gourmet dogs at Chicago's Dog House are just as good (maybe better). All-in-all, Hot Doug's is a must do if you love hot dogs.
