Perfection.I tell you, one of the major perks of living in Lakeview (besides the clean atmosphere, pedestrian friendly streets, beautiful architecture on the buildings, and the...lake) is the plethora of great eateries we have within walking distance.Crisp definitely fits in here. Their sweet and slightly spicy wings (which are uncut, full winged monsters) are definitely worth trying. They are what got me hooked on this place.My favorites are the Buddha bowls: delightful combinations of spinach, rice, beansprouts, carrots, and other vegetables. Meat if you want it. Oh... and I mustn't forget about the lovely fried egg they put on top!!! The regular-sized bowls are large enough for two people to share!It's hearty enough for vegetarians!The atmosphere of the place is nice, too. The fellows who work there are always laid back and easy going. Genuinely nice guys. They have these large, Medieval-looking tables which can be shared with more than one group of people (thus discouraging the isolation that has become so prevalent in our society ;P) The place is always clean. I've never seen a dirty table or bathroom or anything. All in all... you gotta try this place. It's very casual, affordable. Definitely even worth making a trip for!
