I think Caro Mio is a good byob option. Some dishes are awesome and some are just okay. The dishes are very hearty- you can tell they use a lot of cream and butter. The porcini pappardelle is outstanding!  Large portions hit or miss entres. The decor is interesting. I will continue to go back but its not my favorite in the world.
