I was very disappointed when I ate here. Everything was overpriced! I don't mind paying a premium for food as long as the food justifies the price. - the pho broth was bland. You know pho is good when you don't need to add hot sauce and hoisin sauce. I added both sauces to my pho and still wasn't good. - Bo loc lac(beef squares): was not worth $11. They barely give you any meat and use so much lettuce to add as a filler. And the meat was so chewing and tough. Does not taste like real Bo loc lac. - smoothies were bland as well. Just because you use real fruit doesn't mean it is good. The only thing thats tanking is their food. I don't recommend this place. Please don't confuse this place with Tank Sushi.
