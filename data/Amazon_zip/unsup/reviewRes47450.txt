The food was outstanding. I stopped in for a quick bite on a Sunday afternoon. They had more than enough TVs with football and it seemed like there were quite a few employees there. All the staff was very friendly but the actual server who took our order was a little forgetful / slow. She may have just been busy serving the rest of the bar. However, it was still a positive experience and I will be back.
