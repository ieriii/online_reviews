Seriously, how much meat can a person eat in one meal?  I found the salad bar was a lot better than anticipated. There were plenty of items on there that would make a person happy without ordering the meat parade. I found the meat parade to be overrated. All the "prime" meats were barely around and the less popular meats kept making an appearance over and over again. The gauchos were very friendly and I give them 5 stars but the food - meh. I found most everything to be way too salty. I like my salt and usually not sensitive to it but everything was salty and I found most of the meat to taste very similar. We used a coupon and still ended up spending over a C note. On after thought, I think I will just get the salad bar or skip the place all together and go to a Korean BBQ. Also, to whoever thinks this place is a great date place - whattcha smoking? After eating your weight in meat, a girl does not feel sexy and your chances of getting some decline greatly!
