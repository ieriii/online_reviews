How cute was this hotel!? Way cute. My boyfriend said we would be staying at his buddy James' place and then checked us in here lol SURPRISE :) Clean modern look, Green, Friendly staff, great location! Nothing bad to say about my stay here at all. I wish I could have taken the bathroom and the bed home with me. SO comfy! Everyone was so accommodating here. The beeeeeeds! and the large mirror next to the bed;) We enjoyed our stay here big time.
