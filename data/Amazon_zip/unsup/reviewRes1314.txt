There's not too much to add about the flavor of hot dogs or the duck fat fries. Yes, they are tasty & innovative.  However i have something to add about the line. I read here that the line moves fast. I guess fast is a relative term. :) I went yesterday and the line was outside the door on Roscoe - PAST the alley. I thought - 40 min max... I have to warn you - if you find yourself past the alley - you will get your hot-dog in about 2 hours. That's how long it took me. Now the question is - how bad you really want you dog.
