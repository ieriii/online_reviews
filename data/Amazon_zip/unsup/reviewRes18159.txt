This place hates fun. Since the servers can't handle being servers, there is a group limit. Too many people = fun, therefore it is not allowed. We were also continuously reminded of this fact, one might say even policed. The fun police. Even told two people in our group they weren't allowed in the ROOM we were in. Additionally I wasn't impressed by the food. I just ate it and already forgot what I had, once it finally arrived. I tried to flavor the dry burger with ketchup only to discover some sort of thick boring, marinara or something. Yuck. I also prefer crappy name brand beer and they don't have that shit. No fun.
