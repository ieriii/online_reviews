I'm surprised this place has gotten some poor reviews. My group and I came for a convention and checked in with relative ease. The staff was courteous. Granted, the check in was in a corner but I felt like this hotel in its entirety had a unique modern feel to it. (There was complimentary drinks at the checkin although non-alcoholic) The rooms themselves were not all set up the same although had same features. The bathroom was modern, not spectacular, but definitely nice. I LOVED the large flatscreen that was in every room. Just imagine modern beds, desks, bathrooms, ect. Hell you can even buy half the stuff in their catalog. On my visit there was a plate of cheese and stuff. (it had a card with a different name on it but hey, we were hungry) The concierge is amazing. Needed some mouthwash. They stated they didn't have any. Guy came up. Gave him a dollar. Went to shower. Came out and saw a bottle of mouthwash sitting there with the $4.95 sticker still on it. This guy went to buy mouthwash that cost more than what I gave him! We got there late, wanted to buy some beer but was told the liquor store was closed. They sent up 2 complimentary coronas. Service was amazing. Room service was good. ( i was kinda buzzed tho so that may have thrown my palate off a bit) Concierge was top notch. Had a bill dispute hence the 4 stars. (bottle of wine was charged to our room although there wasn't a bottle there when we had arrived.) I would definitely stay again. Even just to ride in their elevators with the 3d thing that trips you out.
