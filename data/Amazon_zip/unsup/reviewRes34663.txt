i had heard about sultan's before i moved to the city. i tried the falafel sandwich (naturally) soon after moving and was in love. i would go there randomly for that. since then, i have tried much more, and i can say that everything this place makes is simply wonderful. the lamb shawarma is AMAZING. hummus is perfect. and their falafel is hands down the best i or anyone i know has ever had. everyone knows that this is a staple of chicago food. eat falafel.
