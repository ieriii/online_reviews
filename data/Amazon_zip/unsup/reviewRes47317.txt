Went there for lunch with a group of four and every one of us left happy and full. One of the best spicy bloody marys that I have ever had, not to mention the beer list was another positive addition to the menu. We all ordered different entrees, build your own mac & cheese, salad and a few burgers. The portions were quite generous and the food was delicious!!!
