Finally made it in!!! I have tried to go to Hot Doug's for um... 3 years? Apparently each time I had the idea to go, about 50 other people did too and the line was ridiculous! I didn't even get out of my car those times; I just kept on driving. But this one lucky day... on a Tuesday at 2:30pm... there were only 8 people in line. I don't eat beef or pork (don't judge), so I ordered one of the many chicken dogs and fries. Delicious! I think it would have been a 5 star experience if I tried one of the dogs they are really known for, but I will extrapolate and say, "it's all good!" Anyway, some advice for your trip to Hot Doug's: 1) Don't go on a weekend - unless you really, really want duckfat fries (only served on Friday/Saturday) 2) Avoid normal meal times - you will be hungry and angry and tired wayyy before you get a hot dog. 12pm is an awful time to go, even on a weekday. 3) If it's nice out, the line will most definitely be longer. Snow doesn't necessarily make the line shorter though. 4) Maximize your experience by ordering a lot. You never know when you might get back in... 5) And apparently order corn dogs 6) Bring yo' cash monies Enjoy :)
