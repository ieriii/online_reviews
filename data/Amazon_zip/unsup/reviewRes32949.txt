Went for breakfast with teen daughters...ordered red velvet french toast, peach struessel crepes, santa fe frittatta with cilantro, jalapenos, and avocado, and of course eggs benedict.  All food was amazing, fresh, delicious and served in large portions with a smile...where else can you get a large glass of fresh squeezed orange juice these days. About $85 with tip for 2 adults, 2 teenagers and a tween. Worth every penny, best breakfast in recent memory, great atmosphere and great location.
