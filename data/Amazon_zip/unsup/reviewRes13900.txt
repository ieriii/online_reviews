The first time I attempted to eat here, I came to late. I was irritated because the website did not connotate when the kitchen closed. Any whom, when i did manage to make it back here for lunch with a girlfriend. I was pleased with the rosie the rivitor beer and mussels, the cheddar soup wasn't too bad either. Second time, I drug my boyfriend back. The wings...oh the wings!!! they were so good. I had a pizza with some rappini on it and it was tasty too. The atmosphere was good, but i wish they had some out door seating but, c'est la vie in the city. Bottom Line: Tasty food, delish beer. Looking forward to many more evenings swilling the fine beer!
