With nearly 500 reviews of this place i will keep this short. The pizza is excellent. It is the thin Neapolitan style pizza with minimal, high quality ingredients. The white pizza can be a little oily, but is also really tasty if you feel like being adventurous. If you are a large person, one pizza goes down really easily, so get an appetizer. Make a reservation so you don't have to wait. Outside is first come first serve. The pizza isn't cheap, but it also isn't outrageous. This is in the top five of Chicago's Neapolitan style pizza. If you haven't been, it's worth trying. I will certainly go back.
