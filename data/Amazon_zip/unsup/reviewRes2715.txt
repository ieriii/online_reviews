Tru is truly a fine dining experience. The high cielings, widely-spread tables, and approximate room for 15 parties in the whole restaurant quickly reminds you that you are in a city where space isn't so limited. The Gold Coast location with highly attentive service quickly reminds you just how great dining can be in Chicago. We both had the chef's tasting menus - there are 2 or 3 options, but go for the splurge. Cucumber gelatin... a cold soup (and I'm not usually a fan, but this one was great!)... foie gras... oh my gosh, the list is endless. My ultimate favorite was the smoked halibut made to resemble a small tin of caviar eggs -- this was creativity at its ultimate best. We also loved the cheese course, it was so much fun: lots of amazing cheese to pick from, a fig-based marmalade, yummy honey. And then for dessert you get a gamut of everything (as if you have saved room for anything else)! We had some fumbles in our service (forgot to bring napkins, brought our neighbors dish that was incorrect, some errors in plating) ... but nothing to alter or ruin our meal. All in all we are glad to have had the Tru experience. A TRU 5-star joint.
