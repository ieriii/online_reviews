The atmosphere intimidated me at first and I'll be honest, I made assumptions, that a "supper club" style Lettuce Entertain You restaurant in downtown Chicago would fail my expectations and needs, but in the six years my family has been coming to Wildfire, it has always fed us well and without issue. The restaurant is a touch loud and yes, as others have mentioned, it does have a spooky corporate glow... but I have been able to eat a very nice, seemingly fresh meal catered to my specifications every single time we have come here. Even when I was on a diet where I could only eat fish and veggies, I happily ate their cedar-planked salmon and veggies all the way to yumtown. They have a very nice gluten-free menu, especially for meat eaters, but those of you who get by with the occasional fish dish will be exceptionally pleased with their offerings. The fish is dee-lish! The chicken chopped salad always makes the whole table happy and the staff always prepares it for us with everything on the side (for one kosher, one lactose-free and one gluten-free diner). This is a little pricier than your everyday meal out on the town, but great for special family occasions, out of town visitors, and those nights when you (you celiac) want to eat downtown without questioning everything placed before you. I'll admit, I love Wildfire.
