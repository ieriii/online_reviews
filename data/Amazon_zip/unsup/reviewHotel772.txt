Dated exterior but conveniently close to the Mag mile and the Hancock, this was the hotel I stayed at in July 2006 for the Gay Games. Inside was OK. Probably your usual Westin decor. Loud busy bar that I did not have a chance to try. Beds were very nice and plush. Room was poorly insulated from noise and I could hear some family yammering in Spanish either below or next to us. I expected better for a Westin. They also lied and said they would credit my Starwood account with points they missed but the credit never showed.  I always wanted to stay here and am glad that's now done and over with.
