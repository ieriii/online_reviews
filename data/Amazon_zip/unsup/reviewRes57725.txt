This Place is Awesome.My wife and I came down town to spend the night and we decided to check this little cafe out since we were staying only a half a block away.What a surprise the food was great . Everything was fresh, very tasty with outstanding service to boot. The owner came around and asked us if we needed anythingThe prices were very reasonable and the portions very generous.We enjoyed it so much we went back in the morning to try their breakfast menu and it was just as good and our dinner the night before.What a great find. I recommend it for 10 stars. Five stars does not do it justice.Dave R. Elm wood Pk IL
