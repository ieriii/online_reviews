This restaurant ROCKS! We are picky, obnoxious diners and we loved this place. The food was amazing, the drinks were amazing and the atmosphere was perfect. We will come back every time we are in Chicago. Great job. The beef appetizer rolled in cellaphane noodles was the best! Oh yeah the service rocked the house too. We were not in a hurry in Chicago for a romantic couple of days, wanted to take our time and our waiter was totally cool about the whole thing. GREAT RESTAURANT!!! We will be back
