For the particular area, this is a great palce to get a bite. Being out in the burbs, it's nice since I'm typically driving past this to get some breakfast after a night or weekend in the city. As any breakfast place in the city on the weekend, the wait can get a little long, or it can just be down right busy. That can be a lot of fun if your in the mood, or annoying if your lookin for something a little slower paced or less noisy. Their execution is impressive. Every base of breakfast is is put together with effort and care. If your on your way out of the city, checking out Grant Park or Mag Mile, this is a place you can feel confident that you'll leave satisfie.
