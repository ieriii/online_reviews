So, I brought 2 of my friends there yesterday to get an after work drink. we got there the place was almost empty except for the bar. I asked if we could have a table as there were not three seats together at the bar and the hostess told me no. NO?!?! She said maybe I could ask one of the bar patrons to move down. Excuse me, but isn't that your job? One of the bar patrons overheard the conversation and offered generously to give up his seat so we could sit together. When we left, the hostess didn't even acknowledge us. I can say that we were not really made to feel welcome by the hostess. When I go out I'm looking for a total experience and Longman really fell short on customer service.
