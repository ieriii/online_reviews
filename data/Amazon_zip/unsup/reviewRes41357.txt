Never a bad meal here, I've been to Ruth's Chris about 5 times (Chicago & Ft Worth, TX). Love the steaks and the sizzling 500 degree plates (which I always touch and burn myself because I always forget). The melted butter sizzling on top is awesome. They currently have a 3 course price fixed menu at 2 price points - $39.95 and $49.95. I think this is a great option because you get a salad/soup, decently sized entree, one side dish, and the dessert.  I just went tonight for dinner and had the 3 course $39.95 menu and had the steak house salad (nothing special), but the blue cheese dressing is delicious! I got the 6 oz filet + shrimp for my entree. It looked tiny when it came out, but it was super thick, about 2". I got the sauteed mushrooms (nothing special) and my date got the mashed potatoes and the ribeye. ($49.95). We added on the sweet potato casserole - ALWAYS get the sweet potato casserole!!! Though they put too much topping on, I wanted more potato and less casserole. They only have one dessert with the fixed price menu - a small serving of chocolate mousse and a small serving of berries & sweet cream on the same platter. I thought both were very good, but there should have been more berries. Service was very good - bus boys used the crumber to clean up the mess! I love places that use crumbers! We only had water, and our check after tax (not including tip) was only $110! Not bad for 3 courses plus a side dish! Highly recommended even without the fixed price menu (but how can you pass it up???) But this is really a special occasion place since it's so pricey.
