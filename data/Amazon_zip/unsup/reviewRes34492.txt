The usual breakfast and brunch fair, nothing really all that unique to rave about. Unless by unique you mean a 2 hour wait...yes, I'm serious. This b*tch will be CRAZY busy early and on 'off' days it still pretty packed. I've decided to eat there 3 times. First time = hour + twenty minute wait, which they were honest about so I can't fault them. I live REAL close so it was a convenience thing. Second time, quoted an hour wait, and didn't want to wait. So we went elsewhere. 3rd time, we walked right in and were seated! It was magical. The food is made well and they seem to used quality ingredients. It's a tad bit pricey, but not horrible for anyone looking stay around 10 bucks a person (without coffee, coffee is close to 3 dollars there). I can't stress this enough: since I live so close I see the place in action often-- definitely call ahead to see the wait time.
