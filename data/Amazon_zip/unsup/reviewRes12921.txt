Three words...MEAT MEAT MEAT!!! The place for you if you want to drown your craving of meat. Totally awesome experience, great atmosphere, fast service, clean, food is great and you even get to see a cute girl dangling from the rafters a la Cirque du Soleil fetching wine from a wall for the patrons. One place I will definitely go back to when I am in Chicago again or if I see another one in another city.
