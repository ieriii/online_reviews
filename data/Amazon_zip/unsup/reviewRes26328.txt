5 Star for food and decor. 1 star taken for quantity. A restaurant for small stomach with a big wallet! This is probably the most RIDICULOUS restaurants Hungry Chicago has ever been to out of the 90 restaurants in Chicago in terms of quantity of food and price proportion. A tilapia that is smaller than half of your palm is $17. Five thin slices of duck is (size of your thumb/slice) is $16. All the dishes are ridiculously small. We have been there twice, and every time we saw people's eyes popping out when they saw the dishes. One couple sitting next to us actually ordered 3 dishes and only finished half of their think sliced steak plate, which is priced $48. We peaked at their bill and it's about $161. SO I am sure there are people appreciating the concept of "fine dining" in the Mercat way. Of course, here is not the place to get full. It's just for an experience or small eats. If you want to impress your date with your wallet, here is the place to go. The atmosphere is unbelievably amazing, very modern, luxurious, classy and sexy!
