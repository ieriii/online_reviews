First of all, you can't walk past this restaurant without the scent of Ethiopian food slipping out the door like a cartoon hand and waving you inside. And in my experience, if it smells great, it tastes even better. The dishes at Demera don't disappoint. It's best to go with a friend (or several) and order family style, so you can sample as many dishes as possible. Be prepared to get messy. You use the spongy injera to pinch from the well-spiced piles of meat or vegetables that come served on a large platter. The less adventurous or the germaphobes in the crowd can order single entrees and use utensils, but you'd be missing out on a crucial part of the dining experience! Go, stuff your face, and leave happy. Just don't expect the service to match the food. I've rarely had a server who so much as smiled at me, and the staff often appears put out by having to do their jobs.
