Recommended by a friend to come, I decided to try to fit it in on my next visit home to Madison. Clearly if it was good enough for her to fly from New York to Chicago just for one meal, I needed to try this place for myself. After calling over 200 times in 45 minutes before finally getting a ring tone, I finally was able to make my long awaited reservation. Mind you this was at the beginning of December, my reservation was for February. Having not been home in almost two years, I lured my extremely Asian parents (meaning their idea of a fancy dinner is a meal at Olive Garden, anything beyond that is unnecessary) here on the basis of it being my baby sister's birthday. They began our meal by greeting us and wishing my sister a happy birthday. Although their names escape me now, the waiters we had were all great. I was a little worried at the beginning about the stuffiness, but they warmed up, were funny and definitely added some wittiness to each dish. They also set aside a special dish for the birthday girl, a creative dessert involving the unwrapping of a present and chocolate and warm cream? which she thoroughly enjoyed. The meal was spectacular and even my parents thought so (WINNN!). Everything was clearly incredibly well thought out and without a doubt, an experience unlike any other. The highlights of the meal were the Yuba, King Crab, Wild Mushrooms, Hot Potato and Dark Chocolate. The only thing I did not enjoy was the Oyster Leaf, the fishiness of it was really unpleasant although I do understand what they were aiming for. The price is quite steep as would be expected but in my mind well worth it. Dinner at Alinea is an adventure anyone with even the slightest appreciation for food should experience.
