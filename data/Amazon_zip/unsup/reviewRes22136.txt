Just went here a couple hours ago for an early dinner with my husband and we loooooved it. My hairstylist recommended this place and she was right. They start you off with these fresh chips with their spicy good green salsa. Then we shared an spinach and cheese empanada. For an entree, we both got the tilapia casado. I also had their passion fruit smoothie and my husband got the Jamaican hibiscus ice tea. I can't wait to come back to this place and try their meats after lent :)
