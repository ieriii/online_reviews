this place swiftly serves up the most delicious falafel sandwich i have ever had the privilege of eating. a fresh, large-and-in-charge pita holds piping hot falafel (green and soft on the inside, crispy and browned on the outside), delightfully crunchy and cool veggies, a spicy sauce, and creamy hummus. i had the medium and can't wait to try it spicy. it is also a ridiculous bargain at $3.75!
