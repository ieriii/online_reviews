Last night I went to piece for the first time. I guess I wasn't as impressed as I thought I would be. The service was good and the salad was good, but the pizza wasn't all that. I guess I prefer a different style of dough, so it could be me. I would much rather eat at Coal Fire or any other pizza place than Piece. I guess if you want to watch the baseball game and drink beer it is the perfect spot. The music is loud and there are TVs everywhere, so it's a party atmosphere. The white pizza was kind of greasy and the Plain was good because of the garlic.
