Our friend had been dropping Nuevo Leon into conversations for months. So before we even set foot in the place, in our minds, it was already legendary. And for good reason. BYOB always makes the check much easier to stomach...but the food...WOW. For incredibly reasonable prices, you will be stuffed in your favorite Mexican-food-coma sort of way. The tortas were made with so much love. The real show-stopper was the carne asada. A quick glace around the restaurant and you'll quickly notice it's the bomb--it seemed like every table had it. It was our server's recommendation and, while I think my husband was a wee bit disappointed the recommendation wasn't more daring, he was completely enamored by the dish. In summary, fantastic authentic Mexican--and it's a steal.
