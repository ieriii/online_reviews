Walking into Carnivale is like walking into a kaleidoscope of colours created by the remnants of 100 doomed clowns trapped in an exploding Mini Coop. Oh, and you are on LSD. But this is a good thing! Really!! I thrive in the vibrant, [needless to say] "colourful" ambiance of the place. It kinda reminded me of a Skittles (taste the rainbow) commercial, but what can I say? I love Skittles. And maybe I'm one of the few people who actually appreciates the fact that it can get "loud" as people talk, drink, and laugh... it's somewhat invigorating, and gives me the feeling that people are having a good time! I have eaten here quite a few times, bringing out of town guests, and for birthday celebrations. I've always had good service at this place, and I guess I've been lucky given the reviews others have written. The food is good, though not phenomenal. But since it's not outrageously priced, I'm okay with it, though I would still rather go to a hole-in-the-wall when I'm looking for authentic Latin American cuisine. As some of the reviewers noted, the drinks are on the weak side. HOWEVER, I want to bring special attention to the Horchatatinis - oh my goodness! I *love* the idea of turning one of my favorite Mexican drinks (rice milk, sugar and cinnamon - or as some of us jokingly call it "dirty rice water" ;) into a martini! I recommend it to people all the time, and I have had no complains about it... yet...
