We stayed here for a wedding in the same hotel. Not only was the wedding itself amazing, but the accommodations were great! Every person we met who worked at the hotel was helpful and friendly. The room was comfortable, clean and surprisingly quiet. We faced the river and the Metra station - I thought it would be loud, but it wasn't at all. The views are the real winner here. It was a picture each time you looked out the window. The pool was big and my kids made sure we stopped there daily. The restaurant had a great menu with some excellent french fries! We enjoyed the lunch/dinner menus. We had breakfast there a couple of times. The buffet was ok - but I preferred to order off the menu. The pancakes were great! I'm a big fan of the hotel bar. It was a little pricey - but worth the location!! I can't wait to stay there again!
