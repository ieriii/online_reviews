I've been here on a once-a-year basis or so--usually when a vege/vegan friend from out of town wants to go to lunch and I want to impress them with the Chicago restaurant scene. It's hip, green, and makes you feel good about what you're eating. But as a meat-eater with no special dietary needs, I'm always left with a slightly raised eyebrow. "mmmm...that tastes good...but it would be better if it were real." So if you're vegan, this place is going to blow your mind. But everyone else you dine with will just be happy for you, and not so much with their food.
