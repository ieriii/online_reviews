We've eaten here so many times, I thought it time for an update. The ingredients are always quality, but some combinations work better than others. It all tastes better than your standard quickie delivery, but if you're having trouble imagining how it would taste, best to skip it. My wife says the BBQ Chicken is the best she's eaten. I will trust her on that. Like so many small Chicago places, I'm blown away by the customer service. You'd think by now my West Coast expectations would be behind me, but when the manager of FoGo called to correct a mis-charge I didn't even catch -- I'm still amazed.
