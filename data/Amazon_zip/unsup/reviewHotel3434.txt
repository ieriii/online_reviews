+ on the magnificent mile + entrance newly refurbished, very nice + comfortable beds + l'occitane products in the bathrooms (including huge chunks of soap.. we stole many off maid carts...) + the rooms are decorated really nicely + huge, flat screen tv + pretty quiet + they provide maid service everyday but you have the option of not sending your linens everyday to cleaned (go earth!) - the elevators are quite small, shake when they go fast and take a long time to respond to the button push -- not only that but they magically stop at practically every floor .. but no one is waiting..( i have an elevator phobia -- so this might not be such a problem for non-crazies) - very close to Northwestern hospital so lots of ambulance noise - the rooms are pretty small as is the bathroom -- doesn't bother me too much but some people might need more roamin' space - no free wi-fi in the rooms, only in the bar area, but you can get it from the hotel next door...
