My friend wanted to try Chicago pizza and Giordano's was right across the street so we went for it. I was way too stuffed from the million other things I ate already so I just accompanied her as she waited in an atrocious line filled with people who were waiting to order. When we first got there, there were hoards of people standing in front and since we've never been there before, we were a little confused about what to do. We then figured out that they were standing in a line to pre-order, so basically they'll make your pizza while you wait for a table. Genius! My friend got an individual pepperoni pizza and just got take-out since we were on our way to Millennium Park and we thought it would be a good idea to sit in the park and eat it there. The pizza took about 20 minutes to make and then we were on our way. When we arrived at the park, we opened the pizza box and at first we were confused. Sauce on top? No signs of pepperoni. Damn it... did they mess up our order?? Upon further inspection of our pizza, we figured out that everything was backwards! Sauce on top, thick layer of cheese in the middle and pepperoni on the bottom. I've never seen anything like it. Overall, I enjoyed it and it was good for a pizza. I wouldn't say that it's the best thing ever, but still good none-the-less.
