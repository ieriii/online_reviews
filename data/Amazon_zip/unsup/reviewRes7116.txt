Nice place to go before a drink or two at one of the many bars near Diversey and Halsted. I took my boyfriend here for his birthday and it was a good experience. The food was good and the service was actually really fast. I was slightly disappointed that we didn't have more time to spend there - I actually felt slightly rushed by the quick service.  The food was delicious and the wine was good (but slightly overpriced for a glass). The restaurant is also nice when they have their front windows open to let in the spring and summer air.
