if I could steer Guy towards one place on triple D, it would be Crisp. Can't go wrong with ANYTHING here. Crisp BBQ wings are solid, but almost too messy. Don't get the strips though, thats cheating. Seoul Sassy wings are as good as it gets as well. Such bold flavors, these guys really go all out. Then there are the buddha bowls...unbelievable. The Original Bad Boy buddha bowl is the go-to here. Not really a "complaint" but they use too much rice, the big issue is that i will eat all the rice until i explode. Recently tried the foodies choice crisp, which is a fried chicken cutlet in whatever sauce you want (i chose BBQ - buffalo may be a good choice next) on a great roll with veggies and bleu cheese. They use spinach leaves instead of shitty shredded lettuce like McDonalds, and cherry tomatoes, not those soggy/flimsy ones you see just about everywhere else. This sandwich is out bounds, you guys. BYOB as well, but kind of difficult to put back some cold ones with the copious amounts of food without exploding. This place isn't perfect though (see the missing star)...open only til 9 which is a bummer, and its not a good place to go to with more than a few people due to limited seating. Second part doesn't really bother me much - don't need a bunch of people i know seeing me with sauce all over myself.
