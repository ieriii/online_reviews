friendly chill atmosphere. seafood omelet is really good and so is the bbq beef in Korean spice. but the short ribs were not very good at all. Wouldn't really call them short ribs, just a slab of bone. authentic grill gives awesome flavor to the meat. a lot of side dish options comes with the bbq, almost overwhelming, but kinda cool to try out different stuff.
