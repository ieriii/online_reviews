I can't get enough of this place!! We ordered the bistec casado and the tinted squid mixed with rice. It couldn't be anymore tasty. When we ordered the tinted squid, the waiter asked if we liked the taste of ocean. HUH?!! We reluctantly said yes, but we now understand what the taste of the ocean is. You must be a true seafood lover to eat this and very used to eating cooked squid. So good! I recommend getting your rice cooked with the beans, such a different take.  Your meal is not complete without ordering an oatmeal shake! Try it mixed with banana, my fav combo.
