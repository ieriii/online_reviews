Went here for the first time with a friend and I absolutely fell in love with The Pasta Bowl!!! I ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo with Shrimp and OMG was the shrimp sooo perfectly cooked! We went around 3ish so it wasn't so busy. Our waiter was really nice and attentive and always had our Iced Teas filled. Oh, & the Iced Tea was REAL good. :) The pasta noodles were cooked so perfectly and the portions weren't super huge, but were the right size. I'm definitely going back to this place. Maybe even tonight if I get out of work early enough. YUMMY!!!!
