On my many adventures around Chicago, I am always on the search for The Perfect Bar. What makes The Perfect Bar (TPB) for me? Cozy, darkly lit room full of laid back people and a kicking bar selection. TPB for me was Deep Ellium in Boston. Is the Hopleaf TPB for me in Chicago? Perhaps, although it is a little far north for true perfection. So what makes the Hopleaf so swell? First off, it is quite excellent for the beer extraordinaire. Many different types of both regional and international beers constantly are changing depending on the season and perhaps mood of the owner. The food is swell as well (yum yum mussels!) served mostly on the pub side of things. Would I come back? Yes, I definitely will! Will it be soon? Perhaps, although the teacher's salary can only go so far in this world. Side note: In order to order, one must go up to the bar. This includes the food service, although food is brought directly to the tables.
