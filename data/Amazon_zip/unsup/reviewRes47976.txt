I'm a little sad that they opened the Morgan Street station near here, because I have even less excuse not to go more. Paul Kahan is a brilliant man to start with, but the atmosphere here alongside the BEST. DAMN. PIECE. OF. MEAT. I've ever put in my mouth make this everything you could possibly want in a dining experience. First, gotta love the snout to tail philosophy here. They use everything they possibly can and treat it with respect and love you can taste. The German alehouse feel is great too, even including long tables where you're seated directly next to other diners. Strike up a conversation with your neighbor, trade favorite suggestions, tips about beers, etc. Speaking of beers, everyone working there is an expert on the drinks they offer. I'm not a huge drinker in general, but they have found me things I'd have never tried otherwise that totally suit my palette. And then... THE. MEAT. Order the Country Ribs. Now. Just do it. It comes out looking like a butterfly cut of pork. It tastes like nothing else. Flavor layered on flavor. Just... incredible. They brine the pork first. Then they marinate it. Then they keep dipping it back in the marinade while they grill it so that it never dries out. Yeah. That thing you're feeling right now? That's hunger. Satisfy it. Also, they are awesome at oysters. Was never a fan before I went here. I had some less than great experiences. This was not those. Really really good stuff. So damn you, CTA, for making my pocketbook lighter. *shakes fist*
