The service here was absolutely awful and I didn't notice anything special about the food. We tried the recommended chili chicken and it was decent. The garlic chicken was pedestrian. Regarding the service, in addition to a very inattentive waiter, my dad ordered orange beef and it took them over an hour and thirty minutes to bring it out. By that time, we were just being passed around various restaurant and waitstaff. The rest of us were done and ready to leave, so my father told them to take the orange beef back and take it off our tab. The chairs were also small, plastic, and uncomfortable.
