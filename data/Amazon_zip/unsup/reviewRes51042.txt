I love Big Jones. It might not be the very best food in the city, but it's always delicious. On top of that they have amazing service, great decor, a strong menu (with lots of vegetarian options) and a focus on fresh, organic and local. Big Jones is a total package. I had one server there who should have been at a 3 diamond restaurant, he knew his stuff. I'd say brunch is their forte, but I've had a number of great dinners too. Came for Valentine's Day and was blown away. The fried green tomatoes are fantastic. Brunch is great, though, because the menu is so unique. They have eggs, bacon, potatoes, pancakes- all your 'usuals' - but the combination and the extra touches make it unique. The Creole cream cheese omelet is incredible, so is the Sally Lune French Toast. Last weekend I had the eggs benedict with fried green tomatoes instead of ham... delicious! Brunch is also much more affordable. At dinner it's so tempting to get a drink, an appetizer, a meal and dessert. It's just all so good. I had one experience at Big Jones that started off bad and ended up making me like them even more. They were understaffed and no one came by after we were seated for a good 20-30 minutes. So what did they do? They apologized profusely (both our waiter and the other one) for the misunderstanding. They we were given 2 free cocktails which were incredible! Then we received amazing service AND a free dessert. As always, the food was amazing. Where else takes services that seriously while still being affordable?
