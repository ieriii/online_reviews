I moved back to Chicago from South Florida about 4 years ago, and in that time have only missed one thing about that godforsaken land - properly prepared Cuban food and coffee. The offerings Chicago has had up until now have not only been disappointing, but borderline offensive (pickles and mustard do not a cubano make!) Not to mention that a few of the existing establishments were banking on the mojito crowd to be forgiving towards their cuisine. I recommend the Lechon sandwich; having tried a handful of items, this is the one I crave continuously. Is it the perfectly tender (and generously portioned) pork? That alone could carry the sandwich, but the sweet plantains are probably the clincher. The garlic sauce is just enough to keep the sandwich moist without being too overwhelming or saucy. This, paired with a frosty can of Ironbeer, is true comfort food. Last note, the owner is amazing. While in the shop last night, a young woman came in to pick up her first ever order from him. He was insistent that, should there be any problems with the food with it being a to-go order and therefore not presented in optimal conditions, she come back the next day to get a refund! Not to mention his charming send-off of "See you tomorrow!" every time you leave. If only I wasn't so busy that I could stop in every morning for a cup of coffee that has me swearing off my previously "Intellegentsia-only" policy! (I'll admit that I've caved on my no-coffee-at-night policy more than once for the awesomely balanced Cafe con Leche.)
