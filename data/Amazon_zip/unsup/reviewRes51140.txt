Awesome place to go for brunch. We waited about 25 minutes on a Saturday which isn't bad. Our server was great. He got our drink order right away and was quick to take our order. He was definitely a pro. I had the spinach omelette with a side of toast and fruit. The omelette was cooked just how I like it-- light and fluffy without much oil (if any at all). I ordered a side of bean cakes and they were great as well. Moist and soft with the perfect amount of spicy kick. You must try some of their freshly squeezed juices while you're there too!
