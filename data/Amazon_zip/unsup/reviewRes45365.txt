Things I love about Wilde: 1. The atmosphere and decor. I love the fireplace, the bookcases, and the comfy chairs. 2. I love the waitstaff and bartenders 3. They have a great beer selection. Any place where I can get a black velvet is great. 4. The Mac and Cheese is wonderful. 5. It isn't too loud or too packed. I went with a few of my girlfriends last night, but have been several times. It is the perfect place to catch up with friends.
