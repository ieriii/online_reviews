Delicious food, great decor, and friendly staff. Their outside seating is awesome. I would agree with another reviewer about the group seating situation. We had reservations for a group of 12, and she made us wait until almost everyone was there. This forced us to wait an extra 45 minutes while the stragglers arrived, all while the table sat empty. It seemed like a lose-lose situation to us. We could have been ordering apps and drinks. Otherwise, I would definitely recommend it for a nice night out.
