This is a tough review as I have been to Shaw's before and had a totally different experience. Shaw's has a nice dinning area to one side of the building and more of a coffee shop (for lack of better terminology) to the other side. The coffee shop pretty much has the same menu. Although I previously ate in the dinning area before, this time I was in shorts and flip flops so opted for the coffee shop this time around.. To start, I waited a good 10 minutes before anybody came by (i.e. no water, bread.. a "hello".. nada).. Waiter comes by, pours enough water in my 8oz glass to fill a 16 oz glass, the result-- yeah, water everywhere. He takes a dirty rag wipes the water off the table and walks away, leaving a soaking napkin. I kinda look at him like "are you serious??" I finally get menu and settle on the tuna rolls for appetizer. Pretty standard, but good. Different waiter literally drops plate on the table and slaps down the tray to fill with soy sauce... I'm like, OK.. do I have a "Hi I'm From Out Of Town, Treat Me Like A Dick" sticker on my back?  I'm like whatever.. I proceed to order the scallops, and again the food is good.. actually the scallops were very good 5-6 good sized scallops with a garlic sauce a little spinach and some house rice which includes tiny shrimp... BUT, oh yeah, yet again, the plate was basically thrown in front of me... I was so annoyed, pretty much didn't care at this point as I would express my feelings with the appropriate tip amount.. Again, this was my second time here, first time in the dining area was phenominal, both food and service.. my recommendation stick to the dinning side and you will really like Shaw's... if not, enter at your own risk- I would suggest a bib and alot of patience!!!
