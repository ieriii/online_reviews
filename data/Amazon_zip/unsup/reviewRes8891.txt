I would have to rate this as the best pizza place in Chicago. The unique brick oven they use makes a huge impact on the pizza they produce. It is almost a healthier version of pizza without all of the grease. I do recommend the more basic pizzas you go for the better they are. When I ate there we ordered a Margherita Pizza and a prosciutto and arugula pizza. I came to the conclusion the fancier pizzas they have on the menu, which are also more expensive are not worth your buck. Stick to the Margheretia it is phenomenal.
