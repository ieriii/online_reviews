I went to Bin School last night, and I have to say, I am a MUCH bigger fan of Bin 36 now. I took Wine 101, in which a very seasoned wine veteran taught us the basics of smelling, tasting, making, EVERYTHING about wine. It was sooo informative. I'm one of those people that's like "You know what, I really like wine, but I know nothing about it." And this class is totally worth your while. $36 gets you about a 2-3 hour instruction, probably tasting about 8-10 wines with explanations about them. Q and A at the end of the session. A really fun teacher. And 10% off any bottles of wine upon your departure. I definitely learned a lot and I thought it was a super good value. I was expecting an hour class or something like that. But I learned a lot about how to taste wine and what to pair it with food wise. I'd definitely be interested in more classes. It was well worth it.
