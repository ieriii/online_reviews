Great food. Love the shrimp and hot chicken on a slate (not the actual menu name). Looks like chimichurri but it wasn't. Delicious!! Bad side were the stools at group tables. No place to put your feet. After a while my back was killing me. Later on, music was too loud. Okay for small group, but unable to communicate with a large group.But the food was unbeatable. Pricey, but tasty.
