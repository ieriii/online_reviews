I am so late on this one. Went a couple of Fridays past, but I am still thinking about this place. I only have two reasons why: Strawberry Fields (cocktail) Oh no you didn't (sushi) I can't really recommend anything else. I can really go back and have a seat at the bar to enjoy the sushi and cocktails. I had the Blue Crab Longevity noodles for an entree and the texture of the dish was off. I am used to pasta being heavy and not fluffy. This pasta was a little fluffy. You would have to get it in order to understand what I am talking about. Beautiful space! Oh yeah dessert.........yeah...... no! My friends thought it would be good to order tofu cheesecake. Not great but not bad. They also decided to order some sort of avocado mousse dessert. Yeah......NO!!! it was a hot mess. That turned me off completely, and it was time to go.
