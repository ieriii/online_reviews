A great deal for your money. The Pho is great and is certainly a treat for your tongue. (Warning: vegetarians stay away from the pho). While a huge bowl of soup is not quite my th-ang... I do love their BBQ pork vermicelli! This is a great budget option, which offers deliciously cooked meat, slightly sweet rice, and great sides. Overall, an A- dish. But what is a trip to Tank Noodle without getting a bubble-tea? I basically grew up on these drinks. I give big thumbs-up to the Avocado and blueberry bubbletea (not on the menu, just ask for that combo and you'll be SURPRISED!). I like to come here occasionally for their quick service, good food, and great budget menu.
