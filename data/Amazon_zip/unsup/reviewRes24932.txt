If you haven't been to Irazu, what are you waiting for? Irazu is a unique, wonderful place. While it is rather small inside, they have great outdoor seating during the warmer months and their food is sure not to disappoint. I would highly recommend the Chicken & Rice. Order it extra spicy (if you like spicy things). It is beyond fantastic and not only will leave you full, but ensure that you have extra to take home. And while their portions are more than enough, don't overlook the oatmeal shake. Oatmeal Shake?? Yes, it may sound a bit strange, but try it!! It is unlike any drink I've ever had before and beyond memorable. Yum!
