First off, let me say after reading the reviews, I was VERY skeptical of coming here for the first time. The only reason we made reservations was because of a Buy 1 Get 1 in the Inside Chicago booklet. We went on a Tuesday night so it was pretty empty - which meant, we had ALL the attention in the world by the servers and the gauchos. Everyone was really nice - the only thing was our server seemed a little nervous - maybe he was new? who knows. The salad bar had a really big selection - tried a little bit of everything. Loved the pasta salads and the cold cuts. The hot bar was even better - Mushroom risotto and cheese tortellini - fantastic. and the light as air bread that is served with your meal! yumm!!! The Meats - I'm usually not a beef gal but that's all I had. I like medium rare cuts so it worked out pretty well and I was TERRIFIED of getting food poisoning as mentioned in other reviews, but that night and a day later and I AM TOTALLY FINE! full and feeling like a fatty but all good! I don't remember the names of anything but the steak/ prime/ rib eye just melts in your mouth. The chicken was really juicy too with a crispness to the outside skin. The dessert selection was wonderful! They have a little bit of everything for everyone. We got the creme brulee which was nice with the caramelized bananas or strawberries on top and then chocolate layer on the bottom. I'm sure had we come on a weekend night, things wouldve been different. Probably less attention overall but all in all, we had a FABULOUS time and I would recommend it!
