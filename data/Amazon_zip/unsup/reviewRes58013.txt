My food was great, it was a chicken with prosciutto and a pasta with a garlic sause. My girlfriend's pasta dumplings in pesto was a bit overcooked and needed more flavor. I was expecting a more romantic ambiance from the reviews, but it was really loud and not romantic at all. The waiter was very attentive which was good and gave us a complimentary desert and liquor drink for my girlfriend's birthday which was very nice.
