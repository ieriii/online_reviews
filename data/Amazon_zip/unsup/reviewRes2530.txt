OMG so freakin good!!!! i've been going to Hot Doug's since high school..... and i go at least once every two to three weeks. Its just so darn good. i have tried nearly everything on the menu and while everything is deliscious.. sometimes i just love the regular chicago style hot dog... with cheese fries. plain and simple. doug is great... and justin is awesome too!! :)
