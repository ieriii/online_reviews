I absolutely loved this place. Stylish but not pretentious, everyone is welcome as long as you follow their house rules.  We sat at the bar and marveled at all of the drinks being prepared. It was very difficult to decide what to try! I wound up having a 23 Skidoo and a Blackberry Caipirissima. (We were there before they switched to the Fall menu.). They were both in the rum section of the menu but couldn't have been more different. The Caiprissima, with Flor de Cana 4 year, blackberries, demerara syrup and Briottet Creme de Muir, is the kind of drink that's right up my alley. It was light and refreshing, a drink you'd be happy to sip on poolside. The 23 Skidoo had Zacapa 23, Ramazzotti Amaro, El Dorado 5 year, demarara syrup and Peychaud's bitters and was totally out of my comfort zone. It was strong and masculine, something I wouldn't ordinarily order. That's the nice thing about their menu: all of the cocktails are $12 so you can just pick whichever cocktail sounds good and have fun. Of course, if you don't want to take your chances, the staff is more than willing to discuss your likes and dislikes and make recommendations. I love the decor and the seating. It's a great place for a date or a small gathering of friends. It is quite dark inside with no windows which really adds to the atmosphere. It's like being in the casinos in Vegas...you can lose all sense of time! Sadly, our time at the Velvet Hour came to an end all too early due to dinner reservations. Rest assured next time we're in town we'll be back.
