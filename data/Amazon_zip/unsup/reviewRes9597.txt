Two ways to dine: $60 for a 3-course plus 2 intermezzos, or you can dine a la carte from the selections on the menu. I loved the satisfying portion sizes -- enough to share with your companions (so order different things and make your own tasting menu).  More than the portion sizes, I loved the surprises of the flavor profiles. The dishes were inspired and inventive -- who knew that black cod, celery greens, turnip, and thinly-shaved pickles would go together so well (and, oh, they do!)? Open your mind and enjoy the unusual combinations.  As Sprout focuses on sustainable proteins and organic produce, the menu is seasonal, so watch out that you don't read a review here and set your heart on that item. Our server was attentive but not intrusive and had excellent input for us when we had questions or asked for recommendations. For those who felt ignored, I hope they give it another go -- I had an amazing evening on all levels. It's definitely a special occasion place, as the pricing is high-end, but that said, $60 for a full meal at such a place is more than reasonable.
