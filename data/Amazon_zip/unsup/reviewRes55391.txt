you want to experiment with ethnic food? Go here. Dont go anywhere else. Never mind what other people say. they dont know. I know. I have been to every persian restaurant in the states worth mentioning. And i am persian. EVERYTHING is good here. I suggest the barg kabob or joojeh. Get dill rice. I don't know why everybody raves about other places rice being good. Indian and Asian rice is not good. Persian rice is rice. Everything else tastes like some kind of bile that was extracted from a pigeons cadaver. Finish off with the Bamieh and some Tea. Dont bother with anything else. Im telling you.
