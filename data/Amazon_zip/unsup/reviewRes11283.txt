Hands down my favorite pizza in Chicago. This may be blasphemy, but I'm not a big fan of deep dish. The crust here is perfectly thin and crispy and the toppings are perfectly doled out--not too much, not too little. And so many types of beer available! Even better now since they deliver and I don't have to wait in that crazy long line!
