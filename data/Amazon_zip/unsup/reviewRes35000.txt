LOVED IT!!!! I am not a big fan of sushi, so when my friends suggested sushi for dinner one evening, I was a little hesitant to go. But, I am so glad I did!!! The building is nondescript from the outside, which is awesome. It's one of those places you need to know about to find, which I love. The restaurant is BYOB, which helps keep the bill WAY down!! The space inside is small and very cute. The service was amazing. I believe we had one of the owners waiting on us that evening. Originally, I had ordered the gyoza which was one of the NON sushi items on the menu. After discussing my feelings towards sushi, the waitress/owner suggested that I tell her what I like and didn't like about sushi, and that the chef would whip something up for me. The rolls that the chef made, were AMAZING!!!!! Made me reconsider my thoughts towards sushi!!! Can't wait to go back!!!!
