Two weeks ago my sister and I brought our mom in for dinner to celebrate her 65th birthday and the staff truly made it an exceptional evening. My standards are pretty high for customer service and every person we interacted with truly went above and beyond. The food was delicious (meat and salad bar were both AMAZING) and we left happy, no longer hungry (to say the least!) and with great memories for a special day. I highly recommend coming here! Thank you, Fogo de Chao!
