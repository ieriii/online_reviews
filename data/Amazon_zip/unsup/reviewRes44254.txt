When it comes to fresh fish at fair prices in a fun atmosphere, this place does the job with grace. They are oddly stingy with the ginger, but the quality of that is always stunning. They don't take reservations, which I hate. And they usually have a line, which everyone hates, but at least the boys and girls are cute....but the drunk ones - please SHUT UP.
