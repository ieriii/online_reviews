Maybe I'm getting older and digestion is not quite as seamless as it once was, but these days I feel pretty gross after the ultra-greasy, ultra-salty Sun Wah meat. Also, the last time I went in I had lunch alone and was told I couldn't pay with a debit card since I hadn't reached their $14 minimum. I thought this just applied to take-out. Since there is no ATM on site I had to leave and go to an ATM at a nearby location (somewhat annoying), but the server forced me to leave my driver's license as collateral for a $6 bill. That seems pretty tacky.
