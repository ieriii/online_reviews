So, this place is like The Cheesecake Factory's cousin. Same chain I believe. And major resemblance as well! Excellent location, right off the Magnificent Mile... Great view while enjoying a scrumptious dinner. Sooothing atmosphere.. Perfect for a quiet dinner. The decor is definitely modern, yet elegant... Their Martinis are amazing... Dinner- delicious. In specific, the Pasta with Jumbo Shrimp and their Pasta Carbonara. As well as their gourmet sandwiches. The Baked-to-Order desserts- amazing! The New Orleans Beignets were stellar! Just make sure to make room for this dessert if you do decide to order it, as it is a very generous portion... Buut Its definitely worth it. Now, it can get crowded, especially on Friday and Saturday nights... As long as its not a ridiculous wait, I dont mind it as long as I have a French Martini in my hand.
