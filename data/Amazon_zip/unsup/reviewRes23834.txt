Irazu is possibly my favorite restaurant in Chicago. My wife and I tend to suggest this restaurant towards the top of the list whenever anyone asks for recommendations, or whenever we have friends coming through town. The people that run the place are extremely warm and friendly and the food is delicious. In fact I've gone here so many times that the guy who seems to run the place always takes a moment to thank me for my business. I'm a huge fan of the Pepito sandwich and the Oatmeal shakes--if I ever were to move away from Chicago, I'd miss these things right up there with going to Cubs games and that one week in September when the weather doesn't suck in Chicago.  In summation, if you don't like Irazu you are probably a jerk.
