My favorite restaurant in all of Chicago. Nothing makes a Sunday better than a Temperature Soup, Old Hickory Chicken Sandwich and a walk across the street to the Lincoln Park Zoo. Other highlights: side Mac & Cheese, California Wrap, Pulled Pork Sandwich, any burger, Salad Bar, Big Kid Milkshakes, Spiked Coffee.
