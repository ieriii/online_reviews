First time going to a gastro pub without knowing it, but was pleasantly surprised. Service was excellent and the food was even better, hence the higher price tag. I loved my amish chicken. It wasn't over seasoned, and of course the chicken wasn't dry, but just right.  Good thing I was decently dressed for the occasion because this place isn't your casual pub and would of felt like a slob with the nicely dressed good lucking mofos up in that joint. This is the spot to hit up if you want some good beers with yummy, not heart-stopping food like other joints and get some good window shopping/buying done. Thank you, come again!
