I wanted to stay in this hotel after hearing about its history and majestic lobby. And damn, this is a gorgeous hotel! It was built (actually re-built) in 1925 and definitely has an amazing vintage style. The lobby is a few stories tall, with frescoed ceilings and lovely lighting. They've added a modern touch with a bar/restaurant and hip music playing everywhere.  The rooms have an overstuffed antique style. They're more ornate than the usual Hilton room, fairly small but decently appointed. My windows overlooked a courtyard and more buildings, so no grand Chicago skyline view. But everything was quiet! My bathroom was very pretty but the lighting was so low, it was impossible to put on makeup or really see much beyond the basics.  Internet access was expensive and only available through a wired connection. I opted to use my cellphone for internet instead. It really annoys me when hotels treat internet access as a luxury, not an amenity - the cheap hotels all offer free wifi, and these pricey hotels charge you $15 per day to plug your computer into the wall like it's 1997.  I found the front desk staff a little patronizing and brisk, but the bell desk and its staff were fantastic about checking luggage and calling cabs. I'm glad I stayed here for a night, and I might grab a drink in the bar the next time I'm in Chicago, but otherwise I'll pass on staying here again.
