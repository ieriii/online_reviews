This tiny little place took me back to all the good things about my trip to Costa Rica two years ago. First, the food is amazing. Everything tasted fresh and home made. The vegetarian selection is so impressive. I even took food to take with for my dinner that day. I recommend the Potato Tacos, Vegetarian Salad, Casado( An Authentic Favorite) and Tostones con Mojo( Double fried green plantains). As for the service everything runs on Costa Rican time, so leave your American anxiety behind, relax, and immerse your self in a an authentic Costa Rican experience. Owned and operated by the Cerdas family that takes much pride in their culture took such great care of me I would highly recommend this place.
