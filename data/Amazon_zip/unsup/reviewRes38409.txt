Food is Ok, the Stilton mac n cheese is excellent though. Our party of 4 ordered lambics and some belgians. One waiter was working all the tables while there were three hostesses. Really? Took 30 minutes to get our food, by which time, the DRINKS had still not arrived from the bar. REALLY?? Who serves food before drinks? Anyway, poor guy gets rushed all over the restaurant and therefore, it was not his fault that the food took forever and drinks took EVEN LONGER THAN FOREVER. We are talking 10 minutes into eating our food, and then our beers arrive. The beer menu is fabulous, though. I had the steak frites ($22) and the steak was OK. Very grisly and definitely not the best I ever had. The onion rings are very small, but good. The Duck Rueben was HORRIBLE and tasteless, No flavor at all. Tasted like eating cardboard. Definitely would not eat there again, but might drink at the bar. Maybe that is faster.
