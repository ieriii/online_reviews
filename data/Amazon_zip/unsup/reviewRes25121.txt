Extremely Romantic. Especially when you sit next to the live Guitar player/singer. Great atmosphere, and even better fondue! I would reccomend it to anyone who has the money to drop on an extremely expensive night of fondue and fatness. Ha! The amount of food is overwhelming and seems to be never ending. Make sure to pace yourself, don't eat all of the cheese and fruits because when the meat comes you will regret it. Highly reccomend the lobster/filet combination. Extremely Pricy!!! But the succulent flavors will have you coming back for more. If you like to cook your own food/fondue/un-buckling your belt then this place is for you... Just make sure to pace yourself and BE EXTREMELY HUNGRY!
