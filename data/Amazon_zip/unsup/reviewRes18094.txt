Came on a Saturday night around 6:30 and the place was packed! We had about a 40 minute wait, as predicted by the hostess. I ordered the cheese curds to start which were as great as could be. Definitely greasy, as cheese curds should be. I ordered a burger with blue cheese on it. They had many gourmet style burgers to choose from. Mine was cooked medium rare to perfection-very juicy and very tasty! It was also a reasonable portion size. I was able to finish the burger and eat many of the fries that actually came with it! How nice! Only four stars because we were seated in a back/side room, and the music was playing quite loud. You lost the feel of the fun bar/restaurant in that room.
