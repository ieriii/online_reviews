I grew up in an italian neighborhood where the moms like to feed "The American kids" with homemade cooking, so when I go to italian restaurants, I use that as a comparison. This place compares. I had the linguine putanesca which was outstanding. My girlfriend had the tortellini with marinara, & her friend the gnocchi stuffed with asiago in a creamy tomato sauce.  All 3 sauces were excellent & the pasta cooked to perfection.  We also had the bruschetta which came on over toasted bread which was a bit dry, but a big slice of mootsadell on top made up for it. Its a cute, cozy little place, but Cozy+crowded = noisy - not the fault of the restaurant of course. Service was ok, but very friendly. Not the greatest location, but worth the trip. Bottom Line: Its a charming little byob with no corkage fee & outstanding food. Probably a 4.5/5, but now one of my favorite byobs in the city. I would get here by 7 to get a table right away. Later in the evening there is a wait.
