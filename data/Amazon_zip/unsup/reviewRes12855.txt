Another place I was able to try thanks to the wonderful people at Groupon. When I called to make reservations tonight, they were actually out of reservations - that should tell you how popular this place is. My friend put her name on the waiting list and was told it would be a 30-45 minute wait. It ended up being an hour, but we were kept happy with some AMAZING mojitos. This place makes some damn fine mojitos - the raspberry is particularly delicious. Mojito, also, is a fun word to say. Mo-hee-toe. Yay. After much debate, I decided on the pistachio encrusted chicken and my two friends had the almond encrusted halibut. We waited roughly 30-40 minutes for our food - not too bad considering how swamped they were. We were contented with the slightly spicy yet sweet butter and soft bread. Then the food arrived. My chicken was slightly above warm, but not HOT. It was still good though - the sauce served with the chicken was creamy and delicious, and the chicken was moist and amazing with the pistachios that covered it. The swiss chard was good with the sauce, but too bitter when I had a piece without sauce. The garlic potatoes were tasty - but how can garlic mashed potatoes go wrong?? My friends literally cleaned their halibut plates. NOTHING was left. The fish was flaky and extremely tasty. The jalapeno potatoes had a great kick and lots of flavor. As far as ambiance, the place is a little cramped and loud for my tastes. But the lighting isn't too dim and we didn't feel rushed at all. I definitely will return to Cafe 28 - great food and good service.
