I had a really great time with my date. I went on a Tuesday night and still had to wait 30 min. I know there are some bad reviews here so I had to toss in my good one. A few bad reviews can really make someone hesitant to try anew place out but hey, this two story place is PACKED to the rafters every night as far as I can tell. That should tell you something. The beer selection is worth the trip but toped off with a creative gastro-pub menu you have a great combination. I had the muscles and fries. The muscles were not chewy but more like delicious velvet. Lets just say I ate all the fries. The aoili was not homemade mayo but had so much garlic I did not care. They were an excellent combo. The scotch egg app stopped me in my tracks. That's how good it was. The CB&J sandwich was creative and my girlfriend loved it. I wasn't blown away by the flavor combination but applaud the dish on originality and creativity. This makes it on my list of places to entertain out of towners. I am proud of this Andersonville eatery. I can wait tell you try it, even if it means I have to wait longer on a table.
