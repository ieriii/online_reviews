My wife and I just moved into the neighborhood and have walked by the restaurant several times. It looked very charming from the outside so we decided to give it a try.  The interior is very nicely done. The food was fantastic so was the service. The owner of the restaurant was very polite, personable and attentive. He was walking around giving everyone in the place a shot of, well, I don't know what it was, but it was strong. Everyone in the place was having a great time. I'd recommend this place to anyone. It's a gem.
