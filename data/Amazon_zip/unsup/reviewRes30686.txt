Food wise, I often find it challenging to differentiate one steak house from another. Throw a caesar salad, crab cakes, and some prime steaks on the menu and there you go, instant steak house. But after a recent dinner at Mastro's I'm once again reminded that certain steak houses are better than the rest. I didn't try the ceasar (although I'm sure it was good) and yes, I enjoyed a perfectly cooked prime NY strip, but dinner really picked up when the sides arrived at the table The lobster mash was a good start, but it's the rich, decadent, and downright addicting black truffle gnocchi that will continue to haunt my dreams. If you're a dessert fan then the signature butter cake is an absolute must. Don't make the same mistake as our table and order one to share. Order one for yourself and slap away any forks that come darting in for a bite of that buttery rich goodness! If you enjoy vino with your meal, you'll find a good number of options to choose from. After asking for a recommendation, our server's finger did tend to drift towards the more expensive options on their list, but we did find a reasonably priced bottle of malbec for the table's enjoyment. Still, I had no complaints from a service standpoint overall. While I don't get major craves for steak house fare as often as I used to, Mastro's would definitely be near the top of my list when that crave hits.
