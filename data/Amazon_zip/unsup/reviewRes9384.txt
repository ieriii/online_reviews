Yeah I did it- took on the big city of Chicago all by my lonesome- stupid relationships! Anyways- thanks to all those Yelpers out there I found a few decent places to eat- party of one! The inside seemed slightly stuffy and there were rich older ladies occupying the dining room so I sat outside (plus it was super nice out) I ordered the vegetarian spring roll appetizer (big spender) and it was pretty good- lots of flavor and I enjoyed the plum peanut dipping sauce. Not a bad place to grab a bite for lunch while shopping around the area!
