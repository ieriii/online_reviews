Waited 1.75 hrs on a warm spring Friday (Fridays and Saturdays have longer lines for the duck-fat fries that are only available on these days). It was a pleasant wait--there was a family playing "I Spy" behind me, and two co-workers who were obviously attracted to each other in front of me. *note* most people were locals, to dispute any fears of it being too touristy, not that tourism is bad for our city or its fine encased meat establishments. I got the BLT dog... it tasted like a BLT... and the Dog.. which is a Chicago dog.... although, I have to be nit-picky about this one... "everything" on the Chicago style dog did not include sport peppers. I LOVE the Chicago dog, but the absence of sport peppers was sorely felt *note*you can add sport peppers, no additional cost or anything. I just didn't read and assumed the dog would come with them. Chicago dog= boiled or steamed dog, poppy seed bun, tomato, relish, onion, celery salt, pickle, mustard, and sport peppers. So if you are a tourist planning on eating a Chicago dog at the best encased meats establishment in the world, do it right and make sure you get the sport peppers. My bff got this spicy calaberese pork sausage that was AMAZING. I was very jealous. Jealous enough to come back and try all their wild, wonderful sausages. We also had duck fat fries. Good, and enough for 2-4 people. The five stars is all about Doug.
