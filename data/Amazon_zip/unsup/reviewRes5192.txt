More like 4.5, but this place is delicious. Both times I visited I was with clients, so no wine list for me, but I'm dying to go and eat without hesitation. I have had the pork shoulder with potatoes (wowzer amazing), the fried Manchango (a must-order), the butternut squash (with sage, best combo ever), the artichokes (meh), scallops, (pass) shrimp + clams in risotto (the risotto is awesome) and the purple pig platter. If you're with 2 or more people you should order it because it is pig heaven. Great service, nice decor, its a total go to.
