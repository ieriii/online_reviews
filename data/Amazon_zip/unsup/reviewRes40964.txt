This was my first time here, but my boyfriend's been here many times before. It was a super rainy Sunday afternoon and there was still lines out the door! Actually out both doors! They have two entrances... very confusing... one entrance is actually on Broadway and the other entrance is on Argyle. The guy taking your name down for the waiting list was no where to be seen for a WHILE, but he must be pretty used to the rush cuz he definitely takes care of everyone waiting in order... I just felt bad for people sitting right by the doors since people were all hovering over them waiting for their tables... I guess a wait is pretty typically, especially on a Sunday afternoon. Our server was really nice! She was also honest about MSG usage in the Pho broth, when we questioned about it. Boyfriend had the extra large Pho and I had the vegetarian Bahn Mi! Also, we got an order of the spring rolls! Delish!!!! Everything was really tasty! Pho wasn't too greasy or too salty... I think it was worth the wait, even with the rain! I would definitely recommend Tank in the Viet town! I would like to venture out and try some of their other menu items! They've got a pretty extensive menu options! FYI, they are closed on Wednesdays! We didn't know and went back on a Wednesday for an early dinner and they were closed.... =(
