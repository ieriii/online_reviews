It's OK for brunch, haven't had any other meals there. I'm not blown away by the cajun-ness, but the food is reasonably good and the service was decent too. The downside is the wait. It's no Bongo Room wait, but you will wait in line to be seated. Not the place's fault I know, but I guess it seemed to me that the wait wasn't worth it.
