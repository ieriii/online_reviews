Ehh. From all the excellent reviews I've heard/read about the Purple Pig, I expected it to be much better. Honestly, it was kind of, well, yucky. With French family, I am all about experiencing new cuisine and am a fan of organ meats. I was neither wowed or full after visiting for a weekday lunch excursion. I was totally unimpressed and will not be making another visit. I tried the eggplant shmear and it was "okay"...nothing to write home about. I also had the signature milk braised pork shoulder dish and I was left wanting. It was okay, but it seemed overcooked and much more done than its goal at being "tender"...it was just slop. I'm not a chef, nor do I know everything about food, but I know what I like (and that's just about anything and everything). Purple Pig is a no-no in my book. Sorry, PP.
