This review is closer to a 3.5 star rating. A group of us went to Chicago Q last night for a friend's birthday dinner. We had reservations, but it being a Monday evening, the restaurant wasn't terribly crowded. I ended up ordering a half slab of ribs, fries and some mac and cheese. The positives: -The mac and cheese was creamy and delicious. -The ribs were quite tender. -The selection of sauces was diverse and flavorful. -Price was reasonable (not great but ok) especially for the area. -The homemade chips and pickles at the table were a great touch. -The restaurant ambiance was very charming. The negatives: -The meat was room temperature. I understand that you don't want the customers burning their hands, but room temperature was a major turn off. -The waiter was very slow waiting half an hour to first approach the table to take only drink order, then waiting another 20 minutes to take dinner order. Only saw him 3 times in what ended up being 2 hours. -The fries were crisp, but subpar in flavor. They too were barely above room temperature. All in all, I thought it was alright to slightly above average. The kinks weren't too major, and could have been chalked up to an off day.
