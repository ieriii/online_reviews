Allright, it took quite many tries, after being fed-up of trying Potbelly's and the restaurants around work so many times, but I finally came to like this place's food. The falafel sandwich changed dramatically once I had them make it spicy and HOT... reminds me of the sabor and textura del chorizo. Well, then I began to love the flavor of the Jerusalem salad... Now I complete it all with rice and lentils and voila... mmm I gotta go back and try it all. -1* b/c it's pricey
