I love going to BIN36, the atmosphere is so open, contemporary and inviting, every time I go there I honestly feel like such a well put together adult...is that a weird way to start a yelp review? Honestly though, the food is delicious and not overly pricey and the wine selection is endless, you can definitely keep it cheap or pull out the wallet, which ever you would prefer. My number one recommmendation is that YOU HAVE TO TRY THE BASKET OF GOUGERES!!! I have no idea how to pronounce it, I usually just point to it on the menu, but the rolls and the honey are to die for! I would definitely recommend BIN if you are looking for a good date spot or a fun place to grab drinks & apps with the girls. have fun!
