i LOVe their burgers and hotdogs my usual deal is a supercheesie and if i'm really hungry i'll get a whoopercheesie their milkshakes are a great chunk of yum.... so far i've only had the strawberry and pineapple... pineapple is a bit adventurous for my taste in a land of milkshakes. but yea.... i love the fact that food comes in a box. it's a bit of a time warp but that's what makes it special. oh and the fries bother me. not bad but too crunchy for my taste
