I can't really explain how much I love The Publican. I could try, but it wouldn't do it justice. There are so many amazing places to eat in Chicago, but The Publican continues to be my favorite. It's the #1 place I want to take all out of town visitors and the first place I think of when we want to go out. It serves up all three of my major food groups (beer, seafood, and pork) in ridiculously good ways; I still haven't found an equal to their mussels (even in Belgium). I'm super specific about the meat that I eat, and there I don't have to worry that my pig parts are jacked up full of hormones or flown in from 3000 miles away. Really, I just want to live there.
