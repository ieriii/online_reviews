Good stuff for sure, but with their efforts to stay organic and sustainable I think I need to give them another shot at a 5 star rating.  Dinner started off with the Duck Confit Quesadilla and Korean Chili-spiced Fried Calamari. Duck is good, duck confit is really good, duck confit with melted Chihuahua cheese and carmelized onions between a crisp tortilla...I think you see where I'm going with this. I would eat this everyday if I could. The calamari was perfectly cooked, but suffered from a little too much sauce. After the calamari comes out of the fryer it gets tossed in the Korean chili-sauce, which by the why is not as spicy as it sounds. The sauce is indeed good, but with the rather thick coating that's about all I could taste after a few bites. I'd definitely get this again, but I'd ask for my sauce on the side. For dinner I had the Prairie Pure Macaroni & Cheese, my gf had the Pistachio Crusted Tilapia. I really wanted to like it, but to be completely honest I've had better Mac & Cheese. The cheese flavor didn't have as much depth as I'd like, and it could have used a little more salt. It also came out in a relatively small ceramic bowl, and I think the pile of tart apple slaw served with it might have been bigger. To be fair, mac & cheese can be pretty rich so the portion size was appropriate. Besides, with America's expanding waste lines I should probably be thanking them! The tilapia was well cooked, but neither my gf nor I were really big on the orange reduction sauce.  Overall it was still a really good dining experience. The outdoor patio has a great romantic atmosphere and I'd definitely recommend it as a date spot. I'm sure I'll end up here again and will update my review after trying a few new entrees.
