I have been working just blocks away from Meli but have some how missed the opportunity to eat there. Today I finally checked it out and am kicking myself for not going sooner. Nestled in the heart of Greek Town this gives some much needed variety to the meal options in the area. I enjoyed their Ham & Swiss Panini with a side of fries. The portions were generous and delicious. The atmosphere was also enjoyable. I look forward to going back and checking out their wide breakfast/brunch menu.
