My lunch here was great. The cashier was very helpful and knowledgeable. I went with a pork belly/vermicelli soup that was perfect for the grey day and my hangover. The portion was huge and every bite was so comforting and warm. I'd love to try some of their sandwiches because they all look delicious.
