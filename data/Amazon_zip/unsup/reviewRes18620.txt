The churros are amazing, as is the guacamole and the service is top notch. The only reason I'm giving this 3 stars versus 5 is because I'm a cheapo and you can go to equivalent places for just as cheap and though they were super friendly and loved my son as he stared and gawked at everyone from his stroller, we were definitely an anomaly and it was not the most kid-friendly place. If you are going, be aware that the wait is quite long, evident of how popular this place is. You tell the hostess how many in your party (if you're sitting) and then you stand in line to order and your seat is normally there when you've made it through the line.  A tip - the chips and guacamole are VERY FILLING and if what you ordered takes a while to come.. you will be full. I'd stop by again next time I'm in Chicago for chips and guac and some churros! Yay!!!
