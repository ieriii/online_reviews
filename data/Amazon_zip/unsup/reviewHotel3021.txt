I'd been wanting to stay at a W hotel for quite some time and finally got my chance while visiting Chicago. As with any hotel there are pros and cons...pros: location, Bliss bathroom products were fabulous, beds and bedding were very nice (my friend thought the pillows were too soft which i agreed but didn't really mind), quiet and comfortable rooms, room decor was nice, staff was super helpful and fun cons: having to leave a deposit locked out of my account for incidentals (puts a damper on your vacation even before it starts) btw the reservation was prepaid so don't know what that was about, the car service is great if you can schedule it which was hard, having to pay for wifi when really in this day and age it's just plain greedy of them but since i needed it i had to pay for it (smh). overall i liked the hotel was glad i got to stay there i just need to remember to have plenty of money in my account for the 'incidentals' hold
