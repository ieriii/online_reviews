Man, the food was good! They definitely know how to cook their protein. My pork belly was perfectly cooked, and so was my friend's chicken breast, which at other places, is typically a little dry. Flavorful, moist, incredible. The chocolate and banana bread pudding is delicious as well, but be warned, it's more like a traditional pudding in texture, not a bread pudding. I didn't regret ordering though - it was so satisfying! The music and the interior design complemented the attitude of the food. Well-executed comfort food that aims to be interesting, but not pretentious. I'm pretty sold on this place. It reinforced the fact that I have a pork belly addiction, something that I'm currently inclined to indulge in rather than cure (pun not intended).
