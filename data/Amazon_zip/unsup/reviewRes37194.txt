What a great store, full of wonderful high-end groceries that nobody can afford to buy on a regular basis. It's good that I come in here only for specific occasions such as before seeing a film at the AMC River East. Yesterday I needed pomegranates for a dinner party, and I found them here after striking out at Dominick's. That was a big relief which saved me from having to hike up to Whole Foods on Huron. These things are out of season and looked pretty questionable, but of course we only used the seeds anyway. I also needed dessert, and some very handsome tarts called to me from the pastry case. They tasted as good as they looked, too: Pumpkin mousse: B Key lime: B+ Coconut creme: A- Turtle: B+
