Irazu is without a doubt my favorite restaurant in Chicago! The food is great, service is great, plenty of vegetarian options which make me happy, and quite possibly the best drink ever, the oatmeal shake! I hate hyping the place up so much, but really just go in without expectations and enjoy some good food and a great atmosphere. Don't forget to bring your cash (cash only) and some Costa Rican beer
