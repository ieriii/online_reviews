Absolutely outstanding and can't wait to go back! Rustic and comfortable surroundings; informed and friendly service, and some of the best and most reasonably priced Italian food I've ever had. Incredibly reasonable and wide ranging wine list (retail price + $7 corkage fee!). Since they don't take reservations, assume it will get overrun as soon as folks find out about it. Once full, very noisy, but who cares, you're eating great food.
