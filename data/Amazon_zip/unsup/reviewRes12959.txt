My wife rarely orders seafood but got the almond crusted halibut. It was amaaaaazing. I ordered the marinated skirt steak and was upset when I was done eating because there wasn't anymore left to eat. The marinade was full of flavor. The food was wonderful, the service was excellent, and the atmosphere was perfect. I would recommend this to everyone I know.
