First time there today, thanks to my boss. From the moment we entered and were greeted by the staff, I knew this restaurant would be phenominal. And I was right. I honestly have never seen a salad bar as good as the one here. You create your own salad and then go bac kto your table to eat it. The waiters will wait for you to finish dining on your salad, then take your plate for you. Then, you turn over your "red card" on your table and the real fun begins! The servers continually roam the room and offer you different types of meats. I have to say that by the time the fourth server came over, I was already full...full on extremely tasty meats! Be sure to save room for dessert. I had the chocolate mousse cake, and was in true heaven. From what I hear they also have a killer cheesecake.
