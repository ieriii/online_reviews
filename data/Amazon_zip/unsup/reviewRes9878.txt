We love Piccolo. A great go-to with one of the best patios in the city. There is no dish that is special here, as you konw what you are going to get and it is a greaat italian meal. The food is fantastic! Nothing out of the ordinary and great for friends or family visiting in the city. We always order the beet salad and a pasta dish, as their homemade pasta is amazing!
