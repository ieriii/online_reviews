I've stayed at the Allegro several times in the past 5 years. Yes, the rooms tend to be small - but it's an historic building in downtown Chicago, and that's to be expected! From what I've experienced staying in other hotels in that area the Allegro's rooms are a fine size, and much nicer than most as far as decor and amenities. On our last visit (a weekend trip) we were offered a last-minute upgrade and got a huge 2-room suite for a fantastic price. We loved it, jacuzzi tub and all. Also, they've updated the wallpaper, furniture, and bedding since our last stay -- gorgeous. Staff were nice and helpful as always, the evening wine/cheese party was a plus, and the location is perfect for a weekend touring around downtown. Probably the only complaint I might have is that noise can be a problem - we could hear the person in the room behind ours when he talked on the phone. Of course, that might have just been because he was shouting... Oh - last but not least, they have FABULOUS swag bags for the kids. If you're traveling with little people, make sure you tell staff when you make the reservation.
