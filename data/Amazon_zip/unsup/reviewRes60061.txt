Just had breakfast at Big Jones for the first time this past Saturday and it was GREAT! I had some of the best Eggs Benedict I've EVER had. The ham was very tasty & they serve it on popovers rather than English muffins...a very nice twist! The hollandaise sauce was PERFECT! Rounded out with freshly squeezed orange juice (very tasty), complimentary beignets (again, very tasty), a warm and cozy atmosphere (both in furnishings AND temperature) and it was a great experience. I've eaten here probably 7 or 8 times since they opened their doors and have NEVER been disappointed. I only wish they would bring back their Mississippi Mud Pie/Cake. BEST dessert on the menu! *hint, hint* Will definitely be back and have taken friends as well as recommended to friends. Keep up the good work!
