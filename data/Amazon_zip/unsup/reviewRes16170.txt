Visting from SF, I found this place on Yelp. It's hard to find but just look for the wooden door right off the street. I love the decor--light blue and white walls with blue velvet curtains. There are a lot of bars popping up in SF with this kind of romantic/gothic/edwardian decor so I was excited. I think the bar isn't executed well though. I don't have a problem with paying $11 a cocktail but make me feel like it's worth it. For a Saturday night, the music was way too mellow. This place was too dark to be loungey so the music just made everything feel depresso. Play better music and a little louder. Other people have said the door man claimed they didn't want to "pack it in" but I felt the place was too empty. You want $11 a cocktail? Make this a fun scene. I don't want to be elbow to elbow but the layout wasn't conducive to socializing at all. The booths are so anti-social! The cocktail menu could have been more extensive and creative too.
