The staff has been very kind and helpful, the location is right in the middle of the Magnificent Mile. Some of the rooms are rather small and having stayed here 30+ times now I think I can confidently say that every room is a different shape. There are rooms I don't like and rooms I like very much and a few that are best described as "unusual" (which are on my list of rooms to avoid). While some of the rooms near the elevators are small, some in the corners are very large, these are my favorites. I've traveled here enough that I know some of the waitstaff in the restaurant, they are always kind and say good morning even when they are not assigned to serve my table. The breakfast buffet is good, but doesn't run every day. I'd like the wait staff to be a little faster with the check, but I've learned to judge the time. In year's past I've spend 100s of nights with Marriott so I do miss having loyalty points that I can spend when I bring the family with me. If you want a place to stay that's in a terrific location to shop and eat on the Magnificent Mile you should definitely check them out.
