Been here 3 times. Loved the black bean burger. Loved the curry chicken dish. Today, I had the eggs Benedict. They were OK. The potatoes that came with it were unspectacular and seemed more like they were leftover scraps that had been reheated. I'm not dying to go back, but I'd be willing to give it another shot. The bison burger sounds good. The decor, by the way, is cool. It's got the feel of an Irish pub mixed with a personal library (going with the literary theme).
