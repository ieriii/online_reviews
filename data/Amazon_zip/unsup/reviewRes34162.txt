The falafel sandwiches here are pretty much amazing, and affordable, too! The lentil soup was at the perfect consistency, and with a squeeze of lemon, was the best lentil soup I had ever tasted. The spinach pie here was great, and the variety of drinks was visually appealing, along with the decor that surrounded me as I ate with friends. It had a delightful ambience-- the music, the lighting, the organization of seating. It made me feel as if I was in a market altogether. I'm definitely recommending this place to everyone I know!
