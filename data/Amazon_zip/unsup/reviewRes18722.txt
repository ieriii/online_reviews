HOLY GUACAMOLE, BAYLESS. I haven't been to Topo, Frontera or Xoco (before Saturday) just because I hate waiting with throngs of people. However, tortas and churros were calling, and I had to take the call. Basically, the premise of this place is Mexican street food. Tortas, soups, guacamole, churros, hot chocolates and other goodies fill the menu. You walk in, and stand in line. I'm sure there's always a line. Our wait time was 30-45 minutes, which wasn't bad, being that we showed up at noon on a weekend. I decided on the woodland mushroom torta, our group got the chips and salsa and we got churros with chocolate and homemade vanilla ice cream for dessert. We also got an iced chocolate with peppermint. Yes, we are gluttons. The chips and salsa were great. There was a green, a red and a guacamole. The chips were the perfect thickness and saltiness, and all the salsas were perfectly flavored. I like a nice salsa. My torta blew my fucking face off. Two pieces of crusty bread encasing (vegetarian) black beans, arugala, woodland mushrooms and goat cheese with a side of red salsa. This was all toasted in their wood fire oven. IT'S AS GOOD AS IT SOUNDS. Cheesy, crusty bread, perfectly cooked mushrooms - it was perfection on a plate. Our churros for dessert were amazing. I highly recommend getting the homemade ice cream, although the chocolate dip was good as well. The churros themselves are hot and cinnamon-y, and so, so dreamy. Our iced chocolate (which was huge, we split it and still couldn't finish it) was super rich, a little bit spicy and had a dash of peppermint. So good on a warm day. AND. AND. THEY HAVE SPARKLING WATER ON TAP. WHO DOES THAT?! RICK BAYLESS. I highly recommend this place if you want to try Mr. Bayless' cuisine without making your wallet cry. It's really great stuff.
