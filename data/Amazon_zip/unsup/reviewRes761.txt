What can you say about this place that hasn't already been said? This is one of those places where it is worth it to wait in line for 2 hours. I have been to Hot Doug's 5-7 times as I am right in the neighborhood. If you are a first timer definitely try the foie gras, but you probably only need half so try to split it with someone else. In fact try to order as many sausages as you can handle and split them up because who knows when the next time you can wait in line for that long so pack it in and try as much as you can. Try the duck fat fries if your there on Fri-Sat, but again split them as they can serve 2-4 people per order. Every item i have ever had here lives up to the hype. I did have a kangaroo sausage one time and the texture was kind of funny. When you finally get to the front of the line, there is Doug ready to take your order, who is a super friendly guy so don't worry about rushing the order. There are somehow always seats inside. Not sure how they figured out the table turnaround, but it works. Stay strong and don't leave the line!
