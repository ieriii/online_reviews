There isn't much to say about this place that hasn't been said, except for this: If you are not into plates of bloody meat waiting to be grilled you should still go here!!! Every time I've gone, I order bim bim bop with no meat, but with egg. It comes in a hot stone bowl and the rice touching the bowl gets crispy and delicious, and you mix in your own hot sauce and I could eat it every day, I swear!  Yes, with the vents above the tables and the grills inside them, it is always either too hot or too cold. Yes, the service is crazy -- sometimes your food comes while you're still enjoying your panchan, sometimes you wait forever, and the ladies really aren't all that nice. But damn, that bbb is good, and from what I can tell, people seem to really dig on that meat as well.
