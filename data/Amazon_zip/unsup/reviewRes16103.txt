I love going to Calos to enjoy their Italian-Americanized, huge portioned pastas. The love started few years back when I used to have them deliver my late-night dinners. My friends and I go visit them every now and then to enjoy Italian done right. I went there to enjoy their risotto for my birthday. My friend and I were there the other day and we could not stop eating our Fettuccini con carciofi even though we were quite full. The reason why they get 4 stars instead of 5 is due to their service. It's a hit or a miss. Love the food though.
