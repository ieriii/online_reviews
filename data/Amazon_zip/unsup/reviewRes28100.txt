Me and a friend stopped here after work today. It's nice, I liked the atmosphere and the service was great. I had late dinner plans for later in the evening but wanted something light so I wouldn't be starving. I had the asparagus salad, a pomegranate and champagne drink, and the deconstructed strawberry shortcake. My friend had the tuna sashimi. All was good and I hope to come back sometime to try the entrees. Also, we had the popcorn that had lemongrass? or some other seasonings that was good.
