Some compare this place to Herbivore in San Francisco, like it's vegetarian food for non-vegetarians. I don't think it's that bad. In fact I quite like it. There are a few misses on the menu, but quite a few hits, especially in the dessert department. I also love booths. Why do they keep getting rid of booths in restaurants? don't be fooled by how cheap the pancakes are a la carte. You get two HUGE ones for one low low price. and P.S. vegan shakes are awesome.
