Double fried plantains with garlic oil dip. If that was the last thing I ate on earth, I would die happy. They were decadent and garlicky. Two things that are fantastic by me. We also got the Costa Rican beef sandwich and that was delicious. I could taste a hint of curry but I don't know if there truly is any. We have eaten here before and was pleased with the food but this second time was so much more. And it was delivered! The food was still hot and the delivery guy was pleasant. It was only the coldest day so far of the year! I highly recommend Irazu for any meal of the day. Or a snack. Whichever you chose, you will love it!
