This was a very cool experience. The restaurant is huge, it looks in some ways like a cafeteria, but the wood roof and skylight were a nice touch. Its not something you would expect considering the other restaurants in the Arglye area. The famous duck was delicious, though it took a while to get to our table (longer than I would think it should have considering how busy it was). The fried rice was the best I've had in a very long time. The fried octopus whiskers were a delicious and cool appetizer as well. This would have gotten 5 stars if the service was a little faster and the servers were a little bit more attentive. FYI: Don't drive to here if you can, take the "L" or cab. Street parking is pretty tough.
