I'm a Hilton honors gold member. I've stayed at numerous Hilton properties, and the only thing that impressed me with this property was it's location. Customer service was meh, there was no free breakfast, no bottles of water in the room, and there was an Internet charge of $10. It wasn't a horrible experience, but I won't be staying here again. I can get much better accommodations for almost $400 a night elsewhere.
