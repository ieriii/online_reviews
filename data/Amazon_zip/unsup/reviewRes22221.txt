I practically grew up here. A definite staple if you are from the neighborhood. Still probably my fave hot dog. Green tomato, crinkle fries and all. Love it. They have car hop service. Prices aren't impressive but it's worth every penny. Bring your camera, you'll want a photo of the giant hog dogs that wink on the roof.
