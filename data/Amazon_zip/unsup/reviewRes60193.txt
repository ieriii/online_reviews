Wow! I am from a small town in Michigan where my father owns an Italian pizza joint. All of his recipes have been handed down from Sicily--let's suffice it to say... I know good pizza. I was VERY impressed at the selection of pizzas offered as well as the unique blend of Italian/Brazilian tastes. I will most definitely become a regular at this well priced/delicious eatery. PS. I cannot wait to bring my dad.
