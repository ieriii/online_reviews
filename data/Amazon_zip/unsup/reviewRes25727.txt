We visited Mercat a la Planxa for a nice, indulgent Valentine's Day dinner, and we were blown away by the mixture of flavors. We looked at the menu and realized that we would never be able to decide what we should try, so we put ourselves into the hands of chef Jose Garces with the prix fixe menu. This was absolutely the right choice. I tried 5 kinds of food that I never had before and probably wouldn't have chosen off the menu. It's been mentioned on many other reviews, but the Serrano Ham and Fig salad is truly amazing. The Conill Amb Chestnut (Braised rabbit agnolotti with rosemary, a truffle-chestnut puree, and brandied cherries) was delicate and delicious. The Lobster and Waygu short rib a la planxa were prime examples of the restaurant's signature grilling style. We were also impressed by the bartenders at Mercat. We enjoyed the Martini de la boqueria (bombay sapphire, pomegranate liqueur, fresh sour, and fresh mint) and the Spanishattan (Bourbon with a vanilla-soaked raspberry and vermouth), which were tasty twists on traditional favorites. We were already big fans of Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba for Tapas on the North Side, but Mercat a la Planxa was a great discovery for us.
