While visiting friends in Chicago, I stayed in Wicker Park. I ate here 2 days in a row and both times were F-ing spectacular!!! Day 1, I ordered the Tomatillo Salsa Scramble (substituted the chicken out, added cheddar cheese) also took a few bites of my friends' Lemon Ricotta & Sour Cherry Hotcakes. Both were fantastic. The Scramble was a wee-bit spicy, but it certainly didn't stop me. Day 2, I ordered the Breakfast Burrito, which was so damn tasty but could barely finish it. Also on the spicy side, FYI. Service was prompt and friendly, coffee great, atmosphere very perfect for breakfast.
