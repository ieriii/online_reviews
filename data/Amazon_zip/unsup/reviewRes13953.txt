Yes, an okay rating. I have to admit the food is superb but the service is lacking. It is not that the staff isn't attentive I just think they might be stoned. Seriously, I really don't want to have a conversation with the staff unless they are serioulsy good looking. But every time I eat here, something is way screwed up. They seem to get confused with orders that are more than a single course: like ordering soup throws them for a loop. Throw a beverage into that combo and chaos ensues. Maybe visit when you're stoned- so you won't mind the service and you can truly accentuate the olifactory.
