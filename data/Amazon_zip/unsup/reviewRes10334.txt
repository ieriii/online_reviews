The first time I came out here was to celebrate a dawning of new thoughts and new tastes. First thought: Nurses love to celebrate with their colleagues and can hold down their beer. Second thought: The bouquet for the beer that I was drinking tickled my senses even before it touched my lips. Making the taste experience all more lovely. And so starts my love for beer. No worries here, my love for prosecco will always be, but my affair with beer will never fade. Catchy names such as Full frontal and the Fornicator list on the easy to read signage describing each beer and the alcohol content. I will have to say that when I come here my thoughts are on the beer and not so much for the pizza. I like the texture of the pizza with the ratio of toppings. Not your traditional round pizza and standard toppings. Tasty toppings such as sauteed onions, goat cheese, and buffalo chicken can be chosen with other accoutrements. The server was knowledgeable and the food came out hot. One of our party guests even went home with a souvenir cup. Street parking as to be expected in Wicker park and tables and booths abound with televisions around the bar.  The party gathering was corralled at the sunken space/seating in the front. We squeezed about 30 adults in cushy booth seating and single seat ottomans around tiny round tables. Not a bad setting for mingling and noshing, but do not expect to eat table side.
