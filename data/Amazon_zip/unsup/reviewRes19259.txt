Stood in line and while we waited had the Mexico City Thick hot chocolate along with a churro to dip in it. Nice touch! I like that they let us order while we waited in the line. I had a oven-toasted torta... I had the wild mushroom. It was tasty, but unfortunately not warm in the middle. Need to be heated more. But damn those mushrooms were good. My husband had the special - the goat. He loved it! I am not super crazy about the bread they use for the sandwiches, but hey Rick B. knows.
