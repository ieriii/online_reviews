We came for my best friend's bday dinner and were NOT disappointed. The great thing about this place, and my ideal restaurant style, are the small plates so everything can be shared. We got almost everything on the atipasti menus to share, my favorite being the goat cheese smear with eggplant. We also got the corn, salt-roasted beets, pig ear with kale, the prosciutto bread balls, and the artichoke/potatoes. I would agree with another review I read about the salt factor (a little too much sometimes) but overall the flavors together were magical. As an entree (still a small portion) I got the scallops with grilled lemon and basil, so incredible!! I never would have thought lemon grilled would be so refreshing and tasty. The scallops were cooked to perfection and not too oily or dry; they were almost buttery. For dessert, the brioche with ricotta and chocolate chips was one of the best desserts IVE EVER HAD. Thank god we were with so many people that I couldnt have my own to shove in my face. It was a perfect combination of very sweet with a little salt from the bread. This place is a gem and hope it stays that way since its on upper Michigan Ave, tourist central.
