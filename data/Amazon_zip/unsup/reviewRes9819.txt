Really wanted to like it, but I don't. Would be 2 stars if it weren't for my girlfriend loving her meal. Sat in the porch-like area upstairs. Extremely awkward. I've never seen tables this close together. Twice someone's ass grazed me as they were trying to get up from their table. I always put atmosphere on par with the food, so this was a negative for me - no real redeeming qualities to the atmosphere at all. My food was average, but it was more of an ordering issue, rather than execution.
