Awesome, awesome salads. I wish I had discovered this place sooner in my Chicago/UIC stay. They also have all kinds of cool juices and drinks (if that wasn't obvious from the name), but it's not gimmicky -- it's super fresh and delicious. Great for eating in or take out. The service is great but it is randomly really nice (and a little stuffy) for a place that is called a cafe/juice bar.
