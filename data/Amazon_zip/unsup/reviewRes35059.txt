Hands down, the best place in Chicago for a seafood brunch. It's a little pricey, but definitely worth every bite! Here are some of the highlights that I remembered from the brunch buffet: - King Crab- served cold, and cut into small pieces for easy peeling. - Snow crab- served hot and very fresh. Some places that I've had this make it too salty and that takes away from the crab flavor. - Smoked bacon- the biggest pieces of bacon I've ever seen. I'm not a huge bacon person, but I had a piece and it was the perfect blend of crispiness and smokiness! - Oysters- I am usually a crab person, but the oysters here were so fresh I probably at a good 15 easily. - Seafood Ceviche- served in a martini glass. excellent quality - Crab cakes- more crab than the cake. sooo good - Belgium waffles- Make your own and top it with their fresh strawberries, bananas fosters, and whip cream. For dessert bar, it's in a separate room filled with so many desserts. I only managed to try a few since I was so full from trying everything else. The creme brulee, chocolate mousse, raspberry tarts, hand spun cotton candy (which I took to go), and chocolate covered strawberries. I mentioned that it was my boyfriend's birthday and the waiter brought out a happy birthday plate for him with a homemade raspberry sorbet. I don't have one bad thing to say about anything on their menu for brunch. Looking forward to going back here. Like I said, Best place for SEAFOOD BRUNCH!
