This place is up there as far as sushi goes for me in the north neighborhoods. They have a very typical selection. A couple of nice variations are on the menu such as jalapeno miso soup (it isn't too spicy). I like the ambiance here. It is dark and cozy. It fills up pretty fast on weekends so be prepared to wait or call ahead. They are b.y.o.b. which is nice, but there is a $5.00 corking fee. I constantly go here when I am in Lakeview.
