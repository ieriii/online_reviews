First off the restaurant has a great atmosphere, wonderful drinks, and great service. Why only 3 stars... because i would give the food 1 star. Super overpriced small portions of sub-par food.Lemongrass beef lollipops- I was told that this was one of the best items on the menu, the beef was extremely dry and almost Sunda Poke- way too much sauce, it was all i could tasteA selection of sushi and sashimi - we choose about 8 different types, and i have to say it didn't look like a sushi chef had sliced the fish. It looked like something i could do at home, as for the taste the salmon was very fishy. Tuna and scallop were very good, but the worst sushi rice i have ever tasted.Honey-ginger braised beef shortribs- We got this because of the yelp reviews. The beef was melt in you mouth wonderful, the problem was the amount of fat. I love short ribs and they are meant to be marbled, however about half our entree was hard pieces of fat and gristle, a disappointment for sure.I really have no idea why the reviews for the food here are 4 and 5 stars
