This is one of my favorite steak and empanadas places. The dough they use for the empanadas is corn so it has a nice crunch. But what I really love here is their house chimichurri that just goes with everything. It's garlicky and has a hint of lemon. This was my old co-worker favorite place to go after work and some of us still meet up here for a good steak.
