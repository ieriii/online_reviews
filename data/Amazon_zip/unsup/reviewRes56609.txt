Went there with my girl friend, and we love it. Hands down best steak house in chicago. She wants to go there every week. The steaks are great, our favorite is the alaskan king crab truffel gnocchi and the butter cake. highly recommended. only downside is the wait if you dont have a reservation and want to sit at the bar during dinner hour.
