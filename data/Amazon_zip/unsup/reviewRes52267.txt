The best deep dish I've ever eaten! That may not be saying much since my deep dish pizza experience has been almost entirely limited to chain food like Pizza Hut and Old Chicago. Neither of which I've eaten in years. Two things stood out about these pizzas: 1. The time to cook. 45 minutes is a long time but well worth it to have the entire crust cooked to perfection. I couldn't find a soggy, uncooked or under cooked spot anywhere. 2. The sheer volume. I figured something must have been up with the prices for small pizzas (around $22) and was not too surprised that I was not able to completely finish mine. The small must have weight a good 3 pounds between the crust and the cheese. That said, the atmosphere was pretty dingy with scribble grafitti everywhere. Yes, that's supposed to be part of the look but I felt it made the place look very dirty and unclean. All of that white reminds me of the bird poop at Alcatraz. That's not true once you get down to brass tacks, silverwear, and the bathrooms all of which are very clean, but that's the impression the grafitti gives to me. It seems pricey but to me, understandable for the amount of ingredients and the time it takes to cook each pie. While I tend to frequent my local pizza "joints" once a month, I couldn't see visting Ginos more than once or twice a year, at least if I wanted deep dish each time. Still, I'd come again although I don't think my waistline could stand for a regular diet of deep dish.
