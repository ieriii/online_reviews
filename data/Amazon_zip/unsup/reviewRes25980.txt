My mom decided to take my sister and I here on a really cold winter day, and stepping into the warm and dimly lit restaurant was really wonderful. The atmosphere is lovely, and I plan on taking my boyfriend here as soon as i save up the money. In regards to the cost, a coupon is a must have. Groupon and http://restaurant.com have both of these, and they help make it more feasible.  The food was delicious. This was my first real fondue experience, and every course was delicious. The server was attentive and explained how to cook everything. It was fun to play cook with all the foods. One of the best parts of the meal was the chocolate fondue. We ordered coffee (delicious) and started scooping the chocolate into it after we had run out of goodies to dip in it.  All in all, everything was wonderful, and I think this is a chicago staple.
