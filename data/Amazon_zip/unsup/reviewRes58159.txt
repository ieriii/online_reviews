Overall the food at Mercat a la Panxa exceeded my expectations. We ordered the mixed cheese, chorizo, escalivada (roasted peppers, eggplant, and confit tomatos), and the butternut squash dumplings. The mixed cheese plate had a nice balance of cheeses. It was served with three different sauces. The goat's milk cheese with dolce de lecce I didn't feel was the best compliment but it went really well with the apples so I can see what they were going for. The butternut squash dumplings were absolutely the highlight with the escalivada as a close runner up. The chorizo was good as well but didn't blow me out of the water by any means. We were also served a complimentary flat bread tapa that was similar to a bruschetta. Very delicious. The wine selection although limited to Spain varietals was good. The service however cost this restaurant a star. Our waiter was very rude and tried to rush us through ordering only to tell us that he would prefer if we ordered everything at once. He was irritated that we asked him for a little extra time to decide and never bothered to check up on us again. We were there a little before the dinner crowd so it was clearly not a matter of opening up space. I felt that the tables were a little to smashed together. We were definitely right on top of our neighbors. It is a very big open space and it might not hurt to space the tables a little better.
