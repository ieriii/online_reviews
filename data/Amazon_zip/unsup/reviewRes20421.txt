It wasn't too busy on a Friday evening for early dinner (530ish). The caldos are giant and almost enough to share. They can be spicy so make sure and get a drink and/or have a friend get a torta so you can munch on the bread to absorb the spice. The churros are a must. Be sure to get a hot cocoa and soft serve to complete the dessert. Just a plain churro doesn't cut it. Not a good place for a large group because table space is tight.
