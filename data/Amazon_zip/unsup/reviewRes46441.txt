this place looks EXACTLY like cheesecake factory. everything was mediocre (definitely not bad, just nothing new or interesting). my friend did tell me about some new dessert menu they have no though - you order your dessert with the rest of your food and it's prepared fresh. supposedly amazing - might just be enough to lure me back through those doors
