What a difference a year makes. We spent New Year's Eve here this year and I was so disappointed. Osso Bucco Ravioli totally over-seasoned and you couldn't taste the meat. No offer of a pre-dinner cocktail (and we were at the earleist possible seating, believe me). I was looking forward to the lamb all week and not only was the meat over-cooked - no way was this grey a medium doneness, but the chops were tiny. The husband's surf and turf was ok and cooked to medium-rare, but nothing spectacular. We didn't bother staying for dessert after that disappointment and were in and out in less than 90 minutes, spending $130 plus tip on this disaster. So not the place of yore anymore.
