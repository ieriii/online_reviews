We got lucky and only had a 10 min wait, but as other reviewers have noted, you should to hang out in line for a while. This is such a neat spot to grab some uniquely concocted cocktails. I really don't think you can go wrong with any drink on their menu. I had the honor of sitting hear the cozy fireplace in the back while sipping on a warm ginger toddy. Heaven.
