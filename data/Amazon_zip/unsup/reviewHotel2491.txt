I like the Hilton...I haven't stayed there but I walk past it every time I go to school and I've eaten in both Kitty O'Shea's and in their big dining room. I also went for a school orientation and they served a nice meal in their conference hall. Every time I walk in there it makes me feel like I'm on vacation in some important place. Plus...the doormen always smile at me (in a good way, not creepy) when I go past. I'd really encourage everyone to try Kitty O'Shea's if you have the chance. Their Irish food is authentic (as far as I know) and really really good. Also, in the summer they have students from Ireland working there so you can experience their sexy accents.
