Empanadas, chicken and beef.....that's what these guys are good at. Fun atmosphere, much better than their old location across the street. Bring your own wine and have a good ol' time. Great for large groups, as they have ample sized tables. I would agree with others on the service. This past time we were there on a farily busy Friday night and our server disapeared and we finally had to flag him for the check. But when we have gone during the week, when it is slower, the service has been very attentive and friendly.
