Holy moly these pizzas are great! We called ahead from the house to order a deep dish mushroom and spinach. We arrived and were sat in the secret upstairs dining area. The pizza came out about 15 minutes later. We ordered some onion rings in the mean time. The pizza has this burnt cheese crust thing that is super delicious. The onion rings were cut and fried just right too and served with barbecue sauce. Next time I'm ordering anchovies!
