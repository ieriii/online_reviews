MMMMM....I went twice in one week! Chicago has such a variety of food choices, but it's hard to find a good soul food restaurant. I liked that they stick to a specialty and didn't have a 6 page menu but proved that they could do one thing well: COMFORT FOOD!Wishbone isn't expensive and I appreciate the two sides included on entrees. It's not grandma's Sunday dinner...but it's close!
