(Not to offend anyone that likes Chilies) This is not Chili's or Applebee's - don't go in expecting to spend $20 and walk away with a meal fit to feed a family of four for a week. Yes, the portions are small. Yes, the menu is pricey. You aren't going to Graham Elliot because you want to gorge yourself on mediocre fare. You go because you're a wannabe foodie with an adventurous spirit and a taste for the eclectic. If you go, be sure to have a moderate appetite and a cleansed pallet. The dishes are fabulously prepared - both esthetically appealing and full of flavor - conventional mixed with the exotic. I went with a friend and we had the tasting menu - each item that came out was better than the last - I'm partial to scallops and short rib. The price was worth it - the ambiance and music was fun and hip - it was a bit loud, but not excessively. I would definitely go back.
