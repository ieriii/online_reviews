As with everyone else...this place rocks. Went here for the first time last week and was fortunate that the chill in the air seemed to scare off the line. There were 6 of us which with the seating in there can be a challenge. We were in line for about 10 minutes, ordered and took an open table. About 5 min later out came the food. The Weisswurst I had was excellent as were the cheese fries I shoveled into my pie hole. I will be back to try more things. The BF has yet to be there so I am sure when they return from vacation at the end of Oct, we both will be there to great them. Side note: the service was excellent!! Not rushed and everything was explained well. For example: I was one of 2 Americans in the group; the other 4 were not fluent in English but this did not deter the workers.
