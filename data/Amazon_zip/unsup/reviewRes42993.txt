Just went here, got the fogo and the meat lovers. Had the fogo there adn the meat lovers to go. Get the Guarana drink! It's like a sweeter apple cidery sorta drink that is refreshing and sweet. Not much seating room, so good for taking it to go! But let me say, the fogo is tasty, love it. The meat lovers is sitting in my fridge, and had a slice of it, sort of a spicy sausage. Buy one pizza, and you get the 2nd one 50% off(the lesser priced of the two). This is a great deal and I will be coming back for more.
