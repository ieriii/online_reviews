On a strip of Halsted filled with mediocre restaurants, Mayan Palace is a total gem! The service is impeccable-their entire waitstaff is friendly and accommodating as well quick moving! Their tortilla chips are AMAZING-I could eat those as my meal any night of the week! Their margaritas are a bit pricey but delicous, but best of all, their entrees. I have never had something off of their menu that wasn't spectacular. I especially love their enchiladas-GREAT sauce! Without question, Mayan Palace is one of my favorite places in the city!
