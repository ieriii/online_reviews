Piece is one of those after-college - or during college - locations that I miss the most. It's got a chill atmosphere, great beer, amazing pizza, and a fun buzz around. It's one of those joints where it's fun to be tipsy or completely sober. Sometimes getting a table here was frustrating, and the staff would just throw up their hands because they couldn't do anything for us, but we knew our time would come again soon.
