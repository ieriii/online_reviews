RUDE!! I have never been treated so rudely by someone, the hostess staff should realize who pays their salary: the customers. I took a group to Gilt Bar for a business dinner. Made reservations for 7:00, arrived at 6:30 and were made to wait for half an hr ... Even though there were numerous empty tables. Once the hostess deemed us near-worthy, she seated us at a table that had been empty since we arrived. The table was small, next to the front door, and in a very busy spot so I politely asked for a different table (there were at least 6 - 7 empty in immediate view) She snapped that the other table was being saved in case a party of 5 came in (there were only 4 of us). I pressed the issue so she turned to my business associates, snatched the menus out of their hands, tossed them onto the other table and then turned to me and snapped, I hope you're happy. Answer: no, I'm not happy but I'm entertaining clients so I'm not going to make the scene that I'm dying to make. After the low-class treatment at the beginning it was hard to know if the rest of the meal was tarnished by the nastiness of the hostess, or if it was truly bad. Drinks were ok ( nothing special), waiter was average at best, food was ok... Music was way too loud, lighting was too low. I eat out in cities across the US every week - some of the best in the country but also some average but nice little spots. Gilt Bar is the worst I've ever encountered by far. Clearly they want to be hip and cool - that's fine, I'm all for it. But hip and cool does not equal snotty and rude.
