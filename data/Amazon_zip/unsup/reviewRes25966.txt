LUNCH SPECIAL - $4.95 for 7" personal pan pizza + 1 topping + pint glass of Bud Light. I still think Lou's deep dish is tastier because of the tomato sauce, but WHAT A DEAL!  The restaurant is clean, and the service is decent at this location, too. I think the rush is around 12:30pm. I'm going to have to make a "You Can't Afford NOT To" List.
