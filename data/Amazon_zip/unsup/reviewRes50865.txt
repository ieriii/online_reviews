i give big jones 4.5 stars. i had such a delicious meal here on sunday night. the sparkling wine they have is really good and only 6 dollars! george wanted the sauvignon blanc, which they only had a half glass of left, so he had the torrentes instead. the atmosphere is really clean and nice. given the name, i was expecting something more kitschy, but it wasn't like that at all. onto the food. beet salad - good. cornbread - OMG. i ate 4 pieces, thanks to our lovely server who brought us 2 extra pieces when she saw how much we loved it. gumbo - amazing. and george really liked his pork chops. finally - the mississippi mud pie and the red velvet cake...so good, especially the mud pie. the service is what really set this place apart for me. our waitress was SO nice. halfway through our meal she brought george the half glass of sauvignon blanc just to be nice. she also brought us an extra dessert that she knew we were debating ordering (the kitchen had made an extra one by mistake, and we were the lucky recipients). i can't wait to come back!
