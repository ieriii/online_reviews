Kinzie was solid. Went there last night with some friends for dinner to cap off a busy restaurant week full of steaks and wine. Restaurant had our table ready and while it was a bit crowded in there, it wasnt uncomfortable. Wine was a bit expensive, especially when we polished off two bottles, but not the biggest deal. Meal was solid, but not spectacular. We all had the caesar salad which was somewhat pedestrian but nice. Three of us got the beef tenderloin and one the salmon. I really liked my steak but again, no one would call anything spectacular. Dessert was fine although I was somewhat stuffed. After the long week of eating, it was tough to distinguish this place from others as it didn't really stand out in any way. I guess I kinda thought it was good, which is definitely not a strong review. I would possibly give it another shot though. Cheers.
