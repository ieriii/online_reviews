I adore Garcias, though to be fair it is right around the corner from my house - I'm not sure I'd make a trip for it. Garcias is pretty much a taqueria, but it's a step up from the average. The food is dirt, dirt cheap and so yummy. Portions are huge - a $5 burrito is easily two meals for me. Meals all start with fantastic, complimentary chips and salsa. Try not to fill up on those, because the entrees are fantastic. The margaritas are not to be missed - very reasonably priced and really, really strong. I also like the staff and authentic feel of this restaurant - there's usually Telemundo on the televisions and the waitresses are very sweet.
