What a great sushi spot! And, that it is BYOB makes it that much better;) The menu is original...yes, all the sushi staples are there, but the specials are not cookie-cutter...and they have tons of specials not listed on the menu...so many so that our waitress listed a few, then told us if there was something we were craving she would let us know if there were any specials... The service was great, the fish was fresh and the place was packed on a Monday night. FYI...we had the wasabi apple special roll, white dragon sans cream chz, creamy spicy (that sounds horrible, but it is delish) and hamachi avocado...plus a few pieces. All were great, but my fav was the white dragon.
