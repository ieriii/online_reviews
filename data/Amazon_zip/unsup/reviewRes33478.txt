If I'm not feeling up to the insane waits at Toast, I come during the later hours of the afternoon, and the wait isn't AS insane, also, there's more room than most other brunchy places in Chi, so it makes it a great place for groups larger than 3!! I loooove the decor and I love the HUMONGOUS array of options- it's hot, it's fresh, and I've never had bad service here... I really, really recommend their Santa Fe omelet and toast with salsa on it. Plus, their hot chocolate is great! And, if you can finagle it, their booths are great to sit at. Oh, and they're greaaat about splitting credit card charges, so feel free to go with large groups! As a final word: what makes this place better than the other places is the lack of attitude- the service is pleasant, the menu isn't rude (*ahem* Orange!), and they're great about dietary restrictions and customizations. I always leave satisfied.
