After several visits, I can say with certainty that Cafe 28 offers some of the best tasting food I have had in Chicago. My favorite is the pistachio crusted chicken. Mojitos are stellar. Service=not so much. On two separate occasions, it was like the waitress completely forgot she had us as a table. And wasn't even aware at how long it took her to come back to the group. Our glasses remained empty and we remained thirsty. The food does keep me coming back.
