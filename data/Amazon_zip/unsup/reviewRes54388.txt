THE best pizza in Chicago. We dont even bother with any other deep dish places anymore. This is our only option.Love everything about it. The carmelized cheesy crust, sauce, toppings...The upstairs area is so much more appealing now after the renovation. They have plenty of seating now and 2 full bars. Perfect place to go before a movie at Webster Place!
