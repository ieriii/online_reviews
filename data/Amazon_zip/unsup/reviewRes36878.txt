I have been eating at Indie since they first opened and love the slow evolution from bare bones to a twice the space elegant yet simple setting. I prefer their luncheon specials. You will never find a better bargain for such high quality food. I have enjoyed both the Japanese and Thai selections. The BYOB is great considering you have Dominicks and Thorndale liquors so close. My favorite dish right now is the Pagnang Curry Chicken.
