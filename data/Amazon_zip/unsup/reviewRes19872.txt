I went to Xoco salivating about the delicious food, had the food hyped up even more after talking to some of my other med school friends, and was extremely excited after arriving there in mid July. I've watching Rick Baylesses show on WTTW, looked at his books on Amazon and have been always amazed at his attention to detail and his need to preserve the authenticity of his food. If anything, he has inspired me to make Mexican food in my home and make it my own. I made the wait for about 35 minutes with a friend. The server was very gracious and took our order and asked us if we were vegetarian. We're not exclusively vegetarians, but when we eat out, we normally go vegetarian and seafood since I try to eat halal. The server then told us that even the vegetarian dishes such as Woodland Mushroom use lard/pork to cook the black beans. The food server told us that the food tried to preserve the Mexican manner of cooking so I understood that and order the woodland mushroom torta without black beans and since we came on friday also order the Shrimp and Bacalao torta without black beans. The shrimp and bacalao torta was very salty and had a raw taste to that. Maybe it's supposed to be balanced by the black beans and authentic Mexican and have a salty brine taste, but it was overpowered by this salty taste. I didn't enjoy this dish very much. The Woodland Mushroom was good because the goat cheese was great. I would recommend dessert which was soft ice cream, brownie / chocolate bits and just a very very mild hit of spice. I would still give frontera grill and topolobampo a chance and would return her for the desert.
