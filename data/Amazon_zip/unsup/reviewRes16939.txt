Came here with my boyfriend when we were both seriously craving good Indian food --- mmm it was super good! Nicely decorated, easy to get to via the red line, pretty fast service when we were there. They started us off w/naan and sauce (i think its like the same sauce they use in butter chicken) soo delicious. We ordered a bunch of food: chicken tikka masala (always), some daal, and a tandoori skillet with chicken, fish and shrimp. Lots of naan and rice...and of course I had to try the mango lassi. It was all very delicious and the daal was almost as good as my moms ;-)
