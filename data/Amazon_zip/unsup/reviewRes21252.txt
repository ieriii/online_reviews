Hands down the best Mexican food on Halsted. I can't say enough good things about this place! I've gone there when it's crowded, when it's empty...when I'm looking for a drink, when I'm looking for something good to eat....it's consistently awesome.  The food: I would really recommend anything on the menu. Whatever you like, it's probably awesome. My favorite thing is the guacamole. That should tell you how good it is!  The price: I've heard people say Mayan Palace is overpriced. It's not the cheapest place, but it's clear when you go there that you get what you pay for. The service: Nothing short of awesome. Enough said. Anything you want, they will get you. The food comes out quick, the margaritas are strong and the manager often shakes your hand and thanks you when you get up to leave.
