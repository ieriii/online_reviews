My rating is closer to 4.5 stars. The only knock I have is that the crust could be a tad more flavorful.I've spent some time recently in Chicago. Everyone seems to have a different opinion of Giordano's; either it is "awesome" or "you can get much, much better pizza elsewhere. I ordered pizza from this place twice (both small pizza's) and each time, I could only eat half. The thought of only eating half a small pizza amazes me even now. Most people seem to go to the restaurants but with pizza, I generally prefer ordering it since many pizza restaurants in The Loop can be quite crowded. I love pizza but I'm not going to wait outside for a table....no restaurant is that good.After trying Lou Malnati's and loving it, I got a small pizza with pepperoni and sausage. As a lover of cheese, it was awesome. Those that aren't big fans of cheese will hate this pizza. While I thought that Malnati's pizza was "better" in a technical sense, Giordano's tasted better to me...though I think both are comparable yet a little different.The meat and the ingredients were up to par. As a native Texan, it still amazes me to pick up a Chicago pizza and feel how heavy it is relative to the size of the box.If you are visiting the city and want to impress anyone you are with, I'd suggest figuring out your party's tastes. Those that like cheesy, "heavy" kind of pizza's will love Giordano's. Those that want more meat, more crust and a little less cheese will go with Lou Malnati's. You cannot lose either way. Now Gino's on the other hand.....I'll save that for another review.
