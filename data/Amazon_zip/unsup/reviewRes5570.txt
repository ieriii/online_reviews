Stumbled upon this place a few days after in had opened in early January. I had actually already eaten dinner, and thought the place was just a cheese/wine/meat shop. Ended up staying for hours and eating until I was sick (in a good way). I love everything I have ordered, and I've almost had everything on the menu. It is just hard to find a lot of these dishes downtown. The pig tails & bone marrow & fried sardines I JUST ALWAYS WANT MORE. This is another one of my favorite place to eat and take friends/coworkers too. It can get crowded & loud, but that never really bothers me. I also don't mind the long tables, but I know some people don't like that. It also feels good to see them doing so well. Bannos, Jr., as well as the other owners and staff, are super friendly and engaging. I love ordering the interesting dishes and introducing and sharing them with whomever I am with. I want to go their all the time. OH! I also really enjoy that I can (if my willpower is in working order) keep the tab pretty low. Even though the willpower usually isn't in working order...I can't wait for the weather to get super nice and then sit outside!!!
