I know this is a very popular place and a lot of people have given it five stars. This was the reason I picked it for my girlfriend's birthday. We really enjoyed it a lot- the cheese fondue appetizer, the salad, and the chocolate dessert were outstanding. They brought her a slice of pound cake drowned in chocolate which was absolutely sinful. It sounds clicheed, but I'd never used that word before to describe food, so I really meant it- this was incredible. Their red sangria was perhaps the best I've ever had. The server was very friendly, helpful but not obtrusive- well done. However, I was a little disappointed with the main course. We got the Connoisseur, which is shrimp, beef tenderloin, and lobster. The quality of the items was tip top, but they were wholly lacking in seasoning, leaving the sauces to do all the work of flavoring the meat. Though the sauces were good (especially the dill, teriyaki, cocktail, yellow curry, and, of course the butter!), I think something to enhance the meat would have gone a long way in improving the overall taste. My only other complaint was that the tables are really close together. We sat in a really nice section of the restaurant, with a wall of wine bottles separating us from the booth next to us- nice ambience. On the other side, the next table was literally seven inches away, making conversation a bit awkward, especially when the second group that sat next to us was a bit loud. Next time I may do whatever you have to do (I assume requesting it when making reservations) to get a booth. All in all, for the money, I think that as much as we enjoyed it, and as special as it was, for the money we could do a bit better. Nevertheless, this was truly a unique, memorable experience!
