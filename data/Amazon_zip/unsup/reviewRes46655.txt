This place had some amazing burgers, and the fries were fantastic! I sat at the bar for dinner after a festival in Lincoln Park. The bartender started telling us how we should of gotten their chips, and when we were all bummed out, he brought some out for us to try. Now thats satisfying the customer. I will definitely be back because this place was awesome, but then again, which lettuce entertain you restaurant isnt?
