I don't think I have ever had anything so decadent in my mouth as the Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage. Homemade duck sausage. Check Gads of fois gras. Check Truffle Aoili. Check Firm spongy bun. Check Get in my mouth. Check 2 seconds of inhaling the hot dog voraciously. Check Memories of Doug's and drooling. Check From the time that I got into line until that amazing hot dog in my belly, I felt like I had finally learned to appreciate what a good hot dog will do. Everyone was so passionate and friendly about their little institution. I say institution because it's a shrine to da'dog. Go, experience, eat.
