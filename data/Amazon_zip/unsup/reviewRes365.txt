After Alinea, everything else is just sustenance. Alinea nails idea through execution on the head. Whenever I eat, I always think whether ingredients could be added/changed, or whether an interesting idea wasn't carried out well. I could find no fault with any of our 16 courses. Not only are the concepts of each meal unique and cutting edge, the flavor/texture combinations were prepared perfectly. If you want to try something you've never tried before, THIS IS IT. Also, the service was seamless and the staff was genuinely happy and personable. My boyfriend ate out at almost all of Vegas' top restaurants (Michelin-starred or otherwise) during a 9-month work project, and he still states that none can compare to Alinea.
