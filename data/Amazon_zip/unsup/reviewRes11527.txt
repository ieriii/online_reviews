My Favorite Pizza Joint. This is where I take visitors to Chicago for some pie. Piece always delivers a big hearty meal and top notch craft beers/ales. There is almost always a wait. Count on that. If you are going on the weekend at a peak time, count on at least 90 minutes wait if not more. So while you are waiting, go hang across the street at one of the other bars, or go window shopping. Just plan on the wait or you will definetly be angry/disappointed. Piece can get pretty loud. Loud enough that you may need to shout across the table. Some areas of the restaurant are "less loud" than others, so you may want to ask about that when being seated if that matters to you.
