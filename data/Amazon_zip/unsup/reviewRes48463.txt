Some of the previous reviews of this place has got to be among the DUMBEST I have ever read. Bitching about the lights??? Really, jackass? People come to Yelp to read reviews about the food, service, and get tips about the dining experience - not about the fucking lights (which you are STILL wrong about, by the way). Well I for one, thought Publican was the highlight of my trip. We had a party of 8, reservations at 10:30pm, right after our meal at Avec! Although both are sister restaurants, I enjoyed the fare at Publican more. Every dish we ordered (oysters, sweetbreads, mussels, ham, and those oh-so-good pork rinds) were hits. Loved the seating, loved all the Pig artwork, and Loved the Publican overall. =)
