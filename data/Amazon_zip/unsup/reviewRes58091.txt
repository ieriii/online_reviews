My partner and I used to love this place but with the recent decor and menu change, the place is somehow less appealing. The restaurant put a good amount of money into redoing the interior, new chairs, tables, wall murals etc but now it just feels off. Guess I don't like change. The food is the same but the prices have gone up reflecting the overall upgrade of the restaurant.
