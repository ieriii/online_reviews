If you were wondering (and c'mon,you were) about where a good place would be to get stuck during a snowstorm, look no further. It's Bin 36. Frankly, with the snow blowing sideways outside, I wouldn't have initially cared which bin they stuck me in, but a warm, flavorful and healthy lunch did more than save me from the elements outside. They warmed me up, transported me, and gave me cause to forget about the weather altogether. I didn't try the soup, which in retrospect, seems to have been a mistake, as my dining companions each had a bowl, and each bowl looked fantastic (in turn they said it was). Instead I held out for pan-seared Atlantic salmon on a bed of carefully presented new potatoes, amidst a dill mustard sauce. The waitstaff was attentive but never hovered, they had ginger ale on tap (I almost high-fived one of them for that), and they made things, well, easy. I'd have to go back again to justify another star, but would definitely consider it. Besides, next time, I want my post-meal cookie. All the more to warm me against the approaching winter snow.
