i can't think of a better restaurant for my first review. i love this restaurant. my family orders here twice a month. my 3 year has been hooked on their pad thai since he was 18 months old. Having tried multiple thai places - this one is the best. they are really fast. fairly priced. and have authentic food. 2 thumbs up.
