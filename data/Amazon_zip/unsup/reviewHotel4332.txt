I stayed at the Palmer House for a couple of days last week. The hotel is old and beautiful. The rooms are on the small size for the price. I had to close the bathroom door to get to the mirror. The location is great for access to State St. and nearby restaurants and shopping. I was not overly impressed with the hotel food service, but the hotel staff was very friendly. The cleaning lady for my floor asked my how my day was going and if i needed anything. The room was clean and well kept.
