This place rocks! I come with a friend every other week and try to seat at the bar. Waiters here are just too weird and rude. The bartenders (mixologist) on the other hand are friendly and even thought sometime they're busy, they're always try to make a small talk. I would recommend to go on a week day and seat at the bar. There are always new drinks.
