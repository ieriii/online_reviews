I'm a tourist to the area but I come from a italian neighbourhood. I had home cooked, restaurant, tourist trap franchise italian food. I can cook it at home pretty well in my opinion. The first thing I told my friend we're going to eat after stepping off the plane is Chicago deep dish pizza and have it for lunch everyday! I've heard about it, but I never tried it. I was so hyped to try it. I talked to the hotel staff after check-in and they recommended for us to check out Giordano's. We left to Toronto at 10am, it was at noontime in Chicago when we arrived -- we were famished. So with our pizza mission defined we hopped in a cab and sped towards Giordano's. Ah there was line. But what's good is you can order your pizza before hand, as it takes 35mins to cook a deep dish pizza, this place is a tourist trap, but you know what? The deep dish pizza they put out is distinct and amazingly good! It can be made better, cheese a little too soft for my liking. Price is steep for a pizza. But man this one seriously heavy weight pizza. We ordered a large took half of it back with us and we ate that for lunch, dinner and breakfast. Why? Because you need to have a gut the size of a whale to eat more than a piece! Each slice is litterally the size of a panzorotti. :) Definately will be going back here next time I'm in Chicago. Love it! :D
