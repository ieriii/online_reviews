The big draw to Le Colonial for me is the atmosphere. Its dark, exotic interior transports me directly to French Vietnam (or what my mid-American psyche would imagine that to be). Tip: Eat upstars in the room off the lounge and share EVERYTHING because the portions are generous and there's so much delicious and interesting food to sample.
