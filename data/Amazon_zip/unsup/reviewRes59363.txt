OPEN FORUM TO MANAGEMENT: I have been the biggest fan of Fox and Obel for so long! However I just ate there the other day and they changed the menu......HORRIBLE. I was looking forward to my tuna melt, which was so delicious in the past. But this one had chunks of corn, watery tomatoes, some herb aoli---it was horrible, it was like they didn't know what they wanted to taste like so they just put everything in it. My fiance had the lobster club which they also changed, he couldnt even eat it. He said it had way to many flavors and it was overwhelming. TO MANAGEMENT! don't change a good thing. I now can't think about this place without getting a little sick, so most likely I won't be returning. CHANGE THE MENU!
