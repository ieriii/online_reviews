I'm not sure how I will select a better dinner option for my birthday this year. Mastro's seems to have everything under control. The bar area is extremely attractive and they sat us at one of the best tables in the restaurant. The steaks are all beautifully prepared and I can't comment enough on the staff. Steaks are some of the best I've had and ever side dish was better than the next. Do not pass up the butter cake, I was lucky enough to have it and a cherry cobbler complimentary for my special day!
