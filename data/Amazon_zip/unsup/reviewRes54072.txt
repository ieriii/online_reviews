PAY WITH CASH ONLY. OR ELSE YOU RISK BEING STOLEN FROM!!!I just opened my Bank of America home page. I was just doing routine budgeting. But I discovered, to my dismay, that VIOLET HOUR STOLE $17 from my bank account!!! You may not think this is a lot, and it's not, but when does it feel good to be robbed???? Here's what happened. My total bill came to $43 dollars. I gave a tip of $7. I paid with my debit card. When I looked in my account, I had a $43 dollar charge followed by a $24 dollar charge. This happened to me once before several years ago and I vowed never to use a card to pay a restaurant. But at some point that wasn't worth the hassle. Then came Violet Hour!Yes the lines are long. Yes the food is only okay. The atmosphere is not necessarily worth the wait. All of that is okay because my girlfriend really wanted to go to a speakeasy and the drinks are amazing. BUT THEY STOLE MONEY FROM ME!! IF YOU DON'T WANT THIS TO HAPPEN TO YOU, USE CASH ONLY. I am writing this even before calling Bank of America. As you can tell, I'm very upset. But I don't think that I'm being over the top. Hopefully my warning will save you 17 bucks. I guess that's the going rate for ripping people off these days (Madoff notwithstanding).
