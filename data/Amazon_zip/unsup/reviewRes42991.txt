I had no idea about Gilt Bar until I left Moe's and basically walked west on Kinzie. Very pleased that I decided to stop in. A sophisticated and sleek feel throughout. The bar in the basement looked intriguing as well. I just had the garlic olive oil spread with a small loaf of bread and some drinks. A great spot for a date.
