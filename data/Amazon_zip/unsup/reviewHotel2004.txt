I stayed at this hotel the weekend after valentines day as a treat to my fiance. Initially I had reserved to stay at the Martiott on the mag mile on north michigan. After reading reviews and looking at pictures, the marriott didn't have that wow factor I was looking for. Radisson aqau blu had it all. From the structure of the building to the lobby entrance down to the bathroom in the room, I was impressed. check in was fast and worry free. They were accommodating and made sure we had what we needed. Our room was awesome! Modern, clean, and relaxing. Carpet was aqua blu which was nice with marble floors and countertops in foyer and bathroom. it was definitely worth every penny spent! Our next stay will be in an executive suite for sure. If you need a place to stay I'd definitely recommend this place for your needs including dining.
