I love cheese. I really really do. So my review is a little biased since I didn't really have anything that the restaurant actually had to cook...But anywho... The boyfriend and I were getting a bit hungry and didn't know if we could survive another 2 hours before our 6:45 dinner reservations so we came here for a little snack. We had a cheese flight, some meats (Spanish Proscuitto and Salami), and 2 glasses of wine. I'm not sure what our flight was called... but it was one on the menu. It was a clever name and I think it had the words cow and goat in it. I don't remember all the cheeses but there was buffalo mozzarella, manchego cheese, and 2 other ones which I should've remembered because they were my favorite!! The wine we tried was nice but we're not wine people so I'm not exactly sure what nice is... We asked for recommendations and I think the waiter did quite well given we only told him we like something light and goes well with the cheese. The service was really helpful and the atmosphere was very casual. I absolutely loved the fig jam that came with our cheese place and the waiter was nice enough to bring me another cup full!
