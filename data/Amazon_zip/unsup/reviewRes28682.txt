Love, love, love it. I have been twice now and the food is so amazing. Its everything I want my Mexican food to be and so much more. The staff are very friendly and very knowledgeable about the food. The drinks are amazing. I highly recommend the blood orange margarita or the topolobampo margarita. I have had both the fundidos and thought them both delicious. The chicken, the duck, and the steak were so fantastic. For dessert we got the tres leches cake and fell in love. It's like heaven in you mouth. The restaurant is very busy and it's not some place to just drop in on and expect to get a table, reservations are a must but so worth planning a night out for.
