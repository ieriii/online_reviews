Five words: Mash potato and Clam Pizza! WOW! What a great pizza! They have really, really, good NY style pizza here. Thin and chewy but crisp edge. This place has got it right. They have great brew too. (not that I can drink it, but the people say it's great). Growlers! mmmmm. The goat cheese dip is amazing too! Prices are ok. A little on the high end, but worth it for the flavor. The white (garlic and olive oil base) pizzas are the best. Again, never in my wildest dog feet kicking dreams, thought I'd eat a mash potato and clam pizza, but SO GLAD I DID! My new favorite pizza. The others being the BBQ chicken, and meat lovers (of course). The atmosphere is cool. Seems to be housed in an old mechanics shop. Big open room with arched wooded ceiling. Guitars are tucked in and around the place too. That's because rocker Rick Neilson from Cheap Trick is one of the owner/operators of the place. Music is pumping. So it's loud. Seems to be a lot of families here. Kids and parents. I wouldn't think I find that crowd here, but hey. Better than Chuckie Cheese's. The only down sides to the place, it's very loud and the prices can get outta hand if you don't watch it. Otherwise, great, non Chicago style pizza and brew.
