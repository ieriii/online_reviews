I forgot to leave a review last fall when my family and I dined here for my birthday.  First off, there was no valet on a Saturday night! Really? This is supposed to be a high end steak place? Had to drop off my parents, park a few block away, pay the meter and go back to add time during our meal. Service was slow and the place wasn't even packed. The decanter for our wine was dirty and the server didn't even notice (I saw it after wine was already poured) Food was sub-par. I live in Chicago (i.e. not a tourist as most of the good reviews here are from) and am used to high end steaks. I had the Ribeye and it didn't come close to any of your other traditional steak places (i.e. Chicago Chop house, Gibson's, David Burkes, ect.) Definitely not what I would have expected for the price.
