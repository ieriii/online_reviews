Atmosphere is very cool. A fun place to bring friends to kinda show off, but not spend too much in the process. We were sat at the Library section in big comfy leather chairs, and read art books while waiting on our dinner. Very nice touch :) They also have nice beer specials daily and the food was very good. My recommendation is to try to Meatloaf sandwich. It was topped with fried onion strings and a tangy tomato chutney which was just amazing.
