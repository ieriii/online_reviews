Absolutely amazing. I came here on a Thursday night -- it was extremely busy. I opted to sit in their lounge area upstairs since I had not made reservations. It worked out great though because I liked the upstairs atmosphere better -- the downstairs is much more formal with white table cloths and the upstairs has dimmer lighting and sofas with lower tables. It was still early so most people were eating dinner in this area too, but as I was leaving it was starting to turn into more of a lounge-bar scene with less eating.  Everything I ordered was amazing from appetizer to dessert. The service was fast even with how busy the restaurant was. This is a great place to take a date or come for a special occasion with a big party.
