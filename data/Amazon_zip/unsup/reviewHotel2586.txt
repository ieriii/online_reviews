I went here Saturday to celebrate a co-worker's birthday, and I had a pretty good time. There were a few problems I had with the place though- the drinks were very over priced (Im talkin $8 beers) and the place was overly packed toward the point I think they exceeded fire code. Also the DJ booth wasn't blocked off so people constantly bumped the table causing the music to stop- very annoying.
