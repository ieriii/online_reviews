A friend took me to Le Colonial for the first time on 6/24 and it was definately one of the best dining experiences I have ever had! The waiter was wonderful, we relaxed with some delicious cocktails and a leisurely 4 course dinner. We shared everything and it was all delicious. My favorites were the salad with lotus root and tofu, the japanese eggplant and the whole red snapper.
