I booked this hotel on PRICELINE and just like my fellow YELPERS say, they don't give you the suite advertised. I knew this going into it so I asked why not and they told me they don't for people who booked through 3d parties. Well after giving them a dissapointed look and telling them I was not happy about this, the OMNI did right by giving me a proper suite that they advertise on their website. The hotel is a bit older but is still a great spot. Location can't be beat, as it is within walking distance to anything you want to do in Chicago except maybe Wrigley (5 miles away). I will def. use this hotel again in the future. The only reason I'm not going 5 stars is because the stunt they pulled by trying to give me a lower quality room for booking through a third party.  Tip: Any room that ends in 18 is going to be a lower quality room, do not accept this.
