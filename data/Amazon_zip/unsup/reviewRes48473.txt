I agree with everone who said it's super bright inside. I describe it a Country-Kitchen-bright. I like the beige uniforms on the servers. The whole atmosphere felt like a bland American chain restaurant redesigned by Scandanavians and taken up a few notches. I liked the charcuterie and sweetbreads, but was most impressed by quality of simple things like the chicken and ham. I could smell delicious smokiness within the bones as I gnawed, making me want to crack them open and get at the marrow. Did not do this, maybe next time.
