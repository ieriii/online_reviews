Seeking a way to define "cool" but having a hard time really pinning it down? Well, search no more. Simply visit Violet Hour and you will experience the true essence of "cool". From the heavy velvet drapes that hang from ceiling to floor, the high-back booths to the intimate seating areas for two; from the amazing offering of specialty cocktails to the house rules posted in the unisex restrooms, Violet Hour is truly cool. This is not a place to "get a drink" -- this is a place to enjoy a perfect cocktail expertly crafted by one of their mixologists in an atmosphere reminiscent of the speakeasy days long past.A few of my favorites: Of Grit & Grace; Half Way Cross Town, and The Old Square Sazarac. If there is a wait at the door hang in there...you won't be disappointed.
