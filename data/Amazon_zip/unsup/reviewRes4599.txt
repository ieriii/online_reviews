Hm, more like a 3.5, but everything was just a little pinch away from being mindblowingly delicious. The bf and I needed a late dinner, yes we dine at 11:30, and apparently this was the place to be! Friends recommended the place, since we're from out of town, and I'm really glad we went. Amazing wine selection that's perfect for pairing with all of the yummy snacks. Had the fried pig ear, which was darn tasty, but a little too salty...can't say it was an OMG UMAMI PORK moment, but it worked well with the crispy kale. MM! Artichoke heart antipasti was way too salty for me, and I throw on the salt when it comes to home cooking. We had the balsamico, mortadella, pistachio spread and it was beautifully presented with a web of balsamic reduction laced on top. The only downside to the aesthetic was that the vinegar reduction drowned out the subtleties of the rest of the dish. Evening's best dish was the gargantuan cave man turkey leg. Tender, falling of the bone and greasalicious (I mean that in the best possible way...). Highly recommend that, as it is probably the largest dish on the menu and only $15!
