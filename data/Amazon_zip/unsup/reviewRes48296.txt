A while back, I read an article in Bon-Appetit magazine about the how the sous-chef cures his own meats and was excited to give it a try. It was a bit difficult to find, tucked away in a trendy industrial neighborhood. It almost felt like the meat packing district in NY. The restaurant decor is simple, and the atmosphere is relaxed. Everything on the menu is full fat, butter, beer, wine, but well proportioned and balanced. The charcuterie (among other dishes) was flavorful, rich, and totally worth it!
