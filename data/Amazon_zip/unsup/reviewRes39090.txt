Oh my god! Sooo good! I tried the negroni cocktail and it's my new favorite summer drink, it's a must! Had olives , bone marrow , and mackerel . Olives of course were tasty , the bone marrow was a nice surprise (tasty bruschetta like ) that you scooped out of the bone and spread on grilled bread. We ordered the Tuna , skirt steak ,curried carrots and suckling pig with corn risotto . And by far the the sucking pig with corn risotto was by far amazing! Did I say amazing! I'm a big foodie and this did it for me! The favors were loaded and melted in your mouth. For dessert was amazing too , we had corn churros and financier and they were amazing too! So if you don't mind a little wait and can relaxi with a cocktail outside you will love it!
