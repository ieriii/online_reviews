People at my work (Spacio) across the street are always ordering lunch from the Mayan Palace, so I had to check it out! Mayan Palace isn't like other mexican dive restaurants that are so common place with this kind of cuisine, if you want classy mexican come here. The one thing that struck me most about this restaurant verses other mexican cuisine venues that I've been to was the attentiveness of the staff. The server was very familiar with the menu and even was able to suggest items based on what we said we were hungry for. As for drinks the water was clean, refreshing, and plentiful, we never had to ask. The peach maragita was very smooth and had little orange peel pieces that gave it a uniqueness, and yummy tangy taste. I had the combination plate with the chile relleno (edible from tip to stem), cheese enchilada (heavy mole, smoky sauce, yum), and open face taco. I can't wait to go back! They even have a "People On Yelp Love Us" sticker in the window.
