Come on people. You seriously trust the City of Chicago to decide what is clean and what isn't when the biggest Vermin this side of the Mississippi is running the city? Go in, check it out for yourself. ITS CLEAN. Ask to see the kitchen. Go with an LTH Forum Group--many times they have special dinners and tours. But please do not take what the City of Chicago, nay, the entire State of Illinois, says as absolute truth because they have been known to make absolutely inane decisions. Remember the Foie Gras debacle? Enough said. Check it out for yourself.
