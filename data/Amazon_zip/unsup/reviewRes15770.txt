This place shouldn't exist. On paper, it's a horrible business model: Limit the number of people inside so that everyone has a seat. Use only top-notch ingredients -- homemade bitters, Venezuelan rum, freshly peeled mango. Make each drink with such care that 15 minutes can pass between ordering and taking your first sip.  But oh my God, does this place rock. Everything about it, the high-backed blue velvet chairs, the smooth-baritoned bouncer who shows you to your seat, the so-good-your-eyes-roll-back-in-your-head-with-every-sip drinks, is aimed at producing an exquisite experience.  With an atmosphere this cool, the drinks could be totally half-ass. With drinks this amazing, they could serve all the alcohol in the crappy little hallway that serves as a waiting area and I'd be happy to stand there for hours. But put both together and give me a bartender in suspenders, and I'm done. I've found it. The most perfect bar in the world.
