Meli Cafe is one of my favorite places for breakfast. I've been here a couple of times to try different things and everytime the food has been perfect. The place is crowded on the weekends and they don't take reservations, so it's best to go early. They make their own butter and jam and it's really good. They infuse honey in the butter and it is so yummy on toast. I've tried the vegetable omlette, , the ham asparagus & mozzerella frittata, the belgian waffle, strawberry stuffed french toast, and crab cake on a english muffin drizzled with hollandaise sauce- all YUM. My fiance had their honey cornmeal pancakes which was a little bland, but the menu offers a variety of pancakes with different flavors and sauces. They also have really good coffee. I definitely recommend this place.
