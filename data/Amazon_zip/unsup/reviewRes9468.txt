Good Vietamese food is hard to find, but this place hit it right on! The food is delicate but filling, and the flavors are amazing. It's a very refreshing type cuisine where I ate enough but didn't leave feeling overly stuffed and uncomfortable. I even had room for crime brle for dessert, which was delicious! Another thing I liked was the decor. There were real palm trees and the interior was such that I felt like I was In a beach club steps away for the sand!
