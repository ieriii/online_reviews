Wakamono is my favorite sushi place in Chicago. The fish is so fresh and the maki combinations are very creative. My favorite is the Godzilla roll with eel wrapped around the outside. They also have some of the best tasting sashimi. They are BYO but they also have a pretty good bar. The people who work there are generally nice and the service has always been great for me. The tables are small and the backless seats are not very comfortable. The wait can be very long if you don't have a reservation so go on a tuesday or something. Wakamono can be pricey, but it is well worth it!
