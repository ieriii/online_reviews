This place rules. My friend from St Louis brought it to my attention, which should never happen (I'm so ashamed), but apparently he had seen it on some TV show. He was visiting last month and, as we were driving up Milwaukee, said "Hey, there's that Costa Rican place that I saw on TV. You should check it out." I said, "Huh? Never heard of it. Costa Rican? Hmm...sounds interesting." So it's been on my list for several weeks, and when it came time to pick a birthday spot, this came first to mind. I just wanted a fun little place with good food and no pretension, and that's exactly what we got. And holy shit, is the food ever good. Chifrijo appetizer--A; chicken casado--A; chicken tico--B+. I went home with a bunch of leftovers thanks to the enormous portions. My friends all liked their dishes. The chips are not that good, so don't show up hungry and not be able to control yourself. Save your stomach space for the deliciousness which lies ahead. It's like when Mom always said, "Don't fill up on bread." We got there at 6:30 and were seated but when we left close to 8, there were people waiting. On a Tuesday! Popular place, I guess, and for good reason. I want to return ASAP.
