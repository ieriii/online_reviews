I like this place. The California Club Pizza is my favorite. I like to say I'm eating healthy by getting that (riiight).  The garlic knots were not overly impressive. Sometimes, I go in and get the slices & a soda. Good prices and they usually have a good variety for slices unlike most places where they just have pepperoni and sausage. We ordered a few pizzas last week and I don't know that I was as in love with them as I am the California Club. We got supreme and a sausage pizza. The menu is a bit overwhelming based on the variety offered - I like that. Sometimes their delivery time is way out of wack - 2 hours??
