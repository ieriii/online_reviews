Unbelievable! My best friend had gift certificates for here because she is the ultimate foodie and I was lucky enough to be her date for the evening. I was blown away with the entire meal. The wine pairings were perfect and the service was excellent. It was for sure the most interesting and exquisite dinner that I've ever experienced. If money isn't an issue and you want an experience while dining then this is the place to go.
