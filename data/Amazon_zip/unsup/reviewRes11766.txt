Every 18 months or so I fall for it. I go on a weekend night and get food and/or beer spilled on me... often by the staff of angry waitresses. I don't really blame them for being angry, since the place is a zoo of people standing around everywhere dealing with their horrible wait, but that's no excuse for treating seated customers nasty. So the experience pretty much sucks, but the beer is decent, and the pizza is often good. Overall, good food is enough for me to look past a lot of crap, but piece just goes way too far and I leave the place feeling like I've been used.
