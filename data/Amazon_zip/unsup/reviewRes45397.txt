Sit by the fire, relax. Great that there are really different ways to experience this joint. I've been in the bar with a bar scene once, and by the fire with a cozy fireside chat in the library once - either way it feels totally solid. Attention to detail in the space makes it a great room to sit in for a while. Most impressed by the versatility of the space - really hard not to feel comfortable here! The food is good, nice specials, plenty of different beer on tap, and good spirits! (not to mention company!)
