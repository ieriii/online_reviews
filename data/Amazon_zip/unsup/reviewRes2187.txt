Things I dislike: sausage, tomatoes, mustard, relish, pork, avocado, onions, mayonnaise.  Things I love: The Keira Knightley, Atomic Bomb, BLT, Taco Sausage, and any other beautiful concoction Doug comes up with. I was nervous on my first trip to Hot Doug's, because I am so incredibly picky. Grilled cheese, strawberries, and salsa are really all I need. But after my first trip, I was hooked. Seriously, EVERYTHING is great. Foie Gras? Count me in! Unfortunately, I moved back to Kansas City. Looking at the website right now, I see that I am missing out on Jamaican Jerk Pork Sausage with Spicy Mango-Passion Fruit Mayonnaise and Roasted Plantains, Jalapeno-Cheddar Pork Sausage with Jalapeno Mayonnaise and Habanero-Jack Cheese, and Spicy Thai Chicken Sausage with Thai Peanut Sauce and Toasted Coconut. I am kicking myself for moving. If I ever move back to Chicago (which is very likely), Hot Doug's will be the first place I go. Doug is super nice, and I have never met anyone in line who wasn't friendly. A plus since the line can get a little ridiculous.
