Another fabulous, fantastic cocktail space in Chicago. Yes, it's popular, and yes, you'll be waiting in line if you get there at 10PM on a weekend night -- but if you make it through or just time it right -- sooooo worth it once you're in! Their cocktail menu features some classic-inspired and more contemporary cocktails, organised by type of base liquour. The cocktails get switched around periodically based on season, hot new cocktail trends, and really just the bartenders' whim. Needless to say, the bartenders really know their stuff, and are happy to offer tastes and whip up off menu cocktails based on your preferences if you strike up a conversation. So sit at the bar, get friendly, and get ready to get seriously impressed by some beautiful cocktails!
