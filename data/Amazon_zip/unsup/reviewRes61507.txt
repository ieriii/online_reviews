This is a carry out spot. The chicken is delicious but the wait is not. A short wait is 15 minutes. if you get your food in less than 5 minutes then it was probably ready already and you want a new order. It would be 5 stars but again the wait + the cover charge to leave the joint (the guys outside asking for money when you leave with your food) = 4 stars tops. The food is delicious if its cooked fresh and the sauce is pretty good (for those of you who rate food by its condiments). For those looking for a comparison to Harold's, it's about neck and neck with a GOOD Harold's(you know what I mean). It doesn't taste the same (because it's a different spot) but it's every bit as good as a good Harold's and certainly better than J&J or Shark's for chicken.
