I came here for the first time this weekend to celebrate my boyfriends birthday. We walked in to a very nice restaurant, with sharply dressed people. There were some people in jeans as well, but seriously, don't, you'll come accross as either ghetto or underdressed. Despite the fact we had reservations, we had to wait a little bit in the bar area. However, the service was super friendly, and they added the bar tab to our check.  Once our pager went off, we sat down to enjoy some very flavorful meats. The waiters were always super attentive and friendly. The meat kept right on coming as soon as we turned the card to green. We could pick off as much as we wanted of each item, and we got to choose what level of "done" we wanted our meat. I hate medium rare or anything not well done, but this meat was super flavorful and done right. Even I liked the pink on the perfectly seasoned steaks. Our drinks were refilled constantly. My boyfriend and I really enjoyed the food and the service. We were so full, we couldn't even hit the salad bar or try any of their desserts.  The downside to this place is the lack of parking, but for about $11ish, you can get valet. It's $50 per person, but add in drinks, tip, and valet, and you're looking at a really hefty bill at the end of the night. However, I think it's worth the experience, and I'd definitely come back here again.
