I have to admit that I've taken to judging Chinese/Thai restaurants by their Crab Rangoon... and I think I've just stumbled upon the ultimate Crab Rangoon, at Indie Cafe Thai & Sushi: paper-thin wrappers, and the touch of pepper in the filling makes them so delicious, I could've easily made a dinner from them alone. But the great tastes don't stop there. Indie Cafe is a hip, hole-in-the-wall joint: feng shui-spartan design consisting of a dozen tables and half a dozen seats at the sushi bar. The menu comes in a metal CD-case, consisting of small laminated pages outlining your menu choices and giving plenty of pictures to help you decide. Lots of variety in Japanese and Thai dishes, superb selection of sushi and sushi rolls. In addition to the most amazing Crab Rangoon *ever*, I had the spring rolls - which were more sushi than traditional-style spring roll - and a chili-hot seafood salad that was as beautiful as it was tasty. The staff was nice, the prices were reasonable (dishes run from $3-17, with most in the $4-8 range), and all the food was great. I couldn't believe I had not discovered this gem earlier!
