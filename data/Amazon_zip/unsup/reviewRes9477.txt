The best dinner I have had in the past 2 months...and I just went to Girl and the Goat (sorry Stephanie!) Started off w/the Egg, Entre of pork, and finished off w/the corn dessert. The Egg was heavy on the truffle oil and delicious as was the entree. The corn dessert was not too sweet and well balanced. The flavors overall were amazing. With a bottle of wine paid $70 and was well worth it! I will be back dale!!
