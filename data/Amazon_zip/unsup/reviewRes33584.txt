Yum Yum, how have I never been here before, esp since it's so close! Came here for Sunday brunch around 12:30 and surprisingly, it wasn't too crowded. They have a great fresh italian type menu as well as a small brunch menu. I got the sausage fritatta which was great! They also had an awesome bruschetta app that had lots of feta and arugula. They had great desserts, too--try the creme brulee or the Torta Lava cake--covered in strawberries too! The service was great. 5 stars all around.
