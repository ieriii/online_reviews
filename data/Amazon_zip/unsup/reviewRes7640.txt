Loved, loved loved. Went for a friends birthday party. We had reservations and had the large table on its own by the window. They brought menus out with his name and birthday wishes on it, which i thought was really cool. The service was great. I had the ceasar salad to start, very flavorful with a nice amount of parm cheese on top. For dinner I had by far one of the best pasta dishes I have had in a long time. Granted it was simple but man it was full of flavor. I had the i think the pasta type was rigatoni? not sure but it was large noodles with stewed tomatoes, olive oil and melted mozzarella. oh my so good. I was so full after half I wanted to finish it all but just couldn't. The space was dimly lit and cozy. Best Italian I have had in this city so far.
