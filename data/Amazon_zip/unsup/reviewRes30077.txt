Live music, even on a Wednesday, with a coffee shop feel, but still on the restaurant classy side. I really loved my experience here with my buddies playing our card game. The laid back environment allowed us to have fun, and still feel like we had gone out. There was a live guitarist singing all my old folk favorites, and the server was quick to take our orders. I had the 3rd Burger which was melt in my mouth pleasure. Loved the sauteed red onions, and the accompanied Caesar salad. It was halfway between a chopped/regular salad. Yummy in my Tummy! I'm definitely coming back here to hang out.
