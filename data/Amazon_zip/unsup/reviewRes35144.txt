Best seafood restaurant in the city. Fresh and yummy. They have a formal dining room, and while nice, I have always felt a little rushed in there. Now, the oyster bar is a whole different--good--different world. Counter or tall table seating. Watching the guys shuck the oysters. Great place. Freshest oysters we've had in Chicago. AND, the best lobster roll here (this is coming from someone who lived in Maine for 5 years). The oysters and lobster rolls are as good as (one of my all time favorite restaurants in New York) The Grand Central Oyster Bar. Very good restaurant.
