The food is fine, possibly slighlty better than other fine restaurants. The ambient is beautiful and my wife loved it. The tables are too close each other and it is quite difficult to make a conversation in the table. The waitress was nice, a little bit disoriented when asked about the dishes, not explaining well the menu. The dishes ARE VERY VERY SMALL and I do not think the price is fair at all. The price is out of proportion to the size and quality of the dishes. OVERPRICED. The popcorn was a disroganized cheese and carbohydrates, all together, a mess!. It took 35-40 min to get the pork dish. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant and I won't come back in the future. This restaurant is for people who loves the chef.
