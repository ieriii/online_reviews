I have to say my first Rick Bayless experience was an AMAZING one. I can't why to try his other two restaurants. I went for lunch by myself here and had to order to dishes. The Tortas I has was the Pepito, short ribs. Simple flavors that really stand out and complement each other so well in the sandwich. The crispy bread that crunches as you bite into... yumm! My favorite however was the Caldos. I had the short rib Red Chile Soup. I cannot get over how wonderful and fresh the broth tasted. Vegetables had a little bit of firmness to them, and the meat was great. I can't wait to go back, which I will and try some of the other Tortas. If you don't want to wait in line you can order to go, which is much much much faster. I would recommend that you get it to go and find the closest spot to sit down and chow down! Also the price is very reasonable!
