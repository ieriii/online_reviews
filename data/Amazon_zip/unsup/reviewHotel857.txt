I was very pleasantly surprised by the Silversmith. Got a really nice and well-appointed suite-type room on the 8th floor toward the center of the hotel with tall windows. Luckily, the windows were not in the front where the elevated CTA trains run. The hotel was upgrading guests to king suites, and the suite and bathroom were very spacious and tastefully decorated in a masculine classic style: 2 closets, french doors, 2 televisions, upholstered window bench, and loveseat. No noise issues, and housekeeping was also respectful of the 'do not disturb' sign. I actually used the business center computer, which was fast and seemed virus-free, and had the front desk send a fax for me without any hassle or charge. Hotel is really conveniently located 2.5 blocks from the blue line (O'Hare) and right next to other loop trains. It is also about a block from Millenium Park (one of the main reasons to stay here) and Michigan Ave shops. Fantastic location and value for the price! You get the boutique feel with understated elegance.
