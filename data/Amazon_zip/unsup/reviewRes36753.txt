My friend from work brought me here for lunch and, I have to say, the food was pretty amazing. We ordered the omelet on naan and the polenta pancakes.We split both -plenty of food for two people. WOW! It was just such good food. I'm always disappointed by restaurant pancakes...too "rubbery" for me. But these were really fluffy and had a mild corn flavor. Almost like a corn muffin but a pancake. It gets pretty crowded during lunch so go early or a bit later to avoid the 12pm crunch time. Lots of great choices and friendly owner and staff! Lots of street parking. Check it out!
