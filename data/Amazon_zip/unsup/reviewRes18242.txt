I live right down the street. Like, i just park in front of my house and walk over...like it only takes 30 seconds for me to get there. I even catch the bus right in front of this place...but, I only just now made it inside. The bestie and I were in search of something delicious to eat and also to drink. Our first choice (margaritas and mexican) was closed (gasp!!) even though it was only 8:30pm on a Sunday. I mean, I do living in Chicago right? Things actually close early on Sundays? Weird. Anyway, we decided to try the Bad Apple when we ended up at home and still hadn't eaten. The staff was friendly, the clientele was a little on the artsy side, though the Bulls were playing and I've never seen so many funky-framed glasses wearing peeps cheer on a sports team!  Our server suggested some cocktails when we mentioned we wanted a delicious bev but weren't in the mood for beer or wine. We ended up with the In Your Dreamsicle (which was a tasty throwback to the little cups and flat wooden spoons of my childhood) and a Kitchen Koolaid which tasted exactly like red Kool-aid. For food we went with burgers. Just plain and simple Bad Apple Burgers but we upgraded to the pretzel roll and added grilled onions. Oh, and you know me...I had them put some bacon on it too!  The burgers were good. Nothing bad to say about them. Just wondering how this place ended up with a "Voted best burger in Chicago" sign out front? Fair enough-I only had a simple burger and not one of the fancier options on the menu...but if you're serving the "best burger" even the most simple one on the menu should be amazing...or at least that's my opinion. So...will I be back? Hard to say. Was there anything wrong that will keep me away? No. Was there anything special that will lure me back in time and again? Nope. Pretty sure next time I want a burger that's close by I'll end up at Smokin' Woody's...because damn, their burgers are amazing!
