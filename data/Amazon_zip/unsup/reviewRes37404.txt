many moons back a highschool buddy's mom used to own this joint and thank goodness she sold the place to people with incredible insight and heart. The customers are pretty damn friendly here as my group grew beyond the maximum capacity of the cozy booths and led us to playing musical chairs with a couple of groups who smiled and simply made it into a game of accommodating us. Beers RAWK and mussels are still tasty heart warming goodness as the cold chicago weather seemed at least 3 miles away despite just being right outside the front door. Metered parking on clark only lasts 2 hours so bring many quarters to feed( yes DD's still exist and can have loads of fun without getting loaded here). It does get packed as somebody obviously told a friend who told 2 friends and so on and so on....so get there early and stay late as this place is good food for the soul.
