I've been here so many times it's hard to remember. My buddy and I love to come here and make fun of the suburbanites while enjoying a delicious, reasonably-priced steak. Yes, I know this is a chain. I am not that snooty (or downright stupid) to care about stuff like that. Service here is always FANTASTIC. No matter how we're dressed, we are always treated like royalty (I have a penchant for rocker T's and jeans). Wine selection is great and the waiters will always let you know what to pair your steak with (bring back the Bommarito!!). I always get the filet, my buddy always gets the strip. Both are consistently delicious (we share, so what?). Sides are great (love the broccoli) and if you can save room, GET DESSERT! Also, try your steak Oscar style next time, you will not be disappointed. SIZZLE! Love that hot steak coming out of the broiler with the butter popping and dancing on the plate. This is how a steak should be served.  Overall this place is great. Check it out if you want a good steak and don't feel like dropping $250 at Morton's.
