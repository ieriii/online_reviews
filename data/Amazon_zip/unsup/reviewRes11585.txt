Ok, here's the deal. I love the Bongo Room. It has a GREAT menu. I love their croissant sandwiches. I'm obviously not going to get any skinnier ordering those or their french toast so it is now my special brunch treat. I look forward to those designated days when I pig myself out on their delightful food and enjoy my friends' company in the cool space it occupies!!!
