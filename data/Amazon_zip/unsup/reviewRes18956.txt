The drink selection is great, but best of all, every server knows that extensive menu inside and out. There are few places I've been where I can say this and believe me, it is a great feature. Because there are so many drinks, cocktails and beers on the list, I always feel like I'm in good hands with knowledgeable, fun servers and bartenders.
