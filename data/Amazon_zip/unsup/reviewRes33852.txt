I like this place ... I don't LOVE it but I do like it. The atmosphere and decor is really refreshing, it just wakes you up. The food, although plentiful, seemed mediocre to me. I should've ventured a bit more into their omelets or specialties. I did try my friend's Eggs Florentine and thought that was really good. The pancakes were decent, nothing special. I did not enjoy their coffee one bit and the fact that I had to grab creamer from another table annoyed me a bit. Ew, that coffee was not good. I did like the service, the waiter didn't rush us at all. We were there for well over an hour, maybe almost 2 hours. I'll probably head back to try something else. Maybe they'll sway my opinion to a 4 or 5 star.
