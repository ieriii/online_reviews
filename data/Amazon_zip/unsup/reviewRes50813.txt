For the build up I read in the reviews before I went here, I have to say this had a hard time earning as much as a 2. In the end, this resturant earned a 2 because of dessert, and the server was very nice, and they had soft live music in the resturant as well, so ok atmosphere. But I dine for the consumables, and here there was a blatant lack of good consumable stuff. I had the soup Dojour, mushroom, so the menu said, so the server said, but not my eyes, and it sure fooled my taste buds. Mushroom, where, how, says who??? If it did not show me 1 srhoom, taste, smell, or even appear to resemble anything srhoom-like: SO how can it be called anything else but "Bland Green Porrige consistancy warm cup of soup -like stuff". So much for course 1. Bread with soup, less impressive then the soup, how you ask? don't. Dinner, turkey slices, aspragus, stuffing, mac and cheese, and cranberry sauce. I skipped the cranberry sauce, but the rest of the meal was cut rightout of my memory of dorm dayz back in school on budget day. Bland, un-inspired, small ish portions, a dolop of stuffing that would make a crab cake look big, equally small and DOA trukey slices that Swanson would not freeze for a microwave prision dinner, and did I mention small? Not fit for a cheap date you are intentionally trying to chase away. The desert, cranbery - apple crisp. Not at all what I know of as an Apple Crisp dish, but light, tastey, unique, and tart but not sweet, like you would expect. Quite different from dinner, this had thought and effort behind it, at least this ended dinner on the highest note it offered me for my evening. So the final dish lifts this out of the a well deserved 1 to just reach a duce, but barley that, and 'duce' was chosen on purpose. Not a repeat vist worthy establishment for sure.
