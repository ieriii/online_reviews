Weeellll, it was good until we got some 'tude from the waitress when it came to splitting payments. That said, the food is decent, nothing special. They pre-cook the pasta and make the sauce in the pans behind the bar. It could be fresher, but overall it's decent. If you're looking for an authentic Italian trattoria this is not the place. I knew this coming in and just expected OK Italian food. It was just ok, nothing to write home about.
