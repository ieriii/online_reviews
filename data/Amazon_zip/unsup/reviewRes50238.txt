Went here on a Saturday night, where t was busy but not packed. The ambiance was great and made you truly feel like you were in a Restaurant in the south. Our waitress was great and very knowledgable with the menu. We are rookies to the southern style food so we kept it pretty safe. Started with the gumbo ya-ya appetizer. It had great flavor and was spicy without being too much. Also, the cornbread was delicious! So soft and tasty! For our main dishes we got the pork sandwich and pork and beans. Both were excellent. It might have been the best pork sandwich I've ever had. We had one of their punch drinks, very good, very strong! We will definitely be back here again! Can't wait to try some more risky items next time!
