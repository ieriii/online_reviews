In 4 words: Latin American soul food! In a few more, all it took to make me feel like I was on vacation was a mojito, some freakin' awesome meat and carbs, more dessert than I could ask for, and a colorfully festive dining room. The grilled skirt steak (arrachera) was so perfectly grilled - and served with equally tasty beans, rice, and sweet red onion - that Bobby Flay should be rushing over to do a throwdown. The waitstaff was right on top of service, so much so that it allllmost felt like we were rushed. "Um, you don't have a butter knife because the bus boy cleared the table already." I tip my hat to Chef Mark. LOVE!
