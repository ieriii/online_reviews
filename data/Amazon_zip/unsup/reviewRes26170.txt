Mission: find a friend, go to Simply It on Tuesday or Wednesday evening, enjoy delicious food for $25. Not each, TOTAL. As in $12.50 each (plus tax + tip) for 2 appetizers, salad, 2 entrees, fresh fruit, and tea. 2 summer rolls and 2 dumplings started off our meal. Both were yummy and FRESH, and the dipping sauces were fantastic. The shrimp papaya salad was next, and it is so crisp and refreshing! I loved the chili lime dressing. Our entrees were the ginger chicken and beer with asparagus, which we shared. I would easily order both entrees again, the ginger chicken was so moist and delicious and the sauce on the beef with asparagus was delish. We finished our meal with a small plate of fresh grapes and pineapple, a very nice touch. Overall, the meal I enjoyed here was above average --- everything was very fresh and NOT greasy at all. BYOB, plus "$25 for 2" deal on Tuesdays/Wednesday makes this place an exceptional value. Go check it out for a weeknight date!
