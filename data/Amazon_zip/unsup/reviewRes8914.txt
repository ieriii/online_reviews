Bing bing bing - About as good as it gets. And I mean 5 stars in terms of taste, service and satisfaction not as in terms of foofy dining experiences. It's pretty laid back here. Going with a small group and ordering family style is the way to experience a little of everything -- and its all good. The four of us ordered 8 kabobs, and every morsel was sublime as were the appetizers. There was even some left over to take home. One thing left me scratching my head though. My wife ordered a glass a of Pinot Grigio and thought it tasted like Greek Retsina. So, for a second round she got Chardonnay and, to her it tasted like... Greek Retsina. Could be her altimeter was mis-calibrated that night -- or maybe there's only one big jug of wine behind the bar.
