Convenient location, casual cozy bar and pretty nice beer/wine selection. Kind of pricey, $14/glass and a half. There was a really good dogfishead chicory stout that was totally delicious and strong on draft. One major booboo - they served their whiskey in a wine glass with ice...waatttttt????? Only one person ordered something to eat; the salad looked pretty weak but it was like 10 pm on a Monday evening... I did appreciate that 7 of us were able to sit together by squishing three tables in the same area and no one cared/said anything.
