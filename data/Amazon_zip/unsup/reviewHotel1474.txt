This is a fabulous hotel. My room was a suite and overlooked Michigan Avenue and the Apple Store (with its grass roof...very cool sight). The room was sparkling clean, the internet access was fast and easy to access and the room was quiet. They even do a turn down service in the evening...something I hardly ever see any more. I was there for a conference. All food and service was excellent. This is also a great location with shopping and restaurants everywhere adjacent. I very much recommend this hotel.
