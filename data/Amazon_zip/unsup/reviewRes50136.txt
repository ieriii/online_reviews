Ok, I've been here twice now and both times I've left slightly pffted at the service and less than attentive staff, which I think reflected my opinion of the food. This last time is warranting the review because I agree with some other folks that the service is either really high or really low. My first visit, it was just weird. Our waitress was cuckoo...just an odd duck. Albeit she took care of us well, she gave me goosebumps a couple times because of her weird sayings and uncomfortable questions. The second time (and sorry, but prolly the last time I'll go) I checked in with my party, and because of the narrow waiting space, stepped off to the side to allow other people to check in....and watched as we were disregarded and party after party got sat before us. That host stand needs some help...I finally said something and then we were sat immediately. Where we had a very lovely water boy keeping our water glasses full...but no waitress. Finally, when the water boy came to fill our glasses for the second time, we again had to draw attention to the fact that a server hadn't visited us yet. And immediately the manager was there, apologetically to take a drink order. But still no server. Hmphf. We finally placed our order and received beignets while we waited. That were cold...which is a bummer because these babies should melt in your mouth. Our food quickly arrived thereafter and was ok. I got the Eggs New Orleans w/ grits. Served on popovers...I think I may have preferred english muffins because the popovers were hard to cut and keep everything intact. But still yummy. The manager was nice enough to discount our drinks from the check...but we still felt slightly neglected by the end of our meal based on our experience.
