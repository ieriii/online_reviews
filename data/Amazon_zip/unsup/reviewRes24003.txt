Just not that impressed. Granted, I'm not a Chinese food expert, so I went with the "safe" choice -- the famous hot pot. It was alright, and a novel way to eat, but at the same time way pricey for what it was ($16 per person). Of the 40 fondue-dipping ingredients the menu promised, probably only half showed up, and while there was plenty of meat selection to chose from, the vegetables that we were interested in never really showed up. The hot broth is hot and little else, and it just wasn't a very interesting mix of flavors at all.
