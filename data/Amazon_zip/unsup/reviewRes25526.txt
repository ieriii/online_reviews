I love Geja's because I'm a dipper! What's not to love about dipping bread/fruit into bubbly melty cheese, meat /veggies into hot oil and then dipping them into sauces, and then fruit/poundcake into chocolate. I love the choice in sauces, and their selection of meats and high-end seafood like lobster. I don't love how I smell when I leave there...like I've been baked in oil for an hour. It's nice for a splurge. I've been here 5 times....and I love it each and every time.
