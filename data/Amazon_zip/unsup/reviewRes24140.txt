Let me prime you with the fact that we were REALLY excited to eat here. We're getting married in CR next year and we really wanted to love this local spot. Okay, so maybe it's our fault for going on a Friday, but I've never been told that it would be a 35 minute wait and then not getting a table for over and hour and a half. Granted we were already hungry when we got there, but not getting to eat for over 2 hours will make anyone grumpy. The staff was very nice and they felt bad for our situation, but offered to comp $0. The food WAS good once we finally got it, but maybe it just tasted extra good once the starvation kicked in. Dine in? Never again. Take out? I'd give it another shot (even though it's really expensive for a take out place).
