The only way this would be 100% gold is if Mr Bayless himself came out to say hi so...... Yeah... Ok I'll get over my disappointment someday - so 5 stars it is!!!! now for the fun part. The food was AAaaamazziingggg! After several years of watching the seafood loving mexican cooking in Ricks show, I was just overly jazzed to be sitting in the restaurant. We had no reservation, walked in on a Wed night at 8pm ready to wait for an hour or so, only to be seated in minutes. (one star earned). Next came the tequila drinks fresh and shaken at your table the mango mojitooooo rocks!! Fresh basil and mango yum (2nd star). Then appetizer of what was the show stopper in my opinion - seafood Yucatecan ceviche (100 stars!!!!). Seriously such great flavor, the lime juices, cilantro, delicate seafood pieces so fresh and so full of flavor yum yum yum and hot tortilla chips - this disappeared in minutes. Main course was the mole trio sauce ( lamb) so good - (I'm out of stars!!) with tortillas and we got extra tortillas on the house and an explanation of how the mole sauce is made for three days stewing. The servers were happy, explained all the meals and a pleasure to be around. Don't think about it, just go and enjoy a lovely night out in a fun atmosphere. Done.
