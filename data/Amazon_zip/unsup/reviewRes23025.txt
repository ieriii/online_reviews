Superdawgs is a nostalgic place for me. Every time I would be going to grandma's we would drive by and I would want to go to Superdawgs instead. Quite a few adventures in high school took me here. Many times now I drive by here on my way to visit my mom. This place with its winking hot dog lady on top is a seared image in my memory. The crispy fries that make the warm bed for my Superdawg which is oh so nestled and tucked away, waiting for me to open it and release it tastiness. I've always either had my dawgs to go or eaten in the little sit down next door, but they still do the car service, rain or shine. And like anytime I eat here it is given with a smile. Is this place fancy? No. Is it amazing? No. Does it warm the cuckolds of your heart? Yes, it usually does for me. This is not only a Chicago institution, but apparently an American one. What does that mean? I'll have two Chicago Superdawgs, no onions please.
