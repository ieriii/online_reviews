You usually go to a Pho restaurant to eat pho and while the pho here is exceptional, I almost always get the pork chops. They are just so good here. Finding a seat right away can be a little daunting because this place is always packed and for good reason, the food is great. But it doesn't take long to get a seat and once seated it doesn't take long to get your food. I highly recommend this place for very good Vietnamese food.
