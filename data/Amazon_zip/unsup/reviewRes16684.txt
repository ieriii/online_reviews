If I could give 4.5 stars, I would. And the only reason Carnivale isn't snagging a fiver from me is because of the seating (at 6pm with the large open space nearly empty, do you need to seat the two top next to us when there are others open?) Everything else, though, was fantastic. The Niman Ranch steak my partner had was melt-in-your-mouth tender, cooked exactly how she asked and my never-finishes-a-whole-meal companion ate even the last bite. Guac was fresh and limey with chunks of avocado that clung to the crisp house-made chips. A cheese plate starter and red wine flight were paired perfectly - even the honey and almonds played well together. The empanada de maiz I had was stuffed with roasted corn and spinach, and the cotija cheese melted everything into a savory marriage. The huge loft-like warehouse space is rich with vibrant colors and enormous mirrors and lamps hang throughout. And to top it all off, our server, Anton was brilliant. Being that we weren't in after-work suits, are younger and might not look the 'money' part, he was polite, professional and never once brushed us off. He described everything in-depth and gave wonderful suggestions. Even though Carnivale clearly doesn't need another Yelp review, it's hard to avoid writing when the experience was top notch.
