I have a love for all things pizza. I like it in many varieties: thick, thin, super thin, veggie and meat. My husband wanted to go here for his birthday dinner and I was super excited! We went in on a Monday night and it was surprisingly busy. We didn't have to wait for a table so that was a bonus. We each got our own pizza and it was plenty big to have leftovers for the next day. It is super thin crust so it's easy to eat the entire small by yourself if you are ravenous. I had the red pizza with goat cheese, tomato and artichoke. The goat cheese was on the skimpy side but still delicious. I wasn't able to finish the whole pizza but came close. My husband had the white pizza with chicken and broccoli. He loved his but it seriously had 3 pieces of broccoli on the whole pizza! I like how you can customize your pizza at Piece. There are so many options and the toppings are a plenty. The prices are about average for the area. They have a lot of micro brews and the price on beer is very reasonable! Our waitress was nice and attentive. We will probably go back again. Just beware of the high noise level due to the TVs with games. Piece is a fun place to watch a game with some friends but think again for a romantic dinner with your honey.
