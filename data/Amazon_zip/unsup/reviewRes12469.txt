Atmosphere: 5 stars Service: 5 stars Food: 3 stars (5 for dessert and drinks) This place was okay, but nothing to write home about. A group of us went there for dinner. The drinks were very strong, which is a plus. The dinner was alright. I had a cuban ribeye that was supposed to have some authentic sauces, but the taste was pretty bland. I loved the fried potatoes and the plantanes that were on the plate (forgive my spelling and lack of knowledge of the authentic names). I've heard there are better Cuban restaurants here in Chicago, so I'm looking forward to trying those.  However, the dessert was excellent!! I had the flan and another member of our party ordered the pistachio cake. Both were delicious and wonderful.
