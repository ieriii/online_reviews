I've been here 3 times now and I've enjoyed myself every time. One of my favorite dishes is the Arctic Char in Diablo sauce. The sauce is spicy and has chucks of shrimp in it, really really good. I've gotten the Jerk Marlin and that in itself was good but the pina colada sauce was a bit too sweet for my taste. It was good every other bite but the fish was quite enjoyable on it's own. I always leave stuffed but yet I still make room for Margie's across the street. Service here is okay, not over the top but could be a little more attentive, but whatev.
