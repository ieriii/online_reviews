I love Mia Francesca, it is always a pleasure to go to this always packed restaurant. I love the ambiance, the service is excellent, it is affordable and the food is delicious. I love how the menu changes week to week. My favorites on the menu are the asparagus salad, all the pastas you get there are fantastic and the fish is never disappointing. They now have a back room by the patio that is so quaint and cute it would be perfect for a small intimate party. If you can ask to sit out there when you make your reservation it is a different ambiance from the inside- more romantic.
