My girlfriend loves this place, so she really wanted me to go and try it out. I'm glad I went. The food I got was pretty delicious, and I had a good time. The interior is actually really cool, especially the area surrounded by bookcases and a fireplace. While I wasn't seated there, I was right by it, and it seemed like a very relaxing place to sit with some friends and have a few drinks. When the waiter came around, he was very friendly and helpful. I decided to order the Wilde Burger, and it was delectable. The fries were good, too. I love fries. Ask me what I love, and I'll say fries. If you don't believe me, try it. The results are guaranteed. My girlfriend got the Wilde soup, which apparently is a favorite of hers, and she said it was fantastic as usual. Score. While what we ordered wasn't too expensive, some of the entrees came with a fairly hefty price tag, so you might want to bring a nice chunk of moola.  I would recommend Wilde to anyone. It's good food and nice environment. Check it out, fool.
