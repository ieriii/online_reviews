Longman is legit. You gotta respect a place that pushes the boundary with the items on the menu and the flavors you experience, but still delivers and your food comes out delicious. Minus one star because the service was not totally on point, and the drinks were a tad disappointing. I actually was expecting more from the drinks and less for the food and I was surprised the other way around. BUT the drinks were solid, just not five stars. I bet if I came when it was less crowded the drinks would improve. Highly recommend this joint though. BYOM (Bring Your Own Mustache)!
