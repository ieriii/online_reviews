Ok, giving Hot Doug's a great review at this point is like making public note of the fact that Scarlet Johansson has a nice body. But I love them both so. And here goes. To make myself feel better during another of my fun "Furlough Friday's" this summer, I made the short pilgrimage. Longest line I've seen yet since I've been going there: 1 hour 15 minutes standing outside watching My Name is Earl episodes on my tiny iPod. But so worth it. Got a spicy Thai sausage with peanut sauce and shaved coconut and an Irish banger with Honkers Ale mustard and Irish cheddar. And, of course, duck fries (since it is Friday and, well why wouldn't I?) Or more simply, Holy Jebus. If you haven't gone, just go.
