Whomever described this as a restaurant, has never been inside a greek diner. This is exactly what every Greek diner in the northeast is, subtitute red and silver bulcky vinyl benchs for the wooden tables (which is very smart of the owner because it gives him more space to work with). Like every greek diner this place has a huge menue that consists of items that are: 1) greesy, 2) sweet and 3) huge portions. All are true here but what the owner had done brilliantly is using culinary synonyms. For example, "chocolate infused crepes with strawberry mascarpone cheese" is really chocolate colored creps with strawberry cream cheese. Which translates to, low flavor high fat and sugar, really? YUK. The service was ok. But really the whole experience was not worth the 30 minute wait. Any diner would do, minus the wait!
