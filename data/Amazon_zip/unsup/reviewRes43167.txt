Went here Friday night with two girlfriends and had a great time. We pushed back our reservation twice and they were so understanding and seated us when we were all there. Anyways everything was delicious. We drank martinis, ordered some app that had toast with a light cheese and tomatoes, the truffle pasta, mussels and the pork belly. Also go the frites. We split everything and it was more than enough food. The atmosphere was fun and loud. Will go back. My only complaint is that our waiter was mia when we were trying to pay but I think he just had too many tables.
