I'm so glad I found this place! I live a block away so I'm definitely going to be coming back a lot. Great food, great service, and the drinks were strong (good if you like that kind of thing!). Best of all was the atmosphere. Very laid back and they were playing Radiohead, Led Zep, and the Beatles in the background. I'll definitely be back to relax and have some good food
