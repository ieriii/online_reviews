I was really excited to go here. My mom knows how to cook real southern comfort food so when I heard about this place I was ready to go. The good * It's a cute little spot on Clark with some real ambiance The bad * The service is pretty slow The ugly This place is way over priced and it's not REAL southern food. What it really is - would be a chef who is taught how to cook - food from LA, puts it on mini dishes, garnishes it up, serves you 1/2 of serving size and sends you a bill for $20-$30/person. Sorry this place is just "meh" - if you want to taste real southern "soul" food it's not here. Real southern food is hearty, tasty, and comes in mega serving sizes. The food is unbelievable and sometimes it scares you because you're like I just ate what "frog legs, pigs feet" - yuck - but that is after your 4th serving. A real soul food cook can disguise everything as chicken with lip smackin' greens and mouth watering mac and cheese - LOL!
