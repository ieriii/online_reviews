W's are hit or miss. Some are magical while others are old hotels with loud music and purple lights. This hotel falls somewhere in-between. Nothing about it really stands out. The lobby has your typical w purple club-like feel. The amenities are above average. The surrounding area is dead at night. Perhaps the best thing about the hotel are the rooms. Big, spacious, and the bathrooms have doors (many Ws do not have walls between the bathroom and bedroom). I expect to be blown away by a W hotel and this hotel doesn't. You'll enjoy your stay but you might feel a bit underwhelmed. The W Lakeshore has other issues but it's a much nicer hotel if your heart is set on a W. If you're a Starwood person I'd recommend the Westin North River.
