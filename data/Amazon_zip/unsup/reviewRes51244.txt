One of the best Mexican restaurants in the city! I am now convinced that there are no good Mexican restaurants in the suburbs after eating here for years. The food is fresh and plentiful. Something is wrong if you go home hungry.  Service can be slow and a little confusing for the uninitiated. It all changes when you get their fresh salsa. They also offer an amazing fish taco for cheap prices. The restaurant is constantly busy but you can almost always find a table. They are also a very reliable choice for takeout. Btw....Did you know that their beans are vegetarian? I was told this by my fiance's sister.
