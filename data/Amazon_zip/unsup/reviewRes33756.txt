Word on the street is that Sultan's is raising their prices for the first time since they opened!?! That's too bad since It's always been a cheap way to grab eats in an area where they are getting fewer and fewer, but i guess you gotta compete. Aside from that, the food is usually awesome. When it's on, best falafel i've had in the city (as advertised), but it's hit or miss. I've been there when the falafel is older and has been sitting under the heat lamps for an extended period of time. Not so good. If you get it hot and fresh it's great.
