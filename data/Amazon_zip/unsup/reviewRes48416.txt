Outstanding food by the same folks who brought us Blackbird, and fantastic beer and wine pairings with affordable prices make this a great restaurant.   A standing prix-fixe tasting menu for $45 every Sunday night make this a neighborhood gem. Signature dishes like the freshly fried pork rinds, sweetbreads, and a general love of all things pig make Publican the talk of the town. However, hard surfaces and communal dining make for a noise level that's over the top. It is impossible to carry on a conversation with the person across the table. The noise problem is a BIG problem. It makes it impossible to have conversations, and it kills any opportunity to take advantage of the communal dining by striking up a conversation with the strangers down the table.  For a place that's basically a high-end pub, the inability to communicate is a deal-breaker. If they could knock down the noise a few notches, this place would easily be a 5 star worthy restaurant. A shame that it's ruined by the noise. _Am
