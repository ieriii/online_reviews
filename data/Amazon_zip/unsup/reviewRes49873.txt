Las Tablas was very good, I would definitely go back. I'm only giving it three stars (I would actually give it 3.5 if I could) because it was incredibly loud in there, and while the meats were very good (the chicken is excellent) they all seemed to be rubbed with the same spices. This is fine, but I guess I was hoping for a little more variety. The side dishes I had also left a little to be desired. The major plus though, was the fact that its a BYOB, and the empanadas were fantastic!
