Situated in Chicago's Greek town, this place is quite nice looking - a beautiful pastry bar with several glass cases filled with beautiful desserts. The gals behind the counter were very friendly and sweet. Our waitress was a little less warm and made a mistake (we wanted the creme brulee and she gave us the creme carmel flan - no biggie). We popped in for an afternoon dessert and espresso. We didn't delve into the lunch or dinner menu but I'd certainly try it again.
