I'm yet another reviewer who knows little to nothing about Indian Cuisine. Unfortunately you won't find me on a panel of experts reviewing traditional and modern Indian dishes any time soon. In good news you will find me at India House again, enjoying pretty much everything they put in front of me. From bread, to the sauces, to the various rice/meat dishes I've consumed, I've yet to be truly dissatisfied with this place. The only downside is my boyfriend and I end up spending an arm and leg each time we go, that's more of a personal problem however.
