Let me start by saying if it were just the food, this would be five stars, hands down. I had the duck tacos, and they were fantastic. Everyone at my table loved their food - especially the mole which was to die for, and we shared guacamole and queso fundido, both of which were some of the best I've ever had. The margaritas, too, were delicious. But, I have to drop it down to three stars because everything else was that bad. It's not the restaurant's fault we were there in the middle of a heat wave, or that we had to stand outside for two hours to get in. But it is their fault for not having properly functioning air conditioning or some appropriate alternative. It was literally hotter inside than out, and we were grossly uncomfortable. Everyone was complaining, including a large party eventually seated next to us, which prompted the manager to bring a fan out of the kitchen and point it directly at them. Of course that didn't help everyone else. In addition to being that hot, the service was painfully slow. After waiting two hours and then being seated in the sweltering heat without any explanation, our server took so painfully long for EVERYTHING. It was close to two hours before he brought our meals out, which was excessive even considering that we'd been there about an hour before he ever bothered to take our orders. He was awful and totally unapologetic, the kitchen was slow, the management seemed to have no idea what they were doing. I would love to go here again for the food, but unless we somehow ended up with a reservation and it was 60 degrees outside, never again.
