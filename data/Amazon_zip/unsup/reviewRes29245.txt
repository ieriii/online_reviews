I miss this place! I wish I could still take a walk over there and get some of their pasta for take out like I used to every week! The Pasta Bowl was a staple in my diet at least once a week. My entree of choice was the Spaghetti Frutti di Mare: shrimp, scallops, and mussels with Marinara sauce. It doesn't really matter what you order you get a good portion for a good price and I am all about a good value! Another good option is the Clams Cappellini!
