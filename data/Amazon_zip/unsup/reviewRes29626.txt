ive been coming to this place for a long time now. it is the best thai spot in lincoln square. dont be fooled by those other places. get the gaeng gari. with chicken. i crave this. its a yellow curry with sweet potatoes and i order it with a side of rice. good. i got that out of the way. for starters try the crab rangoon, its creamy and crabby and crispy. the sweet and sour sauce is good.  i havent heard many people mention the tiger cry but its delicious. the dipping sauce is a mix of tartness and sweetness, its very fresh. the extra wait is worth it. i also almost always get the pad kra praow with ground beef. it has thai basil and slivers of jalapeno pepper. (if you order this, get it so its not "lard khao" which i guess means "over rice". order it instead with a side of rice. you get more that way. ) theres a liquor store next door which is awesome. if you go with a group make sure you form an alliance with someone so you can get both the gaeng gari and the pad kra praow. the decor is pretty cool they have interesting wood carvings and a huge stone carving of Ganesh (a hindu diety of success says wiki.) they dont have chopsticks on the table, which i thought was weird but apparently traditionally thai food is eaten with a fork and a spoon. i didnt know this. so, yeah go. have awesome food and a great time. and a thai iced coffee for dessert.
