Honestly, every time I have been here I have either been or become very, very drunk.  The last time I was there I do remember having a 3Floyd's Topless Wytch- which, while I could not tell you what it tasted like, I can tell you it was good- as was their beer that I sampled. Maybe I shouldn't have had that last Old Fashioned at the Whistler.  I have had the Burger- good, Bacon Popcorn, also good, and the charcuterie plate- all of which were good.  A great time was had every time I have been here- and I will go back again.  Please take the negative reviews on this site with a grain of salt. Having worked in a restaurant for some time, I am sure that the folks who receive bad service and attitude have given the servers and hosts some reason to behave that way- in other words, I strongly suspect that the douche bags are treated accordingly here.  Yum! Beer and Food my favorites!
