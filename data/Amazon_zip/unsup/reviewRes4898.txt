Wow, what an amazing experience. I went with my boss for a lunch in between some appointments downtown (he lives in NC). The menu was a bit different than what I was expecting, which kind of freaked me out. I think our server sensed that and, without us asking, delved into describing the menu, that items are meant to be shared, and recommended we get a few plates for lunch. We tried the bone marrow, balsamico "smear" and one of the antipastis (which I can't remember right now). Everything was delicious and was the perfect amount of food to fill us up but not too heavy. The restaurant it'self is on the river. So, we took advantage of sitting outside. However, there were bees flying around from the potted plants, and I freaked out since I'm allergic. There are natural bee deterrents they could use. Just a suggestion... The outdoor seating had wonderful umbrellas, and there was a group of 10 sitting outside. So, I would definitely recommend this to a group. The inside is pretty extensive, with a nice bar area in the center of the space. Everything looks clean, Euro chic and just inviting. The Purple Pig sign is big enough that you can't miss. I'd encourage you to try this place!
