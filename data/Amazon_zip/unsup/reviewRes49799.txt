If you come here you need to have the steak. We tried the empanadas and they weren't anything to write home about. I had an array of seafood which was quite fresh. The sides appear bland but the plantains are perfect and the yuca is well seasoned. The reason I gave a four star review is because our food took almost 40 minutes, we actually asked the waitress if our food was coming soon. Afterwards our check took awhile and after we gave her our cards it was another 15 minutes before we left. The entire meal was 2 hours. So go for the steak and stay awhile...because you might not have a choice.
