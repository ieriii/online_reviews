I have since gone there over and over again because of 2 dishes: 1. The fifty burger is crazy good. the burger itself is stuffed with gouda, mushrooms and bacon and flat out scrumptious. The steak sandwich is also to die for. Super tender -I usually dont like steak sandwiches because they are often bad cuts of meat that you have to sit there all night chewing like a cow... but I digress. Its also marinated in some fabulous sweet tangy stuff that makes it doubly yummy. I am a definite fan! Only drawback is that they are one of those places that thinks people will only think they are having fun if the music is so loud that your eardrums bleed..... I always hear people commenting on it but they never change it. But the owners are nice and really care that they make good food. Well done guys! Just stop making my eardrums bleed please..
