We went with the Wacky Wacky Wings (split half BBQ, half Seoul Sassy), a small order of fries, a small cole slaw, and the Not So Common Crisp sandwich. All in all, the food was good. Not out of my mind fantastic, but good. The sandwich that looked small turned out to be filling, but the sliced grape tomatoes and lettuce chopped up salad-style kept falling out. Fries were just OK - they arrived cold, but I guess that's what happens with delivery. Cole Slaw got a funny face review from my friend. But the wings were the saving grace - perfectly seasoned, huge, meaty, and nice and crispy. Next time I think I'll just have to order the wings. On a sidenote, they are pretty new and it seems like they're working out their operational kinks (we got voicemail when we called to order, the guy on the phone was wrong about delivery). Maybe we'll try them again in person vs. delivery.
