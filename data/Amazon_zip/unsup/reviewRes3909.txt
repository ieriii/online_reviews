After yahoo rated this place top 10, and seeing they have 500+ reviews, it was that time to checkout Crisp. We went in on a Tuesday about 30 mins before closing and this little place was still slammed. By the time we ordered, seats opened up so I didn't need to haul it all the way back home. The wife ordered the spicy BBQ wings, not really my thing, but not bad either. I ordered the Seoul sassy wings and fries. These did not disappoint. These steroid wings drenched in that sweet savory sauce were simply crackalicious. We were there til about 15 mins after close but never felt rushed to leave. Awesome courteous staff at this joint. The sack of fries you get is HUGE, and I ordered a small! Overall I wont go as far to say they're the best wings I've had, but they were pretty damn good. I will make the trek back to Boystown in the future to get my wing on again, and if it's this good again the consistency will bump this up to a 5 star review.
