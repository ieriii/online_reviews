Our experience was all around great. We loved the location which is close to the river, and we were able to walk everywhere downtown or hop on a bus or train quickly. The staff was really friendly and I usually won't even look at free "continental" breakfast, but theirs was really nice. They even refreshed it numerous times so it wasn't like if the family with ten kids shows up right before you, you are screwed. I loved the decor of the rooms and was inspired by their color choices in the bathroom. I would definitely stay there again.
