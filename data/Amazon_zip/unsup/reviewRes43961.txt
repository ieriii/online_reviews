Basically, the only negative comment I could give this place is that there is always a wait... very good for them and it should tell you that their food is absolutely delicous all the time. A leisurely breakfast at one of the outdoor tables is a pretty ideal morning. Great coffee, location, dog friendly patio, and the most satisfying breakfast. The portions are pretty large and the food is not usually on the light side but it is worth it. Also, the salad and soup specials that change weekly never dissappoint! If you ever see the jerk chicken salad or the panzanella salad up on the special board, I highly recommend it! And of course, the granola is fabulous and it seem s they have added a couple new blends including a low-fat version and a chocolate.
