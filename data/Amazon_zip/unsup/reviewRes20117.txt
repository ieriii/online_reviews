The only sane place on Black Friday for lunch. Excellent service and a very nice decor. Had the Gage Burger...one of the best burgers I have ever had. Can't remember which wine I had, but the wine list was quite nice. My mom had the scallops and my dad had the soup (very cool presentation), they both enjoyed their meal and wine as well.
