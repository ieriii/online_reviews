I was pretty worried that xoco wouldn't live up to my very high, Rick Bayless loving expectations.  Apparently, I had nothing to worry about. My husband and I went for lunch at around 1:30 today. We had to wait about 5-10 minutes to order (which was totally fine since we were debating our order for that time anyhow). The girl who took our order was super nice and gave us some great suggestions. We started off with guac and chips (which also came with two kinds of salsa). Really delicious and a perfect serving size for two people. My husband had the ahogada torta and I had the cochinita pibil torta. Both were so good, we both just sort of looked at each other wide eyed after our first bite. My husband proclaimed that it was the best sandwich he can ever remember eating. The ingredients are fresh and everything is well made.  I also really appreciate that the restaurant advertises where they get their meat and produce (mostly local - including Bayless's own garden) and that they're LEED certified. We'll definitely be back. As an earlier reviewer wrote, you could probably order anything and it would be delicious.
