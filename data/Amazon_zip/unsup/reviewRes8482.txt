My friends took me here for my birthday. We were seated in another room that was separated from the main dining room. I've been here twice and always loved it. This time it was no different. Many selection of steak, they even had lamb chops and chicken and pork. My favorite were their house steak. What I notice is that sometimes the meat are a little salty. But I'm not complaining. I would love to come here again.
