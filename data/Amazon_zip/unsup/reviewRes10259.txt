I'm down with Piece. They made a pretty good new england style pizza. Which I must say, for a Chicagoan who believes that pizza is 4 inches thick and has the sauce on top, was tough for me to get behind, but it's good stuff. I like a white pizza with clams, bacon and ricotta cheese. Sounds weird, but trust me it's real nice. The beer is brewed in house and I haven't had one that I didn't like. There are a couple that I love too (see Worryin' Ale). Also, live band karaoke always makes for some good laughs.
