I'm a huge brunch fan, well, i'm a huge FOOD fan, but yes brunch is my favorite food consumption time of the day. we went there just a couple of weeks ago and enjoyed it a lot. the location is a bit sketchy and hard to get to (we live downtown and don't have a car) - if you do have a car, it's easy and there tons of parking so please ignore the statement above.  our waitress was super sweet and helped us out with the menu - i ordered Nanadict - delicious, they also have freshly squeezed juice, HOWEVER, i think they add sugar and dilute it with water. i may be wrong, but was not a fan. they also sell jewelry in the restaurant! i thought that was odd but super cool.  coffee - they serve intelligentsia or metropolis - don't remember which one but i'm a huge fan of both.  the food - it was really tasty and not too rich/heavy. I'd definitely go there again for brunch maybe if i get wheels or if they open a location downtown :) a thumb up, def worth a try if you're a foodie, a brunchie or a lifie eater :) cheers
