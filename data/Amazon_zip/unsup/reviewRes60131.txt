Yeah the pho is good, they also have a hundred other things on the menu.  In particluar I've enjoyed the raw beef salad (Bo Tai Chan) and the Thit Heo Ram Man which is pork belly cooked in a crock with fish sauce, lemongrass, and chilies. Eat with rice. Typical for Vietnamese places, a lot of their entries are overpriced.I wish they still wore those camo uniforms.
