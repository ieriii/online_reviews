I really liked The Publican! That's if you can get a table... We had to take a 5:00 seating in order to get in. The waiters are REALLY knowledgeable. I went on a Sunday, so I think I was able to take advantage of my server's knowledge much better (I think that on a Friday or Saturday they would be too busy to share a lot of their expertise). I loved the pork rinds, and I don't normally eat pork rinds! I am a huge fan of any restaurant using ingredients from local farms, and I like that the menu changes daily. I had duck that was excellent and the sweet breads were delicious too. I definitely recommend the Publican, just make sure to make a reservation WAY in advance!
