I hate to review Wakamono because I want this place all to myself. I've been there twice, both times without reservations and for both we were seated quickly despite the place being quite crowded. Every staff member from the charming maitre d' to the countless waitresses were efficient and pleasant. The food was spectacular, with well sized sushi and sashimi cuts, and they know how to make a real martini. I'm going back as often as I can.
