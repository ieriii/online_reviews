Sunda is one of my favorite Sushi spots in Chicago. The food is phenomenal. The Rock Shrimp, Brussel Sprout Salad and Spicy Tail of Two Tunas are must haves. They have always been very accommodating of my reservations requests. Aeron Lancero is great to work with. I would highly recommend Sunda for a fun night out!
