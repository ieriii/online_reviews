This place was great. I went with my wife and had a wonderful meal. I consider myself somewhat of a foodie, but never actually tried a tasting menu. We had it here and it was AMAZING. There was so much food, that I couldn't even enjoy the amazing steak that came last. We must have had 15 different items and they were delicious. The place is not cheap, but the food and the ambiance were great. I would definitely go again.
