We went to Caro Mio last night. The atmosphere is really sweet. Great that it's BYOB. Service was really good. We ordered bruschetta con basilico as an appetizer and melenzana parmigiana and tri-colored rotolo for our main courses. The bruschetta was great. The main dishes were okay. Both of them has a lot of cheese. In fact the amount of cheese was pretty overwhelming and the melenzana was a huge serving. Overall, I think the restaurant has a nice feel but the the dishes were a little pricey and not that great. One other thing - when I first go there, two N'sync songs played. Pretty funny. They were so out of place. But after those two, the music got better.
