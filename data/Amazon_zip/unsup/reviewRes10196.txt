YUMMY! This place is AMAZING! Some of the best Italian food in the city, by far. We started off with the antipasti platter and everything was to die for. The grilled veggies were amazing as well as the olives and prosciutto! There was a TON of food, I was pleasantly surprised. I had the special of scallops on top of pasta with tomatoes, garlic, etc. O-M-G! First of all, my scallops were huge and there were about 6-7 on the plate and the pasta was very fresh and very flavorful. I couldn't stop eating this dish. My boyfriend had the pumpkin ravioli with brown butter sauce and it was very good as well. The prices are also very reasonable. It is definitely one of our favorite places in the city!
