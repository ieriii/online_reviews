YUM! The wine here is amazing! I had the red wine Syra, goes great with anything! The cesar salad was very big and perfect, to be honest. I would have loved to try the Caprese Salad, but the tomatoes aren't good yet! I split the gnocchi with my friend because the portions are huge here, always enough for 2. This also cuts down on the bill price, even though it's not terribly expensive. The service was great. In a great neighborhood with nice ambience!
