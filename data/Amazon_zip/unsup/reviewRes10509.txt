Eh... Nice atmosphere... The place was busy, which is a good sign, but was not at all impressed. They brought out some sort of "deep fried meatball?" compliments of the chef... it tasted so bland, I actually had to cut into it to see what was inside... yeah, no, not good. I got the ravioli piccolo sogno... i figured its the house pasta? Totally bland... the sauce had no flavor, and the 4 cheeses inside the ravioli tasted so sour that I thought it was bad, as in rotten. My date's fish had sooooo many bones in it, which is kinda ridiculous in a place that should know how to filet a fish. I will not be going here again.
