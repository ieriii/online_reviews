If I wrote a review for this place a year ago, I would have given it 4 stars but the last few times that I've been there, I found the kalbi is getting progressively tougher every time. Perhaps a lowering of meat quality or some version of cutting corners? Don't get me wrong, it's not enough to keep me away from here because it's a pretty good value but I think it's time to move on to find some better Korean BBQ places in town. Also, I think the ventilation just isn't what it used to be... maybe those things are clogged and need a serious cleaning!
