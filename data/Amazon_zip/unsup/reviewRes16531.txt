The decor is beautiful and the staff is excellent, but the buffet is only mediocre. A platter of tandoori chicken was brought to the table, which I guess is what they always do since my friend and I didn't order it. She thought the tandoori was the best part of the buffet, but I'm a vegetarian and couldn't eat any so over half of the chicken went to waste. It's a nice gesture, but they should ask beforehand and perhaps bring fresh naan to each table instead as some other Indian restaurants do.
