I've lived in the South Loop area for years and Yolk is a welcome addidtion. It has a cool funky modern esthetic. But more than its good looks is the awesome food...you have to try the cinnamon roll french toast...yum.......be prepared to wait a bit in line outside on the wekends because its a popular place. Its well worth it though. Who knows, maybe you will bump into a neighbor and get to chat.
