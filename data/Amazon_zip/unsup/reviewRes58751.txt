Let me preface this by saying that I am a faux-foodie, this means 1) my palette is not refined (my ideal meal consists of anything with guacamole, cheese and sour cream 2) I'm frugal when it comes to food (I'd rather buy a new pair of shoes) and 3) everything I've learned about food I have learned from watching Bravo. It was by watching "Top Chef-Masters," that I heard of Graham Elliot and his restaurant in Chicago. Two friends and I decided to check it out and what a great experience it turned out to be. The ambiance is very causal and welcoming.  I tired a Blueberry hill drink(gin, crme de violette, blueberry compote and basil shrub) to kick off the evening and it was tasty and went down very easily (don't be afraid of the notion of basil shrub in your drink).  White tuna sashimi for an appetizer, seared Alaskan halibut for my main course and blackberry panna cotta for dessert. The halibut was amazing and literally melted in my mouth and the panna cotta looked like a piece of art. The best part of Graham Elliott was the service.  Our waiter, Jeff, was so excited and zealous about the food that it was contagious. When the server put the plates down and they weren't properly placed before us, he came and twisted the plates so that we would be served to the chef's vision. When my friend couldn't decide between two different wines for dinner, our waiter brought him a half of glass of each. And when we were discussing having an after dinner Riesling but decided against it, he brought out a sample for us to try regardless. It was such a pleasurable experience and his passion about the food was contagious.It was expensive, especially when the blueberry hills slid so effortlessly down my gullet, but it was well worth it. We left satisfied but not stuffed. The Graham Elliot experience is unpretentious, casual and fun just the way life and food should be! A must try.
