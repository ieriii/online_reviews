I have went by this place many times and kind of had an idea that this place was a 'bar' as in some kind of mix between sportsbar and dive. BOY OH BOY was i pleasantly surprised to go there. It was literally one of the most positive dining experiences i have had in Chicago. The food was SUPER (get the mussels), the service really good, atmosphere was great and so the list continues... Go there - you wont be disappointed!
