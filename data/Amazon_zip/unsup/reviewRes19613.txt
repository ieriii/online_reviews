I agree with Karen C. I am not a fan of touristy places or locations. The only reason we went here for lunch was because Mr. Beef was closed on Sunday and we had a few hours to kill before our flight, and we had walked by it coming back from Millennium Park. My boyfriend and I consider ourselves amateur foodies (as we do not have enough money to be real foodies), and I had a feeling the food would be overpriced and underwhelming, but we were hungry and did not know where else to go. Plus we wanted a beer. We were so pleasantly surprised. The food was amazing. I recommend the Scotch Egg (WOW), the house burger (Camembert and caramelized onions...yes), and potato soup (with bacon and clams, I wish I had gotten a bigger serving and made it my whole lunch). I had the buffalo chicken sandwich, too. It was very good. But not "special" good.  Beer selection was excellent and moderately priced. I have to say...I will be back next time I am in Chicago to try more of their menu, and hopefully to check out the chef's new restaurant that was advertised outside.
