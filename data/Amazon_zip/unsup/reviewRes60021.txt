Big Jones was a treat. We went for lunch and were the first guests to arrive. By the time we'd finished a tart and smoky fried green tomato and bacon sandwich and a steaming bowl of hearty mushroom etoufee the place was definitely filling up. The service was like the service I've had at some of my favorite places in New Orleans, not too fast, not too slow, backed by a bright smile and strong opinions about what you should order. Our server talked me into a side of fried okra that was among the best I'd ever had. My fiance loved the decor which had a great down home vibe, but I thought it seemed a bit unfinished, with no art or other personal touches. Overall, we loved it and will be back to try dinner and brunch.
