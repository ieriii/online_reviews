What a find! I was perusing the streets of Chicago, en route to a birthday party, and feeling slightly distraught that I didn't have time to get deep dish pizza on my last night. Without warning, my boyfriend spins the car to impulsively pull into The Art of Pizza's parking lot. It. Was. Wonderful. It reminded me a lot of Giordano's: it is very thick (I can only handle one slice) and the crust is to die for. It's also very cheap, less than 3 dollars for a slice of pizza. I would definitely go here all the time if I lived in the area. It's probably a good thing that I don't--I would have to confine myself to sweatpants due to my expanding waist from this joint!
