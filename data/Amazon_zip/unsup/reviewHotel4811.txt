What an experience! If you are looking at staying at a modern, stylish, hip hotel then look no further than theWit hotel.  We recently held our wedding at this hotel and only have the best to say about this place. The food was excellent, the atomosphere was perfect, and the staff was top notch. The rooftop deck was unique and fun -- great experience for our out of town guests and even our family/friends from Chicago! We also loved how the event space had floor to ceiling windows with a city view - this was lacking at many of the other hotel spaces we viewed.
