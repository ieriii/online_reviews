Chicago may be known for its deep dish pizza, but the pizza at Spacca Napoli is definitely worth the visit. When my wife and I first entered the establishment, there was a huge crowd of people waiting inside and outside of the restaurant. We pushed our way through and the hostess quoted us about a 45 minute wait time. As we were debating whether or not to wait, the owner approached us AND HE RECOMMENDED ANOTHER RESTAURANT if we decided not to stay at his! (He recommended Glenn's Diner, in case you're wondering, another fantastic restaurant we frequent often). We decided to wait for a table. During our wait, the owner walked around with some free appetizers for the crowd to sample---you could also get drinks from the bar, although it was kind of tough squeezing around all the people, tables and waitstaff.  We were not disappointed. I'm glad we waited! The pizza selection at Spacca Napoli is very unique and refreshing. Lots of fresh vegetables and italian meats. Everything we ate was absolutely delicious from the appetizer to the brickoven pizza. After we paid and were leaving the restaurant, the owner chased us down and insisted we try a few complimentary mini cannolis and he thanked us for waiting! What great customer service!
