PASTA LOVE. It doesn't look like much from the outside, it's a bit out of the way - sure - but goddamn the strands of dough they craft inside are tasty.... A cold and snowy night in January, a girlie date, a lost walk in the 'hood, a bottle of red wine, and the most amazing pasta dishes I have had in a long while. The paperdelle made in house are just perfection. You can substitute them (instead of dry pasta) to any dish your heart desires for an additional $2 and believe me, it's waaayyyyyy worth it. Get them with porcini, borolo red wine, parmesan and cream and you will sing R&B with angels for eternity. Yes, really. To top it off: the bread is lovely, the service adorably shy (our waiter was so quiet and timid that it was hilarious) and the beverages 'bring-able' by you directly from your favorite liquor store. Oh - no corkage fee either. It's very darling indeed.
