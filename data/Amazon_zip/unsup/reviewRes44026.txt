As sushi places go this falls to the bottom third of most in the city. The freshness is questionable, overall the food is mediocre at best with very little flavor. The super white tuna sashimi (which I crave when it's good) - was slightly fishy, and not any where near as fresh as we are used to and expect. Finally, It seems they are trying to hide the lack of freshness and flavor by burying their sushi in lot's of rice. And buyer beware - for parties of 5 they automatically added a over 20% service charge to the cost of the food (over 19% on food incl. taxes) - without ever saying anything to us before hand. And when we questioned how they come to charging tip on taxes and more than the standard 18%, the woman unapologetically shrugged her shoulders - leaving us feeling like we were being cheated! Between the mediocre food, rice ball sushi and a 20% plus automatic service charge, this place does not deserve to be in business for very long.
