After several great stays here, we tried another significantly more expensive hotel in the area. Big mistake. Westin is a world-class hotel. Room ambience, heavenly bed, location, views, and professional staff have never disappointed. We make periodic trips to Chicago for getaway weekends and we now have established our "go to" destination. Can't wait to visit again.
