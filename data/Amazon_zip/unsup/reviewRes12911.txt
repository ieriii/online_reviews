North Center lacks a ton of fantastic places to eat, but Cafe 28 is one of them. Fantastic Cuban dishes and desserts. I love the chicken. I'm not traditionally a fan of Latin flavors, but the way their beans are cooked is extremely tasty. One of my favorite restaurants in the city, and I can walk to it.
