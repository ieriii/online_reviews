Everyone is always like "Superdawg this, Superdawg that, bla bla bla bla I love Superdawg". Well you know what? Now it's my turn!! I don't ask for too much in a Chicago style hotdog. First and foremost it shouldn't taste like crap. But that's a given. Nobody likes to eat things that taste like crap, unless they're a fly. The Superdawg is almost perfect. It holds together well, even though I kept one of the dogs in the box for the drive home, which was about 30 minutes with all the construction traffic. I got it home and the bun was still intact. I hate when hotdog buns split at the bottom. That's a turn off. I almost expected it to be soggy from sitting in that box so long but it wasn't. When I bit into it, it still stayed together. I was delighted. The dog itself had a good snap, and it wasn't too salty. It had a bit of a smoky undertone, which you don't find very often in a hotdog. I think this is one of the aspects of the Superdawg that set it apart. The fries that come with the dog leave much to be desired. They're peppery and taste better than the average greasy fry, but they were a bit inconsistent. Some were chewy, some were crunchy. I'm not going to judge Superdawg french fries, though, since the real attraction is the hot dog. That's what they're there for, and they do it excellently. Those shows that come on late at night on the Travel Channel when you're hungry. They talk about hotdogs, and they always have to show Superdawg, with the anthropomorphic hotdogs on the roof and the carhops. They're right. This is a damn good hot dog.
