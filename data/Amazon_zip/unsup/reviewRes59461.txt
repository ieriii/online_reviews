i've been to Gino's East at O'hare and tasted their famous deep dish pizza but this one at Giordano's is much better for me. I thought that since i have already tried it at Gino's, it's still the same thing but Lo and behold, i was wrong! Even more wonderful coz we paired it w/ Samuel Adams... the result... a very great time! :) The only downside of this is that this place is kinda top dollar for me. We just ordered the medium deep dish pizza, mozarella finger appetizer at 2 pitchers of beer. Our tab, a measley $90... but again, i would say that i had a great time here plus the great deep dish pizza that they have...
