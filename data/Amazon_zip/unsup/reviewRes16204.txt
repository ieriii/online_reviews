The first time I went to Violet Hour I was convinced it was worth the price, the wait outside, and the ridiculously slow service once you actually get seated. I was wowed by an amazing selection of fantastic cocktails, and a classy, cozy atmosphere. I've been back three times since. Never has the quality of the cocktails even come close to that of the 1st visit. I'm forced to conclude they've gone downhill. Each time I've been there, someone in my group has ordered the Juliet & Romeo, a gin drink with rose water and a splash of lime. The first time it was perfect, maybe the best cocktail I've ever had. During later visits it was way too limey, obscuring the taste of everything else. Other drinks were similarly unimpressive and unbalanced after that first visit. Once, after waiting to be served for an HOUR at our table, our cocktails tasted like the dregs left over from other cocktails mixed together-- they were nothing like what we ordered. They were so bad we couldn't even drink them (ok, that's a lie. We choked them down solely for the booze content, rather than waiting another hour to see whether they could be corrected). I've never come here without waiting at least 45 min outside the door (even on a Tuesday). I tend to give overhyped places credit when they deserve it, but this place DOES NOT. Go to a bar at an upscale restaurant instead if you want a nice atmosphere and better drinks for the same price.
