Xoco never fails me for a quick, easy, delicious meal downtown (more or less). Of course you come here for the tortas (and I've never had the bad one - the Albondiga was particularly good), but definitely look into the soft serve ice cream, all of which are great. (I'm a sucker for the chocolate one, but to each their own.) There can definitely be a wait, but as is usually the case, it's worth it.
