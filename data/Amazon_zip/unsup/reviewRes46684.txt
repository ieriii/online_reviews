I have to admit I haven't dined here for at least 20 years! We decided to walk over one chilly evening and nothing has changed. It was very full with young families and there was food on the floor everywhere - but we managed to make our way to the salad bar and I enjoyed a thoroughly fresh and yummy soup & salad and split the chicken wrap with my husband. Very, very tasty. Not a place to go for a romantic dinner or to have a quiet conversation, but it is a good, solid place offering good value in a great neighborhood. No wonder it has lasted all these years!
