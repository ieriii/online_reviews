My boyfriend had been to Wilde for dinner before and had really liked it, so on our way to the Chicago Gay Men's Chorus concert, we stopped at Wilde for an early dinner. I was highly impressed with our dinner - we were seated in the "library" area, and aside from feeling like we couldn't get close enough to the table in our comfy lounge chairs, it was a great meal. I had a glass of red wine, and Mike went through a few vodka tonics while we waited for our curry fries. I have been dreaming about them ever since. Both of us had fish for dinner - he had seared salmon and I had the special that day - white fish with a garlic herb coating. I can't speak for the salmon, but my fish was outstanding, and I loved that it actually came with sides! We had the apple cobbler for dessert, and it was sooooo good, once it cooled down enough to actually eat :).
