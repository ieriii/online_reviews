When I heard that this place served shrimp and grits, I was all over it like white on rice. I lived in New Orleans some 10 years ago and my favorite dish from that time was shrimp and grits. Circumstances since have taken me to places where I have never been able to find that dish on menus, and I've been reluctant to make it myself lest my version not live up to the memory. Having seen rave reviews for Wishbone's rendition on Yelp, I figured it wouldn't disappoint, and it didn't. A creamy sauce cloaking medium-sized shrimp, cooked to the perfect degree of doneness, with mushrooms, onion and bacon (and NO TOMATOES! this is the right way), and served over cheese grits. My dining companion and I both got this for dinner (it's listed under the appetizers, but it's a full bowl), and I wolfed mine down before she'd finished half of her bowl. The strawberry lemonade (fresh fruit blended into a slushy consistency and served in a soda fountain glass) was refreshing on a warm summer day, and the pecan pie we had for dessert was delicious -- warm and wonderful, the pecans giving way at the slightest provocation under the fork, with a ball of fresh whipped cream on the side as counterpoint. Our waitress was a gracious young woman who we had fun chatting and joking with, and the restaurant's ambiance is bright and perky, with vibrant blue walls and unusual light fixtures; the decorator does appear to have a rooster fetish, as they're everywhere. I really couldn't wish for anything more out of this place. The only bone to pick was the bathroom; it could have been a bit brighter, and fresher. Aside from that, I hope that Wishbone keeps on cluckin'.
