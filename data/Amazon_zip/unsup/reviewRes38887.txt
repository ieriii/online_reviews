We were here for my birthday lunch. We'd never come out to Logan Sq before but I'd heard it was good for restaurants. The neighborhood did not look it though. This place is a diamond in the rough. TOTS hipster. I had just seen Lawless with Tom Hardy, a movie set in Virginia during the prohibition about bootleggers and I swear I thought the bootleggers had gone haute cuisine and opened this place up. Floor to ceiling dark hardwood. Solid wall of whiskey. Lots of flannel. Anyway, we had the duck hash and the wild boar sloppy joe. One elegant and nuanced, just gorgeous; the other heavy, yes sloppy, and super rich. PS thanks for asking if I'm "okay" with my fries being cooked in beef fat, and honey YES PLEASE! I've had duck fat fries that seemed to be a gimmick but these beef fat fries actually tasted it. Scrumdiddliumptious.
