Seriously guys. Your website says you are open from 10am till 2am. I come in at 4 pm for a late lunch / early dinner whatever you want to call it. I walk up to the empty bar (it's 4 in the afternoon, not busy yet). Bartender walks up and asks if I want a drink menu. I say, No, I'll take a food menu and a draft. He proceeds to ask which beer I'd like; he gets me the beer. I ask again for a menu at which time he now decides to say, oh, the kitchen is closed till 5, we only have olives or cheese till then. Really.... olives and cheese. I came for food. If you are not going to serve food, say so immediately when I ask for a menu, not after you ignore my request for a menu and get me a drink. Meanwhile, I'm starving and now chugging a beer on an empty stomach so that I can leave and go eat elsewhere. Lame. If you are not going to serve food, why get me the drink. It's like going to the post office to find out you can buy stamps but can't mail the letter. On other experiences, the food is great. Wish I could have had some.
