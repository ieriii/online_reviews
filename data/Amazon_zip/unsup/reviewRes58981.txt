Went here for the first time last night and had such an excellent experience!I was meeting my friend for dinner at 6 and unfortunately, I didn't get there until 6:30. They were great at the front, held the table and were very quick to accomodate us (even though the place was packed). Our server was great too - we didn't feel rushed and she gave us great recommendations when we asked as well!Definitely can't beat the people watching! Was almost hard to concetrate on the converstation cuz there was so much going on around you - but entertaining, none the less.Food/wine are definitely a little pricey, but everything we had was absolutely delicious and so different from what you see at other places.Highly recommend the following...Rock Shrimp TempuraFirecracker RollThe Number Ten RollCrispy Rice with Kobe Beef
