Ok so I may be a bit late on writing this review and I may not exactly be a chicago deep-dish expert but this pizza has remained and I feel will always be in my top 3 or 5 pizzas of all time (and I just got back from Italy this summer and had the best pizza of my life). Oh and btw, the pizza in NYC I had will remain in the bottom 5 of pizzas I have had of all time. Not what I expected at all! =/ That being said, this pizza is so unique but so good and delicious at the same time. Yes, it does take about 45 minutes for them to make your pie but I would rather wait 45 minutes than wait 10 for some pre-made pie thats sitting under a warmer. At leas you know your getting a fresh made-to-order pie! Just plan ahead or order an appetizer to tie you over. We ordered the sausage pie which had a complete payer of sausage covering the pie (the use a ball of sausage and flatten it into a disc which covers every inch of the pie, an absolute dream for meat lovers). The sauce, cheese, and tons of sausage went perfectly together and then the super buttery crust was the perfect support for the massive amounts of toppings. Definitely a knife n fork pie that will fill you way up with just 1-2 pieces. FYI, you can write your name on the walls so bring some white out or a pen that will show up on black booths/walls. So if your in Chicago get some deep dish at Gino's and not Lou Malnatis because I went there too and it was NOTHING compared to Gino's. Enjoy!
