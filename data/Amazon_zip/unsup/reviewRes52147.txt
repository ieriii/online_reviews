First time having deep dish pizza in Chicago was a disappointment. I didn't like this cornmeal crust at all. The toppings were just ok and the cheese got hard fast since we sat under a air vent. On top of that it took 45 minutes to cook our pizza which I understand but It wasn't worth the wait... I will definitely give deep dish another try but not at Gino's.
