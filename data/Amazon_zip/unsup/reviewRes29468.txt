It's like this: If I want Thai food, then I go to Opart Thai House. A friend of mine recommended this place since he goes there quite often for carry out which is what we wound up doing. I never actually ate inside the restaurant although it looks nice enough. The spotlight is the food. I've tried various dishes, but for me the Pad Thai is the best.
