"A Nice Attempt" Violet has an older brother in New York City named Raines. Raines is a good guy; he's classy but keeps from being pretentious. He charges a premium for his expertly crafted cocktails, but it is hard to complain about spending $20+ when you're drinking liquid gold. His space is intimate, comfortable, and sophisticated. Violet grew up and always aspired to be like her big brother, but she just never managed to get there. But unlike her brother, she is a bit of a wide load and handles things with less grace. She is so large it is difficult to ensure an atmosphere of intimacy. And with such size comes the problem of filling it with the right amount of knick knacks to make it feel more homey. Instead, Violet just sort of bought some big chairs and then gave up, making it feel almost warehouse like. (Or maybe I'm just not used to sitting in such large cocktail lounges.) The drinks, while good, are nothing spectacular, and I'm afraid the same can be said of the food coming out of Violet's kitchen. I'm also a bit perplexed as to why she (and others) keeps referring to herself as a "speakeasy". There's a line down the block and nearly 1,000 reviews on Yelp. There's nothing speakeasy about that.
