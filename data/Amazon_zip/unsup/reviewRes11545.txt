As if this place needs another review! Ha! Well, I feel that I have to throw in my two cents. Definitely one of my favorite pizza places in the city. LOVE their white pizza - so frickin' amazing! Could eat miles of this stuff. Also REALLY LOVE their barbecue chicken pizza - a little sweet with a little savory - SO GOOD! I'm not a beer person, but tasted the brew that my family was drinking, and I actually enjoyed it! The only reason why I didn't give this place five stars is because there was something about their regular pizza with tomato sauce that I didn't like. Pizza is such a personal thing - there are so many variables - so just because it wasn't the best thin crust pizza with tomato sauce I ever had doesn't mean it won't be the best that you have ever had! But, their "other" types of pizzas were the BEST I HAVE EVER HAD. In a Deep Dish Pizza city, I HATE all deep dish besides Lou Malnati's, so I'm glad that Piece exists. Yay for thin crust Pizza! Yay for Pizza places in Chicago that only serve thin crust! Bye the way, there service here is EXCELLENT! The place looked crowded - but we were seated quickly, orders taken quickly, Pizza came out quickly - was hot and melty and much larger than I expected - Portions are awesome - prices are typical - Beer selection is great. Our server was really helpful, attentive and quite awesome. Yes, this place is loud, but that is what adds to the lively atmosphere. Tons of TVs to catch your favorite sports team - karaoke on some nights. Nice light from the skylight and fresh air from the open storefront. Overall HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! Plus, I'm a sucker for marketing - love their logo, and especially love their logo when it is adapted to commemorate Chicago sports teams! Great place, give it a try!
