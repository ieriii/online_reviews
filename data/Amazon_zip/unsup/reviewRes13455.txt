Glenn's is a sweet neighborhood restaurant with an amazing selection of fish, many prepared creatively, but I've left pissed off both times I've visited. The first time, my shrimp was very overcooked and my mac 'n cheese was too salty. The second time, my salmon was too undercooked on the inside and too over grilled on the outside. My server was attentive and polite about it. I also felt rushed after just 45 minutes because the place was getting very busy and the staff were staring us down. I guess if we had ordered two appetizers, a bottle of wine, and two entrees like the table next to us, we would have been more welcome to stay (it's kind of a stuck-up place like that). All patrons are not treated equal here. BYOB, $5 corkage fee. They also have a full-ish bar and wine.
