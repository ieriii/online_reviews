I am sad to say that we have left Chicago for Atlanta and that Glenn's Diner will be my most missed restaurant in Chicago. My wife and I visited it twice, both times leaving extremely full and pleasantly happy.  Our first visit was for lunch. I ordered the Catfish Poboy. Great bread, perfect amount of batter and the fish was fresh. My wife ordered the Reuben sandwich and said it was very good. We met the owner and the waiting staff was extremely attentive. Our second and last visit was for dinner and it was, in my opinion, the best seafood that we had in Chicago. I had the Crustacean Pot Pie. It was a pot pie with lumps of Blue Crab, shrimp, scallops and veggies. Trust me when I say, these were huge lumps of everything. You could differentiate between each seafood in the pot pit. I topped the pot pie off with a Dog Fish Head beer. My wife had the scallop dish. There were 12 scallops on her plate. Perfectly pan seared, with carmelization on the outside but could cut through it with a plastic spoon.  Almost forgot, I ordered their clam chowder for an appetizer. I would recommend it to anyone.  It is a little pricey but what do you expect? The food portions were huge, fresh and perfectly cooked. When I visit Chicago, it will be at the top of my list of restaurants to go back to.  Make reservations if going for dinner.
