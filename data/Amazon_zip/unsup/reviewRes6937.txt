Ok, I am a transplanted Southerner and BBQ fanatic, so I am a bit picky about BBQ. That being said, I found the BBQ at Chicago q to be fair at best (pulled pork), with some of the dishes on the sampler platter I ordered arriving dry and tough (brisket) or cold (pulled chicken). Not impressive. The side dishes, on the other hand, were amazing (homemade potato chips- yum - grilled polenta squares - yum), as were the lemon shrimp, which were so perfectly prepared they tasted like lobster. If I ever went back I would order shrimp and side dishes.
