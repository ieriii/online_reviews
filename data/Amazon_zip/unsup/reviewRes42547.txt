Hands down, the BEST stuffed pizza in Chicago. The crust is buttery and crispy on the outside - perfect. The sauce is not too chunky, not too sweet - again perfect. The toppings are fantastic (pepperoni is my favorite for stuffed). All this, for a crazy low price. Also, unlike Giordano's, they sell slices of stuffed pizza. Fanny-tastic! I also tried their thin pizza, which is ok. The reason to go to Art of Pizza is stuffed pizza. You won't be disappointed.
