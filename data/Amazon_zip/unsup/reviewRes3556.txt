Awesome sauces on their fried chicken. I've had a couple burritos and Buddha bowls, but the chicken is where it's at. At first I figured that anyone could buy sauce from H-Mart and slather it on some fried chicken -- but it works and it's kind of addicting. Crisp BBQ is my favorite, Seoul Sassy is solid too. I usually need a whole chicken to get full, but I tend to eat a lot. Food comes out quick and people are nice. I'd recommend eating the food there, cause a 15-minute drive home makes a big difference. And smelling the food for that long without being able to eat it is pure torture. Now if only the prices were just a couple bucks lower...
