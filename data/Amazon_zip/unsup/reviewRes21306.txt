The outside doesn't do this place justice. After being turned away from a packed Sappori Trattoria, we ran into the Mayan Palace. We all had fear in our eyes from what looked like it was going to be an awful meal at a second rate mexican restaurant, boy were we wrong. The nachos are amazing and a must have. They use shredded cheese and a cheese sauce that blends perfectly together, The enchiladas are fantastic and combine the perfect amount of flavor and texture. My friend got the quesadillas and was also very happy with her choice. We had three rotating waiters continually look in on us providing us with top of the line service. Never judge a book by its cover or a restaurant by its awning and windows or you may skip a fantastic meal.
