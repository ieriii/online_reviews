Had a lovely lunch here over the weekend. Our party of four was sat outside, in their front patio area on the sidewalk across from Millennium Park.  This is a high-traffic, tourist-heavy area, but we were camouflaged by thick green plants that, while seated, reached well above head-level. It was a nice setup.  We all ordered sandwiches, that were well-received by all. I opted for the 1/2 sandwich + 1/2 soup : Chicken sandwich with peppers, queso, pineapple slices + cheese on soft bread + tomato soup with creamed goat cheese and avocado. Both were really good.  There was a little mix-up with our table's soup. It didn't come out first as it should have, and we had to remind our server that we ordered it after the sandwiches were served - but otherwise, service was decent. From what I saw of the interior, there's a nice, classy feel to the dining space. A solid dining / drinking option in the heart of the loop.
