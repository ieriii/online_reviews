I was so excited to eat Chicago pizza for the first time and chose this spot based on all the positive Yelp reviews. Once again another let down. How in the world does this place have 4 out of 5 stars?! My experience is only based on the single slices, so I can't comment on the whole pizzas. Single slices are kept in a heated display that looks like something they would have a cafeteria and the pizza tasted like Pizza Hut. A total waste of a meal! :(
