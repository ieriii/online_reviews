Best thin crust in Chicago. Period. Nay, best thin crust I've ever had. Period. Nay nay (hey hey), best style (New Haven) of pizza I've ever had, PERIOD. The crust is almost paper thin, yet stretchy and doughy, meaning you need two hands to eat it. It comes out fast, a large is huge, there are a million toppings, and the service is good. Add to that the fact that it's also one of the best brewpubs in the city, and you're pretty much in dude heaven. Only bad components are the throngs of people who choke the place literally every day of the week, and all the TVs. But I'm not a sports guy, and the crowds are testament to how damn good it is, oh well.  But I'll gladly deal with both for their pizza, and their dysfunctionale. I've been here about a hundred times, and if you ask me, this is as good at it gets.
