Two words: cookie dessert. I mean, I had the vegetarian chili (which is huge for an appetizer) and it was delicious, and I've had their salad bar before, which is wonderful and I don't even know what's on it, but omg. The cookie. If there is one thing you must do before you die, it is to get that cookie dessert. Probably 8000 calories, but it's worth killing your diet for this one.
