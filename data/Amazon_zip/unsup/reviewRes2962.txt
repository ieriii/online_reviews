This was where my now hubby took me for my 25th bday. It is by far the best service I have received when dining. They pay such careful attention to you w/o being intrusive. My menu was personalized with a "Happy Birthday, Raquel". Nice touch. I rem the food being good - not the "omg, I've died and gone to heaven good" but better than average for sure. Your obviously paying for the stellar treatment, fancy food combos...and the overall experience, but hey, you should have known that already. They do have a chocolate truffle cart that comes by at the end of your meal - which is pretty cool. We got a little goodie on our way out and it was def a nice experience, but for that pricetag, it may be just once in this lifetime for us.
