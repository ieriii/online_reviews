Seemed like a fun place, and I kinda wish I wasn't with a group that was packed away in the back, cause the place seemed hoppin'! Food wasn't bad at all. The crab legs are huge and down-right yummy - hey it's what they call the place, and they delivered. Same with oyster on the half-shell. The clam chowder was terrific, just kicked myself that I only ordered a cup instead of a bowl. And if any one has read any of my food reviews, you will know I don't like seafood, so that is saying something for this place. For dinner I went back to my roots, and go the filet mignon, which was cooked pretty well. It had good flavor, and was fairly tender. It was good, just didn't knock my socks off. But then again the place is called a crab house. The big knock was that it took so long for the entrees to arrive.  I'd check the place out again, it'll just be out with the people -- as I am a man of the people!
