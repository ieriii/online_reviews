Love the concept. We went on a Friday night, albiet a cold one, and the wait was not too bad. Maybe 20 minutes. I had a special torta with shrimp and cod, which was good, but not blow my mind good. I felt the same way about the seafood caldo, but my husband was much happier with it. The guacomole did blow my mind, however. Also, the aqua del dia was one of the best things I've ever tasted and the cholcolate with almond was ridiculously rich, but a great finish to the meal. I will definitely go back to try different stuff off the menu.
