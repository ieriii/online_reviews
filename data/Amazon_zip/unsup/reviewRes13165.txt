Went on a Saturday night with no reservations. The friendly hostess said it would be 45 minutes to an hour so we gave our number and went down the street for a drink. 30 minutes later we got the call that our table was ready. Our waiter was knowledgeable, helpful and was very attentive without being intrusive. Excellent service! We were not able to order an appetizer because there was nothing available without garlic which I am allergic to. This is a pretty common scenario for me so no big surprise. After reading the menu and blackboards and getting a refill on wine and beer we ordered our entrees. I ordered the Sturgeon as recommended by our waiter. It was simply prepared, flame grilled with some sort of creamy mushroom and bacon sauce. Absolutely delicious and fresh! The sides, roasted potatoes and steamed veggies were OK but unimpressive. The only disappointment was the portion size. For $26 I was served a 1" x 3.5" slice of fish and was charged another $3 for an extra side of the sauce to fix up the bland sides. My girlfriend got the Red Snapper which was lightly floured and fried. Pretty good but a little fishy for my taste. I think it was the skin which was strong tasting which is normal I guess. For dessert we shared a brownie with vanilla ice cream. Not bad but not very chocolaty. Kinda tasted like a box mix and again for $7 it should knock my socks off. We both liked the food and the great service and may try it again if we find a groupon or other discount but will probably go back to Devon Seafood Grill downtown first.
