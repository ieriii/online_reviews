I stayed here one night with my girlfriend. First, the good: The location is great and the River North area is blowing up so there are good bars and restaurants within walking distance. The bed was really comfy. The breakfast bar was nice. Quiet room. Now the bad: I expected the rooms to be nicer, but they had a spiced up Holiday Inn quality and came across as a bit dingy. The view was awful. The happy hour is nice, but way too crowded and not really worth it unless you're a huge cheapskate (not judging). But all in all, a nice place, especially if you can find a good deal online.
