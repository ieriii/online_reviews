I ordered the Chicken Shawarma Sandwtich with a side of Falafel. The sandwich was packed with fresh veggies and Id have to say was very filling. As for the taste, lets just say you can find allot better tasting shwarmas in chicago. Also the Falafel was very disappointing, maybe because i have really picky tastebuds also the hummus was bland. If you want real arabic middile eastern cusine, stick to Pita Inn Or Salam on Kedzie. Peace
