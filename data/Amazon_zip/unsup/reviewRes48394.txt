Brian Huston's menu was full of eclectic, original dishes...none of them disappointing. The Publican has a knack for flavor combinations: braised short ribs served with brown butter vinaigrette - perfectly cooked with a wonderfully sweet finish. The smoked trout was moist and flaky, and served over country style potatoes, topped with pickled green beans & fried egg. Phenomenal tastes. The beer list was equally impressive. Serving Belgian Micro's and Whit's, Germanic Weiss & Helles, American Micro's & IPA's, there's no shortage of good suds. The beer selection complements the menu, making for a harmonious and intoxicating food and drink experience. The European beer hall theme was refreshingly different, simultaneously rich and rugged. The only downside to the experience: the place was slammed and a few decibels too loud. Our waitress was a bit verbose when it came to her beer and whiskey commentary, but at least she erred on the right side of the knowledge equation. Also notable, the dishes came out as they were finished and shared by the table - a kind of tapas-like experience - creating a pleasantly intimate evening.
