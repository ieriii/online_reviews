UPDATE: Former Italian prof (authentic Italian lady) says this is the best Italian pizza in Chicago. Need I say more? ------ Before evening sitting down here, I knew this had to be a good place. The first time I went there was a wait for a table for two... on a Sunday night! The "soggy" pizza that someone mentioned in the review below is what makes this place great. It's called fresh, Neapolitan style pizza. It's thin, non-crispy crust and is soooo good. My criteria for good pizza is thin-enough crust that you can eat a whole pizza and not feel stuffed. The pizza here definitely meets that criteria. I have also never had problems finding parking in the area either. Extra points for that alone!
