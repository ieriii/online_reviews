I love this place. I could sit at the bar all day to accept as a challenge their motto Whiskey for your mouth, not for our shelves, but then I'd miss the food.And the food! The food!The menu changes often and there will probably be words you don't understand, so ask your sever if you need help, order a couple small plates, and you'll have room for dessert.No reservations, no problem. Enjoy the whiskey selection, cocktails, and beers while you wait.Also, I cannot stand going out to brunch at most places. But I absolutely love brunch here.
