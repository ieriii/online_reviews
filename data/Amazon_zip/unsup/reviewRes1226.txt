I went here with high expectations and think the hype is overrated. I ordered the dog with all the trimmings and that was a good hot dog. I also ordered the Frankie "five angels" and went with the suggestion of the worker which had onions and mustard and some other stuff. This was a bit too spicy and overall not what I thought it would taste like. It probably would have been better if I stuck with everything on it. The staff is very friendly and helpful, even gave use peppers for our dogs. 20 minute wait wasn't too bad. Had I waited over an hour, I would have been disappointed with the food. Definitely try this place out, probably have better success than me when ordering different trimmings.
