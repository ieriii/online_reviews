I booked The James Hotel through Expedia for a great deal. It really did live up to all the reviews. This was our first visit to Chicago so I wasn't really sure what to expect. Location: This hotel is close to so much. We were a few blocks from the train that we used to go to Wrigley & the airport. We were able to walk to Navy Pier, Millennium Park, Grant Park, and the beaches. There were shops, and restaurant galore all around us. It was raining the one day, so the complimentary car service took us to our brunch destination. That was very nice and so much better than a cab ride. Also, there is a Trader Joe's across the street where you can get some wine & beer,water, and snacks, rather than using the very expensive mini bar in your room. Staff: The concierges, doormen, front staff, and housekeeping were all extremely nice, helpful, and professional. We were greeted at our arrival by wishing us a Happy Anniversary. The evening of celebrating our anniversary they even had complimentary desert waiting for us in our room! It was something small but so very thoughtful and made us happy. The Rooms: We spent a good portion of time in our room for some pre-dinner drinks and TV watching in the morning. We never felt confined. We just had the basic King Room. The room is spacious and the beds are super comfortable. Even the bathroom had plenty of room to get ready and spread all my stuff out. The rooms are cleaned twice a day(turn down service at night, with a treat). It was so nice to come back after a night out, and have the room clean again. We also went to the gym daily, which was very clean and more than enough machines. Fresh water, towels, and even oranges were available for your workout. My husband and I loved Chicago and had one of our best vacations. It definitely started with The James and would return if and when we make it back to Chi Town.
