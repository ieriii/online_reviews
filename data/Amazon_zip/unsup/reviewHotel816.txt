My Husband and l couldn't find a baby sitter to watch our toddler on Valentines day 2009 and so we decided to have early dinner with our son.The only places we were looking at going were Hotel restaurants because we knew they would be family friendly and so we were glad to have a reservation at the Westin hotel, it had a nice location, not crowded at 4.30pm,we were happy when we arrived.However,all that changed when our waitress arrived.Oh my God, talk about taking away the joy of Valentines,She never smiled, she aggressively asked for our lds when we asked for our drinks,it was not the fact that she asked for it,it was HOW she asked, you would think she was a cop.She brought my steak well-done after l specifically requested for it to be medium rare.Our Whole dinner was ruined, it was such a beautiful restaurant and this silly woman had to ruin it with her negative energy. l reckon you must have a heart of stone not to respond to my sons smile or very bubbly personality and she did not once for the entire dinner say anything friendly to him,even though l could see her being friendly and smiley to another couple at another table not too far from ours! l did not think it necessary to complain.Personally, l would never be back. All that negative energy, unfortunately, took away from the lovely gesture of the restaurant giving out Valentine roses to everyone and the smiley faces of the other waitresses and staff of this place.If only we had a normal waitress,everything would have been perfect!
