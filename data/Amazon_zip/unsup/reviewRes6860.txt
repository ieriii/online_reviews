New Year's Eve was our second visit to Chicago q. We knew we had to go back after our awesome experience at Thanksgiving and the phenomenal turkey, but this time go back for their regular menu. Great again. Some restaurants don't understand how service, above and beyond the food, can make or break an experience. Chicago q gets it. Everyone with whom you come in contact with is exceptional. I just love it and this place is a new favorite. List of greats: Turkey Cornbread (the spicy one) Greens Baby back ribs Cocktails. Like burbon? This is the place. Mac n Cheese BBQ sauces. Cool that BBQ comes with servings of 4 to try. My only caveat is that the brisket slices seemed a slightly dry. Go for the ribs or the pulled meats, you won't be disappointed. Portions are large, unless you're Adam Richman you're most likely going to go home with leftovers... yay! Prices are reasonable. Service is flat out great. Ambience is wonderful. Here's hoping Chicago q adds turkey more often... not just once a year. That meal was a thing of beauty. Other establishments can learn a thing or two by coming in and observing how service is done. Let's hope they do.
