If you're a vegetarian that wants "meat" dishes this is the place for you. If you're a carnivore looking for an appetizing vegetarian dish, this place blows. To be clear, I don't really like meat substitutes. Since I'm not a vegetarian, when I want the taste of meat, I eat meat. I do however really like vegetarian dishes. A solid mix of veggies or a portobella sub-in for chicken or beef in a pasta dish or burger is kind of my style. Unfortunately the diner has hardly any (I don't remember seeing any, but surely there's a few), dishes that are straight vegetarian without bothering with the meat substitute. I got the avocado tostadas, and they were decent, not amazing. They would have been far better without the quinoa and far better if they actually threw a little salt on the veggies. And the veggies on it (aka bell peppers and onions) were kind of limp and pitiful. I was hoping for something a little more interesting out of the "grilled veggies." Not to mention this is equivalent to a dish I eat a lot in Texas where it rarely runs about $8 unless you're putting fajita meat on it. Try $11 something here. I know vegetarian food can taste a hell of a lot better for cheaper. In fact, I think I can probably steam veggies at home with salt and pepper and be more satiated. So I'll leave this place for the "meat" seekers and get my fix elsewhere. I forgot to mention, I tried a bite of my SO's "pork" tacos. I'm going to say, I just can't judge them because they were so bad I'm not sure what they were supposed to taste like. Not just the "pork" but the taste in general was off. I don't know how else to describe it. They weren't spicy, but they wanted to be spicy. And they weren't flavorful, but they were trying to be. Not even sure what could have made them better (how about veggie taco with grilled portobella, bell peppers, onions, tomato, guacamole? maybe a little squash? eh?). On the bright side, the wait staff was really nice.
