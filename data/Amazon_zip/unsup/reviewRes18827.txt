This place is great! If you can get a seat... I've been here multiple times, and the best is just avoid the meal time rushes. Prices have increased over time and it appears that sandwiches have shrunk over time. Sigh, a sign of inflation (at least in the food industry). But it's still worth it once in a while. I've tried several items here: Ahogada - Best choice hands down. If you're a first-timer, get this. Pepito - It's okay, wasn't spectacular Cochinita Pibil - On par with the Pepito Pork Belly Vermicelli - Tasty, would recommend; wish there was more pork belly Churros - They're just like any other place that sells churros. Chocolate dipping sauce - It's bittersweet chocolate, which helps combat the sugar coating on the churros. Is it worth the price? Not really. On subsequent visits, I've skipped it. I recommend this place if you want to bring some friends and not blow a ton on Frontera or Topolobampo.
