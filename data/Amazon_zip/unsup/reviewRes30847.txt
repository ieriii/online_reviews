My husband and I are frequent steakhouse diners, so we were very excited to try Mastro's. It didnt disappoint. We sat upstairs which was defintiely more quiet and much better for conversations vs. the downstairs which is very loud. Our server was very attentive without overdoing it and was very good. We started with the sauteed scallops which were outstanding. The sauce that it comes in is delicious. Our steaks were good, but we wouldn't say any better than the other steakhouses. Some of their sides were excellent. The truffle gnocchi and gorgonzola mac n cheese are absolutely phenomenal. The au gratin potatoes were a huge disappointment. They were potato wedge fries with greasy melted cheese over them. Don't bother getting those. You must save room for dessert. Their signature warm butter cake is amazing! I could have eaten the whole thing by myself if I wasn't so stuffed from dinner. All in all, a very good dining experience. We will definitely be going back.
