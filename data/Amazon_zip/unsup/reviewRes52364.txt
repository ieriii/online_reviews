The pizza at Gino's East is awesome!!! Just got back from my first ever visit to Chicago and stopped in yesterday for lunch. We had Giordano's the day before and thought it would be fun to compare the two and see which we liked better, but oddly enough it was pretty much a tie...we liked them both very much and appreciated how different they were. Initially my friend and I were just going to order individual pizzas because we each wanted something different, but thankfully our server, Daniel, suggested we order a small to share instead...that was definitely the way to go. We compromised and ordered a small cheese pizza with crumbled sausage on half...for me. The crust was very different than any I've ever had, but sooooooo yummy!! And OMG the mozzarella sticks were amazing...not typically an appetizer orderer but since it takes about 45 minutes for them to cook the pizzas, we decided to order mozzarella sticks and let me tell you those were the best I've ever had...IN MY LIFE!!! And the marinara was to die for...it was very fresh tasting and wasn't overly spiced, which is what I prefer. Overall Gino's East was a wonderful experience and I will definitely go back the next time I'm in Chicago!!
