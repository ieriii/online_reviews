Ruth's Chris has good steaks and all the sides. This is one of the better steaks I have had in the city. I have had a little better service at other steak houses in the city though which is the only reason I am giving them a four verses a five star. I know this is a chain which is something I try to avoid when I can, but they did have a good steaks.
