I also have to agree with Beth L. and her not so flattering review. We waited about 20 min for a "oh it will be 5 min" table, then waited another 15 min before we even got bread. Then we had to ask when we wanted more bread. And the bread was cool both times. Temperature, not chic. If I'm paying $20/entree is it too much to ask for warm bread? Then my veal was so-so, and at the end of the meal the server put dessert menus in front of us, assuming that we would want to order. After a less than mediocre meal, this was assuming a lot.  Too many other good italian places in the area to waste my time with this place again.
