Ok don't get me wrong the pizza is always good, service is good everything about Giordano's is good but don't base you deep dish pizza experience off of this place. Art of Pizza and My Pie make a much better pizza and have a way friendlier staff. I feel like this is the Burger King or McDonalds of deep dish pizza, good but never my first choice to go for pizza. With that said it's good I like it but if you can try a pizza from a place you can't get everywhere.
