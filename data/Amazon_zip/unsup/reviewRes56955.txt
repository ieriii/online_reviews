Me and my wife went to Texas de Brazil for the first time last week. I have to say we loved it!!! I am big into finding new experiences... and we found it. Between the carvers bringing the meats table side and the wine / trapeze girl flying around in the wine cooler it was an awesome dining experience. One thing that stood out to me is our waitress.... She recommended a new wine that I have had to purchase a couple bottles since. Duckhorn sauvignon blanc is what she recommended. Her knowledge of the wine list was extensive. Needless to say we will be back soon. It is a wow experience from us.
