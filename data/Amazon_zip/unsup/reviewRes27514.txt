My husband and I have been fans of Rick Bayliss for a long time, just from watching him on Bravo. So when we visited Chicago we knew we had to visit Frontera Grill. We went on a weekday night about an hour before closing. They told us we would have to wait about an hour but 10 minutes later they had a table for us. Our waiter was absolutely wonderful. His demeanor was as warm and welcome as the restaurants ambience. I ordered the Pollo en Crema de Pepita and my husband ordered the Cochinita Pibil. Our food was out in good time and it was the most amazing Mexican food we have ever eaten. The textures and flavors were astounding. My chicken was perfectly cooked, so tender and juicy and my pumpkinseed sauce was every bit as velvety as it was suppose to be, with a fantastic nutty flavor to it. My husband loved his dish as well. For dessert we decided to see what Bayliss could do with Strawberry Shortcake. Believe me, you have NEVER had strawberry shortcake like this! The biscuit had such delicate crispy layers and I loved the sugar crystals on top. Then there was the honey manila mango salsa! Oh my gosh! I died and went to heaven! All of our food was incredible. Frontera is a dining experience not to be missed.
