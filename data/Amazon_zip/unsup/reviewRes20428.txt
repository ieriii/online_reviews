I had no idea this constituted as Mexican food.. I absolutely love it! Upon entering the restaurant, you wait in a cafeteria style line to order while looking above at the wall of menu options. The host will ask how many are in your party and give you time quotes every 10-15 minutes on how long your wait is. My friend and I waited about 30 minutes on a Wednesday night. After ordering, we were seated in their 40 person space. BONUS POINTS because you can request to have your desserts served later at a later time, which we did. What we ordered and my thoughts: Woodland Mushroom :: Sandwich filled with mushroom, goat cheese, wild argula and black beans. DO NOT GET DETERED BY THE FACT THAT THERE IS NO MEAT. This dish was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. Pepito :: Sandwich with tallgrass shortribs, caramelized onion, Jack cheese, black beans, and pickled jalapenos. Hearty and yummy, and I loved the spicy kick, but the flavor is nothing close to the mushroom sandiwch (See above). Classic Hot Chocolate & Churros: chocolate shot + 2% milk; the hot chocolate is warm and thick (though not too aggresively); dipping the churros in the hot chocolate is a must.
