My lord, but this place is great! The dining room is exactly what you want when you go out for a fun night -- great view and decor, and the right kind of loud vibe you crave when you want to be around people. And yes, the food is absolutely amazing. It can also be expensive, so be prepared. Here's what I had last night: De Los Cort Martini (orange and cinnamon): $15 (w/ tax, tip at the bar) Cadi Urgelia: (raw cow milk cheese): $11 Olives: $6 Croquetas de Mariscos (seafood croquettes): $12 Gambas Con Garbonzos (flatbread): $14 Patatas Bravas (potatoes with aioli): $5 Chocolate Croquetas: $10 TOTAL: $73 (not including tax and tip on food) Now, that was MORE than enough food (my friend also ordered a few plates and we shared), and it was completely worth it. You should just know what you're getting into, especially if you work at a non-profit like I do. PROS: they will make vegetarian accommodations without judging, they serve absinthe, service is friendly, and if you order 72 hours in advance, you can get a WHOLE SUCKLING PIG!!! I don't even eat meat and I want to see that!
