Great price. Good service. Good pho. I stopped in here last week for a quick and filling lunch and was not disappointed. After driving around doing errands, my friend and I pulled up to grab lunch. We happened to pick the best pho place around. We split a large bowl of pho and I downed a thai iced coffee. Service was quick and the place was clean. And it was packed at 3p.m. for lunch. Definitely a winner!
