Excellent hotel centrally located, with an incredibly professional staff. We stayed here while in Chicago for a convention, and were very happy we did! Our friends stayed at another hotel down the street and were very jealous of our huge quiet room! Why only 4 stars? First night we were awaken by the burning stench of ammonia. The cleaning person and engineer quickly found the cause, the refrigerator had a leak and fixed it! They charge $10 a day for wifi! Really makes no sense to charge for wifi in this day and age! however sign up for their rewards program and its free. Finally we decided that we were going to return to Chicago a few days after we checked out and thought we might as well stay at the omni, however even though we stayed there five nights and paid well over $1,000 they still would only give us the rack rate of $285 on a Saturday night. Oh and when we recieved our bill i saw they charged me to call reservations! Granted it was a mistake and only $.75 but its the principle .
