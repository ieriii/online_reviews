It was incredible. The outside seating was perfect, our waiter Buck was so accomodating and everything he recommended was so wonderful!! The flavors in the food was great. The portion sizes was more than I anticipated and took a lot of it home. Just a wonderful experience all around and will definitely go back for more.
