If I go to this place once more with a reservation and they tell us to grab a drink while they get our table ready, I will never go again. We are always on time and there are always tons of tables open but they like to make you wait 20 min so you buy a drink or make the place look busy. I am not sure which is the reason but it pisses me off - if you have a reservation and tables open - SIT YOUR GUESTS!!!  Enough with that. We went last Saturday - not the first time. In general the food has always been good - I think it has trended a bit down over the last year or so. Great flavors - stick to the steaks/beef. I had the pork chop and it was average. The atmosphere is great - high ceilings, bright colors, etc. The service was spotty - our entrees literally came 5 minutes after we got our apps and then we waited over 30 minutes between our main course and dessert. Really poor spacing of the courses.
