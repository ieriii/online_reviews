My boyfriend and I absolutely love the Purple Pig!! Although I was terrified of half of the things on the menu....my boyfriend and our very knowledgeable waitress convinced me to try a bunch of plates and wine. I loved the decor and European style seating. It is definitely nice to have a vibrant atmosphere along Michigan Ave where most of the choices tend to be over priced and stuffy. My boyfriend's favorite plate is the Pig Ears and I love the prosciutto balls. The nice thing about The Pig is that the menu changes with every season and the food is always super fresh. There was some dessert on the menu that was AMAZING! It was a puff pastry filled with some sort of custard and chocolate. I would def recommend asking your server for wine suggestions OR I know they usually have a Wine expert on staff. You won't be disappointed with this restaurant! And, did I mention it is a great date spot??! We will be back soon!!
