This place is a diner and it doesn't serve meat. If that appeals to you, then run, don't walk.  It is great for a casual date. You could take your kids or your aged parents. I loved it. My food was not the best I ever had, but it was really good. If you don't eat meat, and you like diners this place is for you.
