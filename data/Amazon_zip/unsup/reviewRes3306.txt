There is so much to say about this place...but the most important thing to say is "You must go!!!" I have walked past this place so many times and always thought, maybe I should pop in, but of course I never did until last week. And let me say, I have been missing out!!! The gentleman working the counter was so friendly and helpful. He explained how everything worked and answered all my dumb questions (and believe me, I had some really dumb questions).  My friend ordered the Baby Buddha bowl...which was not that baby at all and really tasty (a much healthier option than what I ordered).  I ordered the 10 piece wacky wacky wings....there were HUGE!!! I could not eat them all and have to leave a few behind, which made me really sad. The best part is that you can order half your wings with one sauce and half with the another. I had half soeul sassy and the other half bbq extra spicy. The soeul sassy was finger lickin' yumminess...but I am a spicy lover...so the bbq extra spicy was my absolute favorite!!!! Also, I tried a bunch of their sauces and there were tasty as well. Be warned the seating is a little non-conventional...kind of like picnic-style with long table and benches. It's a huge place so I would imagine that when it gets crowded you will be elbow to elbow with some new friends! Enjoy!!
