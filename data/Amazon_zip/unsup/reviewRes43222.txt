I am not a big fan of deep dish. It's something that I will never really understand, therefore, never really appreciate. I think of it more as a cake rather than a pizza. However, my sister LOVES this place, and I will never turn down pizza so I eat it when the time occurs. There used to be a location in Berwyn that I'd order from many many years ago til it burned down. Their sauce is tasty, and the thin crust is delicious, too.
