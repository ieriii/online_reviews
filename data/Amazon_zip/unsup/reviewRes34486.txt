What can I say that's not already been said? This place is fantastic. I make a quick stop there regularly to pick up a sandwich or other goodies. Always delicious, very inexpensive, and the staff are always friendly. Falafel, Chicken Shwarma, Baba Ghanooj, Lentil Soup, Kefta Kabob... It's all great.  If you haven't been, check it.
