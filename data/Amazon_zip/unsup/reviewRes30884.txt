I really enjoy coming here for breakfast. They have a good selection of "different" foods and offer something other than your run of the mill traditional breakfast. The coffe is really good and I can sit here for hours, it's so comfy. We brought the kids here on a Sunday ONCE for brunch. Never again. They prefer the traditional pancakes, bacon, sausage, etc. and did not like it here one bit. We ordered white milk for them and I think the waiter should have warned us it was chunky (raw?). The pancakes were also wheat maybe, and they didn't like them. So now, I only come here when the kids are not with me. :-(
