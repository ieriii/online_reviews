Why in the world did I just find out they deliver last night?!?! I guess I don't read very GOODLY, since it clearly states that on this page and all around their restaurant. But, I'm like a horse with blinders when it comes to Crisp.....I just want my damn Chicken WANGS!!! Order made over the phone, estimated delivery was within one hour, and arrived in 20. Hewls to the yeah.....Crisp + Delivery = Daaaahnjerrous.....
