My friend's brilliant idea to gorge here before having to bare ourselves at the beach... Its not that I didn't enjoy the meal at tank its that it tasted identical to the Viet food here at home in NYC. My friend raved that their pho was better but my taste buds were previously spoiled by homemade pho which of course tops any restaurant attempt. The bahn mi was also not the best, my local place makes a better version. Gotta give it to tank though for having a book for a menu. When I visit Chicago again and head to the beach I will a) eat after the beach and b) try a different place.
