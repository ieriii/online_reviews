FINALLY decided to try this place out after driving by a dozen times and saying "we really need to try that place out sometime" - and all I can say is WOW - why ohhh why did I not try Irazu sooner???? We had the following items: -Veggie Burrito w/sauteed mushrooms added in - 5 stars! I'm a meat eater and this was EASILY one of the best burritos I've ever had. that should tell you how amazing it is. -Pineapple Empanada - 4 stars - sweet & tasty -Black Bean Empanada - 3 stars black bean flavor was a bit overpowering -Beef & Potato Empanada - 5 stars - yummy! -Plantain Empanada - 5 stars! This was EXCELLENT! -Spinach & Cheese Empanada - 4 stars! Cheesy yummy goodness :) -Oatmeal Shake - 5 Stars! yum yum yum yum yum! All of that and our total bill was $21... amazing value for such delicious food! do yourself a favor and give Irazu a chance next time you're looking for some place new to try! you will not be disappointed.. oh yeah - and its BYOB too! ;)
