My husband, 2.5 year old daughter and I visited Irazu again recently after a long hiatus. Everything was as delicious as I remembered. The vegetarian salad was fresh and the perfect combo of crunch/smooth/acid. The Pepito sandwich was perfection. I finished my daughter's left-over chicken taco at the hotel later that night and it was incredibly flavorful. My husband got one of the breakfast dishes and was pleased as well. Oatmeal shakes are a must! The service at Irazu is always top notch. The owner, Henry, truly cares about the customers and makes you feel incredibly welcome. I honestly would eat here everyday if I could (and I did 5 years ago when we lived down the street from this wonderful place!) Definitely check out Irazu. I promise you will not be disappointed!
