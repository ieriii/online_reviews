Yes, I'm aware that the Hop Leaf staff prides itself on being rude to patrons, but the patio server tonight took it to obnoxious levels, reminding us of "city ordinances" about how late she can take orders and last call--this started at 8:45 (we got several reminders!) She overcharged us by nearly $10 then rudely informed us that it's our responsibility to remind her when she forgets something in our order. Like I said: obnoxious.
