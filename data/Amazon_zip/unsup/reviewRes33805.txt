Yolk is an ok breakfast spot. The place is clean, the staff pretty friendly, but the food is just ok. If you like Eggs Benedict, don't get it here. The hollandaise sauce isn't right. Something is weird about it. I also had the chocolate and strawberry pancakes, not great, but not bad; the skillet which was pretty good (with turkey sausage) and the plain pancakes. Basically, everything is mediocre. It's not bad, but you can find better. I will say though, they can accomodate a large party and they keep the line moving pretty quickly.
