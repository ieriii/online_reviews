Functional. Don't get a room on 11th street side. Faces a music schl=loud music all day. Tiny rooms. Huge gap under door to room. Holly nice desk girl. Night staff underwhelming. I'm not messy, but I never had a housekeeper in my room the entire time. I would like to have my coffee replenished and fresh towels, but had to ask for them every night because the housekeeper didn't come to my room. Loud door slamming ALL night, and someone kept smoking in the hall. The heater was next to the thin windows so it kept going non stop and that side of the room was freezing while the other side was HOT. The wall thermostat was broken so I had to keep walking to the thing to adjust it. Also, the lighting sucks in the bathroom. and NO water pressure in the shower.
