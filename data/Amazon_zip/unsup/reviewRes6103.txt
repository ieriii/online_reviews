Came for a friends bday - the food is super good and sharing small plates is always fun. We started with the squash salad which was my fav small plate. We also got the truffle egg toast which was yummy and the mascarpone of the day which was pretty good. Then we moved on to the mushroom pizza, seafood linguine and sausage pasta. We also got two bottles of wine. Also got the bacio pie for the bday girl. Pretty reasonable - $40 for three people. Only reason this place gets 4 starts - we waiting about 2.5 hours for a table. Came in at 7, seated at 9:30. Food came out super fast. We passed the time at Three Aces which was down the street.
