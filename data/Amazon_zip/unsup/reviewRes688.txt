FABULOUS. Very inventive menu with clever presentations using what often looked like executive office toys. We both left full after the 24 course tasting menu with wine pairings. That's a lot of courses, but it didn't feel like our meal took over 4 hours. After reading some other reviews, we both couldn't imagine needing anything additional to eat afterwards.
