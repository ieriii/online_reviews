If I was rating this place solely on the food I would give it 4.5 stars. My food was very fresh and tasty and love that this place is local and right in the heart of Greektown. However, since I have to factor in customer service that takes it down a few notches.I realize the waiting space is cramped and in order to cut down on that they give you a beeper and send you a few doors down for complimentary coffee. That's fantastic. However, if the hostess tells you 30 minute wait, that sometimes means 1 hour and 20 minutes. I realize it's a busy place but after approaching her after the 1st hour wait to make sure she didn't accidentally overlook us. She seemed annoyed and completely unapologetic for the extra wait time. So after finally getting seated we meet our waitress who also seems like she would rather be anywhere else in the world. We constantly felt like we were being rushed throughout our meal. I had just signed my credit card receipt when the glorious hostess asked us to please leave because there were more people waiting for our table.No, no it's cool I didn't want to finish my beverage or enjoy myself. So to sum things up- the food is delicious but not great enough for me to deal with the aloof staff. There are way too many brunch spots in the city where you can get your waffles, ample time to eat them, without the side of bitchy.
