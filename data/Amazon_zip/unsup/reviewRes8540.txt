The food at Fogo is fantastic and never disappoints......15 varieties of meats and a wonderful buffet full of gourmet meat, vegetables, and cheeses. This is a brazilian steakhouse, so there is no menu (except for dessert menu); each patron eats the same buffet and meat selections...but the quality and service is outstanding. The salad bar is top notch! This is a MUST try when visiting Chicago! Honestly, the whole experience at this place is incredible. Personally, it's one of my top dining experiences. They have other locations in various cities such as Dallas, Austin, and Atlanta........but i've only had the opportunity to go to the Chicago location during a recent trip. Wonderful!
