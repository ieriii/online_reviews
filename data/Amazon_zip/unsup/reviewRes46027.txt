Only a couple things to add among all of the reviews for this place.  1) I think it should be obvious: you're walking into the Cheesecake Factory's sister restaurant, right off of Michigan, directly above Ann Taylor, for Pete's sake. If you don't like tourists, and if you don't like Cheesecake Factory-type restaurants, why on earth would you walk into this place? I think most of the low reviews are because people want to turn their noses up on lowly tourists vs. finding it an actual bad restaurant (although the broken a.c. a couple years back is a bad deal). I am baffled by the reviewers on here who went and threw up a low review and made the obvious comment "crowded with tourists." Really. Tell me more. "There was a wait time!" No -- who would have thought. Never would have guessed. 2) I have no idea what a previous reviewer (a self-proclaimed big baby, by the way) was eating/drinking, but our tab came nowhere near what she claims to have paid. We were well prepared to have paid more. We had two drinks (including one off the specialty menu) and entrees and paid a tab of $44. This place is a chain, has huge portions, and is a tourist stop -- so all in all, its prices were very fair. When we were done, we went somewhere else to cap off the night with more martinis and paid just as much. I give it three stars because it's exactly that -- a-ok for Chicago. A safe bet for a place to eat, especially for young families.
