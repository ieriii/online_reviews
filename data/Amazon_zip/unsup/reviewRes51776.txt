i didn't have high hopes for garcias.. im more of a hole in the wall lover myself.. that is those small mom and pop joints that make the damn best burritos you've ever had, even though they only used the same ingredients every other mexican place has.. garcias is the opposite, its like a powerhouse of mexican food, the dining area is huge, there were tons of people, lots of chaos and noise. my friends raved about the cheap tasty margarita pitchers, so we went for it. we ordered blended strawberry margaritas, which i assumed would be over-sugary made from a cheap blend. it wasn't, in fact it had real strawberry seeds (which makes me think real strawberries too). the salsa was also tasty, well blended pico de gallo, nothing super fancy, but i was super into it. (not sure what bland salsa the other yelpers were given...) but thats where the goodness ends. the rest of the food was suuper greasy, covered in cheese, oily.. yea it tasted ok, but i don't want my refried beans swimming in grease. we ordered the combo platter (taco, tostada, two enchiladas, rice and beans), which was a good deal, alex and i couldn't take it down, even with our joined efforts. but as the grease dripped down my hand while i ate my tostada i felt sick to my stomach,, and that feeling stayed with me well into the night....
