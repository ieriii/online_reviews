My husband and I ate at this restaurant on a recent trip to Chicago. I must say I have been a fan of Rick Bayless for many years when I use to watch his cooking show on TV. I have been trying to search for more episodes of his show, however nothing comes up. I am not sure if he still has it. Anyways when we were planning our trip I immediately made reservations to go to his restaurant, Topolobampo. I was not disspaointed. We arrived and we were immediately impressed at the decore, it truly is a nice place. We were seated and our dining experience began with the trio of ceviches. The most delicious ceviche I have ever had. Then we had our entrees. My husband had the cochinita pibil and I had the duck in chile guajillo. Both dishes were amazing. We finished off with a chocolate cake fit for a king. I can honestly say this has been one of the best meals ever. I highly recommend it.
