Most often eaten at restaurant in Chicago the last 6 years. Delicious steak in all kinds of ways from burritos to sandwiches. Also you have to get an oatmeal shake and some fried plantains smothered in oil and garlic. What more can anyone ask for? Oh maybe the redone outside seating area in the summer for soaking up the day....
