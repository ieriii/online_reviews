Love this place so much my fianc and I are contemplating having our rehearsal dinner here for our wedding. To start they give you amazing homemade pickles and potatoe chips. The hominy and corn salad is great with a slight smokey and spicey flavoring. The pulled chicken sandwhich is a great meal and plenty of food even without the generous side that it comes with. Just once did we have the courage to sample desserts and they were all huge and delicious. I have heard they have a seasonal key lime pie that is supposed to be phenomanal as well.
