Even this wine-lover found her home at this "4 page beer menu" spot... This place knows beer. If you are looking for a Miller Lite, yikes. If you are looking for inventive and unique tasting beers, to go along with their amazing hamburgers, you, my friend, found the right spot. The Sunday afternoon that I was at Bad Apple, it felt like 1/3 daycare, and 2/3 parents, who needed to drink b/c they had kids, and kids are hard. I had to admire the little tykes, as one by one I would see them lift up the 4 page beer menu...admiring what will be one day....
