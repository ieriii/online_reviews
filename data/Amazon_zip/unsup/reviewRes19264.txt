The beer menu here is fantastic as well as the food. Nice addition to North Center / Lincoln Square. The fried cheese curds were delicious and came with a good ranch which is always important. I had the spicy burger with onions, peppers, bacon and white cheddar. I ordered it Medium and it came more on the pink side. I would suggest ordering your burger Well if you really want medium. I don't mind my burgers pink since the meat is good. My wife had the veggie burger which she liked as well. Will definitely go here again.
