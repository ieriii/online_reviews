We chose Carnivale to celebrate with friends. We called for a reservation and were told they were booked, and our only option was to come in and wait for a table.  Given the drink menu, we decided an hour at the bar didn't sound so bad. We went and ordered a round of drinks, and then my smooth talking husband talked to the hostess and she sat as almost as soon as I took the last sip of my margarita. The main dining room seemed a bit noisy, but we were led to the back, down a few stairs, and were sat in a small cove. We had a lovely meal and enjoyed each of our dishes which included the pork chop and a jerk chicken special.  Go - it was a great experience.
