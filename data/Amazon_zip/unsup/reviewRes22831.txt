I have loved Greek food ever since I visited Greece in 2004 and wanted to go nowhere else but Greektown for my birthday dinner this year. Everyone recommended Greek Islands, and they were definitely right! We got an awesome table sort of overlooking the whole restaurant (which is much larger than I expected). We had to get the flaming cheese appetizer, which is just as fun as it sounds, although be prepared for salty! We also got the Tzatziki and pita bread, which was DELICIOUS. I love spanokopita, so I had that as my entree, my husband had the lamb shiskabob and we both cleaned our plates leaving no room for dessert :( Prices are good here and the service is even better, we'd literally take a sip out of our water before it was refilled!
