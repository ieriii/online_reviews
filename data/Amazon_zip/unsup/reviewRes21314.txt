I really love coming here in the morning on weekends, when it's quiet. The churros are just about as good as ones I had in Madrid, except that they're rolled in sugar and the Spanish ones weren't. I love the Authentic and Almendrado hot chocolates. The Barcelona isn't quite as good as the real deal (sorry Rick...), but it's still very tasty. The tortas are delicious. I love the breakfast torta sans chorizo, since I don't eat meat. For lunch, the woodland mushroom torta is terrific. Now if only there weren't so much of a line after 11 AM...
