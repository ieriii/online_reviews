i can see it's popular for a reason. they make really good food & are very patient & helpful. i actually noticed a lot of ass pains anxiously waiting to get their grub on. why doesn't anyone in the world pay with cash anymore? why are you charging something under $10?  that's just so weird to me. anyhoo, i joined a pal who goes here & it was my first time. i got the gazpacho & a side of xtra avocado so it could keep me full. my pal brought the obligatory sriracha sauce which made this a most perfect bowl of summer tomato goodness. paired with a liter of pelligrino, i was set for the afternoon.  i like the diy thing. why not get your own silverware, etc. you are not obligated to tip. not really an issue for me. i will definitely stop in for more. i think i like what they are doing. i was especially impressed with the service at the front of the store. patience is really what this place is about. & very well executed food. well done. those who don't "get" that never will. not worth milk & honey's time anyhoo. i don't give a shit about granola. i'm not a dog. but i heard it's gold. and i will definitely return at a smart time for the brekkie. and intellegentisa makes a signature coffee blend exclusively for them is also impressive. if they support this place, it has to be gold.
