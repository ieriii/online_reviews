THE BEST HOT DOGS IN THE WORLD! and trust me, i've tried hot dogs in europe too!  Even if you are at Midway Airport, try the ones there (probably not as great as the drive thru one but damn, still better than any other dog). remember to bring cash to the drive thru superdawg! no credit! Service is friendly. It's a drive thru so you'll get minimal service.  But I had no problems. The Superdawg meal comes with a pickle, fries, and of course, your hot dog in a sesame bun. topped with mustard, onion, pickles and this "green stuff." from what i was told that "green" stuff is a type of sweet cucumber. whatever . . it was GREAT. NO KETCHUP!! you have to ask for it! Chicago style hot dogs don't have ketchup! MY FIRST BITE INTO THE HOT DOG. . . . HEAVEN.  it's so plump and so juicy and so aaaaaaaaaaaah. I have been here 5 times and each time, that superdawg just makes me cry because i am so happy! when I die, i would like to be burried with a superdawg right next to me.
