I can't say I was really impressed with this place. It was ok but not something I would rave about. I ordered the mariscos and beet and orange salad for appetizers and that was great. For entrees, we ordered the cuban pork and and roasted chicken-they were dried and had no flavor. Just seemed like they were leftovers...
