I thought this place was good and tasty, deep dish is really the way to go here. I think the thin slice was fine, but it was more mediocre compared to the deep dish. The deep dish was delicious. But, to be honest, I am not that great at differentiating good deep dish from bad deep dish. Maybe I just have never had bad deep dish, who knows. But I think it's really cool they do it by the slice. Definitely recommend this place if you are in the neighborhood and looking for pizza.
