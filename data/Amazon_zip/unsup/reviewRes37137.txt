Bravo! What a great place for fantastic beer, lively atmosphere and tasty eats! Hopleaf is definitely a place to be for Yelpers. I arrived on a Thursday night and this place was packed! It didn't take long to snag a table, but I could instantly tell that Hopleaf gets busy often. They offer loads of amazing drafts and even have a whole separate menu for the bottled beers. Simply put, it's Andersonville's interpretation of beer heaven. I tried so many different beers that it's a little hard to remember ( =) ) but one of the standouts was Kwak. It's a great Belgium beer served in a unique glass, and it's quite an experience. Food was also involved in this visit, not much...but some. I personally ordered the onion straws (rings), and they were mighty tasty! The aioli that was served with them seemed almost unnecessary. A friend of mine then ordered a CB&J. Imagine is a fancy grilled cheese and a fancy PB&J had a love child. The CB&J consisted of cashew butter, fig jam, raclette cheese and it was served on sour dough. It's a wonderful adult version of the classic. I can't wait to go back. It was a damn good experience last time and it will be another great experience as soon as I get my butt over to Chicago again. If you're on the north side, go check out Hopleaf.
