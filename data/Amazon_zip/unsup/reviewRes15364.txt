With how packed this bar gets you would think there's no other bars in the area! But it's just that it's so good! I've been to Revolution a couple times now and have noticed a few things. First, they always have a good crowd. And their hostesses seem to go out of their way to seat you, and try to make any accommodation you ask for. Like when Alex N showed up an hour later and they made plans to extend our table when they finally arrived. What service! Also, the interior is very nice, with the fireplace and the large bar, and the windows exposing the brewery in back. And the beers are good. I like 'em all, but I was particularly fond of the stout. And the IPA. And the amber. Like I said, I like 'em all! And well-priced for microbrews. And their food was tasty too. Ordered the workingman's burger (for the bacon of course) and it was juicy and fresh. I can't wait to try some more of their food items. And of course, I can't wait to drink more of their beer. This is a great place!
