I'll go back and give it another try. The food was OK. The Server highly recommended the Hot Chicken and Pasta salad which turned out to be mediocre at best. Avoid the Onion Chips, they where extra oily and flavorless. The place was really fun inside, clean and bright and the Menu was huge but nothing to stand out from other brunch spots. We got a decent parking spot on MLK but it could be harder on other days.
