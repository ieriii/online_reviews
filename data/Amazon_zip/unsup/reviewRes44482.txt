Quite a unique place. The bakery and its "lounge" next door have not been remodeled, and the bakery itself is small, but the fondant draped cakes in the window displays and the smells that seep out of there just draws you in. There are two cases of pastries, mainly cookies and little cakes. My girl friend and I came here to grab portabello foccacia sandwiches, mint iced teas, 1 strawberry almond tart, and 3 macaroons, which totalled $22. I don't think they post prices, which was a little annoying. But everything was tasty! Surprisingly, the portabello focaccia sandwich too, even though it looked boring. However, the foccacia bread was a little hard, which I think was a result of it being stored in the refrigerated case. We took our food next door where there are tables, A/C, and free wifi - until it started raining. Love that there is that much seating and free wifi, especially for studiers and workers who need sweets to fuel their brains!
