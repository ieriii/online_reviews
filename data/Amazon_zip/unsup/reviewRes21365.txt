Not a fan of this place. While ten bucks may be a reasonable deal for a GOOD chille relleno, tamale and enchilada platter, the ones that we got looked dried up and pathetic. For ten bucks at a Mexican restaurant, I expect my platter to be heaping with deliciousness, not sparseness, as the three pieces of unappetizing fingerlings accompanied by a sad smidgen of rice and beans appeared to be. Our server also said that I could order an extra enchilada a la carte even though it wasn't on the menu, but ended up bringing me the entire platter and expecting to charge me for it too - I had to "return" it. Apart from looking sad, the food didn't taste good either. It seems, however, that this place gets rave review for their margaritas. Seated by the bar, I was able to watch them throw fresh fruit into blenders and whip up some pretty tasty looking frozen margaritas, which come in an array of flavors. I didn't try one...but I was definitely tempted.  Thus the best use of this place is probaly to show up on half-price margarita night and take advantage of the free chips and salsa. But nothing more.
