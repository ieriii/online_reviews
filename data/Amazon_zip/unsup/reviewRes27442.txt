Don't EVER call this "Chicago Style" as it's not even close. It's as unique as it gets. The pan pizza is really the only way to fly. It has a nice crust, cheese is crusted on, you find yourself wanting to eat the crust first. I'm a minimal topping guy as too many tend to blend into a big ass slice. The sausage is great, that's all you really need. Pequods has it figured out. sure the wait is really long for a pizza (45-1hr) but hey, have a beer and shut up because the pizza is so legit you will forget how long you waited. I wouldn't bother with any apps from here, they are all your typical fried junk with a side of marinara. Don't waste $$$ on a salad either. For one, you are about to consume 1500 calories and roughly 30 grams of tasty fat so get over yourself with ordering a salad to try to justify to yourself that its good for you. 2nd, you are getting a load of iceberg with a tomato wedge that resembles the salads I used to get in the dorms. This place is decently priced, the pizza travels well if you live in neighboring areas and they have cold beer.  Just don't go here with plans to walk across the street and catch a movie, know where you're going and the pizza isn't by the slice. I also really hope nobody talks shit about the service. It a pizza joint, what are you expecting.
