I ate at Yolk a few weeks ago and had an overall good experience. The food was great, and after all, that's what I went there for! The beginning of our adventure started off a little rocky though.. We got there sometime around 10:30 on a Sunday. We were expecting a wait, so we weren't startled when they told us it would be 45-60 minutes. The thing that did annoy us, however, was the annoying host that was working. To put it simply, he was rude and did not know how to take charge and direct the crowd of people to stand in the right place. I was okay with waiting, but the guy was REALLY getting on all of our nerves. We were eventually seated and HUNGRY! I got the corned beef hash with a poached egg and the potatoes and it was deliciousss. Everything on the menu looked so good. I need to go back soon and keep on trying different things. My mouth is watering just thinking about it!
