A friend of mine took me here yesterday 06.15.06. I found out that the guy who owns this place went into business with my friend when they were 19 (they're now both in their 40's.). So they have a deep connection. Best buds. I learned a LOT about the background of the Art of Pizza - and all of it GOOD. And GREAT pizza! Years ago, my dad had a bakery (Napolitano) and he also made pizza. It's like I'm back in the bakery when I was 8 years old! This pizza rocks! Buying by the slice allows you to choose a variety ($2.75 a slice) Yes, the place itself is very small, but it's not a dive. It's a nice place! As usual, I have the "scoop" others do not: the owner bought out the whole strip mall, and he's taking the next two empty stores and expanding. The local alderman recommended he also do outdoor seating, but from what I can gather, that would be messy and later down the line. Remember: The Art of Pizza won the Best Deep Dish Pizza in Chicago by WGN TV. I know why!
