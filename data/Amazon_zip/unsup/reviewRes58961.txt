Sunda is a wonderful dining experience for all the senses. We have been there twice and have had great experiences both times. Last time we went on a Tuesday and the place was packed. We walked by several other restaurants in the area and there were very few tables filled. Sunda is doing it right! The atmosphere is upscale, fun, creative, and energized. If you are looking for a quiet place, Sunda may not be for you. The bar area is comfortable with interesting cocktails and my favorite Pinor Noir, A to Z. The staff is friendly and waiters are well versed in the menu and will help you make fabulous choices. The "No You Didn't" roll and the cod main course are the best. The menu is heavy meat and fish based. I would love to see a vegan main course choice that isn't sushi. If you are looking for an interesting, high energy, yummy dining experience, go to Sunda.
