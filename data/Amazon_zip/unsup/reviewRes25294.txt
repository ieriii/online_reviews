My wife and I have been going to Mercat since it opened in 2008 and we have introduced friends and family to its Catalan Spanish delicacies since the beginning. The "small plates" format is more than a little overplayed at this point but Mercat came in at the beginning of that phase and with it's chef winning Iron Chef the restaurant which is also beautiful and well located in the Blackstone Hotel was off to the races. While you can certainly order off of any of the menu's different segments we have have loved their tasting menu which is a real value at $55 because they bring selections from each of their menu segments and you get their best. It is a lot of food though but the variety is incredible. Highlights for starters are the tomato bread, the aged spanish hams, croquetas and the fantastic white anchovies. For flatbreads try the beef short rib & horseradish, for vegetables must haves are the wild mushroom with confit potato and the amazing stuffed cipollini onions. From the planxa (grill) try the amazingly marinated ribeye and the Colorado rack of lamb. I have always wanted to call ahead and order the whole suckling pig for four or more people but never had the takers. Summary- Mercat a la Planxa is and has been one of the best new restaurants in the past few years, its a beautiful room overlooking Grant Park in the Blackstone Hotel and offers food served like tapas but made of the finest Spanish and American ingredients you will find.
