I've gone to RJ Grunts quite a few times. They have an AWESOME veggie burger...one of the best in the city. I'm not a fan of their "homemade chips" and would prefer some fries (which they don't offer). If they could get the side item right, I would probably go more often. For now, I will go to Dunlay's on Clark.
