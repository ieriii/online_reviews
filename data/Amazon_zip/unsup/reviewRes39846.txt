This is one of my favorite after club spots. I use to think it was opened 24 hours until I was kicked out around 5am. The kalbi and bulgogi here is awesome and I like cooking it to perfection myself (or having my boyfriend do it for me). I also like the boodae jigae and yuk gae jang soups. The side dishes are one of the best parts. I love the potato dish. The one thing I must warn you though is its almost always crowded when I go and the employees are not that friendly especially if you don't speak korean and even more so if you don't order the more expensive dishes on the menu.
