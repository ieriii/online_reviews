Absolutely amazing! I was very impressed with their salad bar selection. They had a delicious shrimp salad and ceviche, I was happy with that alone. Then came all the meat cuts. They offer 16 different type of meat including shrimp and baked pinneaple. It is all you can eat so please go with an empty belly! Already looking forward to my next visit.
