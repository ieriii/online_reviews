Sort of a mixed bag here. I'm confident that i'd give one and a half more stars if they changed one thing - Its way way way too dark in there. It's like you've descended into a cave and are worried about what lurks around the corner. Perhaps a trogloditic creature, or if you're lucky a fondue pot of hot cheese. You don't really know. Maybe the thought of that is thrilling to some, but to me it was a complete distraction. I imagine the intent is to produce a romantic ambiance, but the reality is that it makes you wonder what they are trying to hide. We showed up at 7:30pm, (in July, so it was still very bright outside) so trying to find our way to the table before our eyes adjusted was almost dangerous. I came within about a half inch of running straight into a pole. One of the corner booth seats has a pole nearby (which for some reason they attached a MIRROR to at about eye height) that's nearly impossible to see and only my instincts allowed me to evade it in time. I had to sit for 5 minutes to let my eyes adjust before i could even begin to see the menu. Overall the food was good. The cheese and dessert fondue were as expected, although the cheese tasted a bit "off". I can't really describe why. I was too pre-occupied with trying to see what i was doing to really enjoy the meat/veggie/oil fondue. The waiter said "the chicken is cooked when its not pink in the middle" (which I already knew). Herein lies the problem - The human eye cannot distinguish color at the level of darkness in the room. I think i cooked my food OK but I suppose I'll find out in a few hours. Really unnecessarily dark. Did I get my point across yet? Not sure if anyone at Geja's reads these reviews, but it seems to be a common theme. Turn the lights up and I'll be back. Otherwise, no thanks. I like a dark room- i sit in one quite a bit watching tv at night. But seriously I want to be able to SEE my food.
