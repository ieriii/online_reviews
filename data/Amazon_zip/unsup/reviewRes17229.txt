Long story short: great food, bad service. We were there for my buddy's last night out on the town before he got married. From the time we walked in to the time we left was over 2 1/2 hours. No because we were slow to order, mind you. We were a group of 6 (with 2 extra for drinks) - and it took 20 minutes for the server to take our orders. Our food then came out in shifts; not a problem except that the first person would be done eating before the next dish even arrived. Considering how much we were drinking, you would expect them to get our glasses full. The reason I give 3 stars (and not lower) is because the food was fantastic. The chicken tikka and mixed grill we simple and divine. The mango kulfi is not to be missed. Lessons learned: go to India House, but not on a Saturday night. Don't bring a big group and don't plan anything for a couple hours afterwards - or you'll be late.
