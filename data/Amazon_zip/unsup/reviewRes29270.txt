One of my favorite little joints in town! Pasta is very good, relatively cheap for a mid-level place, and though it's narrow and gets crowded the service has never been bad for me (even though it may take them a little time to get to you the first time, they are typically attentive thereafter) and when I want a big bowl of pasta it's the first place I think of.
