My favorite cocktail bar in Chicago. Not *quite* as good as Little Branch or Milk & Honey in NYC (my 2 favorite places there). But great for grabbing a drink somewhere cozy, and being able to talk with someone quietly with a little privacy (the high backed chairs are surprisingly effective barriers). Excellent place for a date or a special night with out with a SO.
