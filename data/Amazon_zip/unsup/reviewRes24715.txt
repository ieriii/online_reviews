Came here for my birthday, just me and my husband, since I heard it has a pretty romantic atmosphere. We've never really tried a real fondu place, so we were kind of excited to try this place. Also, we bought this http://restaurant.com gift certificate a while back we finally get to use it. I was glad I made a reservation, for some reason even on a Wednesday early evening (6pm), it was pretty full. The restaurant has two main rooms for dining, it's pretty dimly lit, with dark wood theme going on, they also have spanish guitar music in the background (I believed it was live music but I didn't see the musician playing it, maybe he was in the other room). For the food, we ordered two premier dinner (as required if we were to use the gift certificate), we had the steak and scallop and the steak with mixed seafood (sorry I forgot their names on the menu). Premier dinner comes with salad, which was really tasty; follows with cheese fondu with grapes, apples and bread; then onto the mail course with the meat/seafood, they have 8 different dipping sauces, all very tasty, I loved the thai chilli sauce the most; after that we had chocolate fondu with assortment of fruit (strawberries/bananas) and pound cake, also a fondu-version of s'mores, which was my favorite. All and all we enjoyed the food there, service was excellent. I would go back for just the cheese or chocolate fondu tho, since the mail fondu (boiling oil) is a bit greasy for me.
