Came here for the first time with my 2 girlfriends after dinner. Very spacious and everything looks good. I got a Ice Frappe - Sweet with milk. My friend got Ice Frappe - Medium with milk. My other friend got the Cappuccino Fredo Then we split a tiramisu and mango mousse. Drink were ok and strong. Tiramisu was different......texture was different from the ones I'm use too. The mango mousse was ok also. Service was ok. We were greeted right away and seated. Waitress came by, but we needed a bit more time since it was our first time. It did take awhile before we saw our waitress again for our check. Very nice place to sit back and talk and enjoy yourselves. Will come back to try the food and other desserts....yum!
