So I walk in and after getting carded I'm standing in the bar waiting. "Waiting?" yes waiting. I came to eats, but nobody said anything to me.... Me to my ass says: "look! open tables...should I seat myself?" my ass to me: " Dude, sit down. worst thing they could do is to smash your face in and you already ugly so no issues with that or they can smile and take your order" me to my ass: "okay dude., thank you for your timely wisdom" Luckily for my ugly mug they smiled and said hello, "Hello!" and asked..."are you drinking AND Eating?" Me talking out the side of my ass: " Yes! BOTH please! if its okay? Kitchen is still open? (it was 21:30 on a friday) Hot looking smiling and friendly server: "Yes!....." So between the free pretzels, the 3 floyds two hearted ales and burger with the chorizo...I is full. The end. Thank you very much. Good mac n cheese. Good fresh cut double fried frites. Good soundsystem and laser show. Good HD system and Concert DVD.s Not so good. Smelly fog juice to mess with my dining experience. Chillax on the smoke please. Medium rare was more raw than rare. kthxbi! It was fun. Just need to check the website for their DVD band lineups to match up my carnivorous needs. word.
