Delicious. I had the chicken with rice and lentils. Fantastic (and I would know). The hummus was good too. Even the mean looking Arab lady wasn't that bad. I will certainly be back to try more food. The only problem was the atmosphere, I felt like it the restaurant was really dirty. The bathroom looked dirty and even where I was sitting looked a little dirty. Maybe it is because it is so dark in there or maybe it is because they have not kept up on maintaining the restaurant? In any case, the food is good and next time I am in bucktown I will give it another go. Maybe next time I will carry out.
