On our last day in town, my boyfriend and I red lined it down to Chinatown because, well, we wanted some Chinese food, and isn't that where you go? We wanted something spicy, and you Yelpers said this was the money Szechuan in the area, so this is where we went. I was so overwhelmed by the menu. So many choices, so little time! I went with something that's hard to find in Utah Chinese restaurants: stir fried kidney. My boyfriend got some supposedly extra spicy special crispy noodle dish with pork and squid. We started with the sizzling rice soup. The soup was slightly underwhelming, mostly because I was expecting a chicken broth based soup (which is how I've usually had sizzling rice soup). This was more sweet and sour based, and while good, I *love* that other version, so I had my hopes up. The kidneys cured me, though. They were meaty and delicious, though the sauce wasn't that spicy. I should have gone with the Kung Pao version. The super spicy noodles had a bite to them, but it seemed like they definitely gringoed up the spices for us. We can handle it, I swear! But the flavors were nice, and I really liked the dish. They served chili cabbage before the other dishes came that we seemed to eat in record time. Very nice flavor. Service was pretty standard for a Chinese restaurant, which means they were polite and efficient, and you can't go wrong with that. The price was very nice as well. Overall, a very good experience.
