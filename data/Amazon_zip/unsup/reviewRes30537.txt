Nana's is one of our go to places for breakfast, the staples on the menu are wonderful (the Nanadict is just perfect) the specials can be hit or miss, so if you're looking for adventure go with a special, but if you want a sure thing I'd go with the set menu. The reason I give it three stars is the service. It's pretty terrible on a good day. The servers are never smiling, never tell you what the specials actually are and depending on the day may or may not refill your coffee. We had one waiter that was there for only a few months that was smiling and made our experience worth while, but he seems to have moved on. One of the owners was our waiter this past weekend, so I was hoping that would mean better service, but my coffee was dry and no one took our order for 20 minutes after we arrived to a pretty empty restaurant. I'll keep coming here for breakfast because the food is tasty, but I really wish the service would come up to meet the food standard. If Bridgeport continues to get better breakfast options we'll spend less time at Nana's and more time somewhere people are happy and smiling when they take our money.
