I had a wonderful meal here. Very tasty coconut curry shrimp, which was not too spicy and very flavorful. The details weren't as impressive. The service was nothing to shout about and the upstairs closed-in deck area where we ate was very crowded and cramped. Intimate feel, if you want to be intimate with all those surrounding you. While waiting for our table, we sat in the upstairs lounge where the country and alt-rock music didn't fit the quaint atmosphere at all.
