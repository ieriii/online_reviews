Yet another hotel that I booked off of Hotwire. I believe this one I got for around $75 a night. There seem to be a lot of complaints on Yelp about the elevators being too slow. From my experience they were just fine! I never had to wait more than a minute or two, which seems perfectly reasonable. I found the location to be quite convenient for my needs. We were planning on taking the Wendella boat tour, and this was literally across the street. It's a few blocks from a CTA station, but nothing unmanageable by any means. The room was nicely sized, though unfortunately our view was quite lacking. Mostly alleyway, though there was a sliver of a lake view, if I craned my neck just right. The bed was VERY comfortable, and we didn't get any noise from surrounding rooms. Best sleep I'd had in a hotel for quite a while. This hotel doesn't have a lot of bells and whistles. The business center and gym were both certainly lacking. Still, for simply a place to sleep at night, this place was more than satisfactory. I'd never go out of my way to stay here again, but I enjoyed it well enough.
