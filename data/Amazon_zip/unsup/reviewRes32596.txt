Really good food for the most part, although the chicken adobo and other Filipino dishes are a little off the mark for me. Love the tempura shrimp, sushi, and bi bim bop, though! I can't say enough about the service. The staff is very friendly, professional and well-trained. Sunda is one of my favorite lunch places and I'm there at least a couple of times a month.
