If you haven't been, you need to run, don't walk here because you are missing out. This is a 5 star all the way restaurant. It's located off Mich Avenue so it gets incredibly crowded but they do a good job of getting you seated when they say they will. The food is excellent and have the dessert- my favorite is the strawberry shortcake!
