I HIGHLY recommend this place. With that said, this is not a place to go for a quiet or intimate dinner. Its communal seating at a couple of LONG high tables. If you're looking for inventive cuisine, a very extensive wine list and a place that is very vibrant, this is a great spot. It's a great place to go for a mini-meal in between, say...mid to late afternoon after doing some shopping on Michigan Avenue. The service was top-notch, our waitress knew the menu off the top of her head and she made the experience memorable. The wine my friend and I ordered was out and she recommended another wine which was similar, however much more expensive, but she honored the price of the wine we originally had chosen. Now that's how good customer service is supposed to work! This is not like all the other "small-plate" restaurants that have proliferated throughout the city, the food here is definitely a cut above the others that I've experienced.
