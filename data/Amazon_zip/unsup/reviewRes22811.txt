it's a hot dog stand. all you gourmands can leave, right now ;) we LOOOVE this place, even though one of us is a vegetarian. we stay in the drive-up area, so we can bring our pet doggies with us. we all just hang out in the car. they go nuts here and are constantly begging for bits of french fry. and it's great even on snowy, rainy days, because, well, you never have to step outside! we love it for the atmosphere, for the unique experience. the food is so much better than the Sonic's (now in the area, in Aurora and other locations). the hot dog has a spice to it, that a generic hot dog would not have, and a richer color. which could just be more red dye, but who cares! we took an out-of-country guest here (among other destinations) for an example of a 'quintessential' American experience -- that even though America is not just what you see on TV + movies -- that there are some places that have the 'gee whiz' quality. the food was not the "best they ever had" but it didn't matter -- they had a filling lunch and an experience they could have only here in all of Chicago. a supa fun date place as long as they're not a meat-and-fries-a-phobe!! - whimsical, nostalgic, casual -- wear your bobby socks!
