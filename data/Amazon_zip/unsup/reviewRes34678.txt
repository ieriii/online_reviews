Behold: Dude Sushi. I had just sat down with two female friends when an all-male group sat down next to us. Call me gender-stereotypical, but I thought, now there's something you don't see every day - 5 dudes out for sushi night. Then I took a look around me: all-black walls, our waiter wearing a hoodie, some incredibly violent anime flick playing on a projector, and godzilla-sized sushi rolls. This place is just a few giant leather recliners short of a full-on man cave. Of course, my friends loved the place too, so sushi x is fun for all. Moving on: Did I mention the ginormous rolls? Because they're ginormous. They're so amazeballs that only combinixtures of words can describe them. Don't be scared of the prices - one roll almost filled me up. You don't need to order two rolls/person. We got the Crab Rangoon, Omega and the Five-0 (bacon & sushi, in it together!?! OF COURSE!!). Also, it's BYOB, and CVS is just across the corner. Extra win. Not too crowded on a Thursday, but not dead either. I would definitely check it out again. Man date, anyone?
