I'm going to join the chorus of people complaining about how crowded it is here. I cam here one weeknight wanting some beers (no dinner, just beer) and was told I could sit upstairs, which had a more limited beer menu and no food. It was fine, and I liked everything I got, but my group was here until the upstairs stopped serving, and when we left there was still no room to sit down. It's cool that they have such an extensive beer list and such great food, but there's no point if people can't enjoy it because they're stuck upstairs with four beers on draft. I shouldn't have to get here at 5 to be able to sit down. If you want a great selection of Euro-beers, go to the Map Room instead.
