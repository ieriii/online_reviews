I loved staying at this lake front hotel right on Lake shore offering awesome views everywhere! I sort of felt like I was at the Hard Rock in Vegas but with an added touch of feng-shui energy. The hallways are paved with rocks and have iridescent lighting everywhere as trance music is on everywhere from the elevators all around. Love the whole 'W' theme...Whatever, Whenever and they certainly lived up to it. I needed a shower cap and called this line and they were there pronto. In addition, was very impressed with the W store catalog but didn't get a chance to do any retail therapy there this weekend. While the room was nice, the bathroom was considerably smaller than expected. The shower was certainly no marvel of engineering. Whoever left the door off of the stall shower is probably the same person mopping up the floor afterwards.
