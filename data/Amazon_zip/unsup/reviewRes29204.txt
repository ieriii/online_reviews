I came here for my birthday last year and had a great time. The food was so terrific. I live in Los Angeles so you know that we have no shortage of great Mexican and Central American places. I tried to go back for lunch but alas they were closed on Mondays and it was my last day in town. So I had to go next door and cry in my scotch at the Tumble Inn.( Not really the name of the place but they left the signage up after they finished shooting the Dillinger film here.)
