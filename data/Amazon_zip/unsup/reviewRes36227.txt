Can I please give this place two snaps in a Z formation?! I LOVED everything about Meli! For the past year, I'd heard and read great things about Meli, but for some reason it kept falling off my radar of places to have breakfast. Probably because in my mind, it's hard to beat Yolk. However, this week my co-worker told me that it was fabulous and that I should try it, so finally I did - and now it's reigning as my favorite breakfast place in the city. Although it's in the heart of Greektown, the area doesn't influence the ambiance whatsoever. You walk in and it's like a cozy french country cafe with yellow walls and comfortable tables. We went on the earlier side, 8:30am, so there wasn't a wait, but it wasn't dead either. Sure enough 15 minutes later, there was a line out the door. We sat down and looked through the extensive (no joke HUGE) menu with tons of breakfast options...everything from french toast made with Challah bread, duck omelets, skillets, frittatas and much more. I went with a breakfast usual - Corned Beef Hash and Eggs, while my husband ordered the Pancakes. When the food came we were surprised at how large the portions were, especially for the low cost of everything. My meal came with eggs, toast, corned beef, red potatoes and fruit...everything was so delish, especially their homemade marmalades. However, the real deciding factor was my husband's pancakes since he really is the connoisseur and sure enough he gave them a thumbs up - enough to say that he prefers Meli's pancakes over Yolk's which says A LOT. Overall, this place was amazing and to Yolk I have to apologize, I think Meli's will be our new breakfast place we frequent every weekend.
