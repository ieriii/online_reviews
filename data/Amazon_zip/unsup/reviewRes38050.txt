Sure, it's not perfectly authentic Chicago deep dish. Sure, it's a chain restaurant. Sure, being downtown sucks. But any Chicago-style pizza place that can make a New Yorker say "mmm" deserves a good mention. Giordano's is a great place to stop in if you're doing the regular touristy stuff in the city, particularly if you plan to hit Hancock Observatory. I had a small sausage and pepperoni pizza, which served as both dinner and breakfast for my date and me. It was loaded with a ton of cheese and delicious sauce. Who cares what my Chicago friends say? I'm a fan.
