I absolutely love this place! I am a picky eater and never am able to order everything off the menu without substitutions. At Chicago Diner I can!! The staff is also very friendly and very knowledgeable regarding their food and the ingredients. The only thing I wish they had were gluten free cookies! But I am excited that they have a Gluten Free Menu!
