Out of this world chicken!!  At the suggestion of the very friendly owner, we ordered a whole chicken, half with the Crisp BBQ and the other half the Seoul Sassy.  The chicken was amazing.... really amazing. Perfectly crispy skin. Perfectly moist and hot on the inside, and really, really meaty cuts. There wasn't a skimpy piece of chicken to be found. Probably the best fried chicken I've had in Chicago.  Even places serving standard Buffalo wings could take a few lessons from this place. I really liked the sassy wings. I also really liked the Crisp BBQ wings. They were both very different and I'm torn between picking which I preferred...  I tried some of Brian's Bi Bim Bop... it was very tastey, but I don't have a lot to benchmark that against. The owner was very friendly, wanted to know everyone's names...and he actually remembered them, then came by "Hey Dane how was this?" Why yes thanks for asking, it was really good.  I really want to go back and try their burritos, their Buffalo wings, and other stuff now. I think I found a new habit.
