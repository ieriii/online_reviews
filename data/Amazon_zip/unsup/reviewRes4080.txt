We absolutely loved it! The first time my now husband and I dined here was over a year ago. We were blown away by the incredible food. Then we read that they were closing down. We were so excited when they re-opened that we knew we had to go back. But then we started to get worried...was the food really as good as we remembered? How could anything possibly be that good? I am very happy to report after dining there again a few weeks ago that yes, it really was THAT good! Not only is the food outstanding, but the chefs take the time to tell you about the dishes they bring and were very welcoming to our questions about the different flavors in the dishes. Many people ask how Schwa and Alinea compare and I have to say that I much prefer Schwa. My husband and I both found the courses at Schwa much more manageable (I almost fell asleep at Alinea from a food coma) and the service much friendlier. Schwa certainly has a more casual and welcoming atmosphere that Alinea. And since it's priced reasonably we can, and will, come back again and again.
