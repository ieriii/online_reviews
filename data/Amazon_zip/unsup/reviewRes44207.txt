Definitely one of the better sushi places in the Lakeview area. I've enjoyed Ping Pong many times (sister restaurant across the street) so I checked this place out soon after it opened many months ago. I've been there a number of times now and it's always been good quality and fast attentive service. The warm wood decor is a nice touch. The price is moderate and I love that it's BYOB.  The only complaints I have are the very small seating room and the lack of proper insulation against the cold weather. The lack of a waiting area means people are constantly opening and closing the door, allowing for a regular cold breeze during the winter months. I like the place, but sadly I won't be back until spring.
