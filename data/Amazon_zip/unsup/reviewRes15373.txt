Calo is a terrific spot. The menu is extensive and the portions are generous.  I had the tilapia with lemon and white wine sauce which was a special, it was fantastic.  I don't know if I liked the tilapia more or the bed of sauteed spinach it arrived on. It was a great dish. My fiance ordered the pappardelle con funghi - grileld shrimp with thick fettucine noodles and mushrooms in a creamy chardonnay and garlic sauce. I didn't get to sample his plate (it was gone too quickly!) but, it smelled amazing. If you love garlic, I highly recommend this dish.
