I feel very guilty for giving this place two stars. No doubt the food was very well prepared but it was an excruciating four-and-a-half long dinner. We ordered the nine-course meal and the highlights were the sturgeon and the lamb, which were perfectly cooked. The frog leg tempura with this green, garlicky sauce was also delicious. Dessert featured their homemade nutella. We even saw ROD F'ING STEWART with his new, uglier, wife. My heart was fluttering the whole night. The food was good but it was a little frustrating that portions were excruciatingly small. Meh. It was good, but I probably would not jump at the chance to return despite the delicious muffing they gave as a parting gift. ROD STEWART!!! Does anybody care???
