This place is supposed to serve one of the top hotdogs in the U.S. so I went with an open mind, figuring they may be overhyped. All I have to say is..This is it huh? For $5 (really, why so much?) my Vienna Chicago style dog was squished into an undersized shoebox, covered with luke warm crinkle fries, and the whole thing looked like it had seen better days. What's with the weird green tomato at one end of the hotdog? Is this a joke? The ingredients of a Chicago style dog are supposed to be arranged so you get an equal amount of all the ingredients in each bite. This was a sorry excuse for a Chicago dog as far as presentation. Taste was OK, but again not any different than dozens of other Vienna stands. The Superburger was almost $6 and was equal to, if not worse quality, than a Wendy's 1/4 lb. My God this place is overrated. Thank heavens for the owner he has those creepy Mr. and Mrs. Hot Dog statues adorning the roof, or this place might be out of business.
