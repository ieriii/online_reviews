Is this place PHO real?! Group of 13 people. Reservations taken for 5:30pm on a Tuesday.  No problem. Separate check for all 12 people. Totally accommodating. Keep in mind, they'll only allow you to use a max of 2 credit cards-otherwise... No problem. Trying to pass along our BYOB bottles of wine without knocking into each other. They've got a Lazy Susan for that.  No problem. Hungry much? Pho here is delicious and brought out in generous portions. One bowl equals dinner and lunch for the next day. I had the #42. Gotta love bible tripe! Unlike your gas tank, it only takes $8 to fill up here. No problem. Not in a pho kind of mood? Their menu includes hot pot, sandwiches, and grilled meats. No problem. Friendly, fast, and patient service. Phi was awesome and we even parted ways with a handshake and a hug! Tangent: Need the season's newest Essie & OPI nail polish. Lynamy's is a 30 second walk away. No problem.
