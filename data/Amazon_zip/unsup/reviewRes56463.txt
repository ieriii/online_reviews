I used to love coming to Frontera but the food has gone down hill in the last year. A group of four went on a Friday night. We waited about 45m and were seated. The drinks were great and the apps were good not great. Something was missing, not sure what. The main courses were terrible. I ordered the flank steak, med rare, it came out fully cooked. I tried it and it was like what shoe leather must taste like. I sent it back. The braised brisket was hard like it wasn't braised long enough. He sent it back. When the dishes came back, all they did was heat it up. They didn't cook a new steak and the brisket was just microwaived. I sent mine back for good. My friend was so hungry he just ate the brisket. Also, the chicken enchiladas my gf had the tortillas weren't cooked properly because they were hard. She just ate the chicken inside and the refried beans were cold. The other person had a great carne asada cooked properly to temp. The manager came over and offered us free desert. We declined and went to Custom House for dessert. What the hell is going on in the kitchen? How could they send out such offensive food? I know its a busy Friday but really, you send out food like that? A waste of time and money.
