LOVE THE CHEESE BALLS!!! During our visit to Chicago, it was my best friend's birthday, I did some research on Yelp and decided to come here. OMG!! The food was incredible here! When you first arrive the waiter explains how the system works. You have this round card - one side is red and the other green. If you want meat, then make sure the card is on the green side and if you want to take a break, make sure the card is on the red side. The items in the salad bar was very fresh! The beef steak tomatoes were huge and tasty. The asparagus were delish! The starches that they bring to your table: 1. Garlic mash potato 2. Fried polenta - delish!! 3. Fried banana's -oh booooyyy!! 4. CHEESE BALLS!! We nicked named these Cheese balls but they're actually small bread balls with cheese in the middle. They lightly crispy on the outside and soft and buttery/cheesy on the inside. The cheese didn't goop out when you bit into it, but you can smell it and taste it. The service was superb. Our wine, water, cheese ball basket, fried polenta and other stuff was NEVER empty. We never had to ask for refills. They would notice that there was only one item in the dish and automatically replaced it. We had to tell the guys to stop bringing the items.  The meats - filet mignon, chicken, linguica, ribs, lamb - were all delish! BUT..... when the bacon wrapped prime rib and filet came!! OMG!! What doesn't taste good that's wrapped in bacon! We had the papaya ice cream and tres leches cake. Very yummy!! PLUS... the guys in the gauchos were cute too!
