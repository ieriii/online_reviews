Checked into the room for the Cubs-Cardinals series in early August. Found the rate online and my critieria was cheap so I guess I can't complain. Location was great. Steps from Michigan Ave and Rush St. On the down side, as we were checking in, a woman at the front desk was asking how to make the tv work, because she could only get a couple channels. "Oh...sorry...our cable is out until next week." Yeah...right! That should have been the first sign that this long-in-the-tooth motel was going to be no-frills. So, not only is the tv limited to local only snow-casts, but having imbibed on great Chicago chow, I soon discovered that the toilet takes about 10 minutes and 5 or 6 flushes to disappear the package. Yucko! Still, with its proximity to just about everything, it was quite a bargain for 3 nights ($159 per). Just would have appreciated a little love on the bill after the cable outage. Ditka's adjoining restaurant made it barable.
