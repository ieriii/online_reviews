I LOVE THIS PLACE!!! AND THE OWNER IS WONDERFUL!I crave this place on a weekly basis. Everything is so fresh and tastes soooo goood! No comparsion to Pizza Doc at all !! Have been to both and without a doubt Spacca Napoli is the best! Every time I have been there the staff is wonderful and the owner has a good habit of giving you a free taste of a specialty beverage! I highly recommend this place!!
