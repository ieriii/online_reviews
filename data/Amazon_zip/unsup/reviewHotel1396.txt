The Millenium Knickerbocker seems to be about a millenium behind the times. Which can be good and bad. Behind the times: size of meeting rooms, decor, internet availability ( they charge for lobby wi-fi internet access). However, sometimes a history in Chicago is a plus and a selling point. The Knickerbocker does have some character, thought the meeting rooms tend to be small and window-less. If I were to plan a big meeting in the city, I would not choose the Knickerbocker. However, if I were to plan a wedding, I may consider the Knickerbocker for its character and charm. The rooms tend to be small with low ceilings, whick makes for a intimate feel...so much better for social gatherings than business gatherings.
