Went with my Husband and 2 friends for dinner a couple Friday's back. Great place for a double date. Be prepared to wait. . . but worth it. The boys sipped on a whiskey flight, and the girls were able to enjoy trying some of the specialty cocktails. Really enjoyed the food. One member of our party had the burger. He claims that it was one of the top 5 burgers he has had in Chicago.
