A friend and I stayed here on a recent vacation to Chicago. As it was our first time in the city, we were most concerned with finding a hotel centrally located to many of the Chicago tourist attractions, as we were not renting a car. Not only is the Doubletree in a great location, but the staff was extremely friendly and helpful, and the rooms were nearly everything we could have hoped for. The only thing missing in the room was a fridge (what is one to do with all that left over deep dish pizza?!?!).  The hotel is a 5 minute walk to Michigan Ave (shopping, restaurants, etc) and a 10 minute walk to the train station. Also within walking distance (bring your walking shoes) are the Chicago River, Millennium Park, Grant Park, The Art Institute & Willis Tower. Although check in is at 3pm, we were allowed to check in at 1:45pm and were given some delicious chocolate chip cookies!  The room was cleaned nicely every day and when I requested a firmer pillow, the maid service brought not 1, but 2 pillows. The concierge staff was helpful when it came time for dining and public transit recommendations. If I ever happen to visit Chicago in the future, I will definitely consider staying at the Doubletree Magnificent Mile.
