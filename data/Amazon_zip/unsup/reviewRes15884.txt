I thought this place was so freakin' cool looking inside, kinda like something out of Alice in Wonderland or something, mixed with an old-school, old-money hotel. The ambience is worth the price of the drinks alone, and the quality of the booze/skill needed in making the cocktails is an added bonus. A place to come and try spirits you have never had before, and are not easily found at other bars in the city. VERY quiet inside, at least when we went. We sat in the booths by the bar, which are high-backed and block conversation from other tables. So if you like to chit-chat, or are looking for a hot date place, go here. That being said, it is a place for the "hipster doofi" as my neighbor Gene K. calls them. Which very possibly could make me a hipster doofi in denial. Oh well.
