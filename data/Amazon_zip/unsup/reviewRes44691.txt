Pizza has to be one of my favorite foods. So it's takes a lot to disappoint me in this category. After giving Giordano's a few tries they have done the impossible by disappointing me. For all the hype this place gets, the pizza did not meet expectations. The tomato sauce on the deep dish pizza was overwhelming and didn't taste fresh. I had to drink a lot of water after my first slice because the bread was so thick and dry. When you bite into it feels like you are just biting through layers. The tomato sauce, cheese, and bread doesn't feel integrated. Their thin crust however was solid. But its hard to mess up a thin crust pie. The wait staff are very nice. Overall the pizzeria is average. I don't sit at home and drool thinking about this place. I would only come back if friends invited me. The only reason I didn't give them a 2 star is because I love pizza.
