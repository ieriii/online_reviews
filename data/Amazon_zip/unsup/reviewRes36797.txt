Excellent food overall, decent service, great location but too bad it has short hours. I went during the Greek Festival so it was EXTREMELY crowded but the quality of the meal was good. The only thing was that my omelette was kind of hard on the outside. Still 5 stars because I think that it would've been better under less crazy conditions.
