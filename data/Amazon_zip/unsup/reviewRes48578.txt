This place is the pork love of my life. I've been to The Publican twice now and it just seems to be getting better. I've sat in an enclosed booth and at a freestanding table for two and found both just fine. The service both times was impeccable. It was my boyfriend's birthday the second time we went and were greeted with a "Happy birthday" and a candle on our waffle at the end of the meal. I love the design of their menu, and everything I've ordered has not only met, but far exceeded my expectations. I've eaten in a lot of great restaurants all over the world and the food at the Publican stands up to the best. They have, hands down, the best pork I've ever had anywhere. My boyfriend, who has worked in the industry for years and really knows his beer, was really impressed with their beer selection, and I found a delicious French cider I fell in love with. Dishes of note: the potted rillettes (divine) the ham chop in hay (really big, made for sharing, and fantastic) and the lamb sausage (incredible flavor). For those who complain about the noise level, yes, it's loud in there. But you need to consider the concept of the restaurant- it's not supposed to be a quiet, intimate place. The communal seating punctuates that idea well. It's a place to kick back, have some delicious beer and even better food and maybe meet a few new people. If you're looking for romantic and intimate you may want to choose somewhere else, but I think the Publican has perfectly achieved what they wanted to do. They really know what they're doing over there, and I can't wait to go back again.
