Ok let me start with the food i would love to give 5 star on their food because they're delicious, The reason i'm giving 3 star is because their servers are SUCKS n RUDE.Servers are throw their food or side dishes in to your face that is not acceptable. And they'll talk to u in Korean which i don't understand.Also if u are not Korean or American they'll give you only 7 dishes of side dish which is sucks. I've been there more then 10 times but i never able to get a side dishes what Koreans or Americans get. Which is not COOL AT ALL. Last 2 time i've been there i complained about to get more side dishes and they gave me which i'm satisfied but they're just suppose to give it to you before they bring your ordered food.MY ONLY WISH IS GET A BEtter SErVER please if u really really wanna improve your business. KOREAN AJUMMA SERvErs are RUde but not all of them.
