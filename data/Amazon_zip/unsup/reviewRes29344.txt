SHELL SHOCK. When I had a bite of my friend's burger, I thought I was eating beef and freaked out. It turned out that the patty was made of satin, a wheat protein. After I calmed down, I proceeded eating the sweet potato fries, and liked the spice on it. However, I was slightly disappointed of the gyoza (dumplings), which was overcooked, and the black bean soup, which would qualify as a stew rather than soup. Although I applauded Chicago Diner's effort of making vegetarian food friendly to non-vegetarians, I thought the food lost the point of being a vegetarian - eating healthy. The fact that most food here are deep fried makes it healthier to eat steak than satin. I may bring my non-vegetarian friends here to change their perception that vegetarian food is plain and boring. However, I doubt I will come back here with vegetarian friends due to health concern. P.S. I would have given 2 stars for my food, but I am giving an extra star for Chicago Diner's creativity.
