Started out in the bar, its pretty loud but very lively and a good atmosphere. The piano player and singer are very good at what they do. The food is amazing! From the appetizers to the steaks all the way down to the sides, it goes head to head with the best of them. But i must say..... be prepared to spend alottttttaaaaa money. The service was on point, not one complaint at all.
