I was at this bar for Game 6 of the Boston/Chicago NBA playoffs. This place was pretty packed and the atmosphere was pretty good. Everyone was into the game and the whole bar was rooting for Chicago. I was just visiting from out of town, but I figured, what the hell, might as well root for the home team. Anyways, we sat at the bar and the bartender was very helpful and friendly. The bar offered full access to their dinner menu, which was cool. They also had some drink specials. I remember they had a $3 bartender special shot, which was pretty good. The food came out pretty quickly and was tasty. I ordered the Wilde Burger, pretty good and juicy. I would recommend that if you are hungry. My friend ordered the Chicken Curry, which was not like an Indian type curry. It was good, just not a lot chicken in the meal. But the drinks were pretty cheap compared to LA bars. What I really liked about the place was the atmosphere and the fact they had like 5+ flat screen TVs to watch the game. I would recommend to go if you are looking to kick it and watch the game and not have to worry about getting rushed out.
