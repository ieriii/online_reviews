We asked them to dance but they didn't.....but they brought out a huge slice of cake on my birthday :) So I went with a group this time and had some meat eatters and they were not so sure when their wings came out ...but after they ate their burgers they were impressed with how full they felt after their meal. ( how much fiber did I just eat one said) A must go to restaurant!! Sweet potato fries are calling your name
