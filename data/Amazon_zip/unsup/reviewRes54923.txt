I was extremely happy when I first heard about Longman and Eagle. A place that would be serving delicious foods til 1am that's only 3 blocks from my house and specializing in whiskey? Have a door connecting to G-Mart comics and I would never leave. But unfortunately, I've been soured.The food is great. GREAT. I've had the rabbit pate, burger, sweetbreads, and marrow bones and I've never left disappointed with the food. I literally savor every bite. My hats off to the chefs. HOWEVER, all my experiences there have been ruined by the bar staff. I have sat at the bar every time I've gone and every time, I've had awful experiences at the bar. Granted I know its a busy place and pretty new, but when I enter an order for a drink, it should get there before my food. When I'm spending my money on food and drinks, I don't how many of the bartender's friends are there, but I do suppose its hard to see your customers with your head so far up Tim Kinsella's ass. If I'm sitting at the bar, it shouldnt take 17 minutes just to pick up my credit card so I can go home, next time I'll leave more than a $2 tip. I wish I could just get my food to go. Or maybe I won't sit at the bar anymore.
