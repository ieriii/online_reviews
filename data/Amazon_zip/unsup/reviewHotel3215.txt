My husband and I stayed at the Hard Rock for 4 nights last summer. I got us a great deal that I was very happy with. Complimentary WiFi was included with our stay. We stayed on floor with the AC/DC memorabilia. The room and the bathroom were spacious and very well kept. The housekeeping service was impeccable. In fact all the staff was very courteous and professional. The location can't be beat - the hotel is right in the middle of everything. It's very close to Millennium Park and the Wendella Boat Rides are right next to it. The shops at North Bridge are only 5 blocks away. You can easily walk to Navy Pier as well. It shouldn't take you more than 15-20 minutes. John Hancock Center is quite close too - about a mile away. There are a lot of places where you can eat around. Cabs and public transportation are both easily accessible if you decide to visit Shedd Aquarium or the Museum of Science & History. I would recommend staying at this hotel.
