I suppose I should preface this by telling you that I have zero clue what Costa Rican food is supposed to taste like. Also that Irazu gets extra points for being BYOB. Especially with no corkage! I ate Casado with chicken, which I was told was one of the more authentic things on the menu (assuming you get it regular and not spicy where they add jalapenos which is decidedly un-authentic).  The chicken itself was good. A little dry but very well flavored.  I got it with the gallo pinto (which I guess is traditionally served for breakfast but came with dinner). Anyway - rice + beans + fried egg. Would have been MUCH better if the egg hadn't been fried but rather over easy. Still tasty though. I look forward to eating my leftovers with an over easy egg.  Not a fan of the cabbage salad but I don't love cabbage and I hate beets. No fault of Irazu if that's authentic! Plantains were hit or miss by person. Some were good some were really dry. Overall it was a good experience but I won't be rushing back anytime soon. And if I do come back, it will for sure be in the summer when the patio is open!!
