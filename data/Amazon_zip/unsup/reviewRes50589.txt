Went there for the first time today for lunch. I really liked the place. Great atmosphere. You feel like you're in somebody's home and you definitely don't feel like you're in Chicago. Had the eggs Benedict. It was pretty good but I wouldn't say great. Loved the hash browns and the beignets. They made a pretty good bloody mary too. I definitely want to try this place for dinner and will go back. Wait staff was a bit slow but very friendly.
