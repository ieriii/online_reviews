I have always passed by this place but never had a chance to come in. Finally on Sunday I made a reservation and went with my husband. OMG!! The colors and vibrant vibe made me feel like I was part of the party. The staff was very nice. Noah our waiter was very nice to the both of us. Recommended the cherry margarita, which I tried. Very tasty. We had the mix ceviche. It had the right amount of lime juice and avocado slices. They give u one large piece of bread toast to eat with. Wish they would have given us another tho. We then shared the arrachera and a side dish that what seemed to be baked mastocholi with bacon bits. The rice was not that good tho, it tasted a little undercooked. But the meat was delicious and the sweet onions were awesome. My husband said it was the best arrachera he has ever had.What a better way to end the night than with one of their blueberry tress leches. And a cup of cappuccino. My husband had a flan that I didn't like so much but he enjoyed it very much. In all it was a very nice evening. I would be going back some time again.
