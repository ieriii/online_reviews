I really enjoyed the food here. I didn't go during restaurant week -- I actually went here about a year ago. I've been lazy in writing reviews; life calls. You'll definitely need to come here looking to eat a lot, and don't underestimate the filling nature of the small plates. It's not cheap, but tapas-style dining rarely is, unless you're eating junk.
