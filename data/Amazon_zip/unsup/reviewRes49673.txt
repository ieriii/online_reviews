The food at this place is horrible. True, to the non-hispanic palatte it is great, but I'm sorry you don't serve a NY steak and call it a Churrasco. The place may be nice for group gatherings and birthdays (I counted over seven songs last night) but the only thing Hispanic about the food is probably the Yuca Frita and the Fried Plantains. I will not return to this restaurant for anythign in the world.
