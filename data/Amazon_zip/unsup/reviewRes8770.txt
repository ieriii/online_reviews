Absolutely the best authentic Italian wood fired oven pizza I have had outside of Italy. The toppings were delicious, it was very well priced for what you get, and the service was amazing. They do not take reservations, and my friend was late in meeting us, so the staff gave us bread and cheese while we waited to be seated, which made us love this place even more. The crust is perfect - exactly the right combination of chewy/crispy and the topping are fresh and basic. My only knock was the appetizer-we got the antipasti sampler plate and it was 90% meat with some olives, which is not bad, but not what we were thinking it would be. However, the pizza is worth a trek from any part of the city whether you have to drive, bike, hitchhike, whatever- it is that good.
