The service, wine, food was all superb! Just delicious! The crab cakes are perfect, scallops are flavorful and don't you dare go without getting butter cake for dessert. It is amazing. The only recommendation I have would be to order your steak a little under cooked. I ordered mine medium rare, but it was slightly overdone, due in part to the delivery on the hot, buttery plate. It was still delicious, just not *perfect*. Another's steak was a touch undercooked, so a little inconsistent! We had a wonderful experience. I also appreciated the call they made to follow up on the dinner. Very nice touch.
