Just had dinner at G. Elliot and it was a disappointment. My food was okay, but my husband ordered salmon and it was RAW when served. He sent it back...still too raw...sent it back again and it was just still raw. The waiter said that the salmon was the highest quality, implying that my husband should have liked it. The waiter was rude and made no attempt to satisfy by husband's concerns. He wanted the salmon just pink in the middle and they were serving it raw. He left the uncooked salmon on the plate and left the restaurant hungry.   We will not go back. Very pretentious. No tablecloths on the table. Very noisy. and too expensive.
