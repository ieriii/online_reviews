I took my father and brother to Davanti who were in from New York for Father's Day. Hearing the reviews and everyone telling me how long they'd had to wait, I planned to wait at least an hour. I walked in around 7.30pm...NO WAIT! Sweet! The ambience and feel of the place is relaxing. Heavy on the warm lighting and dark woods. Dig it. The waiter, I forget his name, unfortunately, was really helpful in explaining dishes and talking about the wine list. I don't eat dairy or meat, but I do eat fish...and everything else. So our waiter was especially helpful with me and the dishes I had were all fantastic. The bruschette, shaved hearts of palm salad, and the mushroom pizza were all delicious. There was a white bean and tuna board that was tasty as well, but may have been a special for that night. Authentic Italian small/medium shared plates, with a hint of Americana in there. Go here, you'll enjoy yourself.
