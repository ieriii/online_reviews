I spent 2 luxurious nights here and I feel a bit odd giving a place like it less than 5 stars. But I have no choice when comparing my experience relative to my high expectations. To begin with, this particular Ritz can't seem to decide whether it's Pottery Barn or Roarin' 20s. Every time I walked from the 1920s bedroom area to the ultramodern bathroom it was like being sucked through a magical time warp. And yet, it took me literally 10 very annoying minutes to figure out how the "ultramodern" bathroom's shower worked because the valve's settings were all screwed up. And as for the 1920s aspect of the decor... it's just not my thing. I wouldn't downgrade the hotel by one star just because of that, but I'm just not a fan of the World War I era feel when I have the privilege of spending a few nights in the heart of downtown Chicago (which has quickly become one of my favorite cities in America, by the way). No other complaints whatsoever. The rooms are spacious. The views from my windows were awesome as they included both downtown and part of the lake. The service is top notch. The hotel is so fully-staffed that you can't walk 10 feet without finding someone to help you, which is nice because the hotel is so massive. I ate a few meals over 2 days inside the hotel and they were good (not excellent, but good). The location is of course perfect, if you want to be in the heart of downtown. The closest train stop, which I was adventurous enough to use to arrive from O'Hare, is barely 3 blocks away.
