Can't decide if this place is better than Tango Sur. I guess you can't really compare the two because one is Argentinian and the other Colombian. It would be like comparing a Chinese Restaurant with a Korean one. My bad, I apologize for that moment of ignorance.. Whoever created the aborrajado is a genius. Melted cheese drenched on top of a fried plantain, this my fellow food loving friends is proof that God does exist. Don't freak out when you notice that most of the dishes are over 20 bucks. It's a steakhouse. If you were expecting to eat steak for under 20 then....... .... .... ... But don't worry, if you get a combination plate it's well worth it. Sides included are plantains (again!), potatoes and assorted vegetables. I can't decide if this would be a great date place. We went on a weeknight and it was pretty loud. The ambiance is festive and the wait staff funny and friendly.
