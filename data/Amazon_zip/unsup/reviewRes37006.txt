I really love a place that has interesting beers. And since I love Belgian beers, Hopleaf is a great place for me to try some new stuff. I went with a friend of mine, and while I was standing awkwardly and waiting for her, the bouncer asked me if I would like to sit in a little corner space. It was so nice of him to carve out a little space for me in the crowded front lobby so I could be comfortable while I waited! Beer was great, though that's pretty hard to mess up, huh? I wish I had gotten the mussels like my friend. I got the brisket instead. I guess when I think brisket I think Texas BBQ brisket. This was good, but very fatty. I had to cut off the fatty parts. The Stilton mac and cheese, on the other hand, wow that was good. The waitress assured us that the asparagus with lemon butter would be in the top 5 of our life asparagus experiences, and I'm pretty sure she was right. Big fat pieces of asparagus, roasted to perfection. Fries were also perfect! For dessert we split the apple fritters. Again, they weren't what I was expecting, but this time it was in a good way. How can they fry the apples and yet keep them so crunchy? Delicious! Our waitress added on the fries, and when we asked for a correction, she happily made the changes. Service was slow, but it was busy. I want to come back and try some more Belgian beers!
