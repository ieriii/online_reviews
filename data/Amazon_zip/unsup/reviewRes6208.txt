Went here for a second time last night, and once again had a great experience. We are kind of early birds, so both times there was just a very short wait...last night we sat at the bar, which I like (kind of like sitting at the counter at a diner, which I love). Anyway, who knew that something as simple as bread and cheese could be so gosh darn good....Burrata, Sea Salt & Evoo, the cheese served in a mason jar, was a great way to start. That was followed by the squash and farro salad, which I had to order again after my last visit...sooo good. My main reason for wanting to go again was for the arugula and prosciutto pizza, which I enjoyed so much last time....but we decided to get the mascarpose polenta w/veal and prosciutto meatballs; another home run. After that, we just didn't have enough room for the pizza, and wanted to get dessert. The problem is, there are just too many good things on the menu at this place. For dessert, BF ordered the Torta Bacio, and I got the carrot cake parfait thingy (served in a mason jar). Uhhh, this is possibly one of the best desserts I have ever eaten...definitely the best carrot cake I've ever had. I don't even think I asked the BF how he liked his, I was so involved in the deliciousness of my own thing....I think he said it was really good though. The service is so friendly, helpful and efficient...they work as a team and there are lots of people serving you, but however they work it out, the timing was perfect on everything. The employees all seem very happy to be there...BF even commented on how the dishwasher made an appearance at one point, and even HE seemed damn glad to be there. This Scott Harris fellow seems to have this restauranteuring thing down (see previous review of Salatino's)....looking forward to ordering a pie from Doughboys very soon.
