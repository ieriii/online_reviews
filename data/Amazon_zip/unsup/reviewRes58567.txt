Decided to take my buddy there for his 32nd Birthday along with my Girlfriend and Daughter... We made reservations for 7:30PM and arrived at the parking lot adjacent to the restaurant which was nice as they validate and it only cost $12 which is far better then the $32 it would have cost had they not. Upon entering we were promptly greeted by the host and seated within minutes. After sitting the waiter Antonio showed up shortly after and we were on our way. Pulled out my Daughter and Girlfriends chair which they blushed at and then we were off to the salad bar. I found the salad bar better then the one in Schaumburg but the Girlfriend says it is not... The Waiter was fantastic and attentive and my Daughter was over whelmed with joy and had the time of her life everytime she flipped over her little Meat Indicator and then staff rushed her asking her if she wanted to try whatever meat they were serving at the time... It almost became a game to her... At the end of the meal the waiter served us dessert and brought the bill being on ball the entire time... He even took my ticket up to be validated... My only complaint was my Daughters $3.50 sprite with no refill but that is how this place is so you deal with it...
