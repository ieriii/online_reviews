I stayed at this place while on a trip to Chicago solely to see major tourist attractions like the Willis (Sears) tower, Shedd Aquarium, Adler Planetarium, Museum, etc. The hotel is walking distance from these places and that way you save time, energy and money. This is a bit further away from O'Hare airport and in early morning rush hour traffic it took us about 2 hours by car. It is connected via train but we did not try that option. The hotel is a bit dated but overall clean and efficient. The rate was very cheap compared to the other top tier hotels in the neighborhood. It is a 2-min walk away from the Roosevelt train station. The front desk clerk Hollie was super nice and let me check in a few hours ahead of check-in time which was super nice of her. Thanks Hollie! She also gave us useful travel tips. The restaurant "Mei's kitchen" right in the hotel building was really good as well - we had a sumptous breakfast there for $10/person. Overall, I am very impressed with this hotel given its proximity to tourist attractions, the lower prices, connectivity via trains, and friendly staff. I highly recommend it.
