Great atmosphere, fun, endearing, great service. I did think the cheese fondue could have been more flavorful. The chocolate fondue was good. I enjoyed the cooking, lingering over conversation. Did not enjoy feeling like they wanted us to leave when we were done with the meal since enjoying the ambiance seems to be the point of the place, as it is certainly not the food. The outrageous price they charge for a small portion of meat and vegetables is crazy, so at least let me sit at the table and enjoy the company I bring.
