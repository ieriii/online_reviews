I took my mom and sister here after a day of exploring Chinatown. I ordered the spring rolls and potstickers for all of us, my mom ordered shrimp fried rice, and my sis and I had Tony's Three Chili Chicken. My sis and I thought the chicken dish was awesome; the perfect balance between spicy, sweet, and salty. My mom liked her fried rice, which I thought was a little greasy though. The appetizers were good and I enjoyed the fact that fresh tea (oolong, perhaps) was served. Service was attentive and friendly!
