It took a little over an hour for the pizza to arrive (the place is less than 1 mile from my house). I ordered an x-large pizza with banana peppers, feta cheese and sundried tomatoes. There was about a pound of sundried tomatoes on my pizza, many pieces that needed to be removed before i took my second bite. Overall the pizza was decent quality.
