Just wanted to give a shout out to one of the new waiters, Nic, who made the high price more bearable. Admittedly, our bar bill was double the food tab; we had two Absinthe & two Death's Door martinis. Excellent cocktails, worth every cent. As for the food: Mac n Cheese and Sweet Potato fries, definite B. The decor is elegant and warm. Maybe when I get a job ($$$) I'll go there to celebrate.
