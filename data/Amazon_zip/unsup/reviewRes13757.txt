My BF and I went here for a late lunch on Saturday. For 2pm in the afternoon there was still quite a pretty sizable crowd there but the line moved quickly and after we placed our order we were able to find a seat outside pretty easily. I ordered the pork sandwich and my BF ordered the beef sandwich and we decided to share a chorizo empanada. Our sandwiches came with a drink for an extra dollar - def worth it! I had a con leche coffee - it was so yummy and a very nice surprise since I had just expected black coffee. I really liked my sandwich - the pork was very moist and tender and the plaintains were also a nice touch. I could have used a little more flavor in the sandwich but I put some of the homemade hot sauce that came with our empanda and it did the trick. The bread was nicely toasted. I also really like our chorizo empanada - it was heavily deep fried and came out nice and hot and it was cheesy and chorizo packed. Very affordable sandwich place and since its close to our apartment, I will be back for more!
