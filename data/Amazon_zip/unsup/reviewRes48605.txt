These people know pork and beer. What the hell else do you want?!? The lady brought me here for my birthday this year after I had been not-so-subtlety hinting that I wanted to try it. The atmosphere is like an upscale farmhouse, complete with giant pig paintings on the walls. Before I got there I didn't look at the menu because I didn't want to get my heart set on any one thing before hearing the specials. I forget our waiter's name, but he was a baller! Not only did he know the portion sizes and flavors of everything on the menu, but he recommended specific beers for me based on my beer experience level, pallet and what we chose to eat. His selections were perfect. We ended up choosing some sort of sashimi for an appetizer, pork belly, broccoli, and something else (I forget, sorry!). One thing to note on the broccoli, and other sides, is that they're probably more than what they seem. IE - the broccoli came with a poached egg and an anchovie. Read the menu carefully. As for my beers, I had 2 belgians trapist beers that were both over 10% ABV but were still great. The lady had 2 crafts from the states. Takeaways: - A little small on the portion sizes for a "Pork & Beer" place - The food tasts amazing anyway - Let your server pick your beer. They're all certified: http://chicago.metromix.
