Great ambience - trendy and nice without making me feel awkward for wearing sneakers. Every bite of food I had was delectable: the chocolate croquettes with banana marshmallows was incredible, the sangria was strong and not too sweet, and the black lentils with garbanzo beans and feta cheese is as filling as a meal. Bacon-wrapped lamb? Yes, please. Also, if you can, try to get seated in Carlos's section. He was a great waiter. Friendly, attentive without being smothering, and he made me laugh so hard at one point that I was doubled over covering my face.
