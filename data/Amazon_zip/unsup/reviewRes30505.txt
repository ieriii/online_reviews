Have been going to Frontera for years and I know about the wait;, but I love going there for Saturday brunch. I recently met some friends there for dinner; they had never been. Can not tell you how disappointed I was -the service was slow and the food only so-so. The Chile Rellenos were very bland and my lamb dish (the evening special) was so salty, it was almost inedible. I need to go back there for brunch. It will be with some trepidation but I am hopeful that my last experience was just a blip and they got their mojo back.
