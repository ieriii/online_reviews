The sauteed plantains and gallo pinto (rice and bean mixture) that came with the entree were fan-freakin-tastic. The entree itself, was kind of bland, chicken with tomatoes and carmelized onions. Not much other flavor. The fried plaintain appetizer, was good, not great.  That being said, we both had enough leftovers for a large lunch the next day. So the price is right, and it's BYOB. Next time I want to try a shake and the Pepito sandwich (which Time Out has raved about on several occasions).
