Very delicious brunch here this morning. I had the red eye benedict, and it was good. There was a slight problem with the english muffin not being robust enough to stand up to the sauce (red pepper, instead of hollandaise, yum!) and yolk. But that's a minor quibble. I know it's a minor quibble, because I finished every single bite of my food.  I'm not sure it's the best brunch I've ever had, but it's damn good, and I'd go back in a heartbeat.
