If these walls could talk, I would shut-up and listen. On the same block, I caught an Indian-Latin-Caribbean funk band (http://www.funkadesi.com) at Kinetic Playground, ate an obscenely delicious Mexican meal, and ended the night at Al Capone's favorite watering hole; replete with original fixtures from the 1920s, sexy-as-hell art-deco/nouveau decor, the promise of secret tunnels, and an amazing multi-culti jazz ensemble takin it WAY back. Never been to a place where words like "prohibition" and "speakeasy" slip so readily from the tongue. Also, for all you single ladies, the male/female ratio in there has gotta be 10:1; you'll be tripping over dudes trying to hook you up w/ free drinks and smokes. Felt like I was in a japanese hostess bar run by the mob.
