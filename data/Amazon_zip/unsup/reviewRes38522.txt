my first thought after a delicious meal at the Hopleaf Bar was "I am going to yelp the shit out of this place!". and better late than never, i am living up to my words. i was visiting my friend in early september and she decided to take me to "this awesome swedish/gay/artsy area" near her place. Being swedish, artsy, and quite gay friendly i was all about it. We walked into the bar and were told it'd be a bit of a wait. totally cool. we strolled upstairs and ordered rounds of cider (anyplace with cider is a place i want to be) anyway, about 5 min later we were seated, and i kept getting this nistoligic london gastro pub feel which I LOVED. I ordered muscles and fries. ok so like, i've never really done the muscle thing so i have nothing to compare them too but i will tell you this much, they were phenomenal. the buttery wine sauce dipped in crusty bread...ahhh salivating. and yummy fries to boot!? this place is allllright. my friend ordered the curried version which were also supremely tasty, however i preferred mine. loved this place and that will most defiantly be my first stop off the plane my next visit out, and in writing this review and drudging up all these savory memories it may get me out there sooner rather than later.
