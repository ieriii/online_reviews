Ah, the luxury. The only thing they don't have is decent accustic managing. It gets loud with all the hard surfaces and high ceilings. I loved the food though, and the drinks were tasty. I hated the TV in the bar. I mean really the atmosphere there was ruined with the glowing screan and faces of football. This actually might become a recuring thing I will be yelping about. I hate TVs in places I go to, especially if they are littered with sports. Unless I am at a sports bar then fine. I don't go to those places though, because I hate sports so there. I just wish establishment owners had the common courtesy to not have a glowing screen in front of me. ugh. that went nowhere. So Mercat is good and tasty, nice staff, great decor, I wouldn't complain if a guy took me to dinner there! Also there is this cute private kinda table that overlooks the restaurant and I want to sit there sometime. I love when restaurants have those!
