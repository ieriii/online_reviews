Great art deco space and atmosphere? Check. Yummy frou-frou drinks? Check. Memorable, savory food? No check :( I've been to Carnivale 6-8 times, most recently being this week for Restaurant week. Every time, the place lures you in with its beautiful decorations, lively atmosphere, and juicy drink menu. But every time I leave, I don't feel like I had a worthy meal. Not to mention, my wallet got much lighter too! This place has a great concept and great potential, but it just never seems to live up to it. Don't get me wrong - there is some decent stuff on the menu. The ropa vieja is good. The guacamole is good and chunky, with nice chips. Mama Mendez's rice is great. I think the pork shoulder is decent too. The chocolate(?) flan dessert is excellent.  But that seems to be it. The ceviche is meh - you can do better. The steaks are ok but maybe a little bland. I just don't get that "wow what a great meal" feeling from this place. Maybe if they charged $10-15 for this food, I wouldn't mind as much, and I'd give it 3 stars. But the entrees are like $15-35. You need to bring it if you're gonna charge such prices. I will be even more harsh for the same reason - 2 stars for you! I'd have to say that you can do better elsewhere. If you want a great upscale pan-Latin place, go to Cuatro. Great Nuevo Mexican, go to Frontera Grill. Great seafood & ceviche, go to El Barco. A place that plays salsa AND has salsa dancing - Nacional 27 or Rhumba. I think I'm just gonna enjoy only having frou-frou happy hour drinks at Carnivale, without dinner. Oh yeah, the photography in the men's bathroom is pretty hot :)
