The beer is decent, but I haven't tried any that really blew me away. I do love the decor and the inventiveness of the menu, but with so many other awesome brewpubs popping up around the city, I might look elsewhere from now on. Revolution definitely attracts the hipster, hipper than thou crowd I'm learning to despise, so maybe that tainted my experiences. The bacon popcorn is okay, but mostly just tasted like bacon and soggy popcorn. The sweet potato cakes are good, not great, though they've been recommended to me by the staff as a favorite menu item. I'd stop by on a weeknight to avoid the crowds and have a beer or two, but the pricey food isn't high on my list to try again.
