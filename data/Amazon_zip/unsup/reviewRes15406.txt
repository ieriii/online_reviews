Great beer and great food. Place was relatively empty on a Tuesday at 6:30pm but they said that the first 2 weeks of June are slow. Service was great and the Thai Chicken Salad was incredible. Husband got a burger and couldn't put it down. Have been meaning to check the place out for a while now and so glad we did. It's not cheap however - 5 beers, a burger, an entree salad and a piece of carrot cake (which was very good but no cream cheese frosting - have to take a star away for that one! ha) was about $65 before tip. Will definitely return.
