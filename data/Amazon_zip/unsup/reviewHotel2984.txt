Overall, I think I'm less and less a fan of the W concept. This hotel has both good and bad. The rooms are very updated and comfortable, but- the soundproofing stinks. Had to swicth rooms and still was awakended by noise the next morning. The staff is very friendly, but- they are so friendly it takes them forever to check you in, so the folks behind you get to wait. The location next to the lake is great, especially if you have a lakeview, but- it's also far from everything else, with few amenities in immediate walking distance. Probably will hit up the Westin on my next stay. But if you're in the mood for the hipster scene, this might be your place to stay.
