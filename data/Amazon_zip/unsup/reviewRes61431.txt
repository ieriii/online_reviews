This is by far my favorite Mexican restaurant in Chicago. Food is always spot on, service is super friendly and fast, and atmosphere is all Mexican. Sometimes the owners are there, and they sit and chat with you for a bit. The carne asada is always superb. Definitely a must try for a mexican restaurant in Chicago. A definite recommendation.
