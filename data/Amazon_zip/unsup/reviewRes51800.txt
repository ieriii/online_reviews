The salsa was delicious! The fish tacos were great, the refried beans were great, the ground beef tacos were excellent too! The service was excellent, and the waitress was so nice and refilled our glasses constantly. The green salsa was fantastic! Probably the best I have ever had. BTW the Horchata was awesome too.
