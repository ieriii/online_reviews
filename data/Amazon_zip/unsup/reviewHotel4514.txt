I've stayed at this hotel in two occasions. The rooms are just ok, not bad. For some reason I never get a nice view here. The lobby is what is really gorgeous, I've seen people take their wedding pictures at the lobby. Very pretty. But since you're not sleeping in the lobby, I'm giving it 3 stars. What I don't like about the Palmer House is that so many people stay here that it gets really hectic, so it doesn't feel very cosy or relaxed for a hotel. The lower level of the hotel that leads to the streets, makes me feel like I'm at a mall, with the Starbucks and the crowd in the halls... Location it's awesome though, oh and the restaurant by the lobby is pretty good too. I stay here only when I find a great deal.
