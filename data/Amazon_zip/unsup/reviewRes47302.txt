This place is a joke! Went there with my husband for a late lunch on Sat at 2:30PM, the whole place had 15 people in it (yes, I counted), there were plenty of tables open and we decided to pick the table outside on the side street sidewalk. Pretty obnoxious young man came out of the bar and said that he needs to put us to the smaller table at Western Ave side, when we asked that if its possible to sit on the side street due to Western is a bit noisy and that bar is empty anyway, he said that this 2 big tables are for in case 2 huge groups of people will appear and decide to party over there, which is in his understanding chances at 2:30PM are incredibly high. Really? Well, we live not far and use to consider that place as our regular lunch place, not anymore. That was the most ridiculous experience you can have at the restaurant. He pretty much kicked us out that's how I would describe it and I would never be there again.
