I've never been to an Indian restaurant, but have had Indian food before. My business colleague said she walks by here all the time and wanted to try it, so we met right after work for an early dinner. The restaurant wasn't very crowded, maybe 3 other tables of diners and a few people at the bar. The waitstaff seated me because I was a little early. They are very courteous and attentive. Let me just say that I'm pretty adventurous and like to try new foods, but I wasn't feeling well and almost cancelled. I was a trooper and met her, but chose my entree very carefully. (I cheated and looked at the menu online prior to arriving and picked #237 - chicken dum biryani.) My colleague ordered the chicken curry, but forgot to order the rice, so she had it with Naan instead. The Naan was good, but I didn't want to fill up on bread and I couldn't try the tikka masala due to allergies with tomatoes. My entree arrived on a plate with a spoon to serve yourself, along with some yogurt sauce on the side. I wasn't sure what to do with the sauce, but after taking my first bite or two I realized it helped with the "kick". We didn't order dessert because we both had engagements right after dinner. All in all, the food was pretty tasty. My colleague would like to return and try the lunch buffet. She asked if I would go back and I said yes when I had a better appetite.  I've read the reviews on here to try the mango ice cream, so I'd like to return and try that as well. Thank you for the reviews posted, they were definitely helpful.
