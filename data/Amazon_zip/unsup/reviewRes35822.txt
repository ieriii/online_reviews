The food is good, but nothing great ... the atmosphere is lively and fun, especially at the oyster bar on Friday/Saturday nights. Pretty much everything on the menu is good, but I'd be hard pressed to point something out that was spectacular. It's a good place to go with a large group because there is definitely something for everybody, whether it be meat or fish. Fun place and I'd have no problems going back.
