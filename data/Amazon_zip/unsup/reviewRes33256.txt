426 Reviews.... Ay Akbar! So I guess we all already know that Sultan's: - Is insanely affordable. Don't be skeptical, it's not dog food, I swear. - Rocks the Casbah when it comes to falafel - you can get those balls of deep fried love mild, med or spicy. Mmmm blazin' chickpea glory.. go for the spicy, let the hummus cool your tongue and the jerusalem salad tame your lips. It's a thing of beauty. - Has a gnarly line that moves surprisingly fast! - Shines crazy tasty madness on the zatter fattia; a warm dough rolled out then rubbed generously with zatter spice, golden baked, and topped with hummus, feta, tomatoes, lettuce, and onion. It's a treat to be savored. Slowly. And possibly with a side of that tempting, terrific lentil soup. Now I have a chubby. - Has a righteous salad bar... or so they say... My only Sultan's complaint... THERE ARE NO FLIPPIN' LABELS ON THE SALAD BAR!! Yes, it's fully stocked and has tons of neat selections, but what's so rockin' about playing taste and guess with my generous, fruitful salad to-go tray? Are those mushrooms or meat pies? Is that chicken or fish? Is that, uh, marinara sauce? Of course not, then what the hell *is* it? Ooooh that tahini dressing looks good!! Wait... I just doused my dolmeh in ginger sauce? Fuck. This is getting confusing.... way.too.confusing. Sultan's, a salad bar isn't rocket science nor should it be a blindfold taste test. Leave that (and the mystery meat) to Old Cuntry [sic] Buffet. Get some labels.
