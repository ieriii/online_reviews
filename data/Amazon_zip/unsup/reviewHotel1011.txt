I ended up at Amalfi because one of the bigger river hotels messed up my reservations. Lets just say it was classic bait and switch, not so renaissance I'd say. Great place, great free evening appetizers and drinks and the staff were extremely nice. The breakfast buffet on every floor was a great touch and very convenient for the working professional - this so-called professional was back home for a conference. This is probably a redundant review as seeing that everyone seems to write about the same thing but I can attest as well to all the great hype. Love the location, love the hotel.
