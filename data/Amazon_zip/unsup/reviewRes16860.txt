The fanciest fucking drink I've ever had. Thanks to the server's suggestion, I had the gin based cocktail called "The Riviera". The server was very knowledgeable with the drink list. I wasn't sure how much my drink costed because my friend picked up the tab, but from looking at the prices of other drinks, I'd say it was moderately priced. Well worth it.
