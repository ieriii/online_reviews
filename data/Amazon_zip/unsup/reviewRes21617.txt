The power of Maurie and Flaurie compels you!!!! ....Sorry, I had to get that out of my system. There's nothing better than a Superdawg with everything and a Blackkow (read: root beer float) to wash it all down on a hot summer day. I have to say, I'm a sucker for the drive-in; I feel bad when I have to get things to go, and deny the flip-switch of its services. Their burgers and Polish sausages are great also! The prices aren't the cheapest you can find, but I think it's well worth it. This place is highly recommended. And there's nothing better than a Chicago-style hot dog, especially here. For all you people who still like your ketchup, have no fear! They'll give it to you in packets, no public embarrassment to worry about. "Hiya, and thanks for stopping."
