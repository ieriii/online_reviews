This is my all time FAVORITE Chicago stuffed crust pizza. Every Chicagoan has their preference...usually between Lou's, Gino's, Giordano's, etc. For me, Art of Pizza wins hands down. The crust to sauce to cheese to topping ratio is always perfection. The crust is ever so slightly buttery and the piece doesn't fall apart as you cut into the pie. Just go try it! A couple things that make this place even greater...there is a parking lot! A rare find in Chicago but clutch for jumping in and grabbing food to go. Which brings me to another great advantage of this place...slices of stuffed crust hot and ready to go! No more waiting for 75 minutes for a whole pizza if its just you and you have a craving. Quick and just as delicious as the whole pie.  This has been my favorite for 3 years now and I imagine it will stay that way for years to come.
