I don't think I can accurately review this place yet, as we ordered some of the less inventive fare - two different salads, a burger. We did try a couple more fun things, like the sweetbreads, dehydrated bacon, and wild boar sloppy joe, but I still don't feel like I can attest to the menu as a whole. So thanks for reading this totally useless review. Just kidding. I had a very important revelation tonight... They say the name Longman and Eagle is a reference to the nearby Illinois Centennial Monument, a structure that has an Eagle perched atop which was sculpted by Evelyn Longman. I reject this all-too-convenient explanation. I postulate that Longman/Eagle is an homage to one of the greatest TV helicopter pilots of the Cold War era: Stringfellow Hawke. Furthermore, whoever named this establishment was a closet Airwolf fan. Think about it. What is long? String is long. What's another word for Man? Fellow. (You can probably figure out Eagle/Hawk part.) What sells food and whiskey better than anything? Experimental helicopters and Jan Michael Vincent. The man single handedly turned "Jan" into a perfectly acceptable first name for a boy. I have had this poster on my wall for many years http://tinyurl.com/yyvop and I live by its motto. I encourage you to do the same.
