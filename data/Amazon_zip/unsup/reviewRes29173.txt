Great food for a great price! I used to eat here a lot when I lived in Lincoln Park. I've tried at least 4 of their soups, and was never disappointed. If you get to go on a Monday, try their lasagna - it's amazing! Another special I used to enjoy was their orecchiette pasta (they used to have it on Thursdays). And there's not a bad pasta on their regular menu either. (I've never tried their panini). No joke - I've even seen a nearby restaurant's owner getting takeout at the Pasta Bowl
