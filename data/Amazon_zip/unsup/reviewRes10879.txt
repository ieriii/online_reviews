If you want good pizza that is not chicago style this is the place. You absolutely must order the red pizza with mushroom because it is the best mushroom pizza I have ever had. My girlfriend doesn't like parmesan, which comes on the red, but I think it gives the pizza another dimension.  Their brews are decent but the real star is the pizza. The only bad thing about Piece is that it is always packed and so you must wait for the delicious pizza.  Only bad experience was ordering the white pizza by delivery. First of the crust was like cardboard and the pizza was cold. Secondly, I don't know if this is true, but the pizza seemed smaller than the same size when dinning in the restaurant? But it is a definite recommendation over coal fire, especially because coal fire recently raised their prices and did away with BYOB.
