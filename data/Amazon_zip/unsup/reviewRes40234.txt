I've seen a few comments here about mediocre service... Not so! Last time we were here we brought our three kids (8, 4, &amp; 3). Our waitress chatted up the kids while we enjoyed our great food, and even invited us to bring a bag of marshmallows for the kids to roast next time we stop in. I call that great and friendly service!
