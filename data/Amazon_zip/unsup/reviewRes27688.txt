My desert island pizza, if that's even a thing. I definitely miss the smoke-filled, non-biance from the pre-fire, pre-re-remodel days, but the pizza's still delicious and worth suffering through Lincoln Park for. Five stars for the pizza, minus one for not delivering to Logan Square. C'mon guys, get it together. We're dying out here!
