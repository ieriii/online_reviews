I doubt my review will help very much given the overwhelming consensus that this is an amazing restaurant (which I share!), but I wanted to add that, when I went a couple of years ago, I and my sister were vegetarian (but not vegan) and they were extremely accommodating. When making the reservation, I told them that there would be two vegetarians, and they said that was completely fine. Our dishes were for the most part similar to the other dishes, but also thoughtfully put together to be a great meal experience without the meat. They even gave us our own separate menus at the end with explanations of the vegetarian dishes. Also, we went with the shorter menu because I thought who can sit in a restaurant for five hours, but then our meal ended up taking five hours anyway. Apparently every time someone leaves the table for even a minute, it can throw off the timing of the dishes and they will remake everything in that course for your table. So the bigger your group, the more likely you will have an extended dining experience!
