Best. Pancakes. Ever. I got the Apple Pancakes and my boyfriend got the Pumpkin Spice Pancakes. Both were absolutely delicious...the most flavorful pancakes I've ever had. They also come in HUGE portions...like Denny's pancakes doubled. I could only finish like a third, but I was really satisfied. While I chose the sweet option here, I looked around and saw several other dishes that looked delicious, like their croissant sandwiches and omelettes. The only drawback is that the place seems to have a long wait. I visited Chicago for New Years so we tried to go on December 31 but it was wayy too crowded. We came back on January 2, relatively early in the morning, and the line was much shorter. But seriously, fantastic pancakes.
