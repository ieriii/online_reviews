Full disclosure: this review is about Pequod's thin crust pizza only. I ordered my first pizza from Pequod's for delivery the other night, and I was very disappointed. Yes, it was slightly different than other Chicago pizzas. The crust was very bready, soft and somewhat spongy. Very pale and lightly cooked. Big thick edge, which added even more unwanted breadiness. The toppings were ample, and of decent quality. The cheese was hardly brown at all. Very little sauce. The whole thing was limp and soggy. Not a good experience. Will not order from here again.
