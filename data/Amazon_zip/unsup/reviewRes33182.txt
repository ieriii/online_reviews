hmm. can't believe this place is getting 4 and 5 stars. i mean, it's OK, but it's not a "best thing you've ever eaten" kind of place to warrant 5 stars. or maybe because my breakfast when i visited a few weeks ago did not include bacon. :( anyways, searched yelp for a breakfast place close to our hotel and found this. we also saw this place in a lot of ads on those touristy chicago brochures. short walk in the morning so it was cool. had to wait for about 30 minutes for a table for 5. understandable since it was a saturday morning and i'm sure everyone was out to have brunch. place: nice and open space and the tables weren't too cramped. the color theme was pleasant as well. certainly fit the breakfast theme. service: attentive and quick. good. food: it was ok. again, nothing to write home about. since i wasn't eating meat during our visit, i had to settle for one of their specials. crispy shrimp eggs benedict. bland bland bland. ugh. i would have been better off getting a waffle or something. bf got the portobello scramble. what a joke. it was scrambled eggs with a tiny piece of portobello on top. really?! the only thing good about our orders were the potatoes. potatoes were actually good. friends got the regular french toast w strawberries (ok) and the banana nut french toast w peanut butter (good). i also got the special caramel hot cocoa (too sweet). overall, OK. but, if i were to visit chicago again, i would go somewhere else.
