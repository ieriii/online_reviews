A tiny slice of Heaven on Earth. Doug's has some of the most fantastic food I've had anywhere, and I don't think I've ever ordered the same thing from the man himself more than once. If you manage to make it out to this little paradise and survive the line (be prepared to wait 45 min - an hour) make sure not to short change yourself and order something off the specials menu. Doug comes up with some interesting recipes, but he knows what he's doing, and I say you should trust his judgement.
