This place is definitely set up to capitalize on people's need to impress others with their chic and pricey dining preferences. I went here with a group of 6 good friends for a fun night out. The whole experience was not negative at all. But we left feeling a little hungry and a little irritated by the chunk of change we dropped. Expect creative parings like my scallops with oatmeal entree. Also expect small and pricey portions. And a very limited menu.My advice is to go here when a) your on an expense account and b) you have something to prove.
