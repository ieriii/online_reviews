If you like thin crust (NY style) pizza, this is a must! Currently my favorite pizza in Chicago. Nice amount of sauce (I can't stand dry pizza), which is perfectly seasoned and not thick like tomato paste. Ample amounts of cheese and toppings make this a no-brainer if you live in their delivery radius. Selection of micro brew beers isn't bad either, if you like beer (real men drink whisky).
