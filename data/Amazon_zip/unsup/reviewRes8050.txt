Think about it, meat-lovers. Unlimited quantities of meat. UNlimited, flavorful meat. It may not be the tastiest steak you'll ever have, but it's still damn good. How can you give less than 3 stars to that? Add to that ... -the delicious, cheesy, fluffy bread basket (I sometimes crave the bread itself), -a refreshing caipirinha, -the salad bar - which actually has a wide selection of things besides salad (fruit, risotto, pasta salad, cold cured meats, etc), -and a bunch of gauchos practically climbing over each other to serve you more UNlimited Meat ... and you have yourself a damn-worth-the-artery-clogging meal. Yes, it is the best churrascaria in town. The only downside, really, is the price (70+ a person, and no free refills on fountain drinks? ..odd). I didn't feel it the first couple times I went (thank heavens for boys), so I was hooked on the meats before I realized what the damage was, but every so often, it's worth it. Make sure you go hungry.
