Went to Wildfire without a reservation. The place was packed (for very good reason). We were able to get a table in the bar because we arrived before 6:00PM. I recommend making reservations if you are planning a weekend visit! The food was excellent; the service was ok. The size of the meals was substantial. I started with the Horseradish Crusted Cherrystone Clams which were excellent. Beware, they have a kick. The Shrimp and Crab Bisque was an amazing blend of texture and taste. After eating the appetizers, soups and warm bread provided, my stomach was too full for a meal. I choose the Roasted Sea Scallop Skewers appetizer as my main course. Mouthwatering is the best way to describe this dish, especially when added to the wine flight I enjoyed throughout the course of the meal. Ending the night with a cappuccino and their heavenly Triple Layer Chocolate Cake put me in a catatonic state of grace; so much that instead of going out for the evening, my husband and I decided to spend the rest of the evening in by the fire. Wonderful food, great ambiance, perfect night out at an affordable price. We'll be going back!
