Love this place. Good pizza, great service, and reasonably priced. We reserved "the pit" (sunken-in front seating area) and had a great time. Game was playing on the humongo flat screen, had pizzas and pitcher beers flowing, and it was a beautiful day so the sliding glass doors were open. No charge to reserve "the pit" area, so affordable and ideal for semi-private parties. Manager, Bob Wagner, was very helpful and accommodating. Will come here much more often. Thanks Piece!
