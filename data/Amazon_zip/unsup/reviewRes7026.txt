My roommate and I went to Sapori Trattoria on a whim when Groupon was doing their $1 deal Groupon Now promotion. We did not know what to expect when we bought the deal because we had never heard of this place before, but figured we didn't have much to lose since we were going to get $40 worth of food for only $1. Fortunately, Sapori greatly exceeded our expectations! We had a bit of a rough beginning because we were not seated until a half hour after our reservation time. This was understandable since they were slammed with all of the Groupon customers. The host was very apologetic and thanked us for our patience. However we did not appreciate that he seated another table for 2, who arrived after us, before we were seated. In terms of the actual dining experience, everything was great. Our server was very nice and attentive and treated us royally even though he knew we were there with a Groupon. I always appreciate businesses who treat customers with coupons the same as they treat full-paying customers. It guarantees a return visit! The food was delicious. I had the pesto gnocchi and my roommate had a rigatoni dish. The portions are large but I thought the dishes were a bit overpriced at 19.99 each. However, this, of course, did not matter to us on this visit since we had the $1 deal. Overall, we had a great experience. The chef asks each table to write any feedback on a comment card. We ran into him as we were leaving and he was extremely kind, as all of the bussers and servers were. Their warm hospitality and yummy food definitely guaranteed a return visit from me!
