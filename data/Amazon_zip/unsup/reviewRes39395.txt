Being raised Korean myself, I can say that all the dishes here remind me of home. It's definitely as authentic of Korean as you will get. The plethora of side dishes and main course selections will leave very little room on your table for very large appetites. The meat selection is great, from Bulgogi to Kalbi and outstanding traditional stews such as my favorite, Kimchi jjigae. The food itself is great, but on a busy night expect a very slow service. Communication can be rough, so expect smooth sailing if you have any korean speaking friends. All in all, an enjoyable experience thats best shared in a group.
