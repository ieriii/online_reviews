This review is for the brunch buffet. Can I just say that brunch in the summer at Zed451 is about as good as you can get. The space is so cool and though they don't offer this on the rooftop, it's nice to gorge yourself and then head up there to relax. Every single thing we had for brunch was delicious. And I'm not exaggerating when I say that. Everything was fantastic. Some standouts include; the hashbrowns, oatmeal, eggs benedict, and french toast. And last, but not least...the freaking mini red velvet cupcakes. Seriously THE BEST red velvet cupcakes I've ever had. And believe me when I say, I'm an expert when it comes to the area of cupcakes. They need to sell those suckers by the dozen because they're just that good. The service was awesome, as well. Both the servers and chefs are very friendly and went out of their way to make sure we were well taken care of.
