I've been to Bin 36 for breakfast, lunch, just drinks and dinner. I would probably recommend it the most for lunch and drinks though. The restaurant is a great modern lofty space which I love, but during dinner conversation can be very tough, especially with a larger group. The concrete ceilings don't do much to tone down the noise either. I think the food has been consistently good when I've come here for lunch. Great salads in the summer, the pizza special is nice and the pastas too. I'm a fan of the seasonal menu. Most recently I enjoyed a wild boar ravioli...the sauce was so good I could sop it up with the extra bread. Appetizers I always enjoy their cheese plate and the hummus is pretty tasty too. Wine flights are fantastic. I always tend to stick with the sexy reds...the petite syrah is a favorite. Great place for a working lunch or after work for a date. Enjoy complimentary coffee and cookie if you come for lunch.
