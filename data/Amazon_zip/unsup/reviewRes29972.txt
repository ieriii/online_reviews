This placed partially lived up to expectations. Though I recommend sticking with what they are famous for, ceviche (Chamoy definitely), guac, and of course the mole...ahh mole. Umm, yeah, I considered asking my date if I could lick the plate, the mole is ridiculous.  However, some of the other entrees were standard.
