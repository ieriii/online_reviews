This was a spur of the moment thing. My friends and I had dinner at Nuevo Leon because we heard it was good from one of my friend's friends. We parked for 25 cents because parking is free after 9 so thats a plus! There were four of us so we packed into a booth and 3 of us ordered the enchiladas suizas with red sauce and chicken and our guy friend had the burrito. Overall it was good times and it was good food. It's CASH ONLY and ONE CHECK PER TABLE so hopefully u bring cash
