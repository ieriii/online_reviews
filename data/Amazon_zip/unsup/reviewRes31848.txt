I went to Sunda tonight for my brother's birthday dinner with high expectations and those expectations were surpassed!  Drink wise I recommend the Mai Tai in the awesome tiki god glass/mug. Tasty, yet potent. For our meal, we decided to go family style and order a plethora of dishes. My favs were the Crispy Rice Spicy Tuna, Longevity Noodles w/Blue Crab, Beef (yes, beef) Popsicles, & the Rock Shrimp Tempura.  I look forward to visiting Sunda again in the near future. Two thumbs up from this guy!
