First, let me say that I am happy Chicago has a bar like this. It is quiet, relaxing, somewhat dark, high ceiling-ed, and the decor is minimalist (the high ceiling and the lack of people standing around makes it seem very spacious). I am happy that it keeps the riffraff out, because sometimes I like to enjoy a drink in peace, without people screaming and running into you. And as for the drinks, they are great alcohols mixed into delicious forms.  VH is too expensive for me to justify going to it on a regular basis. The cocktails are $12, but like I said, they're wonderful. I think this is a great place for a special occasion with another person or a small group The crowd seemed to be in their mid to late 20's or up, with the look of money burning a hole in their pockets. I would say go with people that you'd like to talk to, as the seating arrangement makes it inconvenient to start a conversation with anyone else. I went with my friend E, and we had a wonderful time talking to each other, trying some interesting drinks, and talking to our bartender, who was very knowledgeable and very friendly. We sat at the bar, although the other time I was here I sat at a table with my group (and the tables are also sort of secluded for other patrons). Everyone who is complaining about the wait at the door or the no-standing policy are totally missing the boat: that's what makes this place different and great. It would totally ruin the ambiance if they packed people in like sardines. Unless you like standing in lines of uncertain duration, I would recommend this place at non-peak times (early or non-weekend).
