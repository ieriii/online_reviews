I had a great experience here. First of all, I wasn't super hungry but was craving some good sushi. My friend and I had the spicy scallop roll, seaweed salad, and split a mushroom/egg appetizer - all were served to us fairly quickly, even though it was super packed! So, all in all, the service was really good. I really liked the dark, sexy atmosphere of the restaurant.  Plus, you'll always win at a BYOB establishment.
