One of my absolute favorite places. The decor is modern, sleek, and swanky and what is also really nice is that you get a glimpse of what's going on in the kitchen since it is on display.  The food is fantastic. Never have I been to place where each taste you are tasting is painstakingly calculated and intentional. I had the perfectly cooked Australian Sea Bass that melted on my tongue. The portions aren't that huge, but I almost feel that it is on purpose so that you savor every rationed bite. I was satisfied with just that...but then the desert menu came. Once upon a time there was a wonderful dish called S'Mores. Smores have always consistently delivered. Then one day, Smores' cousin came into town, who happened to be a better looking, better tasting, a more sophisticated supermodel of smores. That's what the croquettes are at Mercat! These delicious supermodels had a crunch and that chocolate oozing out of the middle, sitting in a puddle of aioli. I could've had 50 of them.  Overall, my experience at Mercat was one of the most pleasant I've ever had. **It is also nestled in the Blackstone Hotel (which is gorgeous!)  Another added bonus to this beautiful restaurant is the wonderful staff. I politely asked them if we could shoot our engagement photos there while the restaurant was closed, and they were more than happy to accommodate this unusual request.
