I'm so excited there is somewhere good to eat in my hood! went there on a whim last weekend, between tour de fat and west fest, and I was in need of food BAD. i honestly wasn't expecting much... after walking past Calvin's everyday the year before, i was pretty sure the whole building was ready to fall down. But we walked into a nice, cozy room, with smiling faces everywhere! the staff was amazing and they didn't even laugh when i ordered and got the name all wrong! i got the Lechon sandwich, which was mouth watering good, with sweet plantains in the center, oh! yum! and plantain chips on the side, which i could've ate a whole bag of! it was suppose to be a eat and run, but we ended up staying for another hour after lunch, just talking with the staff, and writing on the wall by the bathroom (this is encouraged). love love LOVE it. i'm ready to go back already!
