The BF and I had a lovely, leisurely meal here the other night. The dining room is beautiful and really set the stage for a pleasant and romantic evening. We were also fortunate enough to get a table by the window and a friendly, knowledgeable server. The meal was delicious and memorable. We started with the salad with frisee, tuna, olives and eggs. It was subtle and delicious. Admittedly, the portions were small, but we enjoy small-plates style dining because it allows us to sample more things. The next items were among the tastiest things we sampled: the Spanish octopus with potatoes and smoked paprika--so incredibly tender and delicious, we could have eaten ten more servings; the potatoes with spicy aoli were almost addictive--crisp on the outside with a dallop of the paprika mayonnaise, making it the perfect mouthful; the Barramndi (Australian Bass) with celery root puree was outstanding, with crispy skin and tender flesh--just out of this world; and the anchovies had the perfect salty, tart, acidic kick. We ended with a cheese plate--three cheeses chosen by the chef, We felt like the chef did not let us down with the dishes we chose for our meal, so he could do no wrong choosing the cheeses. It was well worth getting the thee cheese selection. The accompaniments that came with the cheeses were all delicious, adding to the pleasure of eating the cheeses. In addition to the cheese plate, we also shared a dessert: a sheep's cheese torta, which was more like a warm cross between a souffle and a cheesecake. Heavenly. I highly recommend this restaurant. The food is inventive and very high quality. The atmosphere is chic but not too trendy. I love the cavernous dining room and the beautiful murals, and was grateful that it was not at all loud or overcrowded (Maybe because it was a Monday night?). I had one of the best meals I've had in recent memory. I'd definitely recommend it to others and of course eat there again myself.
