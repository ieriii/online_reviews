Frutti di Mare. Oh.Emm.Gee, an incredible bowl of black spaghetti served with a spicy red pepper sauce and fresh clams, mussels, calamari, shrimp; lions tigers and bears OH MY! Ok now the review. Walking in the restaurant, off the bat you can tell the place is pretentious (I later learned they do have reason). The host staff was not very friendly, almost look bothered as we walked in. Anyways, we were taken to our table where a nice, attentive server waited on us (and kept my glass of sparkling rose full - it may have gone down too easily, the wine list in general is quite extensive and offers many great options).  Started with the pear and goat cheese salad, which was pretty awful, I was very disappointed. I am a sucker for goat cheese, if its on the menu I have to order it, and you could tell no thought went into this salad, an un-original fruit and goat cheese salad with arugula, and lacked much flavor. I was nervous about the main course, having been so underwhelmed by the salad. However, the Spaghetti Nero Frutti di Mare is exceptional. The seafood was very fresh, red sauce on point, and black pasta was delicious. This is a great dish. However, the lamb meatballs were a little off. Perhaps too much seasoning? With no room left for dessert after swallowing that incredible bowl of pasta, we did leave very satisfied and I will most certainly return. The environment is great, waitstaff very friendly and attentive, and the food was all in all, pretty darn good.
