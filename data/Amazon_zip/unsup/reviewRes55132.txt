Ribeye was excellent. Service was perfect. made an e-reservation and noted it was my birthday. I didn't mention it at any point during the evening to see if they actaully read the note. They did, and brought out a freebie desert for us. Waiter even played coy, trying to make it a surprise. It was the perfect service that really made the night, very attentive but not a touch overzelous. Wildfire is a complete opposite to another Lettuce property, L Woods, which is horrible food and service. Things are priced right too. Even the bar had pub prices.
