All I can say is- wow. I can't believe I haven't tried this restaurant! The food is really amazing. I love the ambiance and the lighting, it gives the place a warm feeling. They serve you a complimentary bread coated with powdered sugar, I guess you can call that a donut =) I ordered the Eggs New Orleans which is a lump crab cake on a type of bread "popover", poached eggs,barnaise sauce.....Heaven. You could really taste the crab and it was delicious. The only reason why I gave a 4 star instead of 5 is the service was a bit slow. There weren't a lot of people so you would think you would get your food quicker right? but I am not complaining because all that wait was well worth it. The price is kinda pricy for breakfast-2 entree, a cup of coffee and a glass of freshly squeezed oj totaled to around $55! I guess you do pay for what you get-fresh food! MMmmm
