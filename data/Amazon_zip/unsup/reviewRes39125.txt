I finally got my hiney to Longman & Eagle. Probably a solid year after adding it to the ever-expanding Chicago bucket list in my mind. I'd driven by several times before and the place looked a bit like a hipster clown car from the street, but I finally happened here with my wife in tow for brunch on a chilly Sunday morning a few weeks back. We hit the sweet spot where the early birds were just finishing up and the late sleepers were still at home fussing with their skinny jeans and pomade. But, I digress. We plopped down at the bar and nearly immediately had menus and tasty brunch beers (Bell's porter anyone?) in front of us. We ordered the wild boar sloppy joe and the burger with cheddar, bacon and brioche bun. Both were fantastic and accompanied by L&E's signature beef fat fries. Wow, tasty as all get-out, but so rich that I couldn't finish mine. I might have preferred duckfat fries with some aioli myself, but still a very solid offering that makes this place unique. I'll have to return when it's a more appropriate hour for bourbon flights as the selections were truly impressive. Very cool rustic vibe with well-appointed vintage bar. I'm sure the place is even better by candlelight at night. See you again soon!
