I recently just moved to Logan Square and heard awesome things about L&E so decided to make it my first meal in the city. My group of 4 were very happy with their meals with only a few minor complaints. The chicken & waffles was a very large portion and takes too much effort to scrounge through the portion which was the biggest turnoff, gotta work for your meal! Two people ordered the mac&cheese, one loved it and the other thought it was nothing special but still very good. The mac&cheese comes with a mini salad with a tad bit of salad dressing on which I thought was a nice touch, not too over powering. We also ordered the biscuits and gravy which was a homerun, no complaints over that dish! The late night menu is very odd and not "bar food" by any means. The upstairs has about 5 rooms, so if you're having too much fun you can always stay the night and I think the room rates are only $85 so cheaper than most downtown hotels. Overall the place is very cool inside, fresh ingredients, nice staff, ridiculously large whiskey menu and unfortunately no TVs so if you're going there ya better be up for socializing!
