This place is so good. We went on Saturday morning around 10am. We had a party of 4 with 2 highchairs. The wait wasn't too bad this time...only 30 minutes. We all loved our food choices. I had the pot roast benedict...delish! The pot roast was tender and moist. The eggs were a little overcooked...not runny. My friends had the chocolate heaven french toast, red velvet french toast, and crepes suzette. We shared and everything was so good. The strawberry orange was amazing. I can't wait to go back. I want to try everything on the menu.
