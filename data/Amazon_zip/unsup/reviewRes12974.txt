Decided to finally check out Cafe 28 after reading through the huge number of favorable reviews in yelp. The experience was to say the least very disappointing. We started of with the 'Taste of Cuba'. This was the highlight of the dinner and that unfortunately is not saying much. The empanadas were average to say the least, cannot be compared with the likes of Las Tablas (delicious) .  For the main course we ordered ropa vieja and some absolutely bland chicken (don't recall the name). The ropa vieja slightly topped the chicken but was again very disappointing. It tasted like a poor version of chilli, nothing like the flavors we walked in expecting. At this point we were just looking forward to the plantain which accompanied both dishes to save the day. But this again was disappointing.. The plantain fare at Las Tablas and Fogo de Chao were miles and miles better. I won't be going back for seconds.
