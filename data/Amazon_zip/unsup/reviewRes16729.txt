Two words: LUNCH BUFFET! Okay, so it's not cheap indian food, but it's a buffet!! And they have gulab jamun (fried donuts in saffron syrup! YUM!) This is a great downtown option for lunch if you're in the city. They have everything from fried vegetable fritters, paneer, chana masala (chickpeas), dal (lentils), butter chicken (oh glorious heaven), lamb, fish curry, and more. They also have a small salad bar with different chutneys and fruit. For dessert, they have gulab jamun (sigh~ heart!), mango ice cream (very delicious), and rice pudding. They also bring warm naan and sizzling tandoori chicken to your table!
