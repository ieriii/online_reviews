I have to agree with most people here: I don't get the hype. I live in the neighborhood and have been able to get to Bongo Room on chilled out weekdays to avoid the crazy weekend brunch crowds. The food is fine -- no orgasms here -- but really, there are so many other good brunch options that are nearby, especially on weekends. Toast, Feast, Jane's, Filter, any number of places over on Division... One nice surprise: The lunch salads are quite good. I'll throw in an extra star because the servers are generally nice and attentive.
