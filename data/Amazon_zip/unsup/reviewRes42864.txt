I loved this place because it was unlike any I've been to before, even in Vegas. It has a great vibe. Our server was super cool and made great recommendations. Highlights - cocktails were spectacular, ribeye was the best we've had in a while (my husband sends his steak back 90% of the time) as was the bernaise, chocolate cream pie and homemade mint chocolate chip ice cream were to die for.
