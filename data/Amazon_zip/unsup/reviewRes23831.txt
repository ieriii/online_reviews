Yummy! Great food. Small place so dont expect anything that you wouldn't get at a diner. THE SALSA that comes with the EMPANADAS is the best ( per the bf). and the entrees are a good size and the drinks are yummy. over all i would def go back when im in the mood for Cuban sandwhich and some spanish talking waitress :)
