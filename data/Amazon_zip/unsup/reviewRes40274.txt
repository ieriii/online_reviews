After running some chores on the north side of the city, the hunger monster awoke and I didn't know what to do. Where should I go? So many places... so many choices. Yelp to the rescue! I yelped nearby restaurants and this place came up as one of the best and most reviewed fast food places around. Here case where I think the ratings were right on. Yes, it is confusing that there are like 3 restaurants with the same name and a 4th with a similar name all practically right next to each other. However, THIS Pasadita was great. I loved the flavor of the beans and the cheese they use was mouth-meltingly awesome. Had a tostada and half a burrito. I think they over-charged me for the burrito, though. A veggie burrito is supposed to be $6. I did ask for the larger size, so I can see if they charged extra, but they charged the regular super burrito size, $8.50. If you look at the meat/regular menu, a regular burrito was like $7 with the super burrito being $8.50 ($1.50 more), so if the veggie burrito is $6, then a veggie super size should be something around $7.50 (roughly $1.50 more?). You would think... A bit upset about that but I didn't say anything because I was just so satisfied by the flavor of the food. Oh... don't forget the sauces. If you eat in, you get chips and two bottles of salsa. Green and brown. The green one is super spicy. I found a combination of a splash of green with a dousing of brown to be a great combination. I don't know why they don't provide a bowl or something if you eat it, because it was kinda awkward to squeeze the sauces directly on to each chip... Overall awesome and I would definitely go back. Next time I'll ask about the price of the burrito and also ask for a bowl for the sauce. :-)
