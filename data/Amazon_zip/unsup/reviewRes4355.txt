This place was a lot better about 5 years ago. However, it has become more popular and they have hiked up the prices. If you are looking for a fun place to go in Uptown, this is really the spot to go. Although, there is generally a cover up to $12, and don't expect to talk during some scheduled performances. The after hours house band is around a $5 cover and you can be as loud as you want. So, really, I recommend it as an after hours bar, but I wouldn't go here for the scheduled jazz shows unless you REALLY want to see the group.
