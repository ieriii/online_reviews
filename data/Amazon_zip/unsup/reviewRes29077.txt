This place is a true Lincoln Park gem. I went to DePaul and have lived in Lincoln Park for years and have always overlooked this place. In the past week, I have gone three times with different groups of people and have gotten awesome reviews from all my friends. My go-to plate is the Spaghetti Frutti de Mare (spaghetti with clams, mussels and shrimp in white wine and marinara sauce)... for $8.50, the taste and ingredients are comparable to the $20/plate Italian places I have gone to. The food is generally amazing for such a good price, but their pasta bowls are the best thus far (hence the name, probably). I always opt for wine with my food and it is just the perfect cheap(er) night with good food and fairly good wine. The place belongs to the neighborhood. It's usually a mix of just down-home good Chicagoans who appreciate good and well-priced food (especially around Lincoln Park)... the few times I have gone, there was always a family, infant and small child, and they don't ever seem out of place. The servers are friendly and casual, which goes well with the general atmosphere. My next visit will probably venture into the sandwich menu... it depends. But the Farfalle Pollo and the Spaghetti Frutti de Mare are very good and I highly recommend it.
