I have been to Sunda three times and each and every time it was fantastic. The impeccable service, the amazing environment, and the out of this world food make Sunda my favorite restaurant. Each time I go I try something new (while still getting some favorites) & am always impressed. The wait staff go out of their way to make sure you know exactly what you're ordering and really take the time to make you feel like you're their only client. I've been raving about it to friends for months & it honestly lives up to all the hype and expectations!
