I just went to this restaurant with a group of nine (relatives visiting from out of town.) It was fabulous. I loved the decor; window shutters, palms, smoky mirrors, and lots of brass fixtures. We ordered a bunch of appetizers. I liked the shrimp wrapped around the sugar cane and the chicken and mushroom ravioli. I wasn't crazy about the shrimp vegetable spring rolls, they had some Vietnamese name i can't remember right now. I also had the filet mignon salad which was fantastic. For our main course I sampled the jumbo shrimp in curry sauce, the mango chicken with asparagus and the tofu cooked in a clay pot. All were great over rice and the tofu had a surprising spicy kick. Desert wise, mango and raspberry sorbet, chocolate mousse cake, and you must try the bananna tapioca, which is served still warm. Ok, now the coffee, they make this Vietnamese coffee that is brewed in the glass at your table. On the bottom is condensed milk which you stir in yourself. Best coffee I have ever had. We all had a great time and the staff was awesome even though we stumbled in there after a day of sightseeing wearing tennis shoes and very casual clothing.
