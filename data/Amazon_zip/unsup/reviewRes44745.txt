Went to Giordanos back in September. I had pretty high expectations for this place because of all the hype. Unfortunately I ended up pretty disappointed and was not too impressed with the pizza at all. I definitely think NYC pizza tastes way better. Sorry Chicago, but NYC definitely kick butt in regards to the pizza department. What we ordered: 2 deep dish pizza. One with ham and pineapple and the other with mushroom and pepperoni. The pizza was way too doughy and there wasn't enough sauce. The cheese tasted pretty good but that was about it.  The line for this place was super long so we ordered take out but ended up sitting near the bar. I am not sure if we had to put our name down for those seats but we just sat down and since no one said anything to us, we just ordered a few drinks and ate the pizzas we ordered.
