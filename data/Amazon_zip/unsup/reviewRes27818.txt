friend: "Hey, there's this place by my house that has good, cheap Mexican food ...do you wanna try it?" me: SURE! I LOVE MEXICAN!!! One of the things I miss about Chicago is their Mexican food. I cannot seem to find a good place in NYC, believe it or not. So when I can get a chance to grab some grub in Chicago, I crave MEXICAN FOOD. My girl-friend, who is Mexican recommended that I order the: TACOS DE SABINAS $8.00 Three flour tortillas filled with strips of our seasoned ribeye steak, grilled onions, tomatoes, jalapeno peppers, refried beans and topped with chihuahua cheese. ***droooool*** YUM! It was some goood tacos, good recommendation ;) Since my friend is a vegetarian, she decided to order up some eggs and beans...whatever she ordered looked yummy too. Too bad I wasn't able to try more but I will definitely drag my friend there when I visit again =D
