I love this little gourmet store. Can't really afford much in the grocery store part, but the cafe is wonderful and reasonably priced. You can get a delicious soup/salad/sandwich lunch for $10-15 and it's a great place to enjoy a leisurely lunch with coffee and a newspaper. The grocery store has some unique stuff--this is the only place in Chicago I've found where I can acquire Fran's salted caramels or Seattle's chocolates.
