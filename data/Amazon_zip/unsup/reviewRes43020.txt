okay, it's five orders down the pike, and this place has me confused. the first time i ordered, the thin crust was so delicious, the second and third, it was chewy and tough. i switched it up to the deep dish, and i guess that's the solution, because once again i can count on a party in my mouth, veggies plentiful, cheese lovely, tasty, stringy deliciousness. it is disappointing though, that i can't count on thin crust consistency. i like to know that when georgio leaves the kitchen, giovanni can step right in and kick it up.
