Oh what to say about this place. I have been here a few times and the food is always top-notch. It is open until 4am. HOWEVER, this place definitely loses a star for the creepy guys that whistle at girls INSIDE the restaurant. It is almost like you order a side of "harrassment" with your chimichanga and enchiladas. It has never failed me. When the waitress offers you to sit in the bar area, if you are a female, REFUSE. Ask to sit privately where no one else is. Otherwise, the food is always delicious and makes chancing a bit of harrassment worth it.
