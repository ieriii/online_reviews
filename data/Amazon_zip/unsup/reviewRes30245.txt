I have to admit that we were a little disappointed by the food here after reading all the great reviews. The cafe certainly has a nice atmosphere, good location, and great service, but it's not a place I would come back to over and over. My stuffed french toast was huge but didn't quite find the right balance between the sweetness of sliced bananas and walnuts and the bite of melted brie. My boyfriend's omelette wasn't bad but his potatoes o'brien were definitely overcooked. Perhaps we didn't order the right dishes!
