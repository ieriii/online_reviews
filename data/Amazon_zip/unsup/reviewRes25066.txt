I usually wish I had a wheelchair when leaving Artopolis. My Greek dad has been taste testing baklava for the 50+ years of his life and he literally started to well up with tears of joy when he tried their baklava. Now I am required to pick up a box of it and bring it to him everytime I go home to Cleveland.
