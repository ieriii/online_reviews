Andale! Andale!! This place is a machine. Definitely has over-the-top Vegas flair, but the restaurant is run with cruel efficiency. We ordered a guac appetizer, and I swear, the waiter must have telepathically communicated the order to the kitchen because it was on our table before we could get the words out. Same for the rest of the meal, I felt like I was on a timetable and it didn't help that there were goons running around with ear pieces keeping things in order. Good wine list, nice selection of cocktails, and the food is decent(had guac, palm salad, beef entree, and fish tacos, all fine)- but be prepared to eat fast- before the next course comes out! I would come back to the bar, it is more quaint and has more charm than the main circus dining hall.  But I'm not sure that I would really want to eat there again and feel like a cog in the wheel.
