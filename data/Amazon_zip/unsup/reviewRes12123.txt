I had a couple of hours to kill in North Center and decided to have a solo dinner here early on a Friday night. I don't normally dine out alone, but I had a really good experience. The staff was great, the mojito was awesome, the bread and crazy butter was amazing. I had the pistachio crusted chicken and it was good, but I not great. I don't know what I was expecting but it wasn't that. Still good though, just not 5-star worthy, especially at $19.
