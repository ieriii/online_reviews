Delicious! Whether you're feeling adventurous for some really authentic Chinese food or something more traditional, this is the place to go. I had the crispy duck and it was perfect. The skin was perfectly crispy bit the meat was tender and juicy. Be careful for the bones, though. With no question, if you're in Chicago and want Chinese, give some thought to Lao Sze Chuan!
