In my opinion this is probably the best pizza in Chicago. The caramelized cheese around the edges is something I haven't found anywhere else. It's also right across the street from the movie theater on Webster so it's a great place to eat before or after a movie. They just renovated the place and it's a lot brighter than before, which is not necessarily a good thing, but overall the new set up woks better.
