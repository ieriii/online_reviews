great night.... great food... great service. as a native floridian (specifically miami), i am a fan of cuban food. this is authentic cuban food. starters: we had the empandas (ropa vieja, goat cheese, and guava & cheese), croquetas, tamal, and avocado salad. out of the apps, the tamal was least tasty to me.... i found it a bit bland and mealy, the rest were delicious! my party and i had a variety of sandwiches.... pollo, guajirito, sandwich de pescale, and a housemade veggie sandwich. each was amazing in its own right. we had a couple of issues with our original order, but buck, our waiter, was great in his recommendations and in accommodating us (and our special requests). we ended the night with a cafe cubano and vanilla flan.... a perfect ending to a tasty dining experience! i recommend this restaurant and recommend buck as your requested server. both are tasty in their own way!
