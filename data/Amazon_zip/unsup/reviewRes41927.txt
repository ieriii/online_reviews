Went here for lunch on Sunday. The place was packed, but in a good way--everyone was happily eating and talking while waiters rushed by frantically with huge bowls of pho and other delicious looking dishes. Despite the crowd, my boyfriend and I are we seated at a communal table in about 10 minutes. To start, we got a mango fruit smoothie and a strawberry smoothie. The mango smoothies was delicious--was thick and tasted like fresh mango. The strawberry smoothie was good, but not as good as the mango.  Now for the food. We ordered shrimp spring rolls, the duck salad and a stir-fried noodle dish with shrimp, beef, vegetables and chicken. The food in general here was very good. The ingredients tasted very fresh and the dishes were not oily at all. The only thing I didn't like was that the bits of duck were still on the bone, which made them a little difficult to eat. Otherwise everything about my meal was great. The waiters were very fast, courteous and friendly. I will definitely be coming back here to sample the other dishes on Pho Xe Tang's huge menu.  FYI. The portions here are pretty generous. We definitely ordered more than enough food and struggled to finish everything.
