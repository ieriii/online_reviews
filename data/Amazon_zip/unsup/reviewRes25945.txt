I had heard great things about this place and was very excited to finally try it. The Blackstone Hotel is an old gem that has been restored to it's old charm and warmth. The restaurant was much more modern and rather loud. I was pleasantly surprised to see it as crowded as it was for a Monday night. Our waiter, while very sweet was rather inept. He never asked for our drink order and did stop by for a second to tell us that some complimentary thing would be coming out. I couldn't hear what it was and it never arrived so I still don't know what it was supposed to be. We ordered a few different things and one of my friends who has food allergies ordered one dish of diver scallops, which the waiter knew was going to be the only thing she was going to eat, puts that order in first and was our first dish to arrive. she ate by herself and then basically sat and ate bread and butter while we ate our food. Throughout the 1st portion of our meal, the waitstaff/servers kept knocking into my friend's chair and then one of them accidentally dropped something on her. The liquid went everywhere. The 2nd tier manager...some snooty french guy acted as though she was an inconvenience to whatever it was he was doing and told her she should get her coat cleaned and that she would have to come back to bring him the cleaning bill. What???  The food!!! WONDERFUL, DELICIOUS, FLAVORFUL!! The morel mushroom risotto was one of the best things I have ever tasted and would have licked the bowl if I was in private!  The pork belly with some potato puree and the short rib was just delicious. The chef really put some thought into his dishes. So, would I go back? The food was so good that yes I probably would...the staff probably knows this which is why they behave like they do. one more thing...make sure you have a fat wallet...it's pricey. 5 star food 1 star service/attitude 3 star average
