If you're looking for a family experience, this Greek restaurant definitely gives that vibe. Owned by a group of friends, this restaurant in Greektown is quite popular. The wait was about 20 minutes on a Sunday night but that may have been because it was also the Greek festival. They serve you bread as an appetizer but I would have thought they'd give you pita bread instead. I ordered a gyro but it was a "make it yourself" gyro platter. The gyro meat wasn't very juicy - a little dry for my standards unfortunately.  I've definitely had better Greek food but perhaps the other items taste better than the gyro meat.
