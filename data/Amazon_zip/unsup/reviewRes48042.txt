I like this place a lot. I went for dinner on a weeknight and I was back on that following Sunday for some damn tasty brunch. What's not to like about this place? Pork, seafood, and beer... you just can't go wrong with that combo. The place reminds me of a large beer hall, filled with long wooden communal tables, pub style cocktail tables, and a long bar with a lot of good beer on tap. There's also these private booths with swinging wooden doors. Dinner was filled with a lot of pork and beer, my favorites of the night being this Blood Sausage w/ pistachio sauce and some Three Floyd's Zombie Dust. That blood sausage was insanely good and I highly recommend it. The Charcuterie plate was also delicious and that Head Cheese was pure porky goodness. My favorite meal here was had at Brunch and I've already made reservations for another Sunday. If you don't want to end up waiting an hour to be seated, just hop on OpenTable. So reasons why I love brunch here: insanely delicious bacon, great beer, really spicy bloody mary's, and just all around good food . Probably the best Waffles I've had anywhere. They're crisp yet airy and topped with that honey butter and jam... just perfect. Even better is their Bacon. I think they should be called Bacon Steaks on their menu, since these bad boys are thick thick cut. Just order a plate for yourself and savor every last bite. Spicy Pork Rinds, Frites w/ egg yolk, Breakfast Sausage... everything was delicious, especially the sausage. They really know their sausages. Can't wait to go back.
