NUEVO LEON IS THE SHIT-and I mean that in a great way. Not sure how it doesn't have more than 5 stars overall on here.The prices are TERRIFIC-nothing is over $12! You get a complimentary appetizer-always amazing! You get free chips and salsa. All of the food there is great, plus you always get so much that even paying $12 for carne asada is a great deal. Most meals come with refried beans and rice. The carne asada also has tortillas. Drinks are all $1 and come in cans. Plus the place is BYOB-how great is that. Service is ALWAYS great and fast. While pretty much everything is amazing, here are the very, very few minor downfalls:Only take cash-however there is an ATM right next to the register.Free parking right down the street-usually there is room, but on some nights it does get busy so you have to park on the street.On busy night the line to get seated can take a little while, but as long as you remain patient and do your thing-the wait is never that terrible!
