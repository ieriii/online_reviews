I love this place for good upper scale Vietnamese food with a twist. I've been here a few different times, and really like it. The ambience is great for a romantic night out with the special person in your life. The service is very professional and attentive. I've tried a couple of the speciality cocktails, which are very tasty. I like the oxtail pho with beef tenderloin soup is awesome! I like the grilled scallops with garlic noodle salad, a must if sharing with some... I like the whole fried red snapper with sweet and sour, it's good, but not the best I've ever had. The fresh spring rolls are very fresh, simple, but very tasty! I've yet to go wrong with any section here, as all the food is good.  The only suggestion I'd make, is not to go on Valentine's Day. When visiting on Valentine's Day, we were offered the same menu at higher prices, which wasn't a good experience. It's a pretty pricy restaurant to begin with, I certainly don't want to pay more to dine here for a special event. I will be back, just not for Valentine's Day.
