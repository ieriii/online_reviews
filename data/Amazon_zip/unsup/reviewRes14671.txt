small place but huge menu... even for the vegetarian -- tons of vegi options that go beyond plaintains and other members of the starch family.  their vegi sandwich is amazing and their tostones, to die for. husband got a bistec sandwich and an empanada and croquette side. pour on that chimichurri sauce on anything and everything!  yes, we probably over ordered but were so overwhelmed by the choices and wanted to try everything. the bread they use is a crunchy chewy goodness and extremely FILLING. i was busting at the seams and could not stop munching - you just can't help it. cuban food has never really done anything for me because of its traditional meat-heavy menu. i also found it difficult to pay so much money for beans and yuca! no need for fancy - 90 miles has very authentic, delicious food for bargain prices.
