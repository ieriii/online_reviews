I love this place and I go out my way to eat here! First, the owner is so welcoming and gracious. If I'm waiting for carryout he brings a cup of tea right away, if there isn't a table right away, he brings tea and sometimes even little complimentary appetizers. Second, the food is great. The Pho is really authentic and delicious! I also love their mango coconut beef - they actually prepare and serve it in a coconut - the flavors are just wonderful and the beef is super tender. The lemongrass chicken, papaya salad, the saigonese crepe are all stand outs too. Plus, the prices are really reasonable AND it's BYOB! I just wish that they delivered to my River West neighborhood!
