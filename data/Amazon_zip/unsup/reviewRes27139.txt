A 90 minute wait on a Friday night but we were sat sooner because my wife is pregnant and she was standing that entire time. I had the steak, wife had the duck enchiladas (she loved them). Great sauces, reasonable prices. Wish the beer selection was a little better though I understand this is not the beverage of choice for most people at this restaurant.
