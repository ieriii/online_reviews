A solid 4 star rating. I am a fan. Not a superfan. But I'd go back here again and probably enjoy myself, as I did the first time. We had a large-ish group, and we knew going in that we were not going to sit together or even eat at the same time. So be it, eez cool. That was pretty much the attitude I had for the whole evening. The drinks are tasty and strong, and I dig the whole $3 whiskey shots thing. The space is tiny and crammed and noisy, but well-decorated. I never felt clausterphobic. Waitstaff was knowledgeable. And hip. Hipper than I am. I felt like I gained 50+ hip points after dining here. The food was just delicious. The pretzel with the welsh rarebit on the side was umamilicious. The short ribs with a side of parsnip puree blobbed into a friggin' bone were just unctuouslydumscious. Ha, I just made up words. See how cool I am now that I've dined here? I'm just creating language left and right. The price was high, but the quality was pretty high too, so there it is. Know that going in. The only mishap was that the rest of our group who arrived a little late wound up getting our table when we had left. So even though they were told it'd only be an hour and a half, it wound up being more like 2.5 hrs for a wait for them. So minus one star for that.
