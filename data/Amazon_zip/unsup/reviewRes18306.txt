After eating a meal and taking a walk around the city, we ran into this place that was bookmarked.. so we decided to squeeze it in while visiting Chicago.. We tried their daily special- Saturday - Goat Barbacoa: Braised goat, Oaxacan pasilla-tomatillo salsa, avocado, onions & cilantro- this was very tasty and the torta itself was good. Also tried their fish shaped churro, which was pretty good. We ordered to go, but looks like this place gets busy all the time. Food was great.
