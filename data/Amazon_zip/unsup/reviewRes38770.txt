I often see an many reviewers on this forum zealously overstating and overrating their experiences and overall quality of a restaurant. La Villa, on the other hand, is the best overall Italian restaurant within the geographical area. I wouldn't go as far as rating the food 4 stars since most of us clearly know that there are other restaurants in Chicago such as Mia Francesca or Little Italy which would be worthy of such a rating. The overall atmosphere is very dated. One would presume that the owner would remodel the restaurant and make the menu ever-changing, but alas we do not live in a perfect world. Some of the employees need a face-lift more than the restaurant itself, no joke. Especially when some are missing their teeth. Many of the pasta dishes fall short of what one would expect from an authentic Italian restaurant. I would never order the Frutti Di Mare here again. All other dishes are mediocre at best, with the exception of a few Chicken and seafood dishes. If you are a neighborhood local unwilling to travel abroad or who doesn't own a car, then La Villa will suffice your appetite. If you are trying to make the distinction of which Italian restaurant in Chicago is worthy of having to send out a mass e-mail the next day at work, then you might want to pass on La Villa.
