sweet potato fries? MORE PLEASE! They're so good, best in the city. The only place I have had comparable fries at is on the upper east side of NY. Certainly a hard task to make a perfect sweet potato fry, and Uncommon Ground has conquered it! Hats off to sweet potato fries served to you with a SMILE!
