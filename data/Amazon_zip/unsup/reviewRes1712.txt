Chicago is a hot dog town! And hot dog-it (!!!), I love Hot Doug's!!! If you were from out of town like me and have no car, your best bet is a nice long bus ride. You get dropped off right across the street, which in my opinion isn't so bad, especially since I got to have a nice look at the neighborhood and so forth. Anyway, let's get to the FOOD. So many choices up on the wall, but what you should really aim for is getting The Dog, which is just Chicago style and that foie gras dog. The fries in duck fat were only available on Friday and Saturday, so my Thursday visit was less eventful. Although those two dogs were the best I have ever had in my life. Chicago doesn't mess around when it comes to hot dogs. Also, I'm sure this place has had a lot of people come ever since it was featured on TV ... but it still feels like a regular corner joint. The guy at the front was really calm and nice and didn't seem to look down on the two fatties before him who ordered more than two hot dogs (yes, it was us). Hot dogs came up quick and tasted good. That was what we loved. I'm definitely coming back to Chicago so I can tear into this menu a little bit more. Plus I'm sure my mom would love this place because they have an Elvis dog!
