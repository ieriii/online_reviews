There isn't much not to like about this place. Be prepared to pay in cash and leave feeling stuffed.  The ceviche (made with white fish and lime juice and traditionally served with saltines) is fresh and delicious. The oatmeal shakes made with soymilk are thick, creamy and nutty. Today I decided to try the vegetarian plate with fresh broccoli, tomatoes, and hot peppers with the costa rican gallo pinto rice, cabbage salad and sweet fried plantains. And of course, I love when a meal starts with homemade tortilla chips and hot salsas. Prices are ridiculously decent. YUM
