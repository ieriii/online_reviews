I know, I know, it's been around for ever, everyone loves it, it's in Lakeview... I've got to say, even when I was vegetarian, I never really dug this place. I mean, there are far worse places to eat as a vegetarian - I remember those unfortunate meals, picking through the appetizers for possible meat-free combination. But just because something is marketed well doesn't mean it's good. (Disclosure: I've been off and on vegetarian since my teens, and vegan for a combined period of about 8 months.) My two major gripes were that the faux-meat doesn't taste like meat (or even good veggie-meat) and most of the options are as greasy as a normal diner. You'd think vegetarian food would translate into something a tad healthier, but everytime I walk out of here, I feel like I've eaten at McDonalds. I know it's a diner, but they could do so much more with the food. Instead of making everything exactly as it would be in a meat-eater diner, try some creativity!  I've been here numerous times, and every time I smell someone getting it takeout, I cringe. Sorry, but sometimes the best isn't always the most obvious. I recommend Victory's Banner, Soul Veg East, Vella Cafe, or Bite (where you can BYOB).
