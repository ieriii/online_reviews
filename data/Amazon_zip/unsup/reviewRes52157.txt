One, star is too generous, but it is the lowest yelp will allow. Gino's East has the worst service ever, for a so-so pizza at best. I am almost 50 and this was the first time I did not tip my server. Don't bother asking your server for recommendations; because the result will be "deep dish" then he will walk away without saying another word. About 15 minutes later the "Pizza Nazi" will finally return and rudely ask, "Are you ready to order now"? If you decide on a deep dish pizza, he will tell you that it will take about 45 minutes, and then ask, "do you still want to order"? He will then take your drink order, and you will not see him again, nor will any other employee come by to refresh your drinks, or ask if you would like anything else.  Wow, stupid owners, I always thought that additional sales usually meant additional income. If this is a public company, don't invest.  I wouldn't waste your time on this place. I found that Pizzeria Uno, which is pretty close, has better pizza and much better service. If you want the best Chicago style deep dish pizza, find a Giordano's; great pizza and great service.
