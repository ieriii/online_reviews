This is definitely the best pizza that will deliver to Bucktown, but it's not nearly as good as Delisi's in West Rogers Park. They have a lot of topping options, but they don't quite execute them as well as Delisi's. The spinach is usually pretty toasted, which I think is a pizza staple, but that's just me. I might be a weirdo though. They do put huge pieces of sausage on the pizza which makes it a divine topping. Something to keep everybody happy? Yeah. Best in the city? Nope, thin it's Delisi's, dish, it's Pequods, fo sho.
