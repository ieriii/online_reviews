I had a bad experience at their cafe about two weeks ago. My food took 45 minutes to arrive! I was there with a friend of mine and we ended up leaving and asking for our money back because we had somewhere else to be.Here is why I give them four stars though. I was there earlier this week on Monday. I didn't want to go back after my last experience, but my friend was in town after having moved away a year ago, and she really wanted to go back to F&O. I was reluctant, but I walked in and asked the manager at the desk if the cafe was open, and I said I was hesitant to go back because of the problem from before. He couldn't have been nicer! He walked me and my three girl friends back to the restaurant area and spoke to the girl at the register. He came back up to us and said he explained to them we had a bad experience before and to make sure they were on top of their game. We got everything we ordered and we didn't have to wait long at all!We were seated outside and had just finished eating when the manager was walking outside. It looked like he was on his way home. He walked past our table but he happened to see us sitting there and he turned around and made sure we got everything we ordered, and asked if we got it quickly. It was nice to see that they took my concern seriously and fixed it. Thanks to the manager Stan from the front who saved the day! I'll definitely be back again soon.
