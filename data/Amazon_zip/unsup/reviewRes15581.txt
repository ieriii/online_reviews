I love handcrafted cocktails and after reading about this place came all dressed up early on a Friday with cash in hand ready to spend on everything I had been drooling over on the menu online. I gave the hostess my phone number and she told me about the call twice thing, so I just waited outside the door with my boyfriend for about 20 minutes. They called once, and fishing around in my purse for my phone I didn't get it in time, so I just went straight inside, phone in hand waiting for call #2. From the time it took me to walk from the outer door to walk up to the curtain they had given my table away. "But," I explained, "you said you would call twice and you only called once, and I'm here!" I even showed them the call log on my phone. Nope, doesn't matter, not getting in, go to the back of the hour long line. I tried to explain again that I had just been waiting right outside the door, and came in as soon as they called. That's when they called over a large bouncer guy to get in my face and repeat "this is not a negotiation" while he physically intimidated me out in to the hallway. I'm not a petite lady, but I really REALLY don't appreciate someone needing to escalate it to threatening to physically remove me, especially when I'm a person who is painfully quiet and polite when resolving a customer service problem. It is to my chagrin that after about a minute of that kind of public humiliation I could feel tears welling up in my eyes, so I just threw up my hands and decided that I guess I'm just not wanted here. I don't know if you can indignantly slam a velvet curtain, but I sure as hell tried. I'm still flabbergasted that anyone there felt that kind of treatment was necessary. So thanks a lot Violet Hour, I came with a lot of money to spend and every intention of becoming a regular, but you shut the door (curtain?) in my face to maintain some pretentious image of artificial exclusivity.
