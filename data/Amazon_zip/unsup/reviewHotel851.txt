Camped out here a few days over Thanksgiving. Staff was friendly and accommodating, room was just fine and overlooked a lovely brick wall (eh, not a deal breaker for me) ... but the interweb connection at this place was incredibly slow. It was as though I was nine again and impatiently waiting for dial up connection so I could do important things like visit the Ty website and look at Beanie Baby paraphernalia. Right. But there was the most amazing vintage typewriter in the lobby, I wished it was as easy to take as little bottles of hotel shampoo.
