Great pizza and beer. We've been there twice and were impressed both times. The second time we went, evidently there was a delay with our pizza (we did not even notice) and the manager came out to apologize for the delay and told us he would modify the bill. I'm sure the pizza was out within 15 minutes, but when we got the bill, they had taken off the entire cost of the pizza. Great pizza, beer, and unbelievable customer service! I think we just found our new standby.
