Amazing service... simply amazing!! We got to the restaurant and was pretty much immediately seated. Our cups were never empty and the plates of plantains, mashed potatoes were always a plenty! When your card is green- the different types of meats kept coming! I especially liked the Picahna- very flavorful. We ate till we were stuffed! The desserts were decent. Nothing too extravagant about them. I chose the chocolate mouse.
