what can I say but this was the perfect place to watch michael phelps bring in the last of his many golden medals. walking into Zed451, the crowd was heavily female (as all newer places tend to be until overrun by sausage which by all means I'd rather be there when the chorizo arrives even though I dont eat meat) nonetheless, the bamboo and sleek decor was very comfortable and the crowd was sophisticated chill sexy and good vibes. We had to put our name on a list and hold onto a beeper until we were notified when there was "room" on the rooftop deck to head upstairs. No problemo, we sat downstairs in the lounge, had a drink and watched Phelps go for some gold. it was quite crowded and everyone was hovering near the plasma TV on the wall by the bar...before we knew it the beeper we went off and out party of ten was finally allowed to the rooftop for some pleasant views (of the city and of men) and a really wonderful and manhattanesque type vibe (there are a lot of rootop lounges in NYC with sweeping views of the skyline) Although our skyline is no NYC, Zed451 did an awfully good job in turning its rootfop into an urban oasis with a chill and laid back sexy vibe. I wil be back for a drink and the views! Didnt try the food this time around but from what I hear it is pretty good but kinda brazilian bbq style so a vegetraian like me will probably not enjoy the cuisine so much but who needs food when you have a view!
