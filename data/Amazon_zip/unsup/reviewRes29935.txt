Third Coast has an old world appeal with the sunken dining room and warm rustic ambiance, you feel like it's winter in the middle of summer. The coffee is great, the atmosphere is chill and they have mouth watering alaskan king crab.. A great place to bring a book, enjoy a latte and not even realize where the day has gone.
