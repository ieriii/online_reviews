Honestly how can you go wrong here? Feel like posting a positive review for Ruth Chris is a big DUH. We searched for a non chain steakhouse but were coming up short on the quality steak experience we were craving. We absolutely loves our meal and wine here. We split a filet, 2 sides, and a bottle of wine and it was delicious. Also ran us $150 + tip. This isn't a Lonestar people. Excellent service! Also the booths on the bar side provide a nice view of the street and the in setting on the buildings.
