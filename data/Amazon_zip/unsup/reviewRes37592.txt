I don't often go to Fox and Obel to shop... it's usually for special items or occasions. But I do frequently eat at the in-store cafe for weekend breakfast. It's a real treat and the food is terrific. The staff is very efficient and polite. Go early to beat the tourists and large groups. That way you can relax at a table, read the paper and enjoy a full hot breakfast to start your day right.
