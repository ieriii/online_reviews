Spent the weekend here and it was great. Checked in at 3:00, our room was ready and after checking emails and catching up on a little bit of work, it was 5:30. Cocktail hour (or in this case...90 minutes) They have a room set up for free drinks and food every day at 5:30. Good stuff. My wife had the "Amalfitini" and I had a gin and tonic. Beefeaters Gin, better than what I had expected. Met a couple from Switzerland and had a great time talking over a few more drinks. We had a corner room with views of 3 different directions. Plenty of space and in the morning, there's a continental breakfast set up on each floor. This is great as you don't have to juggle coffee and a bagel in the elevator. Bellmen were nice and accomodating. It's in River North and close to so many restaurants and clubs. I highly recommend it.
