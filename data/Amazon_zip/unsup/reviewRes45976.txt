Not knowing this was a Cheesecake Factory owned restaurant, my first thought when I walked in here was, "Wow, this place looks exactly like Cheesecake Factory."  That's not necessarily a bad thing, though. This place is huge, with floor to ceiling windows overlooking Michigan Ave. As you can imagine, these are coveted seats. Food I had was decent and the prices are fair considering the decor and location. I'd like to try out other items on the menu. Service was good, too. Our waiter was friendly, attentive, and quick with the refills. I would really like to come back here for dinner, preferably with a date, and take advantage of the window seats.
