I love this place.Unfortunately I have a gluten/dairy allergy I recently learned of, so there isn't much I can eat here anymore. But when I could eat extreme amounts of gluten, this was the place for me. The sauces they top their pancakes are delectable! Beyond that their eggs benedict is also amazing. I always go to this place whenever I meet up with this certain friend I rarely see and it's always such a treat to look forward to. I highly recommend it. It's the best brunch/breakfast place I've ever been to.
