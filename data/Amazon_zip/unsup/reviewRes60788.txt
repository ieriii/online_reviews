First of all, can I just say one thing? This place is so SMALL. What a tiny bar! I was surprised. Their second level is about the size of a closet with only 3 tables. Luckily though, my friends and I snagged one of those tables on a crowded Saturday night (woo-hoo!)One of the waitress/servers was an absolute sweetheart! I didn't catch her name, but she had short dark hair and was always smiling (which is refreshing for a change! Most waitress' glare at you the second they walk up to your table as if trying to convey the "tough bar bitch" look). She was super-friendly! My girl friends & I weren't sure what to order since it was our first time there (the place just opened up that week too) so we asked her for suggestions and she was extremely helpful! I absolutely ADORE the fact that they play concerts on the large TV screens, but HOLY CRAP IS IT LOUD AS HELL IN THIS BAR! Haha. No kidding! I think my ears were ringing the next day. It was almost as if I actually went to one of the concerts they were playing on the screens. Pretty cool though. Bring ear plugs if you're a wussy ;) It's definitely not the right place if you're looking to have anything remotely close to "deep conversation" with your buddies as I'm pretty sure your voice will be hoarse trying to scream over the noise level. Last but not least, they played Motley Crue, baby!!! I love it. Just for that, I'm coming to Lockdown again for sure. Fantastic music.
