Made a reservation here with a group of friends for a pre-marriage girls night out (classier than a bachelorette party!) They went to seat us at a circle table in the low-ceiling seating area. There weren't enough seats for the 7 of us so when we got the maitre'd to take care of it--she put us at a more private larger area off to the side. We all liked the new choice. Reading other reviews I'd agree--i feel like it's lacking something cozy! The bottles of wine we got were delicious, and the cheese was great too! I split a Caesar Salad with my friend and it was plenty for the both of us and it was well-dressed. I ordered the vegetarian option, a pasta with vegetables and a yummy pesto. I thought it was tasty--my friend thought that the pasta was a little heavy. My friends were satisfied the mussels and the cauliflower soup. Short menu, lots of wine and cheese....good place to go, but didn't feel the umph.
