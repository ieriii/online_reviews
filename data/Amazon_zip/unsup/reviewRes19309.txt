I've eaten at The Gage a couple times and not been dissappointed. On my latest visit, my wife and I had lunch during Restaurant Week. I had the 3-course special and my wife had fish and chips. She took the mixed green salad that came with the special and I had a Scotch egg. A Scotch egg is a hard-boiled egg, surrounded by crumbled sausage, breaded, and deep fried. I'd been wanting to try this dish for awhile, and it was delicious! The salad with blue cheese, dried cherries, pecans, and honey balsamic vinigrette was tasty, but nothing out of the ordinary. For my entree, I chose the arctic char with marble potatos, celery, fennel, and cauliflower fume. This was a great piece of fish! The meat was moist & flavorful while the skin was crisp and delicate. The shaved fennel really added to the overall flavor of the fish. My wife's fish and chips were good. Moist pieces of cod in a light batter with very good fries, but no comparison to the arctic char. The only dessert for the special was a pistachio panna cotta. This was perfect! I love pistachio and if it's on the menu, I'm more than likely going to order it. It was moist & creamy and full of pitachio flavor. The best dessert I've had in a long time! The service was very good also. Drinks and water were refilled quickly and the waitress was very pleasant and friendly. The Manager even stopped by to make sure everything was going well. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend The Gage to anyone.
