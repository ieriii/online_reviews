I've stayed here twice, once for work and once on vacation. Overall it's a nice hotel with a great location and I would stay on future trips to Chicago. Here are the highlights: The Good: Lobby Bar There was a surprising amount of amusing antics in the lobby bar. It was great to sit back and watch people drop game, especially those that shouldn't be. It was packed Friday and Saturday night. Starbucks There was a line in the morning, but you can't beat the convenience of having one in the lobby (or one right across the street, or one two doors down.....) Location Walk out the back door, walk down Michigan Avenue...... Staff Nothing but great things to say about the staff. Everyone that we encountered was just fantastic The Bad: Elevators If you were on floors 29 on up (which we were) there was always a significant wait for the elevators. There was a bank of eight elevators servicing these floors, but only two were running. Someone told me that the staff claimed this was temporary, but I had the same issue on both visits, which were eight months apart. Street Noise Maybe I'm just a country bumpkin, but there sure was a lot of street noise coming up to the 37th floor. It may have just been our particular room, bu it seemed like the seals on our window weren't tight and a lot of outside noise was getting in. Overall it had been a good place to stay and I envision staying there again when I go back in September.
