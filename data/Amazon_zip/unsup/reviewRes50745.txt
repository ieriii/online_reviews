What happened here? After many return trips, Big Jones simply has not sustained itself. Something seems to get missed/screwed up every time we visit and last time the eggs benedict just tasted funky. I think it was the brioche which, instead of being light and airy, was soggy. Plus, the $6 cheddar/herb croquettes, which sounded yummy, came out looking like 3 mini corn-dogs; thick breading and way too brown. Yuck. And, they got rid of the shrimp and biscuits. We are done with Big Jones.
