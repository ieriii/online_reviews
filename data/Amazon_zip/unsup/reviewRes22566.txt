Everyone definitely needs to try Superdawg at least once in their life! I was a virgin-superdawger until last week when my boyfriend surprised me with a visit there. I was wondering why he didnt care to go out of the house wearing the nice khakis he wore to work paired with a ratty t-shirt and baseball hat. We had read about it in the book 1,000 places to see before you die ...funny that a hot dog stand made it in a book that has some of the world's most famous landmarks. It was certainly a little pricey -- for 2 superdawgs and 2 milkshakes, it was just under $20! (but they were damn good dogs). You would think for a meal like that it should have been about $10. But I suppose you pay for the fun atmosphere with waitress-to-car window service ...not to mention the dancing weiners on top of the restaurant.
