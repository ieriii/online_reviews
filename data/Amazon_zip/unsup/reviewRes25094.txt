Went 2 weeks ago and was looking for a great place to take my girlfriend with atmosphere and good food (not that finding either of those is a problem in this town ) I left very happy and this is why ..... My Wallet Wasn't Heavy Anymore!!! ....just kidding , love the way that the place just opens up when you climb the spiral stairs to the restaurant .The massive windows looking out at the park are impressive but i agree the etching thing is a bit off. The service was fantastic, polite and attentive .  We went with the Chefs Choice and You better be hungry because for Tapas it fills you up . choose to go with our servers choice on wine instead of the pairings and was he spot on. It was Lent so for my date we asked for a more seafood laden choice and were told "not a problem we would be glad to do it". Everything was perfect and the final dish was lobster for two ....WOW!!!!!!! we were stuffed . Dessert was excellent.       There are 2 down sides - Only bathroom requires you going thru the dining area back downstairs to the tiny lounge area (so what right) , and if you are not comfortable meeting new people your in trouble because this place is Packed Tight , try getting up from the booth area without moving entire table!!!! Considering the pedigree of the Executive Chef/Staff it should be what it is ...A place I will go to again and again
