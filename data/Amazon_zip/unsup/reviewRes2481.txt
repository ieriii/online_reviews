I waited almost 2 hours for my hot dog, and it was totally worth it. the rib-eye hot dog was delicious, and the duck fat fries were decadent. Surprisingly, although the wait for the hot dog is outrageous, once you get inside, there are plenty of seats. I suppose that makes sense since it doesn't take very long to scarf a hot dog. I would HIGHLY recommend Hot Doug's if you're a hot dog fanatic and are open minded to incredibly creative variations. If not, then there are better ways for you to spend 2 hours. oh, and i HATE when people whine about waiting more than an hr for a hot dog. You know this going in. if you're not willing to wait in line and make friends with your fellow hot dog fanatics, go home.
