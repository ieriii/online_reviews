Apparently this is where Spoken Word and Poetry Slams got started. Try telling that to the manager. Within 5 mins. we had been insulted by three staff people and my husband had to speak to the manager outside. They do not take poetry slam seriously--everything is a joke here--they constantly laugh about everything and the slammers are actually just jokesters/ pranksters, so don't waste your time. I tried to tell the Manager about Cafe Nuba in Denver or other well known Poetry Slam places we've been in Seattle, L.A. and New York and she clearly didn't give a shit. She actually said to me, "maybe when I retire, I'll go there", anyway, don't waste your money or your time here if you're looking for good poetry slam, you'll be disappointed.
