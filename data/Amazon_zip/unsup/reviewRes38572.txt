Oh, the ooey gooey goodness of steaming hot cheese! I ordered a small special that included, crumbled sausage, mushrooms, green peppers, and sweet onions. The pie is presented on a riser set at eye level just for you to marvel at this simple, yet perfect culinary creation. As I am being served the first slice I am getting excited about what is in store for my tastebuds.The slightly tart smelling sauce teased my senses. I take my first bite and close my eyes savoring the explosion of flavors filling my mouth. The best part was the crispy crust. It had a hint of cornmeal and light taste of olive oil. The staff was very friendly and helpful. My only waning is it takes 45 mins for you ZA so don't order the deep dish if you are in a hurry.
