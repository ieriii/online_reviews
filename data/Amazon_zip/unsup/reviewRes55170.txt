Ordered the q2 as a take out for lunch and it was simply fabulous. The prices are reasonable and I am looking forward to going to dinner there soon. Enjoyed the different sauces as well as the pickles. The ribs were a good size and smoked perfectly. We ordered the pulled pork and it was excellent as well. Did not like the coleslaw--will try the fries next time.
