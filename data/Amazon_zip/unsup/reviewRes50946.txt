Excellent and creative. Those are the 2 words I would use to describe dinner at Big Jones. It's unique and delicious. The spicy pork small plate is divine and the shrimp and grits were fab. Between the 3 people dining with me, there were a couple of so-so plates including the cod in curry sauce and picollo dish which is entirely vegan. If it weren't for those "blah" moments, I would have thrown out 5 stars. Great food, great service, lovely atmosphere.
