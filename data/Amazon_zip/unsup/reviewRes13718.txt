I've lived in Chicago for a while now, but I only ventured into Logan Square for the first time last night to meet up with a friend-of-a-friend sort of thing. I really didn't know what to expect of this neighborhood or bar. The bar was impressively decorated in an industrial/loft style. It was brightly lit for a bar, but it worked. The wood bar was long and spacious, so even though the place was packed, we didn't feel crowded. Revolution had an impressive beer selection that made me wish I liked beer. For us non-beer drinkers of the world, they had a nice selection of cocktails. We'd gone there after dinner, so we didn't try the food, but many items looked intriguing enough for me to want to return. Perhaps I can offer a more useful review after my next trip - for now, I'll give it 4stars based on atmosphere and drinks.
