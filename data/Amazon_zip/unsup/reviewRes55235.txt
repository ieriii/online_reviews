Well, I went to Fogo de Chao for lunch today. I believe Fogo de Chao loosely translates from Portuguese to campfire in English.The food is excellent. Keep your disk to green and the meat is non-stop. The hostess was excellent and the manager introduced himself to ensure everything was alright.I thoroughly enjoyed the lamb chops. Each slice of beef I requested was medium and cooked perfectly.I would highly suggest going during the lunch hours.Cost per person with tip included was two shy of $50.
