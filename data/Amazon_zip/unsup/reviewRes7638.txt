I promised a friend she could write this review, but until then I will use this space to rave: I HAD THE BEST EXPERIENCE HERE AND ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT!!!! I lost a bet with Susan (the deadbeat who has yet to write this review, although you could hardly call our bet a fair wager), so I told her I'd take her here since I had the coupon for 2 4-course meals for $65. Yes, like everyone else I was suspicious, but was assured by fellow yelpers. I'm so glad we went. We made reservations (I hate when restaurants don't let you make a reservation) and were able to secure a seat outside. Although the tables are REALLY close to the road, its a relatively quiet street. The wine was merlot, not normally my favorite, but it was delicious! The bruchetta was amazing, fresh and crisp. House salad was good, but I was trying to save room for the main course. I ordered the truffle filled ravioli, which was a bit rich, but by the the time I got to the main course,I didn't have much room left for it. The tiramisu was on par, but could have had a little more espresso flavor. Overall, we had great service, great food, and great atmosphere. A highly recommend everyone go, whether you are with a good friend, significant other, or large group I'm sure you will enjoy it!!
