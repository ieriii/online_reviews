I am not much a fan of chain restaurants but my sister booked this before our theatre show at Goodman because it is within walking distance. Let's start with the bad, valet parking was bad, it took over 15 mins to get our car at the end of our dinner. Not good. But everything else was excellent. The table for 19 right in the middle of the main dining room was impressive. Service was prompt after we told them we had a theatre engagement. Crab cake and steaks were all excellent. so were the sides and wild salmon. The 4 bottles of Antinori was reasonably price also. I really have nothing negative to say. Highly recommended.
