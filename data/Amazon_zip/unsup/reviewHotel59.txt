Oh man - where to start? Well, I saw a funny review on Orbitz which expresses my sentiments perfectly, so here's an excerpt... "The Inn at Lincoln Park is located in one of Chicago's trendiest neighborhood and yet, the hotel itself does not live up to ... its surroundings. The comforter on the bed looked old and a bit worn and perhaps it was the combination of humidity that made me not want to take my shoes off... Oh, and I didn't feel comfortable sitting on the toilet seat without first covering it with toilet paper... When was the last time they cleaned that bathroom? On the plus side, I found the front desk staff to be very helpful and genuinely concerned about my comfort. It's in an EXCELLENT location and I felt very safe in the neighborhood. With that in mind, one night was enough for me." So in summary: Pros: * location - lots of shops and food (the walgreens on the corner is closed right now though) * pleasant staff - very accommodating and helpful in my experience Cons: * the rooms - small, uncomfortable, and not clean I don't like to be too negative, so will leave it at that. Keep in mind that you're paying half or a third of the cost of a nice hotel, so you get what you pay for. If you've stayed in hostels through europe in your youth and can still stand it, this place is fine. So I'd say this is the right place if all you care about is having a bed to sleep on and would spend as little time as possible inside the room. I never realized I had become a hotel snob until I stayed here, so the Inn at Lincoln Park will always have a place in my heart. Somewhere in the back/bottom...
