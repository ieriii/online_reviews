I've gone here twice, and both times it was great. I'm vegetarian and have tried pretty much every vegetarian item on the menu, and I can honestly say they've all been great. The only con is that this place is crazy busy, however both times I've gone, I've been seated quickly. Great addition to the neighborhood!
