Schwa is definitely a rarity in these day, a high end restaurant run by iconoclasts who refuse to change. There will be no recipe books, television shows, Schwa Cafes, Schwa To Go, or Schwa frozen foods at whole foods. There also will not be servers, or anything remotely like your typical restaurant service. What will you will get at Schwa is an amazing meal served by the people who produced it. You will be told the story of each dish by those who made the dish. You will sit in a small, intimate setting where you will know that you will be taken care of. The chefs of Schwa care about the food to a degree that you will only find in the other top restaurants in the city. The dishes are too numerous to discuss each in detail, but I want to discuss a couple of them. The first dish that really blew my mind was the apple pie soup which was a thick, creamy concoction that was both apple and savory; the soup was in of itself almost a meal - my wife joked that it could easily take the place of a Thanksgiving meal. The other dish was a plate consisting of one single egg-quail ravioli that was so creamy and rich only one was needed (I couldn't imagine even eating more than one.) The menu changes so your experience will be different than mine, but regardless of the menu - you will have a great experience. Some things you will need to keep in mind. One - don't expect a quick return call for reservations - it might take a month or so (or not). Two - Schwa is BYOB - bring a good selection of reds and whites; they will take the wine in the back and pour what they feel will pair with the food. Have fun.
