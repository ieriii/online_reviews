The #1 reason to come here is the outdoor dining area. Once you step outside, you'll forget that you are just minutes from the Loop. High walls and lots of trees almost completely disguise the busy city intersection, leaving just a sliver of skyscrapers and sky showing above the wooden fence. Food here is good, sometimes even excellent - but once you've have the peach salad or the porchetta sandwich, you wonder why everything isn't that good - because the kitchen is clearly capable. I'll be back for the lasagna bolognese, but will skip some other dishes that seemed bland or uninteresting by comparison (pizza with prosciutto, pork milanese). The special that day, tagliatelle with salmon, tomatoes and olives, was a failure of great ingredients, but mis-matched flavors. Still, I'll come back, even if I have to order carefully, just to experience the outdoor dining area again.
