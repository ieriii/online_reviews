Went here last month to celebrate a friend's promotion and also as our innagural Supper Club monthly meal. The decor in the restaurant is amazing and valet parking is only $5. As far as the meal was concerned, we ordered the ceviche and cheese tastings to start-- we did all five for each. I couldn't pick a favorite cheese as they were all delicious but I did discover that eating honey with a cheese can really compliment or balance out it's pungent flavor. The Escolar ceviche was my favorite and I'm not even sure what escolar is! We also ordered the Sopes de Pato which were quite delicious as well. As for the main course, our table of 4 split two entrees, the Churrasco and the Costilla de Res. The Churrasco was cooked perfectly and the herb chimmicurri was TO DIE. The Costilla de Res is a braised short rib. The meat was so soft and melted in your mouth, while the polenta was delightfully cheesy. My friend who had never had polenta before declared, "These are the best mashed potatoes I've ever had!" Since we were celebrating a promotion, we decided to go all out for dessert. Unfortunately, I forgot the name of what we ordered but it was the most expensive dessert and HUGE. It was cotton candy in a glass filled with caramel popcorn, cinnamon flan, chocolate cake and a ginormous plantain sundae. Yum.
