My husband and I went to Longman & Eagle on a Saturday afternoon when we were in the city looking for a good brunch place for some good eats. We went around 1 PM in the afternoon and was told that there would be about a 20 minute wait. While we waited, we sat at the bar. My husband had a virgin Bloody Mary, and I had their Mimosa. Their Mimosas were quite tasty. The Bloody Mary was a bit thick due to the lack of alcohol, but pretty tasty. I did notice that the bartender was going heavy on the alcohol on the Bloody Mary's that were being ordered.  We got seated and had a super cool waitress. She was chill and gave us some good recommendations. I had the Chicken and Waffles. He had the Croque Madame with Fries, and we shared the Grits. My husband's made me instant grits before with salt, pepper, and some cheese. I didn't really care for them, but our waitress said that these would be the best grits ever. She was soo right!!! These grits were cheesy and crunchy - probably one of the best things I've eaten in a while where I drool thinking about it. My Chicken and Waffles was well seasoned, nice crunchy coat, tender chicken, and fluffy waffles. The Croque Madame was good, but the fries were the best part! I'm not sure what they put in their fries or grits, but it keeps me wanting more.  TDLR; Food was out of this world good, service was good, definitely going back again.
