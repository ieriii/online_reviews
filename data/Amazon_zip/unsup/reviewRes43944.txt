Anytime I'm excited about trying a place, I always end up disappointed. I need to remind myself more often to NOT get excited. The Good: $25-3 course prix fixe -started with the bacon, potato, leek soup: pretty good but a little thin. But then again it's really hard to make potatoes and bacon taste bad. -side salad: REALLY average, very heavily dressed -10oz New York Strip: Just such a boring piece of steak. It's too lean and so even medium rare sucked all the juice out of the meat. It was a little better after I asked for a side of more jus. The side of mac &cheese was really rich and the baked bread crumbs gave it some extra crunch-crunch -chocolate cake: really good, dense and rich. -pumpkin cheesecake: also really dense and rich. Literally tasted like if pumpkin pie and cheesecake had a preemie. It tasted fine, but seemed a little underdeveloped. -bottle of malbec: helped everything out A LOT I gave it an extra star because of the super nice service. Our server was very friendly and attentive. He wouldn't even let my bf refill our wine glasses. I would definitely come again but only if they weren't serving NY strip. Or if someone wealthy was paying and I can order a $40 piece of steak.
