My old roommate reviewed this place, (Katie S if you're curious). Anyway I'll skip over repeating the exact same things she said but yes the experience was simply okay. A few menu items, like the po' boy I had appeared, a bit on the pricey side for what I was consuming.  Although I do believe my companion got her money's worth viewing the size of her fish. Prices for their various fish related items range anywhere between 18-25+ dollars at dinner time. All in all it was a good experience, nothing to write home about but I might go again if I'm in the neighborhood.
