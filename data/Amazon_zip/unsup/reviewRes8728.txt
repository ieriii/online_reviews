I have been eating here for a long time, since the days it was a small place ran by an old man. The food is always consistently excellent here. Better quality than most Persian restaurants in the city. My favorite include, shrimp curry is great. Their Jenjeh, kubided or Kupta, Kapta are great. You can tell they used high quality ground meat to make these. Fish is about on par with Reza. The lamb shank is also great here. I don't normally give 5 stars, but this one deserves it.
