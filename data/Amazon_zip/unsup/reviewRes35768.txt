I went to Shaw's for the Oyster Bar with my fiancee before our dinner date at a restaurant down the street. Great fun atmosphere, as an oyster bar should be. I have to give it only three stars at this point because I don't like oysters and we didn't try anything else! But I will definitely be back for lunch or dinner and try one of their other wonderful sounding dishes. Then I'll reevaluate my review. But even if you don't like oysters (and someone with you does) head over there to hang out, its still fun. And if you do like oysters, I'm sure you will love it, as my fiancee did!
