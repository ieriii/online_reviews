Oh Sultan's! The falafel sandwich is the best that I've had within city limits. I love that they put hummus on the sandwich and that you have the option to have it mild or spicy. I am not the biggest fan of their Jerusalem salad and feel that it makes the sandwich too soggy when they slop on too much. It does happen that if you go there during a slower time you will end up with cold and dried falafel but when the falafel is good, it's really good. I'm also a big fan of their lentil soup, it's blended and spiced to perfection! Ever since their renovation, I can't help but feel serious confusion every time I look at the seven holes in which you have throw away your garbage, recyclables, etc. I definitely recommend this place to anyone who is looking for cheap and affordable Mediterranean food.
