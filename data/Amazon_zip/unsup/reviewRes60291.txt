First brunch at Milk & Honey this Sunday, finally braved the line and was happy we did. Huevos Rancheros in a casserole was divine, oatmeal pancakes with blueberries and peaches sublime and delicious iced green tea. The thing that impressed was the consistency of the food coming out of a busy Sunday brunch kitchen; every dish looked the same. High quality is only as good as the consistency, and Milk and Honey must be taking good care of their kitchen staff because you need happy employees to put out high volume, high quality, consistent dishes that look beautiful and taste great.
