I wouldn't know if the dogs were good because I never got to try them. We left the Cubs/Dbacks game at Wrigley Field and hopped on CTA buses to get there from the game. We had been PLANNING on eating at HOT DOUGS for months and we couldn't wait. It was about to close for two weeks for vacation and we knew it was our only chance. The traffic was rough and the bus was at a stand still so we walked. We arrived at the door and saw PEOPLE EATING inside. They wouldn't let us in cuz they were about to close. It was FOUR IN THE AFTERNOON!!!  The guy at the door was total vinegar and water type, Wouldn't let me and my lady in to try. I even told him I was from outta town and that I had delays on mass transit. The fact that I was from outta town made him even more of a rhymes like Mick. We got back on mass transit and missed out on HOT DOUGS. THANKS!!!
