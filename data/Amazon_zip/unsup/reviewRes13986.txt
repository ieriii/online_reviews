there was a big range of goodness and badness here. came here for brunch with the boyf and we got pork belly with watermelon, biscuits and pancetta gravy, and the breakfast from scratch. the pork belly appetizer was amazing. spicy and crispy, offset by the watermelon and zing added by the pickled watermelon rind. that was incredibly good. my biscuits and gravy were also fantastic. flaky, fluffy biscuits swimming in a sea of delicious gooey-ness with and egg. as far as yummy, hearty brunches go, this tops the list. a less good thing was the breakfast from scratch. it wasn't bad but it wasn't impressive. i was really excited to try the sage-ginger sausage. it was good but not sage-y or gingery enough to deserve its name. the potatoes were good, but nothing special, as were the eggs. what was special about that though was the jam that came with it. it was tangy and not too sweet and it tasted fresh and just a little green. that was very tasty. the thing that tips my 3.5-star opnion down is that service. our appetizer came out at the same time as the food, which i think could have been avoided by waiting to put in the check for the food. we were checked up on maybe once and it just wasn't very welcoming. maybe i'd come back to try some beer or popcorn since that's what they're known for, but it'd have to be at the insistence of others in a group.
