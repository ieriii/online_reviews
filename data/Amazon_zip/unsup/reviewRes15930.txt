My daughter had wanted to go here for quite some time. We decided to take her there for her graduation dinner from High School. The food was wonderful and we would definitely go back for it. However, our waiter was terrible. It took forever to get our first drink and our second drink did not arrive until the end of our meal. We had the manager come over to ask if we needed anything. We told her we would like to see the wine menu. After that was delivered, it took too much time to order, much less receive our drinks. We will give it a try one more time and hope for better service. I would have given them 5 stars if it was not for the service.
