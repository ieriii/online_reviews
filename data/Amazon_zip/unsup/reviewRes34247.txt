Jeez! call off the dogs, the search is over!!!! This is the BEST resturant in Chicago. Cheap, Fast, Unique and Delish! The falafel sandwich is a meer $3.25 with tax and its just amazingly great. Homemade, great music, fun setting, and great location. If you haven't tried this people, please please do!!!!
