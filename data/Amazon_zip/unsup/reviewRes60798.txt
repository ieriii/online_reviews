I used to work in this building before it was a bar. HUGE RENOVATION! tons of lcd tv's. Great concept of having recorded shows from all over the globe being played (when the hawks aren't in the playoffs that is).Menu is simple and well done. Burger guy/gals paradise. Gumball bear always seems to be on special which i cannot complain about. Definitely a lot better than all the other miller lite specials and bud light specials everywhere else. We went in there on a sat afternoon. wasnt packed and were able to sit right down at the bar. My gf and i got the mac and cheese to split and each got a burger. Outstanding!!!! we sat there eating and drinking for 3+ hours and only ended up spending $50. we were taken care of and even the owner came up and bought us a shot on the house. Not something that happens the first time you walk into a bar/grill for the first time. Definitely will be going back especially once it warms up - if it ever does - so the windows can be opened up and listen to some more great music that isn't topping the billboard what have you done for me lately charts!
