I can't imagine how this place doesn't have a five star average. The food is out of this world. The buffalo sweetbreads made me close my eyes and MOAN. Oh yes, moan. Don't even get me started on the doughnuts. Holy foodgasms, Batman. The wait on a Saturday night was long, but we were able to snag a bar spot and ordered food there. The bartenders were helpful, friendly, and made the best whiskey sour I've ever had (I'm not really a whiskey drinker but hey, when in Rome). If you go in there with the understanding that you're going to have to wait, the food will be worth it. I wish they had more space, and REALLY wish hey took reservations, but what can you do? I'll be back.
