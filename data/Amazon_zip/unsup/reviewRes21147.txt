I DON"T eat hot dogs.   But I ate a SuperDawg. And was glad I did. I DON'T usually dine in the car.   But I spun some 50s golden oldies while the car hop waitress loaded my tray on my car side.  How was the dog? Super. Loaded to the top. Great flavor. Fun, especially in the car with the tray on the side. Loved the 50's call boxes. Not so great: fries. Crinkle standard 50s frozen. eeehh would pass on next time. middle of the road: shake. Decent. Solid. Nothing out of the ballpark. Wouldn't do often, but will repeat for special family night out treat. TIP: Green pickles, get extra (lovely sour flavor) Put fries on the side vs all over the top.
