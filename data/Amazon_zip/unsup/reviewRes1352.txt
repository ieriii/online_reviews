Hot Doug's? Jesus Christ! THIS is awesome! Kinda, sorta built out of the old neighborhood south of gordon Tech high School and smack in the middle of nothing is this oasis. Pure genius to be appreciated while it's here! Not a dog joint for the neighborhood wino who needs something cheap and stupid: a true challenge to everything we know as hot dog culture and an amazing experience... and yeah, the lines are worth it. Get creative; you can't possibly regret trying this place!
