I've been to Piece a few times now during the winter months, and I'm holding out on giving them that elusive 5th star until I try their Spring/Summer brews. Our server Nora was awesome and made me not want to wait for when the hefeweizen is brewed. I love Chicago style pizza, but Piece knows how to make a great thin crust pizza! I do wish that they would offer pineapple as a topping, but I can't fault them because the rest of their offerings are awesome! The beer was delicious! I had the superfluous triple and one of my friends had the dunklewizen (the hefeweizen's darker cousin). Both were very tasty and I could definately see myself getting their Sunday special someday soon - $25 for a large pizza and growler?!!! You really can't go wrong! It was crowded when we went, but I guess that's what you get for going at 2pm on a Sunday afternoon. There was absolutely no where to stand while we waited for a table, and unfortunately we kept getting in the servers way. I totally would have gone out side to wait for a table but already haven gotten a beer made that impossible. I'll be back for sure!
