Mmmm so good! I ordered the traditional Icosium crepe with chicken. It was really delicious. At first, I didn't think that one crepe would fill me up but it did. It came with potato's on the side which were really good too. At first I was going to take it to go but then saw how nice the atmosphere was...it is very decorative, intimate, and quiet...you wouldn't think it was from the outside. If you get a seat by the window, it's a good people watching view. The server was friendly and the service was quick.
