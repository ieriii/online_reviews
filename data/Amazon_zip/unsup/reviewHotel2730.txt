I stayed at The James for the first time earlier this year. I booked a room through a promotion where rooms were $125 and we received $100 in food credits! I was expecting the hotel to be a bit budget to provide such a crazy deal but was very pleasantly surprised.  I travel about 1-2 weeks a month and am always looking for well-designed and comfortable hotels. Basically I look for hotels that don't remind me I am on the road! I was impressed with the overall service of The James, cleanliness of the rooms, comfort of the bed, Kiehl's products (yay!), deliciousness of food (Prime is a great steak house, the room service menu comes from Prime as well) and location. I went back to The James for a second time (this time not on the promotion) to see if the first experience was just a fluke - but it wasn't! They have a large gym with many cardio equipment options and a fantastic spa. Dawn is a great masseuse. I also love the access to printers and an easy and open business "center". Both my trips have been for business and I look forward to going back to Chicago and staying at The James again. I see they are opening a hotel in NY as well....
