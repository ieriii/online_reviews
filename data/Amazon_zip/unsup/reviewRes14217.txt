Holy. Cow. My husband is from Daytona Beach, Florida, so when it comes to Cubanos, which rate up in his top 3 favorite foods of all time, he "knows what he likes". Which has been a whole lot of nothing, up until we tried 90 Miles. It was my first experience with Cuban, but we both came to a consensus that HOT DAWG that was good food. I did the whole "eat until your belly almost hurts" thing. We tried an order of the sweet, and of the savory fried plantains, and while I preferred the savory (like the best pub fry EVER) the sweet was also delicious. HIGH, High, High props and recommendations for 90 Miles
