This is probably the best restaurant in the city to go to with a group of about four people. The food is always extremely good with large portions and I was surprised to see that they don't rip people off on the beer prices (Ayinger Brau-Weiss for $4). Definitely go here on Monday nights for the $12.95 full slab of ribs special...falls off the bone and comes with a side of spaghetti and a soup or salad. This is an old school place that still knows how to take care of people, feels like an expensive restaurant but doesn't act like one.
