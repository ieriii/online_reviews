I'm not sandwich person..and not particularly big on mexican food either -- but I love the food network so came here to try out Bayless' joint. It's not what I expected and oh so tasty! One complaint though -- XOCO should use some serious process improvement. They don't let you get food to go and have the strangest ordering process. You get in line to order (usually a 30+ min wait), but then food is delivered to your table by a huge staff. The register is a huge bottleneck with lines out the door while several tables are open at any one point. Strange. We waited about 30 min and ordered: Ahgoda ($9.5) - Carnitas sandwich with pickled onions and peppers. The sandwich sits in a bowl of spicy/tangy tomatoe broth. Made my nose run, but it's so zangy and appetizing -- Highly recommended! Pepito ($12) - Braised shortribs meat with pickled jalapenos and onions and melted jack. Meat is great, but very similar to a philly cheese, but...smaller. No soup to dunk it in, so can be dry. Classic Hot Chocolate ($3) - Even you dont come in to eat b/c the long line sucks, I suggest at least getting a chocolate to go! It's not "hot chocolate" as much as it's melted chocolate. It's almost like hot chocolate pudding. So rich, so thick...so good. Chocolate Cafe con Leche ($4.25) - basically a mocha. As good as their hot chocolate, but for those feening caffeine. Churros ($3 for 3) - Goes perfect with the chocolate.  Soup isnt served until 3pm, but came at 2:30 but stayed long enough to see others order it -- looks absolutely delicious. Must try it next time!
