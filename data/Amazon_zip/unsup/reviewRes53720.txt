If you wanna put an encased piece of meat in your body, this is the place to start.Likes: There is an excellent selection of creative sausages that are priced fairly, and served quickly. The fries are good for what they are (the fresh cut variety often get greasier and it makes my aging stomach angry). Dislikes: There are several, hence the 3 stars. It is located in a pretty inconvenient spot for people sans cars, and the hours are so limited that there is always a long line to place your order. It's hard to imagine a well established business like Hot Doug's still only accepting cash.  Many neighborhood places do it so that they can avoid city taxes (which are disproportionately high for small businesses), but this just seems like hard-headedness. If you have a couple of hours (like when people are in from out of town) Hot Dougs is worth the wait. Unfortunately, that condition rarely applies to me.
