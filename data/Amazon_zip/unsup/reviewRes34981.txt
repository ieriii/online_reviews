It should be known that I have absolutely no complaints about the quality of the food at Shaw's. The waitstaff was very friendly and agreeable--they even moved us to a booth halfway through our visit. If there was any disappointment, however, then it definitely lies within the portions. We both expected to order the lobster roll, but when we asked the waitress about the sizes of the roll, she disgustingly exaggerated its size. We were expecting a massive, nearly impossible to finish sandwich, and she said it would be ideal for sharing, if one ordered the lobster roll, and the other ordered another entree. When our food arrived (the lobster roll and the Alaskan sauteed halibut), we were severely disappointed by the sizes of our dishes. The size of the lobster roll was terribly mediocre, and the cut of halibut was embarrasingly small. When it comes to the appetizers, we were expecting to split a loster cocktail, and when asked about the sizes, she said it was very dainty, and we would probably be better off ordering our own. It was small, yes, but it probably would have been enough for two people. Delicious? Yes. But you'd be better off filling up on bread before your food arrives. And definitely not worth the price.
