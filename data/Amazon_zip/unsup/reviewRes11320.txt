I can't bring myself to a full 5 stars,I generally reserve those for the Spago's of the world, so I will stick with my guns and give The Bongo Room a 4.5. It was delicious, it was quick & friendly service, it exceeded my expectations. I am so glad to have found a brunch spot that satisfies my desire for perfectly delectable meals!! With the help of yelpers, I opted for the Chocolate Tower French Toast, and was not only pleased but floored by the "yumminess"! It was moist, not overly powerful chocolate flavors and paired with the right amount of melt in your mouth banana sauce goodness. The BF had the original Egg Benedict and was also severely pleased. We have been scoring the country looking for the perfect EB- as in the last year we have lived in LA, Boston, DC and now Chicago. Well he has finally found his match! To counter what others have said of the price and waits......sure, you can expect to wait over a half hour at peak times on the weekend and sure you pay $30 for 2 including tax and tip. But- so what!! I can't believe there are people complaining about a few measly dollars. This city will shell out $50 for a over cooked steak a la carte- but cant give a well prepared, well thought pancake or egg delicacy $11 of decency!! Anywho, off my soapbox. You can be sure that we will be back for a second, third and fourth round of The Bongo Room.
