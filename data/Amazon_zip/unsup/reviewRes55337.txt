I went to Nazareth Sweets to buy baklava, so I decided to stop here to buy dinner. I ordered the lamb kabobs and a small order of hummus. The food was very delicious and filling. But I do think it's overpriced by a buck or two. The dill rice is great, and you're given enough to feed two or three people. Although it seemed to be more of a carry-out place, I will definitely try this place again. I'd write more, but I'm too stuffed. :)
