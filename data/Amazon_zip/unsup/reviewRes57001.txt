Friday, September 17th - No reservation - 8:00PM arrival. Was quoted a 30 minute wait time, assured the pager was working at the 45 minute mark, and finally was seated at the 1:20 minute mark. People with reservations seemed to be waiting more than 20 minutes past their reservation time. Server splashed hot oil all over my fiancee when he quickly set down one of the pork dishes. Server was inattentive, as we used the same plate the entire meal and only received attention when it was time for the check. The meat was overly salted, and not generally as flavorful as usual. The restrooms both had dirty water stains on the floor, full waste baskets, and few remaining towels. Normally this place does well, but for some reason it was extremely disappointing this night. The other nearby steakhouses are much more consistent, so we have chosen to not return to this location.
