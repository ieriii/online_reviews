Wow, AWESOME. This place catapulted to the top of my "favorite pizza in Chicago, and consequently, the world" list with my inaugural visit there last weekend. Sauce is great. Crust is great. Toppings are great. Setting is great (Painting of GANDALF in the bathroom?! Saying "You Shall Not Piss!"? Awesome!). I cannot say anything else that hasn't been said about it. Just go. Take the bus, take your car, take a taxi... it's worth it!
