The eight of us sat at the communal table. Family style dining is encouraged by the waitstaff. I thought this worked better for smaller groups. We ended up doing four and four. Portion size like tapas. I enjoy everything but I can't really give a thorough review as I just got to taste a couple of tablespoon size portions per plate. What did stand out for me was the roasted beets. Now that was memorable.
