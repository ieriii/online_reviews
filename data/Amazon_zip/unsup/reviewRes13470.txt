Seafood lovers will get so excited over the menu! Tons of options and all well prepared. I've been for dinners, lunches, and brunches. Something for everyone and all packed with flavor. The wait can be a drag but there is one for a reason- it is good! If you can get in on Tuesday nights for all you can eat crab DO IT! Excellent quality, there is a slight delay in refilling your plate but that is because it is made fresh, worth it!
