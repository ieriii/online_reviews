Staff and service are wonderful. Food is really well done. I had the crab Benedict once. (skip it) Crowds can be annoying. The place is somewhat tight. Don't be surprised if the person next to you is having a long/loud cellphone conversation next to you. This happened to me twice, while having breakfast there.
