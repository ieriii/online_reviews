My husband and I just returned from the IRCE Convention in Chicago and we visited Yolk on Sunday (June 13 '10) for brunch. The crowds outside could be seen from blocks away and we knew we were in for a long wait. We waited for close to an hour but it was worth it since the food was great! The inside is pretty and bright and I had a really wonderful omelet. My husband had french toast that was the best we ever ate - it was filled with cream cheese and it came with fruit and berries. Just amazing! My only complaint was that my decaf was always cold but still good and the place was jam packed. Would def recommend it!
