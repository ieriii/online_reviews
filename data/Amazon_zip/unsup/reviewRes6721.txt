2-1/2 stars. I really don't get the hype. While I am not a huge fan of BBQ, I was hoping to be won over by Chicago Q after reading such good review. However, that was not the case.  The chips and pickles are a really nice touch and the sauces are delicious. BUT-- I do not like the idea of competition BBQ where you put the sauces on yourself. I got the brisket and it was very difficult to eat. The bread was dry especially with the lack of sauce. The brisket was chopped into squares which made the sandwich impossible to eat. The mac and cheese was nothing to write home about. The cornbread was good but dry. The sweet cornbread was definitely the better than the savory. The positive things: the decor is really cute and it's cool that it is in a house and located in a great area. Unfortunately, I will not be coming back here.
