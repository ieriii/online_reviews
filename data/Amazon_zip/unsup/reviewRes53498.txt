Tru was the best combination of excellent food and incredible service. We went there to celebrate a birthday, and the staff made it a memorable and special event. In addition to the extreme attention to detail, the staff was welcoming and friendly. While expensive, I would definitely recommend Tru because I felt the food and service were superior to other fine dining establishments. I enjoyed the experience much more than Everest, and maybe even Alinea.
