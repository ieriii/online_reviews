This place came highly recommended but with a warning that the wait times could be long. This was true on both ends. With a group of 7, we knew it'd be a while wait on a Saturday night with the line curling outside the door. Having not made reservations anywhere, we figured that we may as well just stick it out, especially once they offered that we could sip beer or wine as we waited. The food was well worth the wait. We got the chips and guac and I think I can say that it was the best, most flavorful guacamole I have ever had. And it wasn't even close. The tortas were amazing. Packed with flavor and so satisfying. It was a ton of food and I couldn't finish. We topped it off with the churros and chocolate shot. The food was just fantastic. The wait is long, but go with some friends to keep you company and just enjoy it.
