I'd been waiting to go here as I heard it was fabulous northeastern style pizza here in Chicago. It's a casual and clean atmosphere with a minimalist brewery-restaurant type feel. Our server was really cool and friendly. They have a great selection of beers including Trumer Pils. But I need to come back for another experience... I was with two vegetarians so we go a spinach and jalapeno pizza. The water from the spinach made the pizza soggy and sloppy. Next time I'm getting a classic pepperoni pizza to get a real taste.
