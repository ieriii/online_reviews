We have been to Frontera a few times. Normally the service and food is great. This time the service was awful and the food was ok, not Bayless-worthy in my book! We sat outside. Any request we made to the waiter was forgotten; hubby's second beer, a request for a price on the specials, OUR FOOD! We waited over 45 minutes between our appetizer and our entree. I asked to see the manager, she said she would check on the time (what?) she came back and CORRECTED me on the time. She said "it says 32 minutes in the kitchen". She admitted it was too long though. NOW SEE HERE... I'm pretty anal: I looked at my watch when they cleared our appetizers and it was 45 Minutes before we got our entrees. I'm not sure when the kitchen starts their "timing"... but it was very tacky to correct me. The saving grace was that she took 3 of our entrees off the bill, BUT THAT WASN'T THE POINT!!! We were tired, hungry, and not happy by the time we were eating. It was not enjoyable. We have another reservation in July. I'll update this review to see if they have fixed their problems!
