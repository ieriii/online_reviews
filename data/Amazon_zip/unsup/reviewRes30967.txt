We dined recently at Mastro's in Chicago and despite the fierce competition in the universe of high-quality high-priced steakhouses, Mastro's in my humble opinion sits at or very near the top of the pile! Some highlights of our meal: 1. My wife had a Cosmo and I had a margarita. While the price was very high ($18), we each had a shaker in which the drinks came in that essentially contained two large drinks (shaken, not stirred, Mr. Bond). 2. My wife had wonderful French Onion soup and I had the house salad, which honesty was large enough for a regiment (or at least a company) . 3. I had the large bone-in filet, which was absolutely wonderful. My wife ordered the petite which was still quite generous. It was one of the best steaks I have ever had (slightly behind the large porterhouse at Doe's Eat Place in Greenville, Mississippi--but like most people, I get to Chicago a lot more than Greenville, MS!) Already stuffed, I foolishly ordered a dessert (a very rich chocolate pudding cake). If I was not in a hotel, I think I would have just brought it all home. We had eaten previously at the Mastro's in Scottsdale, AZ, and had a similar great meal. If you go, make sure you are very hungry and your credit card is well shy of its limit!
