I went to dinner last night with a couple old roommates... and by "old roommates" I mean my mom and brother... for a night-before birthday dinner. I can honestly say I wasn't disappointed. I had the fillet medallions Oscar - succulent would sum it up! Tender pieces of fillet Mignon covered with lump crab meat and asparagus - delicious! Great staff, wonderful wine, and the cute little cake with a candle - lovely! I'll most definitely be back, because I don't think it's possible for this restaurant to serve ANYTHING bad!
