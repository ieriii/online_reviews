The fried chicken is delish! The korean bbq sauce is addictive and sweat-inducing. It might be a little pricier than fast food chicken, but hey, you get what you pay for. Considering the quality of the food, this place is a bargain. And confirming what everyone else here has said about how nice the owner is (and the other employees). It's clear this restaurant is knocking themselves out to get it right. I wonder if they could be BYO? Having a cold beer with the Wacky Wings would be tops. It's the only thing missing.
