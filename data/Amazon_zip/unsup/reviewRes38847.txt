An amazing selection of spirits. A nice ambiance. Not open for lunch. It can be difficult to get a table and there are often 30 min + wait times. That being said, the food is hit or miss. The steak frites is the only good thing I've had. The steak is tender and the fries are extra thin. There's a lovely sort of mayo-garlic dipping sauce. Previously, I've tried the rabbit stew and the brisket which were both misses. All my friends love the mussels and the CB&J. A fun place to go once but definitely not a place to frequent.
