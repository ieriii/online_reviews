I came here for "lunch with the CEO" last week. There were 7 people in our party and they happily seated the first carload of people while the rest of our group was still searching for parking. Our CEO's assistant thinks of absolutely everything, so she had pre-ordered some appetizers which were waiting on the table when we arrived.  The pizza was just ok. I ordered the 4-cheese Quattro de something thinking "what's better than a cheese pizza? FOUR CHEESES!" Turns out I was mistaken. It was not the wonderfully cheesey, gooey mess I was anticipating....it was almost dry! :-( The decor is cute, but by the end of our lunch I could barely hear the people at the other end of the table. The acoustics are just horrible.
