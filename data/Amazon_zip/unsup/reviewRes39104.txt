I have to say that one of my most favorite places to eat with a group of four or more is San Soo Gab San for a delicious Korean BBQ. This location is very a very popular place in the city. I think I have eaten here over ten times in the past four years and each time is still an experience to be had. I had my Master's degree graduation party here and not one person said they disliked the food. The service on the other hand is not the best in the world, but that is just a cultural thing. The best part of the meal include several parts. First, you have the fact that you get to cook your own meat (if you order two) on the charcoal grill at your table. BTW - you will smell like smoke when you leave so don't come here before prom. Some of the meats, for example are beef short rib, tenderloins, pork, chicken, and squid. Then, there are the 15-20 side dishes that you get (which you can always get refills of) such as kimchi, lotus root, and potato salad just to name a few. The meats come with one rice and one miso soup for each meat, which I would suggest sharing so you can have more meat and side dishes. They also have other dishes like Korean pancakes and such, but I would suggest the grilled meats. It is best to go to San Soo Gab San on the weeknights as the weekends can be very crowded. And as always.... Have Fun!!!
