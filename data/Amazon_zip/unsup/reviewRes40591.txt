I'm such a fan of this place. When I lived in Uptown this was right next door and I took people here all the time. Big bowls of pho with generous portions of meat and noodles. Two signs of a good Asian restaurant: first, packed with people (and Asians at that) and second, if it's packed, they squeeze you into a table with other random people. Love it!
