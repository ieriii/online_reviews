The size of their pho is really good. I always want to try other dishes, but most of the time when I am heading to Tank its cause I need a hangover cure and pho is the best for that. The place can get crowded. WHen it does they will try to seat you randomly at a 6 top table when there is a couple already seated there. SO be prepared for that. If it's to the point of having to wait in line, I usually don't want to wait for more than 10 min. White this place is good, there are many other restaurants serving pho too.
