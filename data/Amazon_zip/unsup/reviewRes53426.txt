The food is defintely to write home about. The dogs come in a variety of 'spice' levels and are reasonably priced. the fries in duck fat are to die for and i am a huge fan of them. the atmosphere is very cool as wellthe reason i cant give 5 stars, is due to the WAIT. it is ridiculous to have to wait so long for anything. it feels like a ride @ Great America @ times. The place is always packed and can get loud and crampy as you might imagine.Overall, a great place though!
