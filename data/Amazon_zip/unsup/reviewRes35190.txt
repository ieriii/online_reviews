Mmm...yummy...delicious....tasty....authentic. The star, of course, is the Peking duck dinner. For $38 buckeroos, you get beautifully carved and prepared Peking duck (enough for 4), duck fried rice, and duck and melon soup.  The duck is excellent. Grown in Montana, the owners are serious about their duck! The other dishes are also great. I was a bit disappointed that they sold out of most of their BBQ. Get there early and not on a Sunday night (many local folks will pick up dinner/groceries by this time) and you'll be able to snag their delicious looking roast pork.
