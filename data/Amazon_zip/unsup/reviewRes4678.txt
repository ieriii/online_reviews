I was traveling solo to Chicago. Took the bar seat right in front of the open kitchen. It was a little cramped with all the plates around me but I had the best seat in the house in my book. Bad news - could not find bone marrow on the menu. Panicked.  One of the chefs saw me and asked what I was looking for... I told... he confirmed and apologized - apparently hey have not been getting their marrows from the supplier. Its been off the menu for more than 2 weeks. Accck quite frustrated. He then suggests the neck bone spread and promised me that I will be satisfied with that. I decided to get the roasted cauliflower as well. It was excellent. It comes with grilled bread which was so good for dipping to the sauce. The sauce is tomatoey and they add sour cream in the middle. I likes it without the sour cream. The bread was so darn good.  The cauliflower is super tiny - in a small bowl. But packed with flavor. It is roasted and the sauce is vinegar based. So good - goes perfect with anything heavy, like my neck bone. Service was good - friend and speedy. They refilled my water a few times without me asking.  The decor is simple and rustic. They also have outdoor seating as well which I would definitely do next time.
