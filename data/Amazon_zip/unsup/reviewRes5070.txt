Went to Chicago this past weekend and a friend took us here as our first place to eat when we arrived. Excellent choice! The food is tapas-style which I absolutely adore; I could dine on pick-food and wine every single day if given the opportunity. There were 4 of us, so the small plates were just enough for each of us to have at least one bite of everything we ordered. "Beer, Swine & Wine" is a lovely motto to have! We started out with a bottle of red wine that was delicious. I don't know what it was, since I didn't do a lot of the ordering....I just trusted my company. For food, we sampled some assorted cheeses, the razor clams, chorizo olives, lardo-something on bread (which I assume by the name that it was straight pork fat slathered on a crostini), proscuitto bread balls, Pig's ear with crispy kale, peppers & fried egg, a cold eggplant dish, and finished off with a second bottle of wine and a ricotta and chocolate filled fried pastry-type thing for dessert. (Can't remember what it was called!) As with many restaurants in big cities, the seating is a bit tight in there and we were sharing a large table with a few strangers. I don't really mind this, unless you get stuck next to stains. Our server was an absolute DOLL also, I can't remember her name but she was terrific. Bus staff also promptly cleared empty tapas plates in the cramped quarters to make room for the next plate of deliciousness. Would highly recommend this to anyone visiting Chicago ~ and the bonus is that it was very close to our hotel (Hyatt Regency on Wacker & Michigan) as it was very windy and rainy there this weekend!
