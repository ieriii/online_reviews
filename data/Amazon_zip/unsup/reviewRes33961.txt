This is one of my all time favorite places for dinner. GREAT ambiance and the service is always good. They also have a cute outdoor back patio and a separate coach house. Been here tons of times and I would give this 5 stars, excpet last night the food was just OK...The pasta selection was not the usual and we all were just ok with our food. The bruchetta with arugula is one of my favorites and that was delicious, as always. The waiter also did a nice job of recommending a nice bottle of red that we all enjoyed. I will be back again!
