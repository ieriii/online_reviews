The Pho was very good, served with fresh jalapenos and cilantro. I really enjoyed it, my issue is with the service. I came with a large party (about 10) and we waited a long time for someone to take our order. When our server finally came around I ordered the Mango Smoothie, it never came and when I asked the server he told me I never ordered it, despite the fact that everybody at my table remembered me ordering it. Now I understand that mistakes happen but don't call me a liar, I really don't appreciate it. Also, we barely finished our food by the time we were being rushed out. There are plenty of places to get good Pho, in the future I'll stick to one that doesn't call me a liar and shove me out the door as soon as I put the last bite in my mouth.
