Yummy, yummy, yummy, I got duck in my tummy. The Peking duck special really is awesome, and they do a wonderful job presenting it. They slice it up right in front of you and it is a delicious looking display. This special also comes with a big bowl of duck soup and duck friend rice. I only went with one other person, so we had quite a bit of leftovers. That's ok, cause duck makes great leftovers! We also started off with some BBQ pork and that was pretty delicious as well. Yum yum.
