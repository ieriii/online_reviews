I like Wishbone for brunch. Yes, the country kitchen look is horrible. I mean, how much rooster-themed kitsch can you possibly have in one restaurant? Plus there usually is a wait on weekends. However, I really enjoy the brunch food. The fruit pancakes are great, I like them with blueberry or mango depending on my mood. The chicken apple sausage is a great accompaniment with the pancakes & sweet maple syrup. I also dig the crab benedict and yankee scrambler (scrambled eggs, cream cheese and onions). Good cappuccino also.
