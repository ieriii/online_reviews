4-star rating. Based on 186 reviews. Umm...... really?!?! Personally, I find my 2 stars quite generous giving the quality of the dishes that Lao Sze Chuan shells out. To start, two different servers delivered two pestering attempts to sell their "impressive" list of beers and wines. Declining politely both times, they continued on to advertise their real fruit smoothies. Admittedly, that sounded great on the humid day that we swung by; disappointingly enough, lychee was not an option so I settled with the pineapple smoothie instead. Onto the food. Having read many reviews about the Tony's chicken with three chili, it behooves me to order the dish. Yes, the spices blended well, but imagine my surprise when I found that most of the chicken chunks were actually breaded chunks of batter. The salt and pepper fried smelt was equally uninspiring. Typically, smelt are fried to a crispy perfection -- i.e. crispy enough that one would not have to wind up in the emergency room having choked on the bone and all. LSC's version? Great blend of flavors once again, but have 911 on speed dial if you wish to conquer the dish. Lastly, the szechuan beef. Surprisingly the only okay dish of the night, but the slices of beef were oddly soft and moist. Do yourself a favor and check out the other (better!) dining options in Chinatown Square instead.
