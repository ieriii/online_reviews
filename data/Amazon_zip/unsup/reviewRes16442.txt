A cryptic, ethereal, elegant, version of Alice in Wonderland. The lack of lighting, and the secluded booths added to the ambience and gave it a very intimate feel. An excellent place for a date, I would say. My friends and I were childishly amused by the tall chairs and the velvet curtains everywhere. There's a wide variety of drinks on the menu, including absinthe. The drinks were complex, which was probably why our order took some time to fulfill (the ice is hand-chiseled by the way haha). This is definitely not a place to come and get smashed. You will hear a whole set of rules after you walk in. It seems unearthly at first, but that's their gimmick. That's why people come, to enjoy the elements it has to offer. The doorman was undoubtedly the most soft spoken, polite doorman I have ever come across. Talking on your phone is prohibited. So come with your best manners and your six-inch voices.
