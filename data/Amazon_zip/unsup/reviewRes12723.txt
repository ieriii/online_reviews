i'm admittedly sorry to be ranking cafe 28 since my hopes were so high. cafe 28 had been recommended by a couple people and though the reviews varied here, i felt they were generally positive. i am not so positive. the atmosphere is fine (though the view from the window at the construction across the street left much to be desired). first off, i was sorely disappointed with the lack of spicy options presented at this cuban restaurant. coobah, just a few blocks away, has the best jamaican jerk chicken salad you could want, so since we had passed up coobah to try cafe 28, i was hoping for something on par. no luck. they've got 2 mexican dishes, a handful of cuban dishes, and a couple of entrees (like the almond crusted halibut - is that really a cuban dish?) that are really expensive and not worth it. my boyfriend ordered the roast pork, which was fine, but nothing to write home about. in fact, it tasted more like an indian spiced pork dish than anything you might find in cuba. i ordered the honey jalepeno pork chops. these two big pork chops arrived sitting in a pool of marinade and on top of a little heap of mashed sweet potatoes. my cut was pretty fatty - though juicy and tasty, but not spicy at all. in fact, i've had honey glazed ham from the deli that i think could have fooled me for the same thing in a blind taste test. but possibly the worst thing? the sangria. i LOVE sangria. and this hawaiian punch/spirte concoction was nothing like the sangria i've known. i felt rather disappointed that i couldn't even count on a good drink to wash back my decent pork chop. maybe their lunches are better? guess i'm just saying that i'm in no hurry to go back.
