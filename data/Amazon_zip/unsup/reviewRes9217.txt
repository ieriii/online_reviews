I'm not impressed. First, to anyone who has had authentic vietnamese food with pho filled to the brim in bowls larger than your head for less than $7 - quickly turn your back away from this place. I'm not a connoiseur of vietnamese food, but I'm not a beginner at it either. The food was good, but grant it any smart person who knows good vietnamese will think that this place is a rip off.  First, $20 for pho??? That's slightly ridiculous. Spend your $20 and get yourself to Uptown and find a vietnamese restaurant where you can get an ENTIRE meal for less than $20.  I know what you're thinking. It's the location, ambiance, blah, blah, blah, but none of that was impressive. First, you literally sit so close the the table next to you that you might as well pass your dish along to your neighbor and share. The tables are so tight that anyone who sits on the booth side of the table can't go to the bathroom without making EVERYONE at the table stand up so that it can be pulled out.  Second, the service was S-L-O-W. I mean seriously, it was 20 minutes from the time we sat down to the time our waitress actually came to take our order. The appetizers came out quick, but our entrees took what felt like an entire century.  No joke. A dinner with only 1 glass of wine, 1 ap and 1 entree took over 2 hours. That's slightly ridiculous.  If I had the option, I would have given my tip to the person filling my water instead of our waitress. He was so attentive that if ever there was even an inch of water sipped out of my glass he would refill it. Thank you kind sir for being the only upside to this experience. I know that this is so different from the other reviews, but vietnamese bun and pho are some of my favorite dishes. This is nothing special and I wish the environment could make up for the food, but it doesn't. it just makes it worse.
