this is my favorite bar in the entire world. i don't care that i have to pay a cover, i don't care how crowded it is on thursdays. i love the way it looks, i love the mix of people there, i love the door guy, i love being able to dress up, wear red lipstick and drink a proper fucking gin martini and dance, i love the orchestra, i love that people will actually dance here... if they're awesome OR even if they're terrible! not to mention it's a great place to see/"accidentally" run into non-sucky celebrities. (vince vaughn, marion cotillard, etc) if you haven't been to the green mill, you have not fully ram-jammed chicago.
