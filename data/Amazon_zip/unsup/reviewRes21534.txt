Mayan Palace rocks, especially on Tuesdays and Thursdays. The have amazing food, service and Marg's! My brother and I loved the food when we went. The Sea Bass was perfect and the Enchiladas were outstanding! Strawberry Margarita's were strong and cheap b/c it was a Thursday, but we switched to cervesa's after. Service was fast and friendly also. Not bad pricing for excellent food. Authentic. I just got a coupon and will be using it very soon! This place rocks!
