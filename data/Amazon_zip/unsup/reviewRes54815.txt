I rated Meli Cafe one star because of the serviceFood: 5 starsService: I have been coming here for about 5 years, why? because of their food but i gave up ! Be ready to wait in line outside.The restaurant TABLES ARE SO CLOSE TO EACH OTHER;after you finally get a table the waitresses RUSH YOU TO ORDER, wait staff is only women it seems THEY HIRE them BASED ON THEIR LOOKS and NOT THEIR EXPERIENCE. They rarely smile and they stand there staring at your table and if you seemed to be done with your meal forget about having having a chat while you enjoy your cofee they will come several times to ask you if you are done or will bring the bill immediately! THE BUS BOYS do all the work and they seem very stressed, they slam the dishes while they clean on the tables near you, THEY STILL HAVE A BETTER ATTITUDE than the miserable waiters. One day I came during the weekday and it wasn't busy at all so i asked to pick a table , the waitress gave me an attitude and they always do that it is like they hate to be there. Out of 10 waitresses in my experience only 2 had a good customer service.The food is outstanding everything is fresh and if you are in a special diet they have several options like fruit ,delicious oatmeal, egg whites, juices . The pancakes, french fries, paninis. Everything in the menu is delicious. I stopped going there because of the terrible customer service almost every time i went there:(
