I've been a huge fan of Alliance in the past, I love their baked goods and their coffee is always delicious. Today, however, when I went in to order paczkis the staff was extremely rude. There was a line of about 2 or 3 people and I patiently waited in it for my turn. When it was my turn the woman behind the counter asked the man behind me for his order instead of me, when I was clearly the next person in line. It seemed that they knew each other and he was a former regular. I would've overlooked this if not for what happened next, the woman behind the counter noticed that I was clearly overlooked and did nothing, then the man behind the counter helped another woman behind me in the line. I finally spoke up and said "I think I'm next." I ended up spending about half an hour in line this morning before work. I probably should've said something but hate making a scene, instead Alliance won't be receiving my business again. They'll probably be just fine without it, I'm just sad about the way I was treated.
