I've loved Indie ever since I moved to Chicago 5 years ago, I've put up with their long wait times for the yummy food. It was worth it. But today, I ordered food for delivery and the woman taking order out and out lied to me not once, but three times. When I placed the order she told me the food would be delivered in 20 minutes. An hour later I called to see where my delivery was and she said it was on the way. A half hour later I called back and she again said it as on it's way but could give no estimate on the delivery time. I called back to cancel the order and she just outright bullshitted some more. Forget it Indie, I don't need your lies.
