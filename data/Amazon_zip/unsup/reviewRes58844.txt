Best sushi restaurant in Chicago!!! I've been coming to Sunda since it first opened, and the atmosphere, service, food and beverage quality have always been excellent. The Brussels sprout salad is to die for!!! It's usually difficult to get a Saturday night reservation, but when we can, this is our girls night out go-to spot!
