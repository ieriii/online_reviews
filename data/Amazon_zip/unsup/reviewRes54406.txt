I have been to Chicago Diner a lot of times. I love eating everything there that I have tried. I am telling you the deserts and nondairy shakes are a whole lot better than dairy ones. They are not sticky and boogery like dairy. The non meat items are really great. I love those sweet potato fries. They rule. Go there and chow down on some good eats. The servers are nice and friendly.
