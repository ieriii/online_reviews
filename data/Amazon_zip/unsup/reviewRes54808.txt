Horrible food and even worse service! This place was okay in the past, but now it really went way down!I ordered something for lunch that clearly was not fresh, to say the least. The server did not care one bit and neither did the manager! In the end they even charged me for the food I DID NOT EAT due to health concerns.Can you imagine worse than this? Let me tell you that I couldn't be nicer about the whole thing while there and even paid my bill. I did work in a restaurant in the past and I know it is hard work, but HORRIBLE SERVICE AND EVEN WORSE FOOD is inexcusable.
