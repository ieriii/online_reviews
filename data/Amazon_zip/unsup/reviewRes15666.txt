Yum, Yum and Yum. My BF and I were up in Andersonville and wanted to try out a few new spots. We headed here based on all the yelp reviews. The wait was about 45 mins so we just went across the street to grab a beer. When we came back out table was ready.  We came to try the thin crust pizza so I can't speak for everything on the menu. I will say the tomato bread that they give you is really amazing along with the other stuff in the bread baskets. (If you read my reviews you know I love bread!) We also ordered the Italian Chopped Salad. They split it up for and it was huge and yummy. It also only costs 7 or 8 dollars. Awesome! Here comes the pizza. We were pretty full on the yummy bread and the huge salad so we didn't devour it like we normally would. I will say it's pretty darn good. The toppings can get mad expensive so just stick with a few.  The only downer of the restaurant....our waitress was not good. I realize it's a Friday night and you are busy but she barely spoke a few words to us. She also took our bill and credit cards so fast that I hardly had time to tell her how to split the bill. I was annoyed by that.  Other than that...it was a good experience.
