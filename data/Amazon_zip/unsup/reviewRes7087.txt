Simply perfect. Everything: the service, the ambient, the food and the wine were perfect!!! Analyzing one by one, the service is one of the best I ever saw in Chicago. Every waiter or waitress has complete knowledge of the entire menu, and always make great suggestions of entrees, wines and desserts. Maximum rate for the service. The ambient can get a little loud, but not excessively, just the regular for a restaurant. Other than that, it's a pleasant place in general. I had the opportunity to be on both: out or indoor tables, and one or another are very comfortable to stay as long as you want. They also got a great selection of wines, that matches perfectly each dish on the menu. And finally the food. From the bread to the desserts, I recommend every single dish in the Menu. Some of them are very special to me, like the meat lasagna (Lasagna Di Antonio) and the Gnocchi al Brivido - two specialties of the Chef. For dessert, I strongly recommend the Tiramisu and the Panna Cotta. I strongly recommend Sapori for anyone that asks me about Italian food. If it was possible, I would give not 5 but 10 stars for them.
