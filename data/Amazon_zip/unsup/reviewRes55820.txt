Love this place! I live in the neighborhood and go out to eat here about once a week. They have a great special available Sun-Thur where you can get their full slab of ribs for half price. It also comes with a side of pasta and salad. Sometimes it gets crowded on the weekend but it's definitely worth the wait.
