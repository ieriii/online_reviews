There are so many reasons why this place has established itself as a Chicago must-see. - The decor. All over the place are photos of all the old waitresses that have worked for RJ. - The music. Classic rock and motown, what can't you love? - The bar. Right there in the front while you wait for room, and now all milkshakes can include liquor. - The salad bar. Sure it's not the cleanest you've ever seen, but a good selection and a great price make it a good deal. - The temperature soup. You pay a penny a degree, so in these Chicago winters you could get a cup of soup for 20 cents! - The cinnamon milkshake. Need I say more? Go here and visit before LEYE shuts it down.
