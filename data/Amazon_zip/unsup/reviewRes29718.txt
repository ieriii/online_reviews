This might be the best pasta in the city AND it's inexpensive. I've been going here since the 7th grade. They have a wonderful Ceasar dressing and their pesto gnocchi with pine nuts is my weak spot. I always ask them to put a touch of cream in it. It's a small place, but we've never waited longer than 5 minutes!
