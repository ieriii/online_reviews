Not that they need another great review, but this place was awesome.  The food was great. We had the experience, and everything was great with only 2 exceptions. The Risotto was very salty and the pork belly should have cooked much longer- it was rather tough. That said, there are some real gems here. The stroganoff, the deconstructed italian beef and the orange dreamsicle were three of the best things I've ever eaten, and I'll definitely come back and order them again in the future. We had a bit of a hiccup, they kind of forgot about us, but otherwise the service was amazing. We gave our waiter pretty much carte blanche on wine selection, and he passed that little test with flying colors, I really appreciate that our waiter had the chance to pad the bill and didn't. Not only did our wine open up and pair differently with each course it was a really delicious wine at a really reasonable price. Also! You don't have to have a few hundred dollars in your pocket to have a beautiful dinner here. The stroganoff dish I had was probably about $30 as an entre, and it paired perfectly with the $11 cab our waiter recommended to go with it. That would be a totally reasonable dinner (by Chicago standards)- thought I definitely suggest the "experience" if you ever get the chance.
