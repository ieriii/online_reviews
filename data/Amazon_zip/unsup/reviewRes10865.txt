Came when it first opened years ago. Made a trip out here recently. The food is still solid. The breakfast burrito and the salsa is a TOP 3. Pancakes here are also surprising good. Almost Walker Brothers caliber. Almost. The location and the cool name should warrant at least 1 visit. I like hash browns not potatoes though. Small lines can be annoying. A bit steepy but a must try breakfast place.
