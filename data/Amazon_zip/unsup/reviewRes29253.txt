Tasty Thai cuisine in a location near the bars of Lincoln Square. It's a nice place to dine in and if you're lazy like me, they'll deliver to your house on time.  The staff is very helpful and you get full control over the level of spice. With three rooms of dining, any size party is nicely accommodated and the bathrooms are clean. The appetizers are tasty; I recommend as the Satays and the Moo Ping. As for main courses, I usually go with the Eggplant in Oyster sauce. Their Pad Thais and Panang Curries are full of flavor and the soups are served in unique Thai bowls that may or may not double as trophies.  It all leads to a nice dinner where you'll feel full but not busted. Good times? Yes!
