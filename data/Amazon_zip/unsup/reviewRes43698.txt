I absolutely love the brunch here. Came here around noon on a Saturday to the heart of the hustling and bustling (which I do not mind); I feel the husting adds character to the place. I had the huevos rancheros, served "casserole style", as well as a soy latte, and they were both extremely delicious. My huevos rancheros stayed warm and hot the whole time and everything - from the salsa picante, to the black beans were distincly flavored. The coffee was also made extremely well, which is hard to find - the foam was perfect for a latte (unlike foam-less lattes I get at other cafes.. e.g. starbucks), and I believe they use Intelligentsia coffee. My husband and friend both had the orange brioche french toast with toasted almonds. I must say, that before I came here, my husband and I both loved the stuffed french toast at Toast, but after coming here, the french toast (although not stuffed), was so yummy - extremely flavorful, just moist enough.  I'll definitely be back to try the granola and panini, and everything else!
