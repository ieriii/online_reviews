I have been going to Mia Francesca for years it used to be one of my favorite restaurants in the city. Always a fresh new menu, and wonderful atmosphere. However, I went for my birthday last night and was greatly disappointed. The food was not that fresh, and the dishes weren't prepared very well. One of my friend's dishes was very cold and overcooked. The service was pretty good, our waiter was very nice. I guess I was just really looking forward to an amazing meal. I don't know if they switched chefs or if they are lowering the quality of ingredients because of the economy, but something was totally off. Hopefully it is better next time!
