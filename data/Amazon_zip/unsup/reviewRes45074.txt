This is a cool place! They serve fast, and very interesting and tasty foods. The portions are pretty small, but the wine choices are good and the staff are friendly and good at what they do. Food is overall not that expensive either. This place has the coolest look from the outside since you really only see the first couple tables and then you get inside and see how many people they have inside. I'm glad I checked this place out, all the food is creative. I've never had polenta (goat) before, but I enjoyed it. Baaaaaah.
