BEST deep dish pizza I've tried in Chicago so far (comparison points = Gino's and Lou Malnati's). The secret is the seasoned pans they use for the pizzas - they line each pan with parmesan cheese so when you get the pizza out, there's a delicious ring of semi-burnt cheese around the outside of the crust. Absolutely amazing. It's definitely worth the wait in my opinion and any time I am in the mood for some deep dish, Pequod's is my first choice!
