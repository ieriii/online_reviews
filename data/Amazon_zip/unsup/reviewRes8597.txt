The concept is amazing- unlimited steak, and if you go for lunch, its only $35. The salad bar is phenomenal, but don't get full on it because the meat is pretty good also. If you can down a lot of meat, this place is very well worth it, but if you can't, there's better steak options. The fried plantains are also delicious. I highly recommend this place for the experience- a large array of cuts and the waiters/servers walking around in traditional clothing.
