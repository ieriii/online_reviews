All I can say is RIDICULOUS! I have now eaten at Publican twice and it just gets better. I raved to my fiance about the muscles (which they just ran out of) but no worries, the beet salad, oysters, pork rinds, chicken and pork belly impressed! Oh and the pear cobbler :). We did it right! We have eaten at many Chicago restaurants and my fianc said this is hands down his fav. That says a lot! Go and enjoy a dinner at Publican! I heard their brunch is awesome too!
