Well, this is my second time be there. A little be disappointed, not as good as I remember. The food is good but not very ethnic since I had a real good one in Singapore. The price is a bit high, that's the reason I rate it in 3.... However, if someone wants to have India food in Chicago, I'll still recommend it.
