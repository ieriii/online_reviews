Went here with a few other Yelpers last night (Saturday) for a later dinner (9:00pm). We had 9 in our party, got a great table by the window & watched the snow & plows. Our server was really nice & on top of all our drink orders. With 9 drinkers all with different drinking schedules, there is always someone needing booze, & she was great. All the appetizers & food were excellent. I tried the ribs for the first time & they were awesome. I'll get 'em again. We sat around shooting the shit for a long time after dinner & there was no rushing us out. I felt bad, as we were the last to leave, but everyone, including the busboys were really nice. It was a fun night & a good holiday get together with friends, Thanks Calo! Jim
