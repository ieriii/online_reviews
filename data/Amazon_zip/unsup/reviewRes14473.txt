Pulled pork sandwich: solid. big. fast. beers: their beers are pretty good, if not missing a little personality. they did just open so i imagine they are going to look around for what is liked etc. i'd like to see some headier stuff but whatever. too many dorks in the place though. oh yeah, and good service.
