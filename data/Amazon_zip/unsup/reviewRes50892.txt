perhaps it's my hatred for rambunctious children and their door mat parents... or that i hyped myself up too much for this place, but either way I was a tad bit dissapointed. i started out on a sour note when i had to wait for 4 screaming children and their 2 moms to stop hogging the sink in the bathroom so that i could wash my hands and go sit down. dude, your kids are obviously just playing w/ the water... go plan your playdate outside. our server was attentive and friendly. my latte was ok, my dining partner had the missisippi mud or whatever and that was tasty as well. the turkey gumbo came out and i was starting to think our experience was going uphill. but then my entree came out. how are u going to pass that sandwich off as a "po boy?!" really? it was dry... and bland. i DID like the cajun fries, but we're fry fanatics... so a tiny side plate wasn't efficient for us. i tried cheese grits for the first time, and that was.... interesting. i don't know if i could eat an entire bowl. thank goodness the obnoxious child in the booth behind me left. bc a kid leaning and screaming near my head was almost too much for my patience.
