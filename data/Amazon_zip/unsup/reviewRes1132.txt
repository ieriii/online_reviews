I waited on a hot Saturday last fall to eat at Hot Doug's. It was worth it.  I had their mixed beef and pork dog Chicago style with everything, duck fat fries and a special - a curry sausage with coconut peanut sauce. Was it worth it? Yes. What was worth it? Not the duck fat fries. - They were good, but really overkill and I would have preferred regular fries, mostly they just made my heart work harder and the line longer outside. Not the standard dogs- This was pretty average and nt worth the trip or the line for me The special dog was one of the most amazing things I have ever eaten, and the other specials looked equally amazing. I would go back here again and again and wait in that line for the special. The atmosphere - The employees , the primary colors of the space, and the fellow customers make it worth waiting. yay! hot dougs!
