Hands down one of the best milkshakes I've ever had(chai) and it was VEGAN nonetheless. My entree, polenta with beans and rice, was very hearty while my dining companion's ravioli was delicious as well. I like this place, very cozy, very cute, very hipster. I will definitely be visiting this spot again.
