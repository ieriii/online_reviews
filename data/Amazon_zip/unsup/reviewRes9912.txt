Dined with the wife on a Sat night for her birthday. It was really crowded and full of older people. Luckily we got seated in the back room cause it would have been an unpleasant meal to be seated in front by the bar. Started with some salads which were good particularly the beet salad(but how can you screw that up). I had the taligette with boar ragu that rocked. Wife had the gnocchi which was OK. Finished with chocolate lava like cake also pretty good. And we got a reasonable bottle of vino. I'd go back but not unless someone else wanted to go. And there is valet parking that everyone was waiting for inspite of the fact that there was plenty of street parking.
