Amazing! Entrees: 1. tofu and veggie yellow curry- I loved the mango, sweet potato, asparagus, fried tofu in a light curry sauce that wasn't sweet or tangy rather perfectly balanced in spice and heat. 2. Bouillabaisse - French fish stew with vietnamese essence, soo good! There is a ton of lobster. The restaurant itself is gorgeous, next time I'll ask to be seated upstairs by the bar/lounge where they also have a dining area with the same menu because it has great music and just looks really cool! All serves should be like the one who served us, she wasn't surprised we didn't order drinks or appetizers and didn't 'suggest' we get them..I hate it when servers do that! Obv I would get an appy if I wanted it in the first place, don't need you to remind me! She was attentive without over-checking up on us. Love Le Colonial!
