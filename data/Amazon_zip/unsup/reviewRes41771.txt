Ruth's Chris is still the king of steakhouses. I think its the ideal place for a special occasion Yes, it is a chain, but it is incredibly consistent. I've been going here regularly for the past 5 years or so and have never been disappointed. I was here last weekend with a date. We had the chop salad (one of the best I've ever had, maybe even better than wildfire); we both had steaks (petite filet and new york strip), with the sweet potato casserole and mashed potatoes. It was unbelievable. Our server was really great and was extremely attentive and even gave us our desert on the house. It's expensive, but for a special occasion, this place really gets it right. You can't go wrong.
