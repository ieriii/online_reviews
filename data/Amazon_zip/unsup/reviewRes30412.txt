I asked the concierge where can we go to get yummy food that is near our hotel and on the way to Michigan Ave. He said, go to 3rd Coast - it's in a luxury condo and has a "different feel". Thankfully we didn't get lost for the whole 3 block walk that it was, but I did ask a guy walking his dog where this place was. It's really really cozy inside. They had a display of wine bottles on the side, a big ole' coffee machine and was really crowded for brunch. Thankfully they had an open table for two and we promptly were seated. I chose a cheddar and bacon egg white omelette with wheat toast and hash browns. I think it was about $9 for that order. My friend ordered a bagel and a side of fruit, both were about $8 or so. I was in much need for a latte and it came in a nice big glass and the milk was perfectly frothed. Service was great and the people in the tables besides us were really friendly and chill. I could tell they lived in the area and frequented this place for good food.
