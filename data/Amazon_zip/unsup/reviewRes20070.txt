I was blown away by XOCO. We went on a Saturday afternoon during off-peak lunch hours, but there was still a ridiculous line. I ordered the Pepito sandwich (Braised Tallgrass shortribs, caramelized onion, artisan Jack cheese, black beans, pickled jalapenos) and it was absofreakinglutely delicious. I loved the pickled jalapenos in the sandwich, gave it that spicy yet tangy kick. The bread they used was also excellent texture and crispy, soaking up the juices and grease from the sandwich. Good lord this sandwich was like a double rainbow in my mouth!!! Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. My friend M had the Ahogado sandwhich which was also verrrryyyy tasty. The broth was delicious -- loads and loads of flavor and just a kick in the ass of spice! Lastly, I forgot what my friend C had, but I can assure you her sandwich was delectable as well. Chips & Salsa? Da bomb. Churros with chocolate sauce...yes please. May I have another. I want that chocolate sauce all over my body. Every thing we had here was hands down exquisite - extremely close to being some of the BEST tortas/sandwiches I've had in my LIFE!!! EAT HERE, you will NOT regret it!!!
