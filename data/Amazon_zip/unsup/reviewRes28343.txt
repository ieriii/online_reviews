Everyone should eat here! We were in town on vacation and had our 14month old with us. Very kid friendly! We had the tastings with the drink pairing. Fabulous. Yes portions were small but adequate, each new tasting made you excited for the next. I dont like peas but the pea bisque with mint marshmallow was great. Left full and will eat here again.
