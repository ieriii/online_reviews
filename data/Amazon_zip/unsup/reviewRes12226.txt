I really don't think you can screw up pizza. I've been hearing about this place for a while and had an opportunity to try it out. I was looking forward to this experience given all the hype. I tried a piece of the white clam pizza and a piece of the red pepperoni/ sausage. They were both "OK". If anything, a little too greasy. I've definitely had better pizza and I was a little disappointed that it wasn't all it was cracked up to be.
