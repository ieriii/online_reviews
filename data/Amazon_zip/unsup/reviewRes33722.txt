In my price range, Italian cuisine often resembles -- and tastes like -- the sloppy contents of a dented can of Chef Boyardee. Somehow American palates don't discriminate between once-frozen, sodium-packed "marinara" and complex, long-simmering sauces, and dime-a-dozen Italian restaurants know this and cater to the disability. Not Francesca. Imagine: a local chain that offers ever-changing menus filled plate after plate of reasonably priced, varied Italian dishes. To celebrate his new assignment, Daniel and I dined here last night. We were ushered through the deafening main dining room to the quiet, dark, "romantic" (the quotations can be translated as: "pleasant, in the way that romance is described in rom-coms and bodice-rippers") patio. Lovely. I ordered the caprese martini, which came with an all-too-liberal dusting of celery salt (I certainly don't associate the taste of celery with caprese, but perhaps I'm mistaken?) and no discernible basil or tomato notes. The saving grace was the vodka-soaked mozzarella ball -- a trick I will treat guests to in the future. Daniel has the Four Roses Manhattan, which came perfectly balanced with Pun e Mes vermouth (the best vermouth to use in a Manhattan, of course). Our meals were above average -- not the best I've had at Mia Francesca, but good. My chicken with mushrooms, prosciutto, and lake of gravy was tender, moist, but on the bland side of "good." Daniel's tilapia with green beans and sweet potato puree (in the darkness, it took me awhile to figure out what I was tasting here) hit all the right notes. Another great thing about Francesca restaurants? The desserts. We passed (I had fig and honey ice cream, freshly churned, waiting at home), but I did spy the chocolate peanut butter torte that has warmed my heart before. Trust me -- it's a great finale for these Puccini-worthy meals.
