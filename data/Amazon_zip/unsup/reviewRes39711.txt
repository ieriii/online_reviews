Solid establishment. Excellent location (steps from Blue Line, #76 / #56, and my condo). Superb service, all around. Great musical selection. Interesting table decor. Complimentary, in-house filtered still or sparkling water. Oh yeah, and incredible food, interesting preparations and lots and lots of bourbon. With many $3 shots listed prominently on the drink menu. /swoon
