Tank God for Vietnamese Food Up in Uptown! Wow! This is one bustling joint! And it is no wonder given that the food is served up quick, hot, and super delicious. We ordered the amazing appetizer sampler with fried egg rolls, fresh spring rolls, and lettuce wraps for the beef and noodles. Delicious start. We both ordered bowls of pho... however as the plates were getting served up all around me... i wanted to have everything that everyone else was having. But my huge bowl of pho was delicious (maybe with a hint of the licorice-y/star anise? a little stronger to my liking in the broth). However overall, the pho was satisfying and had a nice depth of flavor as far as pho goes. I love tendon in my pho! soft and yummy! We ate here during World Cup. The wait staff furtively watched the game while serving up the food (their multitasking went well... however one of the waiters was so enthralled with the game (that his mouth was always wide open with the suspenseful game on). The cute couple seated un front of me burst into yells and cheers amidst the bustling restaurant (they needed to tone it down a little)... couldn't remember who scored (maybe the Brits?). Another thing I found interesting, it seemed to be Filipino theme day at the restaurant... as a Fil Am myself... everyone seated around me was Filipino... I couldn't figure out what the deal was...was there a nurses station around the corner or did mass just let out? But hey, my people love to eat... so a ton of them at TANK... means that it's all good, TANK you.  Overall, great prices and awesome eatery!
