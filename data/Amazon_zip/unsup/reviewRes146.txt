(Not much I say here isn't going to be echoed by previous reviewers, which was part of why I wasn't planning on reviewing this place. Also note that shortly after I went they changed the menu from the Tour and Tasting versions to a single Tour) A vanilla bean being used as a serving utensil may be one of the most over the top bits of presentation possible, but it served a particular purpose in the dish and that is part of why Alinea is great.  Even having some idea of what to expect, this still blew me away. The creative effort, the sheer volume of involvement necessary, the service, all of it, was spectacular. As for the food itself, it's ineffable to encompass it all here, but short of it all is, I am inspired to be more fearless with my cooking just to try and find some of the joy and surprise I had during the meal. Of course, I'd have to be insanely talented and a lot richer before I can get close to some of the stuff they do.  Out of the entire meal two dishes were a miss...not spectacular, not terrible, just not in line with the rest of my experience. The rest were very good to purely amazing. I think the look on my face after several bites probably made the wait staff worry if both my hands were above the table. They're probably used to that by now, though.....I hope.  I can see this not being the kind of place everyone would enjoy due to its involved nature and their playfulness with presentation/instruction/flavor. Much like other places of this caliber, I recommend you go if you get the chance.
