I've heard about this place for years and finally tried it.  The mushroom stuffed ravioli was terrific, the pot sticker's uninspired. Even considering it's a "neighborhood" restaurant, and it's squarely in the tradition of non-traditional [sort of a vegetarian college place that lingers still] , the service was SLOW, V-E-R-Y slow, and they messed up the order. I'll try again for the food.
