Perfect spot for a brunch then walk in Grant Park or trip to the beach. A bright, bustling atmosphere welcomes you when you enter this spot right at the southern tip of Grant Park on Michigan Ave. Although it's a little hot inside in the summer, it's fitting for a nice brunch with plenty of hot and cool options. I went with The Works Omelette (bacon, sausage, ham, shrooms, onions, and tomatoes, topped with jack and cheddar cheese). Given the option of potatoes or fruit, I went with fruit to feel better about myself. I had a nice assortment of grapes, orange slices, pineapple, and watermelon. You also have the option of toast, english muffins, or pancakes. I went with the pancakes, which more than negated the fruit, I'm sure. The strawberry orange juice is quite delicious as well.
