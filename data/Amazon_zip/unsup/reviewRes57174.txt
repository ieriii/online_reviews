This is a cool place. Love the lighting and the glass plate wall where you can see the huge stainless steel barrels where they brew the beer. We ordered the Bacon Pop corn which was yummy and the huge Beet salad, also very good. The sweet potatoes cakes were my favorite. Very clever Russian names on everything but I can't remember any. Give them a try. They are open late too!
