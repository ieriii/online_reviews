Sure, it is a flashy tourist spot right off of Michigan Avenue, with a long wait if you hit it during a peak time. However, the food is decent and pretty consistent. It is better and has a better atmosphere than it's sister restaurant, the Cheesecake Factory. They have pretty much something for everyone here, huge menu. My favorite is the BLT. What can I say? They make a good one. I think it's the bread. Oh yeah, and if you go for brunch, the egg white bruschetta thing is amazing.
