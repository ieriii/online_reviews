I finally made it there!! I wanted to organize my friend's bday celebration there but it didn't seem very accomodating for larger groups.  Two things to be aware of: you cannot make a reservation so don't be surprised when the hostess tells you your wait will be 45 minutes (this is a friday night but since it was raining, I assume regular nights are just as packed).  most of the tables are for double seating so it may not be a place to host a larger group of ppl. The bar area is first come first serve so be ready to pounce on any seats that open up. But don't let that discourage you from trying it out!  Enoteca is a great alternative to spanish tapas (minus the sangria). You could go for larger main dishes or stick with a cheese/deli plate and appetizers. We started the meal with a cheese plate (one pecorino - forgot the other - with proscuitto served with toasted raisin bread). They have specials every night of the week - $3 for 10 on fridays for cheese and deli picks. We had the linguine tossed in unni and crab meat, grilled octopus over a beet salad and scallops soup for our main course.  At first i was wary of the unni over linguine. Unni - sea urchin which typically is served raw at your neighborhood sushi spot. doesn't have the best aesthetic appeal - looks something along the lines of an orange mashed tongue of some sort. I never had it cooked and it turned out really good. Definitely innovative and very fresh. Everything we had was delish! Can't wait to try other stuff on the menu. Portions are small but it also allows you do a tasting of the menu. Prices are expected, similar to other tapas style rests. Our tab came out to be $80 which included two glasses of wine
