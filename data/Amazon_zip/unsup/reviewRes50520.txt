Visited Big Jones for my birthday with my family and we had a fantastic time! We had the best, and I truly mean THE BEST, server ever! His name was Andy and he anticipated everything we needed and wanted and was charming and toed the line nicely between being helpful and friendly and giving us our space. I would go back again just to have that kind of service. Big Jones best hold onto him and keep him happy! Once again the food was wonderful! And if you don't get the Mississippi Mud Pie, you are a crazy fool. And did you know if you fill out a card to be on their mailing list and email list, you will get a card in the mail on your birthday for a free drink and a free dessert?! Now that's smart business. See you in a couple of weeks Big Jones, for my hubby's birthday!
