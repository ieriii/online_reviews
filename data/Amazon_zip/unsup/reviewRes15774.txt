Carnivale is one of my favorite places for big dinner events. I've been here a bunch of times, so I have experienced a few iterations of food service here. I think I like it best for drinks and appetizers. They make this sweet plantain (maduro) thing with shredded beef that I could probably eat a whole tray of. They also make good guac, served with homemade root veggie chips, and a good ceviche. If you're planning an event for your group there, and your budget allows, I would skip the set meal and just order off the menu. The carne asada off the set meal was really nothing special. The actual menu entrees are really delicious, so creative and flavorful. It's a shame to eat the stock food when you can get the good stuff. The decor here is also great. The party rooms downstairs are my favorite, you get great service and it's always fun to sit in a private room. The upstairs is cool too, but it can get a little crowded, depending on the size of your group. I'm sure I'll be back to Carnivale again and again.
