It's been a while, but we meet again Bonsoiree... You never disappoint. The last time I was here had to be about 3 years ago. 3 years ago the tasting was about $55 which is beyond reasonable. Now the weekday tasting menu will run you about $85, but for the quality of the food you get and the experience, it is not that bad. The inside is still the same as I had remembered. Clean and easy on the eye. I think the interior pairs well with the food since it creates an open palette for your food to shine through. The way the chefs plates is amazing and beautiful. I had a hard time destroying their works of art. My favorite all time dish here is their Motoyaki, which I'm glad is a staple. It's the best thing ever. I could eat a dozen of these and drink some Sapporro's and call it a night! The rest of the meal was pretty amazing. Lots of seafood and pork; everything I love! The dessert course was super good. It was something like 8 different preparations of chocolate. The chocolate creme brulee was out of this world. I regret not ordering the Duck, Duck, Goose. The couple next to us did and it looked scrumptious--what was I thinking? Can't wait to go back.
