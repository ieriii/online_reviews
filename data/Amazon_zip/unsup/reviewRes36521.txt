Great Lunch Spot! I been having lunch here since October 2006 on a weekly basis. Huge Fan of their delicious Thai Lunch Entrees like the Chicken Pad Thai, Basil Chicken (unbelievable), and Chicken Udon Noodles (i substitute chicken instead of shrimp). Also to my surprise, their sushi is not too bad, but their sushi pricing is overpriced. Never had dinner here, but when i drive by or leave work late, they are slammed since they have great food and its BYOB. Hope my review doesn't disappoint.
