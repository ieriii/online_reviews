First of all I will say that I live right above from Meli's cafe so I never have to wait in line. I just grab the little buzzer and go back to bed and wait.... This is such an advantage, I wish I liked Meli's more... They serve large portions of hearty healthy breakfast. The place is so crowded and there's barely room for plates, coffee cups, silverware, elbows. The tables are so close to each other and you can hear everybody's conversations. Noise? A lot. BF spaces out a lot. You can hear plates clink-clank-ing, everybody talking at the same time, juice blender blending. Had an incident with my meal recently, they served me a barely cooked egg on my benedict. I poked the egg and the raw yolk just slides out, and out comes the clear translucent goopy mess. RAW eggs on my benedict. Maybe I overreacted but I was almost panicking when I explained it to the waitress. She was nice though, after I finished talking she's like, don't worry we'll take care of it. That she did. I don't know why I panicked over the raw egg all over my food. My benedicts came with a complementary glass of OJ. I really wish I *loved* this place as much as those people who wait an hour outside.
