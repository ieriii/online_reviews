I ate here for the first time on Labor Day weekend. The decor is pleasant and warm, perfect for a casual date or lunch out with friends. I had an omelette, which came with potatoes on the side, and it was very good. The service was decent, the wait staff were all friendly. They have fresh-squeezed juices, which is great, and the coffee is EXCELLENT. The booths are a little uncomfortable, but otherwise I was very impressed. I'll definitely be bringing people here.
