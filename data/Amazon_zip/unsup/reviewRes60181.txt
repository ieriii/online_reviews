This was my first time trying this restaurant since I had heard good things. When I explored the online ordering, I was impressed with the ease of ordering and what appeared to be an accurate representation of when the food would be ready (over an hour since we ordered chicken). I think the food was ready much earlier than the time on the website since it was barely warm when we picked it up 10 minutes BEFORE the time noted. Also, they forgot the drink that was included with one item so I had to remind them. The worst part was that when we got home I noticed we didn't get the all white meat on the quarter chicken (and paid an extra $1 for) and they didn't include the extra side of corn that we paid for. When I called in to complain the first response was "whoever took the order didn't make that note so you weren't charged." Of course, I had to explain that I had submitted the order online and the confirmation and bill included those items. The response back was an offer to credit free corn the next time I ordered from them and when I pushed for an adjustment on the credit card charge, I was told they didn't know how to do that and would "leave a note for the owner."To be fair, the next the owners contacted me and apologized with a full credit and encouraged me to return and a big reason why I will definitely give them another chance. Its nice to see that they care about the client experience.
