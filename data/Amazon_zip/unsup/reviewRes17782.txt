Wow... after 200 plus reviews, nearly a year later I still love this place. If it isn't your thing, great, don't mind it, don't come back. Who ever said every one is supposed to like the same thing? I love it. I love coming in early in the evening, sitting down at the bar, chatting with the bartenders, asking them to make me what ever they feel like making me, taking a deep breath and relaxing. The music can be loud, the place can be a little dark, I like it that way. I need change every now and then. I can't go to a dive bar every weekend, nor some chad and trixie filled Wrigley/ Lincoln Park bar. I come early to avoid the ones trickling in here. I love the fact they have no "Light beer" or Grey Goose or Cosmo. No freakin' bomb shots. Their is some order here. Civility in my eyes. Every staff member I have ever met has been wonderfully nice to me and anyone I bring here. The drinks are great, the vibe I truly enjoy, the staff treats me like family. I loves me some Violet Hour and I don't see that changing any time soon.
