I AM IN LOVE WITH PLACE! They have many different pizza concoctions but if you can't find what your looking for you can always build your own. They have a ridiculous amount of toppings for to choose from, I suggest the goat cheese with artichoke hearts and tomato. Despite this being Chicago, they only serve thin crust pizza which is fine by me as I grew up on New York style.  The beer is also wonderful! They brew their own and always have at least 6 on tap however if your looking for something else they have other great options and a full bar. Around 6:00 pm thought this place gets PACKED and they only accept reservations for groups of 10 or more. Be prepared to wait up to 2 hours at times but trust me its well worth it. If you manage to snag a seat at the bar you're more than welcome to eat there too. Also, if you use the foursquare application they almost always have specials like 10% off your lunch or a free flight of beer. AWESOME!
