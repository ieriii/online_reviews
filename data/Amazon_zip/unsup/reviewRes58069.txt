I used to eat here 3 or 4 times a year but no more and here's why. Twenty patrons were waiting outside for a table, patiently, in 30 degree weather. The maitre de blatantly took a bribe from some beeyotch to get seated immediately. Our party of 4 left immediately and dined at Lao ShangHai,which was every bit as good if not better.
