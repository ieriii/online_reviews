I saw this place on the Travel Channels episode, "Pizza Paradises".  I couldn't stop thinking about it so I ended up ordering on for a party. The pizza was about 25 bucks but the shipping was $55. I said what the hell. Cheaper than flying to Chicago. We got it. Puit in the oven. Cut the Pie. Opened mouth. Insert Pie. IT WAS AWESOME! I like thin crust pizza but I LOVES me some thick and stuffed!  I would have given it another star if it was fresh. I know, that's my fault.
