Go at lunch! You get a personal pan and a beer for less than 5 bucks. Whhhhaaaatttttt? In Chicago? It's true. And DELISH. This could quite possibly be the best pan-style crust pizza I've had. yes. it. is. that. good. Loved the ambiance, the decor, the overall feeling I had when I was dining in. The server was top notch and sweet. Bonus points for that. It would make a great date night before heading to the movie theatre within walking distance. :) I'm a Pequod fan for sure. :)
