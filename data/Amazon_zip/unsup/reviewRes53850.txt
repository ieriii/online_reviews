The food was amazing. I love how knowledgeable my server was. her name was Natalia. She knew so much about the wine list and what foods would complement the wine etc and so forth. She was very helpful and when the appetizer we ordered was sold out, she brought us another option on the house! It was incredible. We loved Natalia and we will definitely ask for her to be our server next time.Thanks girl!
