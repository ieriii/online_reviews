I was really excited about checking this place out, unfortunately, I was insanely hungover when I went. But I didn't let that stop me. I tried the beef lollipops, roasted duck baos and sticky rice rolls with shrimp tempura and avocado. The beef lollipops were really tasty and had great presentation. There isn't a ton of meat there, but it was really satisfying. The baos were pretty good but I don't think i would order them again. The presentation again was lovely but the duck wasn't very flavorful and actually tasted kind of dry. But the sticky rice rolls really saved this entire thing for me. The rice was beyond delicious and the avocado had a nice flavor but it wasn't very spicy (even with wasabi in it) and the avocado did overflavor the shrimp. Either way, I would still order it again. The one thing I will say though is that I dined her alone (reading a magazine) and the staff didn't seem to know what to do with me. They tried to seat me at the bar and when I noticed a table outside and asked to sit there, they hesitated and then took me out. When I asked if it was reserved for someone else, they said no and the waiter wasn't rude but just seemed a little unsure of how to approach me. Or maybe i looked as hungover as I felt. I would definitely go back but I wouldn't run there.
