This place has a huge beer list and good food. I highly recommend that you make reservations and ask for a pen (as opposed to the communal table). Or, come near the end of the night and you might be able to score one. Here's what you should order: -Pork belly: Really really good. Just don't think about the calories -Mussels: Huge bowl with cream sauce and tasty. Use the table bread and sop up the juices -Anything from the beer list Other Fries: Pretty good Oysters: Okay, but not for the price. Maybe I've just gotten used to better deals. This place is packed. Make reservations and be prepared to spend a lot of $ because it's expensive.
