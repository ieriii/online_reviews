Sultan's is great, and it is what it is. Inexpensive and tasty. But don't let the "inexpensive" fool you. The ingredients are fresh, and you leave feeling healthy. For a first timer, I'd reccommend the Falafel pita or Chicken Schwarma. You can get full, and eat healthy for about 4 bucks. What else could you want?
