The first time we went, the line was 1.5 hrs long, it was a Saturday and they were serving duck fat fries.... we didn't wait and moved on. We decided to try the place for lunch before we hit the road home. 11a on a Tuesday the line is out the door, but this time only a 20 min wait. Sara ordered the chicken sausage w/ spinach and mozzarella fries n drink, I ordered my first Chicago style dog and also skittishly ordered the ginger spiked rabbit sausage. The Chicken Sausage was good. The Chicago dog was surprisingly good- I wasn't sure I would like all the toppings on it, but they really go well together. The Rabbit Sausage was delicious-just a hint of ginger, the brie and roasted pepper sauces really brought it together.
