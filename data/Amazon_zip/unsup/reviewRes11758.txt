Lived up to its hype. I went here with a group of 13 people, and they were more than accommodating (although we did reserve the area/table weeks in advance to make certain we would get seated). The large pizzas are huge, and really easy to split amongst several people. The crust is thin and wonderful, and I think that with this type of pizza the more toppings you have, the better it will taste! I didn't think that the pizza was mind-blowing good (it's just good), but I think what makes this place rock is the atmosphere. Lots of different crowds, really tasty beer, and fun music. I will be going back without a doubt.
