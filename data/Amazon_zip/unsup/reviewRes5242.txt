Big fan of this place! Love their cheese board, spirits are awesome, and service is amazing. The roasted bone marrow is amazing!!!! TRy everything on the menu, but be prepared to wait. The line is long to get a seat, and it is hot inside during the summer months!! There is outside seating that is nice, and as mentioned above.....service is awesome. Glad to see this place downtown, and will return every time I am in Chicago.
