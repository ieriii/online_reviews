I have been to Gilt Bar a handful of times and it is a great experience each time. The staff are always willing to give their opinion when solicited about whether they think one dish is better than another (they're all fantastic), or what they prefer. I cannot recommend the pork belly or bone marrow enough. The gunthorp farms chicken is some of the best chicken I've ever had. It's juicy and the portions are very large. I'm not a fan of fois gras but everyone I've gone there with raves about it. I can never cook lentils the way they can. They're bursting with flavor. They have delicious cocktails also, if you're looking for somewhere to go after work for a drink. Put this at the top of your restaurant bucket list!
