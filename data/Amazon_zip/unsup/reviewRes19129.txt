The Gage is a quality dining experience - you can expect sophisticated menu offerings and very nicely prepared food. I've had the pleasure of both dinner and brunch here, and would recommend either. For dinner, you can't go wrong with the seared sea scallops or roasted Amish chicken. The portions are a decent size, and the food is very well prepared. I wasn't keen on the vindaloo mussels - an interesting concept, but it didn't quite the mark. The wine selection is quite nice and the staff is happy to make recommendations. When it comes to brunch, I thoroughly enjoyed the French toast and my partner was excited by the traditional Irish breakfast. The brunch offerings weren't stellar, but certainly left a good impression. My main complaint about The Gage is the way noise carries throughout the restaurant - I could hear every word of the conversation from the table next to us, and there was a woman two tables away that sounded like she was screaming in my ear. And this was at the back of the restaurant - I can only imagine what the noise levels must be like near the bar!
