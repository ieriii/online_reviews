Walking around Chicago at 7 at night in January was probably on one of the less intelligent things I have done. But while looking for warmth I have walked into Sunda. Upon walking in the interior was nicely decorated and it looked fairly busy. Luckily I was able to get a seat at the sushi bar. Everything was looking good so far, but then it quickly fell. I sat around waiting for at least 20 minutes with no one coming by to take a drink order or even give me a glass of water (there goes 2 stars already). Finally I asked a waiter if someone was going to help me and he said he was going to ask the front who is on my station, but then after a few sec he said forget it and he would help me himself since he noticed no one came over (gain 1/2 star).  Once the waiter helped me, everything came out quickly. The fish tasted really fresh, which I didn't expect from not being near an ocean. The uni was the highlight of the meal. It was super buttery and chilled to perfection. The only problem that I had with the whole meal was that the sushi was lacking wasabi. Maybe this is a midwest thing, but I expect when I order nigiri, that the sushi chef would put a bit of wasabi between the rice and sushi to accent it. This was not found at Sunda (hence removal of another 1/2 star, to end up with 3).  Overall the meal was enjoyable, w/ a good selection of Sake. If it wasn't for the initial terrible service, Sunda would have gotten 4 stars. I think it is worth stopping by for a plate of uni.
