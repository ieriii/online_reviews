Went to Geja's on Friday, right at the start of restaurant week. I booked a reservation through their online service and requested a booth. Upon arrival it took about 20 minutes and we got seated at a very private table in the bay window overlooking the courtyard.  Because it is restaurant week all premiere dinners except for the Prince Geja's combo were $32, a great deal. My friend that I brought had never had fondue before, so it was entertaining seeing his reactions to the experience as well. The cheese fondue and the salad came out together which personally feels a little rushed. Previously they had brought out the cheese fondue and then the salad after the cheese completion. Grapes and apples were ripe and the cheese stayed hot till it was gone. The oil fondue came out next after the table was cleaned and upon request they gave us extra mushrooms/potatoes/and broccoli. The oil was really hot but cooled quickly and we had a hard time getting consistency in how the meat and vegetables cooked. The melted butter and shrimp were both of our favorite combinations. The included coffee and whipped cream were a nice break before the chocolate fondue came out. The chocolate, pound cake, pineapple, strawberries, and cherries were quite indulgent but truly enjoyed. We were so full by the time we left that the belts definitely had notch released. Both of us dined, with two glasses of wine, and tip for just under $100. I see this as a great value for the experience. We'll be back.
