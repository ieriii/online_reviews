The wait is seriously RIDONCOLOUS if you haven't strategically put your name down with the hostess and went back home for a nap, get a haircut, or washed your car with your own bare hands. But it's worth it. Their omelettes are seriously the size of my head. I love the spicy one. I also love getting one of their juices. It makes me feel a tad better about ordering anything cheesecovered, fried, and loaded with carbs. It's a bit on the expensive side so think of it as a breakfast-calorie splurge.
