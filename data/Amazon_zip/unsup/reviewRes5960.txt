This truly deserves 5 stars, cause it's as GOOD AS IT GETS! Went there with some colleagues while in Chicago for a conference and one of my colleagues summed it up perfectly- "I simply don't know what to do with all these amazing flavors!" We started with the ricotta honeycomb and all I can say is- WOW!! How is that not a staple at EVERY Italian restaurant!? Simply perfect! And make sure you don't go light on the ricotta on your toast- because you MUST use the toast as a vehicle for that amazingness!! We then got the truffled egg and cheese toast and yep- another amazing dish! It comes with aspargus on the side and surely that was the best asparagus I've ever had.  We ordered some corn salad, which we all thought would be served cold, but nope- surprised us again with the best warm corn salad I've ever had.  We continued to order pizzas and other appetizers, which I now don't remember, but all I can say is that everything from start to finish was HEAVENLY!  If you go to Chicago, you MUST try out this amazing gem.
