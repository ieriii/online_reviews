I'm a meat eater and I have dreams about eating the Chicago Diner's amazing food. Huge fan of their Reuben, also the Titantic Burger. New favorite: the mushroom swiss melt. And their ranch dressing? I could eat it on everything. If you go for dinner, plan to wait for a table, but finding a seat at lunch isn't usually a problem. Also, be aware, they won't seat you at a table until your entire party is present. They serve beer, but are also BYOB, although they do charge a cork fee of, I believe, $10.
