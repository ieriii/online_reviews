If you love pubs, ignore this review. Hopleaf is okay. It's a pub; it's not really my style anymore. I went with some friends for dinner - a reunion of sorts. Service was surprisingly good for the weekend. I didn't expect to have such a solid server with the large crowd. Food was pub food. I really don't know how to rate pub food. 'Nuff said. I thought upstairs was a better place for dining conversation, but when we went downstairs after dinner, it was way too loud and congested for socializing. I wouldn't recommend as a dinner option. I would recommend as a place to get intoxicated. This review is mainly based on dining experience. I exhausted my pub experiences during my college years. No need to relive it again.
