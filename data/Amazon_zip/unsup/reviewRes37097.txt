I had such high expectations for this place, so I think that is why I was a bit let down. Beer...amazing. And thier outdoor space was really nice, I had a fun time here drinking and eating with a girlfriend. We had the Mussels because I was told they were the best in Chicago...I was sadly disappointed. The fries they serve with them are great and the serving for one was enough to feed the two of us. We got the wine and ham mussles, the ham overtook the dish and that his all I could taste. There was twice as much ham chunks as there was mussles and they were a bit dried out. We also shared the beet and orange salad and the ramp waffles. The salad was very good, but I craved more orange. The ramp waffles were pretty bad though, one dimensional and just not very satisfying. Final disappointment was the service...our waitress was helpful and nice, but she was services the entire outdoors, about 12 tables. I had a good time though, despite all of this. And I definetly want to give it another chance ~ I even know what we are going to order this time. Beer mussles, carrot salad and duck ruben. I'm rooten for you Hopleaf...don't let me down again!
