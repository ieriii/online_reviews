Please don't mistake me like I'm an out of towner from the Suburbs of Chicago. Born a raise on the Northside of Chicago(Aka pizza heaven), so don't get me twisted for a guy who just had his first slice of Chicago pizza.  I live life for pizza, I dream about pizza, I talk about pizza, I still have pieces of pizza stuck between my teeth from my last pizza party. I think that at times pizza is my middle name. At one point in life I thought that I was the lost teenage mutant ninja turtle. Piece is where its at. They make a super super super bomb pizza. The dough, cheese, and sauce are to die for. You can tell it's made by pizza lovers, because it's made perfectly to the tee! I'm a pepperoni dude, but this place makes a killer clam and bacon pizza. The sausage, mushroom, and green pepper is killer also. The pizzas are huge also. The pizza is just as tasty the next day when you warm it up in the microwave.  The staff at Piece is super cool and laid back peoples. It's a great spot for big group gatherings, birthday parties, corporate meeting, and first dates. They have a super sick beer selection also, which is a big plus in my book. Thing to remember - Avoid trying to get a table on Friday and Saturday after 7pm. It half near impossible. They do have a take out window. Also it gets really loud in there after dark, with live bands and other parties. In my book it's a top 5 best pizza in Chicago. That's keeping it real. If your looking for Chicago style pizza I would suggest a couple of other places. If your looking for a all around pie then this is the spot.
