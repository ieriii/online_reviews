My dad's Thai and has a pretty extensive background in cooking. He insists on eating at Thai restaurants everytime he spots a new one, and then will laugh/insult/refuse to eat whatever they put in front of him. He's also very picky about the food being authentic, so if something is sweet that's not supposed to be he hates it. With that being said... we repeatedly find ourselves back at Opart. Some things are better than others. I LOVE the basil chicken (or pork, or beef). Make sure to ask for the meat to be ground, rather than sliced. It is very authentic, not sweet at all, and just downright delicious. I ask for it hot, and if it's not as hot as I want it then I just ask for a side of chilies in fish sauce/lime juice. I'm not a fan of their satay. Actually, I've barely strayed from my basil at all because it's so damn perfect. I haven't been to all of the countless Thai restaurants in Chicago, but this one's at the top.
