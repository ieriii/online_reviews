Bacon wrapped dates were a highlight as well as nice dishes of ropa vieja and roasted pork.  I was a little saddened that the pork did not come with any crispy bark-like skin, but the dish was still good. The mojito was delicious, although surprisingly expensive. It was a Wednesday night, but the place was packed because of the Groupon special, and service suffered a tiny bit because of it. Also, we sat in a back area where it was a little too warm because of the kitchen. Overall though, a great experience.
