It was Friday, my friend and I were craving Sushi really badly! We unfortunately were unable to find a table at Sunda on such short notice (BOOK IN ADVANCE), but they were able to accommodate us at the Sushi Bar. The staff was friendly beyond belief, extremely helpful and the food was amazing. They have a special 50% menu for their monday-Friday happy which runs 5-7. I would encourage everyone to try it! Also, Their drinks are really potent and you will be nice a and buzzed by the end of your meal with one of their cocktails.
