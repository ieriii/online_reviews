This place sucks. A large group of ours came here one night because it was one of the few places that was able to accomodate a last minute reservation -- now I know why. We ordered a bunch of things and after waiting for over forty minutes, said something and realized they'd forgotten our order or given it to another table... they comped us some appetizers, but really it was nothing given the huge mistake. The food itself was decent, but nothing to rave about. There is a Foursquare special though, which offers you a cheap cheese flight of your choice. Overall I would not recommend this place to anyone.
