bottom line: has a fairly urban feel to it, and the food is pretty good. the fried chicken is korean style and was probably my favorite thing there, though it did get all over my face (speaks to the sauce they put on there, which was delicious). also tried one of the korean burritos and bibimbap but i probably wouldn't get them again as they didn't stand out. overall, stick with the wings and you should be good to go. p.s. on the fence between 3 and 4
