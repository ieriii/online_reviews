I will just mimic all the good reviews here, but I have to add that nowhere have I ever had grilled onions like they have at Xoco. Onions tasted like effin steak. That's meat, people. What the...?! Marks off for the back and forth of wait staff from front house kitchen to back kitchen. Not fun dodging staff wielding bus boxes. Next time we'll sit down and eat instead of taking to go. Oh, something funny. Since we got our meal to go, when we went into our bag, they actually put real flatware in there. We seriously wanted to go back and return them and would have if we weren't already in Evanston by then. LOL
