I've been twice. The first time was a disaster and the second visit was really good, so I'm going to give it 3 stars.  I'm not a big fan of the interior. It's kind of drab for my taste with dull lighting and the "stalls"/booths they have you in are kind of claustrophobic. Do they really have to close us in there? I guess I know what the animals they serve feel like. The first time I went was a 9:00 reservation on a Thursday and they were out of half the things we ordered. Totally annoying. We were forced to order second tier things that we wouldn't normally order, had everything been available. They only had a few oysters left and one or two of the meats were gone. After the first visit I was going to call this place The Republican't because they couldn't provide anything they had on the menu. The service the first time was awful as well. Impossible to get a beer (plus they were out of some of the beers we ordered)...and 747 jet level loud. A friend of mine invited me to go again last night, though and I considered bailing, but couldn't....and it turned out to be a pleasant surprise. The service in the bar area was great. It wasn't as unbelievably loud as before. They had the beers I wanted and the waiter really knew his stuff in the bar. I'll add that the beer list really is amazing. When we moved to our stall our server was great as well. Very nice and knowledgeable....and they had all the food we ordered! The taste of three hams was fantastic. The pork belly was really delish. The country ribs were a little fatty for my taste, but the flavor was very good. I also have to mention the collard greens. I've never liked them....but one of the guys I was with ordered them and they were delicious. I'll go back....and not so reluctantly this time.
