Chicken is good, but I hate the atmosphere. I don't like the communal tables, music is too loud, and paper towels instead of napkins. Better Korean food is widely available (in other neighborhoods). Poor selection of soft drinks. Maybe fun for a younger crowd, but the food is not good enough for me to go back.
