It's hard to expect anything less than earth shaking from a restaurant that was dubbed with the "#1 ranking" from Gourmet Magazine's "Top 50 Restaurants." Not once but twice. The venue is sophisticated yet humbly understated; a blank canvas for the artistic creations that will hit your table like a spray from Jackson Pollock's paintbrush. Each dish is carefully constructed, using both rare and familiar ingredients, which all equally create a complex, gastronomic dance, on the palate. In a nut shell: It's a culinary experience one should have at least once in their lifetime!
