This place was great--small and quaint, but not too small or kitschy... The service was great. Our waiter was very friendly and I was never without water (which is saying something, as I usually go through several glasses of water). The food was really good and reasonably priced. I had a combination platter, which included a tostada (I chose chicken, and it was really good), a taco (I chose beef, and it was also really good), and a cheese enchilada.  Definitely a solid choice--I would definitely go back.  Overall, a pleasant experience.
