Oh My let the combinations Fly. What a place. Cool Korean Mexican Fusions. I can't think of anything more creative. Tons of food. I came back here a second time, and I got their Korean style fried chicken. Ohh Good GOD does this place make my taste buds give me a kick in the nuts of flavor! food is awesome, people are awesome, easily in my top 10
