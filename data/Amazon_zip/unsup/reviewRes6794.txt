It was my first time to this restaurant, I was very delighted with the hospitality. The waiters are genuinely very nice and makes you feel invited. I liked the ambiance. The tiramisu was as good as any other Italian restaurant. I ordered the clam linguine and the portion size was generous. The minute it arrived it smelt like too much garlic. I was trying to eat it, but to my surprise it was too garlicky. I was thinking that it cant be that bad as all the yelp reviews are so great, it was my palate and I tried to eat quarter of the portion with water and the clams seemed too chewy as well. I took the leftovers home for my husband. He literally took a bite and threw it in the bin since the garlic flavor was so strong. He could not eat it and had to throw it away. There was nothing special at this restaurant that I will crave in future.
