Want to stay at a hotel with rude staff? This would be it. Room wasn't ready at noon; my girlfriend at the time and I left for lunch and came back. It still wasn't ready. The next day, we were out all day and came back at 5pm. The room hadn't been made up. I tried addressing these issues with the manager and she wouldn't have anything to do with it. The only saving grace was the awesome view from the room, including Navy Pier at night. A pretty terrible W experience, when it has been good for the most part.
