I was very excited to try this place, and had been wanting to for over a year after it opened. I am a HUGE fan of the Brazilian food places (ie Brazzaz, Fogo de Chao, etc) And this place definitely did not disappoint. The best thing about this place was their selection of food. Yes, their appetizer bar was a bit lacking in selection, but for what they did have, the quality was amazing. The types of food that was brought around to each table was definitely different than the typical Brazilian place (duck, ahi tuna, venison...you can NOT find these meats at the other places!) The odd part was, the place was not crowded. My boyfriend and I went for dinner around 7pm, and figured it would be packed on a Saturday night...nope. But that did not bother us since our server was VERY attentive (something I have to say that is often lacking at Brazzaz where you can never find your server when you need him or her) and knew his stuff about the meats and restaurant. I've also been on the rooftop for happy hour. I love the couches and the set-up. I can see it getting crowded, so I would recommened getting their early on a Thursday or Friday after work.
