I dined at Zed 451 on a recent trip to Chicago and while a beautiful restaurant, the experience overall was, EHH! The concept reminds me of Brazilian Style dining, however, the food offerings didn't excite me - nothing was super delish, just a dressed up salad bar and meat. The bar and upstairs scene was very cute and good for people watching although a little crowded.
