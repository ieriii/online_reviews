This place gets five stars because, as every real Mexican and Rick Bayless knows, NOTHING beats the tortas, pozole, salsas, churros, and aguas frescas you can get those little hole in the wall taquerias and Mexican deli's. Rick takes that charm and comfort food to a GOURMET level at XOCO. I've been here about three times and everything I've tried is delish. It's Rick Bayless, you CAN'T go wrong! This guy KNOWS his Mexican food. Tips: - Wear comfortable shoes. If you can't make it between 10:30-11:30 am (the best time to go! minimal waiting!) expect to wait for at least an hour! - Don't go with more than two people. This place is made to resemble a small taqueria. Not ideal for groups. - The churros are a MUST DO!
