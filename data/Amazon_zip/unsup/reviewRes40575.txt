I love this place. But, I love it mid-Sunday afternoon when the brunch crowd has dispersed and the dinner crowd hasn't come in. Or, I love it on Thanksgiving night. Or, I love it at 2AM on a cold Saturday night. The staff is friendly - well, most of them - the food is good, and the drink selection is exciting. I love this place ... as does everyone else in the country. I'll always have my memories ...
