If you live under a rock, Grand Lux is cousin to The Cheesecake Factory. That said the food is consistently good. Not great but good. Went for breakfast/brunch and had a plain old omelet and coffee. It's all good. This location is right on Michigan Ave so it does tend to be crazy busy at times but it is conveniently located.
