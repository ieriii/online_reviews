I really have to hand it to Wilde's they are extraordinarily unique in atmosphere, decor, great beer, and some of their dishes are unexpected. As usual I blab about the decor of most of the places I visit, Wilde's is really neat.The best way to describe the look of this place is, a dark English library with a pub. Although it has a dark feel to it, it's also strangely cozy. The crowd varies from young to old and it can get pretty loud in here so if your looking for romantic, this place just isn't it. This place is great for getting together with friends drinking from a great beer selection and having a bite. Their dishes are so unexpected in that within the same menu containing macaroni and cheese and classic American burgers, you have fish and chips and an Irish curry chicken dish. Personally I'm a HUGE fan of the fish and chips here, the only other place that beats them out was some hole in the wall fish and chips place on the Cayman Islands. On the few occasions that I've been here, the servers have been either rude, really awkward, or really nice. Trust me, the food, the atmosphere, and the beer make the rudeness or awkwardness of the servers completely irrelevant.
