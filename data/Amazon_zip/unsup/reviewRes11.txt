Today marks one year since my dinner at Alinea. It was the finest dining experience of my life and it lived up to all of my lofty expectations. In hindsight, it is not the culinary party tricks or the use of technology that still lingers in the forefront of my mind (although each innovative technique employed delighted me and served to advance each dish). My memories fall back on the bright, harmonious flavors and the impeccable (at at times, playful) service. To borrow from Michelin's own rubric, Alinea provided me "exceptional cuisine, worth a special journey." So much so that I I cannot imagine another trip to Chicago without partaking of what ever joys that Achatz may have in store.
