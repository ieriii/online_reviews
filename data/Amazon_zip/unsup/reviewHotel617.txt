3.5 stars. I want to give this place higher, but a couple of things just didn't cut it. Let's start with the positives, then move to the negatives. Pros - location: near Michigan Street a couple bus stops, which help - cookies: try them & you'll understand - lobby w/ free wi-fi - nice gym (open 24 hours a day) - comfy beds - nice pool Cons - my parents & bro/sis had a hard time getting extra toilet paper - the maid service took all day - a shower leaked/broke and took a while to fix - a charge for wi-fi in the rooms per day Overall we were pleased, but if you take the location away it might just be 3 stars. We got a pretty good price and we weren't in the hotel much anyways. I'm thinking I wouldn't mind staying there again if I visit, but I'd probably take my chances on Priceline and see what I get.
