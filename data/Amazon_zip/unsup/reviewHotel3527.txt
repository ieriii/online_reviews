This place is a steal compared to the other swanky hotels off of Michigan Avenue. Yeah if you're used to staying at 4 star hotels and above this might seem like a 3 star hotel to you but it is really a deal for the location. And apparently it used to be the Radisson, but it's better than any Radisson I've seen! We stayed for 4 nights in a 1 bedroom suite with views of Lake Michigan and I only paid about $530, averaging out to about $130/night. But that's with a one room service meal and the ridiculous state tax of 11.9% + city tax 3.5% each night added on. What a deal for such a prime location! Hotel Service: Service by the concierge and front desk was pleasant and helpful. Room service was friendly but they didn't get my order right, but it was partially my fault for trying to order breakfast food at 9pm! They accomodated a late check-out at 2pm. :) Hotel Condition: Newly renovated. Halls are still a little outdated and the lobby could use some more decor, but the rooms have been furnished and decorated well. The pool wasn't open but apparently it's only open from May-Sept. Room cleanliness: Overall, pretty clean but there were some fingerprints and dust on the tables. Room comfort: Since it was a 1-bedroom suite we had ample space but the bathroom was small. The shower head was a rain shower and the pressure was very weak. However, the bed is more important and it was very comfortable. It got pretty cold because the bedroom is surrounded by windows, so we had to keep the heater running, which was pretty loud. It also helped to keep the drapes closed, but that view was so fantastic! There was a large LCD TV in each room, an iPod docking station in the parlor and the best part, an iMac computer with free wireless! I didn't even have to bring my laptop. A mini fridge is only $20 for your entire stay. I would recommend walking over to Wal-greens and buying some drinks instead of using the minibar.
