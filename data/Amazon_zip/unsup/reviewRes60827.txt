This place is outrageous!!! I went for drinks with some girls on a Thursday night. There was a line to get in at 6pm on a Thursday! What made it more frustrating was people kept coming downstairs to check on their friends and said the place was practically empty and therefore lame. Get over yourself! Don't make people stand in line in 90 degree heat at 6pm on Thursday to create the illusion that your bar is packed. To top it off the bouncer is a hot headed russian guy who flipped out on a girl who made 1 comment about how stupid it was that he only let 2 people enter in over 30 minutes. Fire that asshole! You lost 5 customers and received bad reviews. If you like to be treated like shit while standing outside a bar at 6pm on a Thursday then this is the place to go. I left and went to a place that appreciated our business. Go to NOMI it is beautiful and you will be treated well.
