Crowded on a Thursday at 7pm, but there was a table available in the side room (and there were some stools open near the bar too).  The food and drinks were delicious but minus one star for reallllllllly slow/absent service. Our waitress was nice but just didn't come around nearly enough. I had the Big Easy on a pretzel roll - the burger was really delicious and so flavorful that I lost most of the pretzel tastiness - an unfortunate casualty in the flavor wars. One of my friends had the same, and the other had the Red Dragon - they were both also extremely pleased with their meals. On the fries - I had them truffled and they were heaven, one friend had the chiptole and they were dang spicy!! and the other friend went with old bay which was good but subtler than I would have liked. The bad apple martini is delish and adorable, with a gummy worm shoved in the slice of apple garnish. I love it when my alcohol is cute.
