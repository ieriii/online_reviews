I've been a Rick Bayless fan for quite sometime but I never had a chance to go to any of his restaurants. I've tried going to Topo and Frontera but usually the wait is too much for me. Anyway, I finally had a chance to try his culinary creations and I was not disappointed to say the least!! I went for dinner on a Friday and had the Torta Ahogada, it was delicious. I was surprised at how filling it was, the salsa was perfect and the agua fresca was sooo good. Highly recommended.
