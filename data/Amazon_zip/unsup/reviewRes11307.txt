Incredible pizza. Just fabulous - I love a good thin crust, and this is it! They use high quality ingredients and you don't feel like you're eating an entire pan of lasagna with one slice ::coughGIORDANOScough:: It's a fun atmosphere with live band karaoke on Saturdays and normal karaoke on Thursdays. Killer combos: - Bacon and clam on white pizza - don't argue with me, it's just like linguine with white clam sauce plus bacon and cheese - how can it get any better? - Spinach and artichoke on white pizza. It's like spinach and artichoke dip, but it's pizza. Om nom nom... - Mashed potatoes on red pizza. Weird? Maybe. I don't even LIKE mashed potatoes, but they're all hash-brown-y and delicious on this thing. The only problem with this place is that it is insanely difficult to actually eat here. It is always PACKED. There's no reservations except for ginormous groups, so invariably, there are about 10-20 people standing by the door, waiting for a table. A good idea: the pick-up area one door over. You can also go to the bar inside, pick up a "growler" (jug, basically, a la moonshine) of their in-house brewed beer, and take it with you to go. All in all, awesome pizza, great beer, and don't be afraid to order something wacky.
