Ate here recently on a business trip and my only complaint would be that they pack a lot of people into lot a lot of space with communal tables. This can be tough since it's small shared plates. That's the extent of my whining...check that...the beer was also over priced. Food was excellent. For me the highlights were the beet salad, pigs ears, and the milk braised pork. I need to find me a recipe for that one. I would definitely hit this place up again if in Chicago.
