This place is always busy but the wait is usually not that long if you're in a smaller party. Place is very accomodating for larger parties as well. Food is good, a wide variety of american italian, chinese-american cuisine. HUGE portions. I always have leftovers that last me a couple of days. Good options for vegetarians. Check out there summer menu. There mini fish tacos hit the spot. Pretty good, and Im from CA, so I KNOW good fish tacos There dessert is awesome. large portions as well, I would suggest sharing with someone
