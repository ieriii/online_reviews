i love jazz and when i came to chicago, i was told green mill is the best place to go. i totaly agree with this. the atmosphere is amazing . it's a little club where you can drink something and enjoy live music. they serve no food, but you are allowed to bring your own and eat it in there, i never saw that before. the people are very friendly and you get your drinks quickly. the live shows at 8 pm normally starts one hour later, but there's always someone playing the piano behind the bar. the stage in in the back and you have a very good few from all the seats. it's a bit far from the center of chicago, but it's totaly worth it.
