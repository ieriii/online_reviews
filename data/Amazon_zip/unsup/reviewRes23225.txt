Yummy and authentic Greek food at this expansive restaurant. Great for parties or dates, it's a bustling place with a terrific menu. My favorite thing is the Avgolemono-- a delectable lemon chicken egg soup that would eat a gigunda bowl of-- and not need anything else! Fast and efficient service and delciously fresh food. It's a place that I will always to go back to.
