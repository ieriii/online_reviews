Is it good?...yes. Is it 2 and a half hour wait good?...not at all. Ok, so we went last night and waited for over 2 hours (we knew that from other reviews). Once we were seated we thought we were going to embark on a wonderful dinner. Not so much. Our service was marginal, as our waitress barely ever stopped to see us. I had the pork tacos, which were decent and my wife had the flank steak which was also just alright. She was not feeling well and had hoped to take it home, however the busboy had other designs. He picked up the plate and stacked other plants on top of it before she could even ask him to wrap it.  To top off the experience we ended up having some "regulars" sit next to us. They had every single employee in the place come over and talk to them, which I can actually respect. What bothered me was that everyone figured they could lean on my chair, which I did not appreciate. Apparently nobody cared since we were sitting next to preffered customers.  Overall, I feel that the city has much more to offer at a better price. I would choose Los Napoles in Lincoln Square any day over Frontera.
