I yelped this place hoping for a home-y neighborhood joint and 3rd coast delivered on all accounts. Plus the food was extra delicious. First they have freaking bobak sausages, which we had just tried the day before at taste of chicago. I had the banana pancakes, which were so banana-y (that's a good thing). The price was right and the service was friendly. It was really nice to have a slow brunch here before getting started on our crazy tourist plans.
