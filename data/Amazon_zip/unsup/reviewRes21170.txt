I go here for the ahogada sandwich swimming in a delicious tomato-based broth. Maybe someday I'll try a different sandwich, but probably not anytime soon, because the ahogada has me seriously smitten. Now if tamales would be added to the menu, then there might be some serious contention. A girl can certainly dream....
