I was always curious about this brightly advertised restaurant & thrilled when my roommate told me that's where we were going for her birthday.  A group of 6 of us dined there last Saturday and it was amazing. If I had it my way I'd eat their Empanadas everyday! Great appetizer! For dinner, two of us split the Arrachera-skirt steak. It was huge, could have easily been split 3 ways. The raspberry mojitos were going down just as quick as the patron shots- making it to be a very fun, upbeat evening. The atmosphere was alive & everyone seemed to be having a great time. Not to mention, the staff was awesome! Great service with personality! Bottom line, Carnivale will be seeing a lot more of me! :)
