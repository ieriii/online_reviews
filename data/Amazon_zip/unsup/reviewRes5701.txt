My husband and I went here for NYE, it was perfect! We actually didn't have to wait that long to be seated-maybe 20 minutes at the most. The servers/hostesses were so gracious. Our server, Natalia, was excellent. She provided us with great recommendations, including a truffle infused goat cheese.  We'll definitely be back.
