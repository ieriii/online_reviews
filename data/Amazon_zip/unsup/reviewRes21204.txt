Today they get an upgrade, not for the "dawg" but for everything that you would usually skip on the menu. My partner and I are trying to be good Catholics and decided to give up red meat for Lent-- it's good for our health and for heaven! Our Groupon for SD is going to expire before Easter, so we decided that we would make the trip and forgo the beefy goodness of the dogs and burgers.  I was surprised and then stuffed and satisfied.  The fish sandwich had two big pieces of flaky white battered fish. No square "filet" here. The "SuperChic" was delicious too-- juicy with just enough sauted onion and savory bbq sauce. Both sandwiches came with fries and the usual pickled tomato.  We also ordered the "SupperVeggies." Innocuously nestled between the usual fried mushrooms and zucchini you will find a knot of something round.  Maybe it's an onion? Maybe a random glob of batter? No, no. You smell. You examine. You carefully bite down... It's DEEP FRIED CREAMED CORN.  If the thought of a fried, battered, sweet, creamy nugget does not have you running to Superdawg you must be dead. RIP.
