Fresh, not overly-filling, delicious! We had really fast service...maybe too fast because we had to stay well after our meal to finish our bottle of wine (BYOB) wine. We will come back to Icosium many more times, and I would call it a good bet when visitors are in town and you want to do something a little different. Mmmm, I must add that the strawberry & nutella dessert crepe was a really wonderful way to top off our meal and I am still thinking about it 3 hours later! Total damage for 2 dinner crepes (one with meat, one not), 2 soups, and 1 dessert crepe was $33.
