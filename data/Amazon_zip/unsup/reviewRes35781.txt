Hit the oyster bar on a late afternoon for a little snack a doo. Had 1/2 oysters and two Oberon drafts for the low low price of $21. Oysters were most tasty , and the drafts hit the spot too. The oyster bar opens before the restaurant so if you need a little bite before dinner head on down to Shaws.
