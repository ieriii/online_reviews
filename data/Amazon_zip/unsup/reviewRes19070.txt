I have wanted to try the gage since we moved to Chicago in September. I won't say I was disappointed, but I will say it didn't meet my expectations. The food was good, our server was knowledgable, but the actual service was slow and awful. It is amazing how service can really make or break a dining experience, but when you wait for 20+ minutes to even place an order for food and drinks (not to mention how long it took to actually get or drinks or place an order for a second beverage) you know your in for an evening of pretty poor service. We came for restaurant week (maybe that's why we got such terrible service?), and the food was delicious. Don't order the bitter lettuce salad unless you're into that sort of thing - I misread it as 'butter lettuce' my mistake. Still gave it 3 stars because I enjoyed the food. Probably won't return unless I sit at the bar.
