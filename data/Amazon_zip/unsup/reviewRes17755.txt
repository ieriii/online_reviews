I'm torn between giving this place 4 stars or 3. Carnivale does have a great atmosphere with its vibrant colors in their decor and live music. They also have decent drinks: Their blueberry mojito was delicious but the classic margarita tasted a bit too tart. The wine flights are nothing special and you are better off ordering something else. I don't know if I was setting myself up for something impressive based on word of mouth or reviews and the awesome decor but the food was just ok to me. Our group ordered The braised beef and plantain appetizer (Ropa Vieja) maybe a bit too salty for my taste (and I love salt). For an entree I ordered the Chef Daily Fish Special and they were out of the fish they were using so they substituted the Artic Char the dish wasnt very flavorful and the fish a bit bland. I tried some of the halibut and glazed pork shoulder and they were somewhat decent. My boyfriend ordered the new york strip and it wasn't anything special. Carnivale gets a plus on their service, fresh fruit mojitos, and the complimentary dessert for my birthday: a moist banana cake with ice cream and dates (very tasty however its not on their dessert menu)
