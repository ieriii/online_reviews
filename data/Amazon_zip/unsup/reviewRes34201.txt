Had dinner there on 11/16/10 for the first time in a couple years. Not the best experience. Service was mediocre at best. Food below average. Had steamed mussel appetizer that was almost inedible, almost like they weren't cooked, if that was possible. Salad of pancetta and lots of ricotta was ok. All in all, not sure why people like this place.
