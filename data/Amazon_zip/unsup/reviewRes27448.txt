Fav Street Reporter back again. Its been a minute, but you still love me and I still love you. Now lets talk Pequod's: So was with the homie Kelsey K. and she told me about Pequod's. Said it was really that deal. So she jumps on the horn and orders 3 deep dishers for about 10 of our peoples. Damn near was a skeleton by the time it arrived it took so long (roughly 1 hour +), but once it got there......ddeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaam!!! (like when Red got knocked out by D-Bo on Friday). This deep dish is so chaotically hectic! The crust is perfectly buttery and the edge is black (as in burned), but there isn't one bite that is imperfect. Sauce is on point. Cheese and toppings are on point...its crazy. Take it from me, your Favorite Street Reporter, who is from Chi and knows a thing or two about Chicago deep dish. Pequod's may have quietly slipped in that back door and stolen the crown, pulling off the impossible. So lets pay attention....straight up and down...cause this is only a story....from the real... Good talk.
