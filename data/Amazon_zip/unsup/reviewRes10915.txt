The wait is ridiculous for someone like me that doesn't get up for brunch before 9a. I don't like waiting that long for anything. But the food is some of the best brunch food I've had.  The vegetarian eggs benedict with red peppers are amazing! In fact, having these here made me want to try this dish when I go out to most other brunch restaurants, but I've never found another that can match the incredible mixtures of flavors and textures (salty, sweet, creamy, crunch) in the Bongo Room's dish (Jam's pulled pork eggs benedict comes closest, but not quite as tasty or as good of a value). The french toast is good to try, but too much for an entire meal. You can get a slice as a side, but no person with a normal appetite will be able to finish the side and their normal dish. Instead, I recommend spitting a french toast dish and a salty dish with someone if you can swing it. You will then get the best of both flavor worlds, save money, and not waste food. Still, have to give it 3 starts because the wait ensures that I will rarely go back.
