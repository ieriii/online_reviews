Well... ZED451 (what the heck is up with that dumb name?). I was more like ZED082. I love Chicago like it's no one's business. And that's from a Coloradoan who lives in Los Angeles. The restaurant is beautiful and the upstairs is beautiful. That is for sure. Also - it's caddy corner from a decent 7/11. The server/waitress is so beautiful and nice. I came here for restaurant week. We had about 7 women and myself and I just wasn't into the food. The salad/food bar was ok and the cheese and breads were GREAT but we only had a selection of three meats. A curry chicken (INCREDIBLE), beef and salmon. The salmon was also good but it seemed kind of expensive for restaurant week. About $40/50 a person (before alcohol). Give me some deep dish/chipotle any day.
