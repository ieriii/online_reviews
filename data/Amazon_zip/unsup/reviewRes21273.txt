Count this as a 3 1/2 star rating. Julee M. and I came here on a Friday evening after seeing all the stellar Yelp reviews on the place. We sat in the glass tent behind the restaurant.  I would give them 4 stars for service - the waiter was very friendly and attentive and seemed genuinely interested in how we liked everything.  I had a raspberry margarita and a Jamaican flower margarita. If I ever go back it will be for the Jamaican flower margarita - very tasty and had a nice kick to it without making it a one-drink-drunk evening (such as can be had at El Jardin and is not necessarily a good thing).  Due to one of those annoying Libra moments of extreme indecision, I decided to stick to an entree I know and love, the burrito suizo. It was HUGE and came topped with mole sauce that was really good - it had a smokier taste to it which gave the burrito a grilled taste. The guacamole appetizer was nice - very creamy and plentiful. I did not care much for the salsa, and the chips had a vaguely approaching stale texture to them. Overall I thought it was average. I've definitely had better Mexican food, but I wouldn't complain if I found myself dining there again. Especially after a few Jamaican flowers!
