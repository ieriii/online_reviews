Okay for the amount I paid I would expect my food to be WARM. But unfortunately, the highlight of my meal there was seeing Rick Bayless. Otherwise the food was OKAY. I'm a huge Top Chef fan, and I heart Rick Bayless, but the food didn't meet my expectations. I just didn't think it was all that great. Wouldn't go back. Sad face, Rick Bayless.
