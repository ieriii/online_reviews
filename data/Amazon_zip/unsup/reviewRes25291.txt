On our recent trip to Chicago, my husband and I took quite the journey to find ourselves some classic, Chicago-style pizza and I am proud to announce that Pequod's did not disappoint. Is it the best deep dish that Chicago has to offer? I have no idea. But I DO know that after Lou Malnati's was surprisingly closed due to renovations (their loss), Pequod's easily picked up where Lou's left off. Thank you very much. We started with an order of garlic bread. Nothing special, but after our long search it tasted quite good. For our pizza, we stuck with a classic cheese deep dish and it was definitely worth the search. It was everything I'd hoped a Chicago-style pizza would be. Deliciously cheesy with a tangy sauce and crispy crust in all the right places. So so good. After our long walk through random neighborhoods with only an iphone to guide us, I was also surprisingly pleased with the ambiance of the place. Super casual and a bit dark inside. Exactly how a Chicago pizzeria should be. The booths were a little dirty and beat up, but in a good, gritty, Chicago-ish way. Perfect for delving into a pan full of cheese. I really would love to come back again soon...if only we weren't so damn far away.
