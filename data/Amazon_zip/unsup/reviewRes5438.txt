Great spot for lunch. A bit hectic and crowded but the food does not disappoint. For apps, the salt roasted beets were very good. The raw corn and tomato was a pleasant surprise. For the regular dishes, the pig ear with crispy kale was excellent, a must try. The pigs tail and the JLT were both tasty dishes that should be considered too. The JLT could make for a fantastic hangover meal. Overall a tasty place to eat.
