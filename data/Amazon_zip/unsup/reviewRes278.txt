Recently ate here on a trip to Chicago and would definitely recommend it to anyone serious about food. The tour could be shortened by 4 courses - a bit of palette overload going on. It's nowhere near the quality of French Laundry or Fat Duck (I've seen comparisons to both), but it is good. It is a bit pricey for what it is and I'm being really honest here. I have no issues paying $500-1000 for dinner per person if it's worthwhile. This, was not. The wine pairing for the tour was a bit too much. Luckily our table was in the smaller back room -- I say luckily because the other dining areas looked, well, not as cool. Oh and the sommelier is one seriously opinionated person! Question any of his judgments or really really snide comments and it's like World War III. Overall his picks were solid, but he could do without the slanted commentary.
