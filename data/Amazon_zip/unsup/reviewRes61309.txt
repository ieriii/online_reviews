My boyfriend and I came here to avail a coupon that seems to be pretty popular among its clients. Even with that coupon I did not think the food was worth it. The meat is very low grade so yes, it is all you can eat but why would you want to stuff yourself with low grade meats. I had the tuna which made me gag, he had the chicken which he said was dry, and he had the beef which he said was very tough. The only thing he enjoyed were the lamb chops. The service from the servers was nice but I found the matre d to be obnoxious and overbearing. I wanted my tip to go to the hardworking servers, not some old jackass who just sat around dishing out "I AM WATCHING YOU" stares at the staff while waiting to pick up tips like a vulture. Overall the experience was a disappointment. We felt rushed and left with the feeling of bricks in our stomach. A really good Brazilian steakhouse experience is something to be savored and enjoyed, so do not expect this at Brazzaz.
