If you are on the North Side of Town I can't tell you how great the food is here. The presentation is fantastic. The food is great the service is great everything is awesome. And yes as mentioned before the Crab Rangoon is out of this world. BYOB is great for any restaurant and there is a party store around the corner in case you forget. Again check this place out if you can.
