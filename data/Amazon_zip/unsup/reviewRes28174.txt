Apparently I dined at a different Nuevo Leon than all the 5 star crew? More grease on EVERYTHING than I would like to remember. Grease...not the good fat that makes you lick your slippery chops but the stuff that makes fairly robust flour tortillas as transparent as Blogojevich. The famous "starter" soup was salty and left an impressive grease pattern on the sides of the cup. The salsa was tasteless and watery. The steak was cooked well and topped with fried potatoes dripping in skillet grease that pooled around my refried beans and sailed my dollop of guacamole right across my plate. The server was absolutely expressionless and voiceless. After the meal we had to pinch ourselves to wake up from our strange twilight zone of an experience at this place. Strange and really sub par food.
