Once I got over the pure SHAME of tracking their donut truck down 2 mornings in a row, sheepishly ordering my 1 dozen (I shared with someone, I SWEAR!!) cinnamon and sugar adorable little mini donuts...I decided to get over it and proclaim to the world, I love Beavers! ....ok wait a minute... I haven't really been all that into the whole food truck scene. But when you're trudging to work in the morning, with all the unpleasant smells of both the Blue Line and the Subway (that sour yeasty deli meat smell hits ya right in the face) right at the entrance of Wells/Lake, the pleasant, mouth-watering aromas of freshly fried donuts triggered me right out of my morning coma.  The peeps at Beavers are so friendly and down to earth, and helpful about deciding which flavors to try. I was cautious, I didn't want to take a risk on their gourmet donut toppings...best to try the cinnamon sugar first. YUM. I'm full on going for the Strawberry Bella next time. BTW's, I did a little sleuthy peeking around inside and the kitchen is VERY clean and orderly, my kinda place. Give it a try, you can find them on Twitter and they'll post their locations usually somewhere in the loop for a few hours in the morning.
