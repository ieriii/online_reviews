No foodie can visit Chicago and not get a Chicago Dog. And there's no foodie that doesn't know who Doug is. Doug was there.The wait was not as long as I thought it would be. (Around 15 min)The Froi Gras and Duck Sausage was exactly what I thought it would be. The Chicago dog was just as I thought it would be. The fries were extra crispy. I wish they had the duck fat fries the day I was there. (only available on Fri & Sat) I need to come back to try the rest of the dogs this day. I forgot that they don't take credit cards, just cash. So keep that in mind.
