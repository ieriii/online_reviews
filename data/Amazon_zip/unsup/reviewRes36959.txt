It is simply inexcusable in 2012, regardless of how good your food is, how good the beer list is, how nice the new renovated space is, when you sit down for a $70 meal to be charged $2.50 for a (very slow) fountain refill of diet coke and to only discover it when the bill arrives at the end. Owners beware. It stops people like myself from coming back with my million friends in the neighborhood.
