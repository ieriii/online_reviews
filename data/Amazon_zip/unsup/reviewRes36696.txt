LOVE this place. There is always a line here on the weekends, so be prepared to wait. I come here at every opportunity I get. I agree that the service isn't the best. The place is crowded and can get loud when it's packed. But, for the price and what you get, I can get over the service. It's easy enough to get the attention you need if you just speak up. I have yet to try something that I haven't liked. The omlets are huge, the eggs benedict great, and the sandwiches are so good! There is something here for even the pickies eater. Come hungry, because everything here is big. Try one of their juices or smoothies--they can definitely help a hangover.
