I am a picky eater so was a little nervous about eating at a Columbian food. Had the skirt steak (i know what your thinking not the best cut of meat) but it was fricken amazing! with it was two six inch long uncut pieces of calimari also amazing. Went on a Tuesday night for BYOB. Comfortable, casual, great service! The boyfriend had the NY strip, not as good but was still great. You must try this place!
