WOW. Best hotel I've ever stayed at. I tend to like modern / minimalist hotels and while the Ritz wasn't that it struck a nice balance between old elegance and modern. The service was PHENOMENAL. The staff were what tipped the scale. Everyone was friendly and helpful. They help elevators open for you. Loved turn down service. Concierge was friendly when I asked for advice on places to eat. Facilities were great (nice pool and lobby). Location was convenient. The views facing lake Michigan were awesome. Loved that you could get your shoes shines for free by leaving them in a bag. My girlfriend joked that if they could legally walk you to the bathroom and hold your hand they would. It was a joke but exemplary of the extent to which they value customer service. Everything just came together. Very impressed. Video: View from our room: http://www.flickr.com/ph Also, was very happy with the free wireless ( wifi ). It was slow but if that bothers you it is only $10 a day for faster wireless.
