Had a nice dinner here with husband and a friend before a show.  We thought our friend in particular would enjoy eating/drinking here because of the wine flight aspect. I had 2 flights of wine = 1 average, 2 good, 2 very good, and 3 excellent. Charcuterie board was OK, cheese flight was well composed of interesting selections. Hanger steak was fabulous. I would have preferred to order and share several appetizers instead of an entree, but their menu isn't all that deep or interesting in that respect. Fun evening though.
