I will keep this short and sweet - this is one of the best finds in Chicago. VERY reasonably priced meal options with well sized portions. The staff was attentive and knowledgable. The food was so delicious and I can not wait to go back. Get the deconstructed bloody mary fish entree. I know, sounds bizarre, but so good!!!!!!!
