A legitimately underrated spot in Chicago. Everyone has probably seen Graham on Masterchef and wondered how good his restaurant is. I can definitively say that I absolutely loved it. I ate at GE while on a swing through the mid-west and GE had the unenviable situation of being my dinner reservation the night after I had my mind blown eating at Alinea and while certainly not on that level, the food was quite good. I loved the foie gras lollipop with pop rocks...never would have thought of it but was quite delicious. Truffle butter popcorn was great...probably ate too much of it. The plates are small, but if you get a tasting menu, you get a ton of them, and the dishes were very nicely balanced and the presentation was beautiful. The "honey" desert course was the pleasant surprise of the evening. Probably my second favorite restaurant in Chicago.
