Swine lovers rejoice. The best time to hit this place up is right after it opens on Sundays. Minimal wait times. If you stroll in after 12pm, your group might be in for a wait. Natalia was very helpful guiding me through the customer favorites and I pretty much stuck to her recommendations. I started off with the marrow. "Meat butter" as she pointed out. But you need the herbs and capers sprinkled on top of this to really enhance the intricate flavor. The crunch of the bread is really great. I moved on to the testa. Cured swine goodness at its best. Slightly salty but yummy non-the-less. The pig ears hit the spot. The crunchiness of the ears, crispness of the kale, combined with the gooeyness of the egg. Who can ask for more? Apparently I can. The best dish of the brunch would be the pig tail. I was expecting curly morsels but this was even better. It seemed to be the part closer to the base of the tail. It has enough fat to keep you happy but not too much to feel like you're biting into grease. As the fat gives way to bone, meaty goodness awaits. The meat was very tender and flavorful especially if you spoon over the broth/sauce that it wades it. Do be shy and eat it like a chicken wing. Finished up with the sweetbread. Nicely breaded, but after the pig tail, the flavor was not that memorable. I'll be back for more in the future.
