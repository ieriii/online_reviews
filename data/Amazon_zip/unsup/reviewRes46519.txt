I absolutely love R.J. Grunts. My mom has fond memories of R.J.s from the 70's, and now I enjoy coming here. Every time I am craving a really good burger, I come here. I also like to take guests here. They always enjoy the food, and the big menu offers a lot of different choices. I've never tried the famous salad bar though, because I am always craving one of their burgers! Pros: Really friendly staff, yummy, huge burgers, kitschy 70's decor, a free chocolate chip cookie with ice cream on your first visit, Lincoln Park Zoo across the street, watching cars trying to parallel park Cons: Parking is a nightmare in this area-best to take public transportation or a cab, can get super crowded on the weekends with long waits
