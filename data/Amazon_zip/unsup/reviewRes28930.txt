came here yesterday with some friends because they never tried Pequods before. we were seated by the entrance which kinda suck cause whenever ppl leave or enter the restaurant, a cold breeze would come to us. we ordered french fries and a large pizza with pepperoni, sausage and mushrooms.. the fries came out first and was kinda disappointed because there was alot of ketchup packets on the side .. i mean what restaurants still used ketchup packets instead of a bottle besides fast food places like McDonald's and burger king.. the fries was just ok. after awhile the pizza finally arrived and the person that brought it out would serve it to our plates.. it was delicious! out of all the pizza places i have gone to, i love Pequods the most.. my friends think it was good too.. it tasted fresh and they didn't cheap out in the ingredients like most places do. the service was good too... we will be back soon
