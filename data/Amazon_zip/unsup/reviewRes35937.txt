This was my second trip to Sun Wah and we were a group of 12 for a celebration. We ordered 2 Peking ducks prior to our visit an enjoyed a variety of SunWah's dishes including: beef and broccoli, Mike's BBQ chicken, tofu and pork, a couple different fried rices, beef and noodles, pot stickers and last but not least the peking duck (with soup and duck fried rice). Mike's BBQ chicken is one of the best that many of us remarked on. Every dish was incredible and the peking duck was exceptional - from the presentation to savoring it in the steamed buns. Another table ordered the whole pig and the presentation was quite impressive. A great night all the way around. Thanks Sun Wah!
