Sultan's was a staple of my diet when I lived a few blocks away from it, from their fresh-made hummus to the chicken shwarma to the honey soaked treats lining the main counter, everything is perfect. You could be fine with ordering a pound of hummus and pita and snacking on it for the next 3 or 4 hours (you will not be able to stop!) or maybe a falafel sandwich extra spicy... I can't think of a time where I didn't enjoy my food here. On top of wonderful food, the staff is really nice and lady are register is pleasant as can be. I still go here constantly even though I live significantly farther away, best Middle Eastern I have found in Chicago.
