This was my first time dining at brazzaz, and to be quite honest, i wasnt too impressed. I've definitely experienced better. The food was good, the salad bar wasnt as exquisite as i had expected or seen in other places (i.e Texas de Brazil), the meat was well prepared, and the servers rounded in a timely manner and were keen to my needs. I went there with a coupon, buy one dinner at full cost (48.50) and get a 2nd complementary meal, but it turns out that i had paid more than expected because of a 15% gratuity which they added to the full price of $97. This threw me off, as i had used a similar coupon elsewhere and i didnt pay this much. Overall i would say I had a much better experience at Texas de Brazil and i probably wouldnt dine at Brazzaz a second time.
