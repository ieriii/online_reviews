This was my first time eating here, as it was recommended by a security guard at the sear tower. Omg,...i cant thank him enough! I absolutely LOVE this place. The pizza was deep dish, the tomato sauce was not to think and not to thin, with a great flavor. the chesse was stringy, and im a chesse lover! this was the best pizza i have ever tasted. You may purchase pizza online,...visit http://www.giordanos.com,..travelled in 2008
