- Amazing quality paired with excellent value! - Ricotta and honeycomb - enough to spread onto probably 8 pieces of large buttery pieces of toast - Truffle Toast - simple yet delicious and rich. The truffle oil and egg yolk compliment the asparagus below perfectly. - Burger and beer deal on Mondays - amazing value... You can order any beer including a matilda ($6) with your burger for $10. The burger is one of the best I've ever had. Perfectly cooked and seasoned and topped with bacon jam, roasted tomato, cheese curd, arugula, roasted garlic mayo.  - Rigatoni with sausage, oven roasted tomato and parmesan - the pasta is cooked al dente and tastes very fresh. Combination of sauce, sausage and pasta are delicious. - Raviolo and Risolto Carbonara - both very rich (with egg), especially if you've ordered the truffle toast and ricotta and honeycomb already. However, the flavors are wonderful if you are looking for something rich and creamy. - Check out the menu for their daily specials!
