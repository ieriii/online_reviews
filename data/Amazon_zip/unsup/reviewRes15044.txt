Wow, where to start? Most of ya'll have pretty much covered. I was there the day they opened and again that Friday. I'll be going back again this weekend. I'll be going here a lot, actually. First off, the beer is really good. Can't say it's knock your socks off amazing, but it's damn solid. The Cross of Gold is my favorite so far, but I haven't made it in to try the Wit, which will hopefully surpass it. The Gold is just a well textured beer with a great flavor profile. Refreshing and num num. The porter could use a little more body, in my humblest opinion. The Workingma's Mild has great caramel tones and is a close second to the Golden. The Pale Ale tastes a bit hoppy for me, and the IPA has great aromatic hops and isn't too bitter, which I like cuz hoppy beers are a bit played out in my mouth. Second, the food. OMFG. A gastropub with V items on the menu. Thank you RBC for answering my biggest wish. The reuben holds up to even the Chicago Diner's--as much as I hate to say that. You're fries are super num num. Crunchy and well seasoned in a nice portion. Presentation doesn't hurt either. Ambience is super classy. The open air feel of the place is wonderful, and what a bar you all have. I love how's it's the main feature of the room. Too bad the place isn't about twice as big, because last 2 times I was in there it was packed. Also, I'd like to be able to see more of the brew setup. Please tell us when and if you'll be doing tours. Thanks for this great spot for us beer nerds to congregate to. Viva la Revolution.
