Went to Little Bucharest tonight for dinner. Parking was easy and convenient. Had appetizers of saganagi and eggplant spread. Saganagi was great and eggplant okay. The dinner of short ribs goulash left alot to be desired. Had apple strudel for dessert and how ccould apple streudel be flat and tasteless?Drinks were good, but VERY small portions - not worth the money. I will not go back. THere is absolutely no light fare on the menu. It would have been nice to see a dinner salad instead of very heavy food.
