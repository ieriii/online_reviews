Great neighborhood Thai place. Must have the signature curry...yum! The curry is so tasty. Crab rangoon is my favorite in the city...actually, my #1 compared to all I've ever had from the east coast to the west coast! Sushi is good.  Finally a decent restaurant in Edgewater/Rogers Park.  Delivery and eat-in food quality are the same, so they are consistent.
