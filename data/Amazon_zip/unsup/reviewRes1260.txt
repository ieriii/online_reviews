You've got a billion reviews that state how good this place is. You've got a changing menu based on Doug's preferences. You've got encased meats that are wild game, that you may never had the opportunity to try elsewhere, done up gourmet style. You've got affordable and high end... the simple Chicago dog all the way to foie gras. You've got Doug, possibly the most involved and friendliest restaurant owner I know who makes it point to greet every customer coming in. And the wait for a table is deceptive... people are in and out much faster than you think. Hang around and take in the decor! Just go! What more convincing do you need? Highly recommended.
