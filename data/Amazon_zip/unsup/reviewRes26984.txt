Get ready for an experience. That's what you get when you go to Frontera. If you are just looking for a meal, there are several other options in Chicago. The wait for a table is long, but so worth it. The dining room is small and first-come, first-served, but luckily there is a large bar with delicious drinks and appetizers to help the time go by. We had the guacamole and the Ceviche trio; both were delicious and flavorful. The drink menus include a variety of margaritas and cocktails as well as craft beer, including a beer made especially for Frontera by Goose Island. When we finally got our table almost 2 hours later our server was very attentive, knowledgeable about the food and drinks, and very personable. The food was out of this world with the standouts being the Carne Asada and Goat special.  And the whole experience was topped off by a Rick Bayless sighting. Viva La Frontera!
