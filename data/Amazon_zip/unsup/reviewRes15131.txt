reminds me of a place right out of a italian mobster scene. the old italy feel makes this place feel super cozy. there's even 2 guys playing the violin (i think) and they'll serenade you at ur table. the people there are great. super friendly and attentive. the food is really good too. not to mention, their portions are HUGE. i always have leftovers to take home from this place. the salad and "pizza" bread is complimentary which is a nice old school touch. we typically get the seafood linguini (not sure what the real name is) and the roasted chicken with wild rice. yum. i'm getting hungry just thinking about this place.
