I've been to many vegan places, but I think this place stands out. Instead of using the usual mock meat patty, the buddha burger was made from an interesting combination of potatoes and spices. Like the other reviewers I enjoyed the sweet potato fries. The best thing about this diner its that they use temptation vegan ice cream. I had hands down the best vegan shake here. The temptation brand isn't available nationwide, so if you are visiting Chicago make sure to try it!
