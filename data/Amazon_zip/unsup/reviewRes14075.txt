The GF and I came here for lunch on a rainy Saturday. Because of the rain, outside seating was not an option. Unfortunately, inside seating is limited to seats at a wrap around counter. That's not a big deal when people are considerate, but the restaurant seemed to be full of couples who could care less about anyone else. Now, I don't hold it against the owners of the restaurant, but it was pretty annoying.  It may seem odd that I gave such a high rating to 90 Miles Cuban Cafe when the intro paragraph is a rant, but the food is that good.  I had a cuban sandwich and ropas vieja sandwich and they were both excellent. I also had the french fries, which were excellent. They were golden brown and crispy. The maduros were great too.  Our entire meal was about $21. I think there were some reviews that say the price is too high, but I think it's a bargain. I'd definitely like to try dinner here.
