Hot diggity dawg!!! Fresh fresh fresh pasta? CHECK! A huge delicious menu? CHECK! Garlic, Parmesan, & red pepper flakes to mix with your olive oil? CHECK CHECK and CHECK! BYOB? HELLA CHECK! I can't wait to take my parents here. It's a bit more expensive (most entrees around $19) but big enough portions to take home for lunch the next day.
