Simply - the best meal I ever ate! It is elegant and every last detail from decor to the gourmet aesthetic of each dish is engaging. My fiance and I had the tasting with the wine pairing. PLUS the cheese, dessert cart, and truffles to go. Our first time spending 4 digits on a dinning experience. Worth it...YES!! We went a little overboard getting everything in tru epicurean fashion, but you have to treat yourself once in a while right! I want to go back - SO BAD!
