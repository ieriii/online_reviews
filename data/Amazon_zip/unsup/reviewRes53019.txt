This place has a great ambiance - love, love their outdoor heated patio, relaxed BYOB attitude, painted mural, latin music, etc. but the food was a huge let down. I was in the mood for empanadas and when they came, they were barely warm and had clearly been sitting out all day. There were no dipping sauces, etc. My date had a pork dinner plate and also said it wasn't very hot. His tasted good but nothing seemed fresh - just reheated. I also felt a bit of pressure from the waiter to order more. He kept saying .. is that it? Are you sure you don't want more? I wouldn't mind going back for the patio but until the food improves, I need to continue my search for awesome empanadas.
