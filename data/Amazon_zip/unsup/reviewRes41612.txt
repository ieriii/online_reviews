While I don't claim to know anything about Vietnamese food, I come here mostly for the banh chuoi hap. It's some sort of steamed banana cake made with tapioca flour and doused liberally in warm, salted coconut milk sprinkled with peanuts and lemongrass. It's my favorite dessert of all time, and I'm not big on dessert at all. We also come here for the pho. Again, no idea whether it's authentic or not, but the portion is HUGE and we love the one with bible tripe and soft tendon in it- it sounds gross, but the soft tendon is totally delicious. The service is mixed, sometimes it's great, sometimes sort of inattentive- but I'm not really into the whole American way of servers asking whether you're okay every five minutes, anyway. Tank is cheap, filling, and as long as they keep serving banh chuoi hap, I will keep coming!
