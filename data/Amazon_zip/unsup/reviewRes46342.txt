My co-worker took me here for lunch, and it's very much like the Cheesecake Factory experience - large portions, pricier dishes, good ambiance. Their selection is also pretty spread out, so you'll be able to find something you will inevitably like. The place is definitely worth checking out once, but I'd stay away from repeat visits. Also, be prepared to bring home food. Even their sandwiches are enormous.
