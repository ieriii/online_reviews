I went here with a friend to try the famous 4 Courser, as featured on Adam Richman's Best Sandwich in America midwest episode. It was ok. Really not the best, just ok. The sweet potato fries were also just ok. The wings were, really, ok. I didn't find anything special about this place EXCEPT the atmosphere. The plethora of flat screens made watching the Cardinal's beat the Cubs even better. There is also a tv outside so that patio patrons can also enjoy the game. The waitstaff are young, friendly, fun and funny women as typical in sports bars but that made the evening more enjoyable. The manager even came over and chatted with us which is always a plus in my book. Would I go out of my way to go there? Probably not. If I'm in the area, yeah I'd go back. I recommend that you go there too, if you are close by! Ask for Elle, she rocks.
