me & san soo have a love/hate relationship.  whilst i love the ridiculous amounts of food (especially the 3483943 different plates of pan-chan -- i.e. little side dishes -- that are unlimited to refill), the service is pretty terrible. for example, your water may never get refilled. i always order the "set A" because it's only $19.95/person, but you have to order a minimum of 5 orders -- FIVE! who goes to eat with 5 people?! why not 4? for some reason i'm always going to san soo w/ 4 people. but set A comes with seafood pancake and i cannot resist. also, parking is terrible, and saturday nights have a crazy wait, and there is virtually no "waiting area" so on a cold night -- have fun waiting outside!
