I love that place! It is mostly a french cuisine. He has a very wide selection of appetizers and entrees. They are a little bit on pricey side. And valet parking will cost about 20 dollars For appetizers I have the shrimp wrapped around a sugar cane and it was absolutely phenomenal for the entree I had the seafood soup also very nice. The 1 thing I really enjoyed about this place does the staff would sit and explain to you how to eat your food. Also explains why the food is the way it is meaning which parts for cleansing the palate, so on. I do think it is a little romantic but not as romantic as everybody describes it otherwise I think it's a great place definitely meats all my expectations and more.
