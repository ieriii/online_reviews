I really love watching Rick Bayless' TV show and enjoy his adventures and cooking. I was really looking forward to trying out his restaurant when I was in Chicago on business. I dropped by for lunch, and had the special. I had a tamale, black beans and rice; and maybe it is because I am from California, or maybe because of what I ordered, but I expected more. I think the food was a little bland, although, I know it has to be made for all to enjoy and I do like things a little spicier. The service was great and reasonably priced. Maybe I should have tried carne asada, or shrimp ceviche, guess I am just spoiled being from so calif.
