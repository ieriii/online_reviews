I had a friend come in from California and this was our first stop. When we arrived around 6pm, the place was a little overlit, which made it feel a bit like a cafeteria, but that was quickly remedied. :) The 15 cheese plate was amazing, an astounding array of mild to strong, soft to hard cheeses. And paired with a flight of pinot noir and a flight of burgundies, I was in heaven! (How can you go wrong with fabulous red wine and cheese!)
