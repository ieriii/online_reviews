I love this place and the waitstaff is AMAZING. My friend heckled a couple of staff members and I did a fair amount of staring at our waiter in tight jeans. With all of that said AND being a large group, everyone at Caro Mio treated all of us as valued guests.  It's difficult to describe the food without my mouth watering... We started off with calamari that was cooked to perfection. I had the spinach gnocchi as an entree and it was hands down, the BEST GNOCCHI I have EVER eaten. I had bites of the lobster ravioli and it was delicious but I didn't eat too much of anything else because I didn't want to (and didn't) stop eating the gnocchi. The portions are sharing sizes (for most humans but not me that night) which makes the food prices very reasonable. Caro Mio is one of the going on my list of best BYOB resturants in the city. I'm looking forward to my next visit!
