While the most delicious dish I ate was a side and the ahi tuna and kale disappointed, there is no restaurant I want to go back to more than The Publican. Here's what my wife, my friend, and I tried from least to most enjoyable: Kale: as kale is one of my favorite greens to make at home, I expected a beautiful dish, but got a salty, soggy one. When I return, I'll try the sunchokes instead Ahi Tuna: this had some good pickled vegetables on it, but the tuna itself imparted a slight fishiness, and I would have preferred it less cooked. Next time, I'll choose the cobia crudo. Shaved Brussels Sprouts: considering how much I love Becker Brussels Sprouts from the Joy of Cooking, I'm usually underwhelmed by other recipes. The grilled onion and mint in this one left me whelmed. Breton Butter Cake: I loved the slight moistness and sweetness of this dish, especially combined with the rhubarb confit, but it still couldn't match the next four dishes. Taste of Three Hams: the serrano was intense, the prosciutto won me over by the second bite, and La Quercia Rossa proved incredibly smooth. Lamb Sausage: this was brilliantly spiced and the bed of lentils, fennel, and yogurt it sat in was richly complementary. Duck Breast: the amazingly juicy duck with a crispy skin beats out even the Peking duck at Golden Unicorn in New York's Chinatown or my favorite duck taco. Sweet Potatoes: I could eat these little chunks of sweet potatoes and drink the Romesco sauce they're smothered in all day. Incredible.
