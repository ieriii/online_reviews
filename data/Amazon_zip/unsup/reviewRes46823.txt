Went here after passing it to many times and wanting too then saw it won most eco friendly restaurant and had to. It was good, nice ambiance, food was good, waitress was awesome. My only complaints were the host was a bit pretentious and that this location doesn't serve the duck entree it advertised on its online menu anymore. Which of course is what I was really looking forward to trying. According to our waitress the Lakeview location still does, so may have to check them out sometime too. The menu is limited though there are only about six entrees to choose from. Unfortunately although all looked appetizing none were what I was in the mood for that night so I just went with the chopped salad and split their sweet potato fries with my friend. Both were very yummy.
