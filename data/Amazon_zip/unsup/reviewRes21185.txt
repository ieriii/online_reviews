I eat here alll the time, how is this not in my reviews?! This place just rocks. I can never express how much I love it, I just take people here and show them!! The burritos, quesadilla supreme, and chimichangas are amazing, you can't go wrong. Def comes here on Tues and Thurs for half priced ritas. The dudes who work here know me, no joke. They love me and I love them more cuz they bring me great food. They use great chicken, not diced up crap!
