OH SNAP! Damn these dogs are good. Gourmet encased meats really hits the nail on the head. If you are looking for something ridiculously exotic between your buns I'd go with the "Brown Ale Buffalo Sausage with Three Floyd's Alpha King Mustard and Horseradish-Cheddar Cheese" or you could always try a rattlesnake sausage creation. We asked Doug how he came up with these ideas, "Doug were you high when you invented your flavors?" he said no, because if he was everything would just be covered in cheese and funyuns, lot's of funyuns. Eat at Hot Doug's, but be prepared to wait a bit on the weekend. Well worth it though. Say hi to Doug when you see him.
