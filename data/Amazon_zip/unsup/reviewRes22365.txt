Superdawg makes my favorite Chicago hot-dog. Overpriced or not. To me, it's worth it. Their dogs are hard to beat. (And, yes, I've had both Gene & Judes and Hot Doug's.) They are always perfectly cooked, very juicy and have that slight hint of garlic...yum! Plus the dogs are definitely considerately larger than those other places. So of course you are going to pay more! Yes, you can get a hot dog for $1 at some places, but you get what you pay for. Plus where else in the city can you go for a cool drive-in feel?
