Yes I am hard to please, but what's wrong with that. Just because I go back to a place a few times doesn't mean it is great, and the converse is true also - just because I don't go all the time doesn't mean it sucks. Irazu is right in the middle. I go every once in a while not because it is exceptional in any real way, it is just fairly solid food that usually is seasoned pretty well at a price point that leaves little room for complaining even if it is less than perfect. You kinda need a place or three like that in your life, one that falls off the radar screen until you drive down Milwaukee, remember you are hungry, make a mental note to stop in sometime soon, finally stop in for a bite a week later, wait too long for your simple peasant food, then finish a not-so-bad torta & oatmeal shake as you contemplate all the little reasons why it will be minute before you return. Rinse, repeat.
