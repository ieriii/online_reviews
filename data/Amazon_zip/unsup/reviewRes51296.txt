Garcia has gone through a recent remodeling which has certainly upper their game. However, along with the space and decor changes there also seems to have some change for the worse regarding their food. As of the last few visits, I can without a doubt lay claim that their finished product is far less superior to its historic predesessors. The best way to describe it is BLAND. It looks good, smells good but just fails to impress or at the least satisfy in the taste arena.  I have been going to Garcia for almost 20 years and it is unbelievable that I am even writing this as I consider myself a franchise customer. I can deal with the occasional mistake and the overall deadly slow service, I always "gave them" those as the payoff was always well balanced.  The game changes when you have bad service and the food is beneath mediocre. It's going to be tough to go back there again and the next time I have a taste for this type of food I will likely go to El Asadero on Lincoln and Montrose. It's a small hole in the wall where you come out smelling like their grill, but the quality of food and flavors are chart topping.
