Fox & Obel, you used to be one of my favorites of all time! What wouldn't I do for one of your lobster club sammies? It used to be so dreamy, along with the rest of your cafe experience! I'm calling it quits, F & O, you had far too many chances. Yesterday will be the last time I ever stop by Fox & Obel. Simply put: quality has gone down, down, down, down. They've removed their free valet too and that was a great perk. Long of it: I picked up breakfast for myself, along with a to-go order of sammies for my mother-in-law. We went to the Flower & Garden show at Navy Pier and I wanted to make sure she had a tasty lunch. The roast beef and brie sandwich that I used to sacrifice my jaw to/for was DISGUSTING.....I just took the beef out because it was too hard to chew! The other half is sitting in my fridge to mold, because I don't know what else to do. It gave me horrible indigestion. I didn't try the turkey/cranberry sammie I got for my mother-in-law, but she certainly wasn't glowing with admiration from it.... The burnt latte and nasty breakfast "panini" was what did you in, F&O..... I have never asked for a latte to be re-done, ever. A nice woman did make the drink again after I couldn't tolerate another sip, but it was marginally better. Might I suggest that you start using "The Bridgeport Cafe" beans? Their beans will give your customers the kick-in-the-pants experience they're after and it won't be BURNT..... The breakfast panini was served on greasy slice bread, not panini bread. It was really unsatisfying..... Last word to you, I read about your grand opening years ago, about your vision and really fell in love with it as a fellow world-traveler who loves trying unique food. The lobster club used to be out of this WORLD tasty and now it is so lackluster I don't know what to do to get my fix! Adios Faux & O-my-bel-ly!
