This place was great. The service was amazing from beginning to end and although my date there was a bust, I came out a huge fan of Texas de Brazil. The manager came to our table twice to check up on the evening and just to talk, which was definitely welcomed. Our server was simply amazing--I would take two sips of wine and before I could put the wine glass down, she was already back at the table refilling my glass with the wine we'd ordered.  The gauchos were so helpful and great. A couple even let us request what we wanted instead of just making us wait til it came out. They also would come by the table anyway, even if our coin was flipped over just to show us a certain cut, in which I had to take anyway because it just looked so good. The server was always just around the corner if we needed anything and was a great help in suggesting things to try pertaining to wine, dessert and drinks. She wasnt overbearing but yet was around just enough so I didnt feel neglected. Great place, service is amazing. Definitely going back with better company! :)
