I went to Sunda for brunch w two of my friends and was very impressed. The decor is so nice, as are the staff. Everyone is very personable and friendly. I had the tempura french toast batons and OH MY GOD were they delicious. They weren't your average french toast at all and i def didnt leave with any leftovers! I had a strawberry mimosa and my friend had a mango one-both were very good. My other friend wanted chocolate milk-which was not on the menu, but our server Amber made it for him out of whatever was avaliable in back-which we all thought was VERY nice! Overall, I'd recommend Sunda to anyone and I'm looking forward to checking out their Sushi...and If your on twitter you can follow @sundachicago @billydec or @aeronsunda for some cool updates and sometimes even vip treatment :)
