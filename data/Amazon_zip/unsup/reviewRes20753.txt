It's your typical touristy American food restaurant. The portions are way too big, which is always a turn off for me but the quality of the food was still pretty good. I got "The Gage" USDA Prime Burger" which was $16.00!!! It came with a ginormous bowl of fries, which made me full just by looking at it... But hey, you can always split the meal with a friend!
