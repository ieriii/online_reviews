This place is over-hyped. The crowd was your typical 20 something group (I'm in my 20's, so this is not a dig against those in their 20's...) straight out of college with their frat T-shirts on underneath their overly starched suits. It was difficult to get to the bar because those previously mentioned were standing in large groups blocking access while waiting for their blind date or office romance to show up. When we were finally seated (though we had a reservation), we were put in the middle of an aisle with poor server attention. The food was about as exciting as rush hour traffic, took a while to get, and was not what was ordered. Sadly, disappointed overall.
