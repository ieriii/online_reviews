Screw the reservation, real men sit at the bar, so we did (right before the John Mayer concert of course). Honestly one of the best places I've been to in a while in Chicago. The hype doesn't lie. We got a couple of delicious recommended beers, and being pleased with them, decided to let the waitress pick the rest of our menu. She didn't do too bad - the oysters were fresh, the ham delicious, the artichokes (who eats artichokes) came with the freshest cheese i've ever tasted (burrata) which actually had no taste and was mostly all texture, the asian marinaded pork ribs were amazing, and just when we thought it couldn't get better, they brought out the braised pork belly with curried cauliflower ... mmm mmm good! Decided to get some desert too, which wasn't a bad decision whatsoever. Left happy and the walk to United Center burned off most of the calories.
