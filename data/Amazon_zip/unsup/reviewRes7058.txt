Top 5 reasons to get a bloody at q: 5) price - $6 per is a steal, especially considering reasons 1-4 below 4) they will mix their spicy BBQ sauce (on request) to the standard bloody mix 3) they rim the glass with their pork shoulder dry rub, which is a little sweet/a little spicy 2) they use smoked olives 1) they give you a bacon twirl that surrounds your straw...when available The food is great too (try the smoked dry-rub wings) but the bloodys alone make q a destination visit.
