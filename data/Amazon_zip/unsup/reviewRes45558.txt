My GF and I come here quite often - I think the Library might very well be one of my favorite places in Chicago to eat/relax/talk. The prices are pretty reasonable for the offerings/surrounding area, and the service is quality stuff (as is the moderately-sized but quality array of beer that they offer - the GF loves Magic Hat). Do try the Shepherd's Pie and/or the Fish and Chips. Good appetizers, as well. Interesting ambience - the interior is well designed, and the art is tasteful and perfect for the type of atmosphere the Wilde Bar folks are projecting. Eclectic and fun mix of patrons. Music is hit-or-miss sometimes, but for the most part it works.
