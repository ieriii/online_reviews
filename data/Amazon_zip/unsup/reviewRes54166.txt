We've eaten here a few times now, and it's great. Like others have said, the caldos were initially too salty, but they seem to have cooled out on the sodium. The wild mushroom torta is one of the best sandwiches I've eaten in the city. The one thing we haven't been thrilled with is the seafood caldo; the broth doesn't have much flavor and the fish is mediocre. I've really enjoyed everything else I've tried.
