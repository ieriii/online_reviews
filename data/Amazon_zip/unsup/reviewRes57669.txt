I really love the feel of this restaurant. When I moved into the area the Realtor told me to check this place out. Then at a gathering I couple of friends told me that it was really the best Restaurant in piles... I had the Chicken Fajitas. They were excellent. I especially loved the corn shells instead of flour. The only thing that bothered me a little was that it was really packed on Sunday buy totally understand. Don't miss this place. :)
