Honey wine. You must start your meal with honey wine. The husband and I are mega-mead fanatics, and we totally dug the Ethiopian honey wine. Next up, we nibbled on some spongey ambasha bread with a cottage cheese-like mixture. Yum! Forgive me, as I'm not recalling the names of any of the dishes, but oh how I do remember their flavors. Here we go... We decided to indulge in the Demera Messob and selected two veggie dishes, a beef, a chicken, a lamb, and a shrimp dish. Nice variety. Most of them were ordered spicy, and Demera delivered on the spice. My favorite part was the veggie dishes. One was a mashed chick pea. The other was lentils. Next time I come here, I'm tempted to order strictly veggies. We couldn't leave without dessert. The hibist volcano melded citrus with earthy spices such as cardamom, cinnamon, and clove. With ice cream on top! The waitstaff were friendly, a little soft spoken, and attentive. My water never ran empty (very important when eating spicy food!). The manager who seated us seemed really nice and appeared to really run the restaurant well. We used a Groupon and everything went smoothly with it. The Groupon led me to try Demera, and the great prices and quality will keep me coming back.
