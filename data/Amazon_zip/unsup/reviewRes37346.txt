I came here the week before Halloween with friends. We had dinner in the less formal sit-down dining area. Items ordered: two sandwiches (including the big fancy lobster sandwich) and a box of veggie lo mein from the hot box cart. My reasonably-priced lo mein was good but not great; the verdict on the fancy lobster sandwich, which costs something like $20, was also "good but not great." We prowled the aisles to kill some time before our movie. Their seasonal candy selection is excellent and honestly kind of mind-blowing. Their dried mushroom selection is also excellent, and they must be twice as good as the dried mushrooms everywhere else, because they cost twice as much. Someday when I make chanterelle risotto again, I'll test this theory. For me, the best part was eating my meal in full view of the dog park across the street. SO MANY CUTE DOGS! Overall: good, but not as good as you might think based on price, for some items. DOGS! Definitely going back.
