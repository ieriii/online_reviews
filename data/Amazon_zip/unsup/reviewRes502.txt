Amazing food, but the experience left me wanting. This place has to be experienced once for the food alone. I guess that is the most important thing but the overall experience for us was a little flat. We were seated in the front room on the street level and that may have been the issue. It was a tiny room with 3 or 4 tables with no atmosphere at all. Also since it was so quiet and everyone was having the same menu we kept hearing each item described 4 times (at each table). The whole thing was just odd. Also our server had no personality whatsoever. Anyway, like I said the food was amazing and I am glad I went.
