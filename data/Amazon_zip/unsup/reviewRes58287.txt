My wife and I have lived in many places in the US and abroad. She, before I, got turned off years ago of Mexican food because of the Tex Mex influence that we seemed to find everywhere. Well, several years ago when I was watching Public TV in Oklahoma City I saw Rick on MEXICO - ONE PLATE AT A TIME. I started watching him every Saturday and found that his style of Mexican cuisine was very interesting to me. I introduced my wife to it and we both decided that we would like to give it a try if we had a chance.It has been many years, but we finally had a chance to visit XOCO in Chicago this weekend. All I can say is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!!! My wife had the Pork Belly Vermicelli Meal-in-a-Bowl-Caldo and I had the Carnitas Meal-in-a-Bowl-Caldo. Absolutely BREATHTAKING. The staff was so helpful and considerate. It was our first time visiting, but they all made us feel that we were regulars. It was a cold and rainy day in the windy city. I can't think of better conditions to sit down at a place like this to have some fantastic street food. Thank you all (Rick and staff) for helping to make our trip to Chicago an extremely memorable one.
