You can smell the garlic in the air a block away from this place - in a good way. My husband swears by the chicken parm with homemade rigatoni, but I've had many of their dishes.Their lobster ravioli with marsacpone alfredo sauce is out of this world, and their asiago stuffed gnocchi is so delicious!The homemade tiramisu is incredible, too. But, it's really hard to have dessert after you've stuffed yourself with the entree.This restaurant is very romantic and cozy - especially on a cold winter night. It's very non-descript from the street - they have huge plants blocking most of the windows. It's the kind of indulgent place that makes it worth gaining a few pounds.
