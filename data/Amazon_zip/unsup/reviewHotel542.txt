Wonderful location, a few blocks from Michigan Ave and 1 block from the Red Line El. The king studio was clean, spacious and had a mini fridge and bar sink. Dcor seems old-style but not old. Definitely would stay here again, since the value was great ($143.10 - $224.10) and the location was good. Why spend $300+ on a room that you'll never be in!?!
