Overall, I wasn't that impressed with Crisp. We got carryout last night and to be honest, it just wasn't all that. The BBQ strips were spicier than the Buffalo wings, and the Buddha Bowl (basically just Bi Bim Bop) was pretty average. My friend got a steak bowl and from the looks of it, it was pretty much just a ton of rice with a little bit of steak on top. Plus everything was super salty and I thought a little overpriced for what we ended up getting. I might be willing to try Crisp again simply because everyone else has had such a great experience here. Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing? But gotta say I'm much more likely to head down to Del Seoul for some Bulgogi!
