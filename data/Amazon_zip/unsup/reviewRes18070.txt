Before coming here for a late lunch today, I had NO IDEA what in the world the word "torta" meant. Turns out, XOCO was a great place to learn. The service model is a little odd (you're assigned a table, then you order at the counter, then they bring the food to your table), but it works I suppose. The food here was great, and served HOT. The torta that I ordered (a chipotle chicken something) was absolutely amazing. Would definitely return :)
