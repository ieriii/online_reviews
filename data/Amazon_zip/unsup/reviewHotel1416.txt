The Millennium Knickerbocker is tucked away just about a half-block east of North Michigan Avenue. I like to refer to this hotel as a mini-Drake, as it is in essence a smaller version of the Drake Hotel across the street. The Knickerbocker is an older property, so the rooms are quite elegant but very average in size. The bathrooms have very little shelf space (and I am a guy). Try to have a look around the attractive public spaces, and there is a cozy library-like nook that is around the corner from the piano bar.
