Only went for hot chocolates and churros so I feel a little bad about not having the full scoop.  The hot chocolates were good, if you are prepared for what they are.  These are not your average hot chocolates - think bittersweet, coffee-esque chocolate.  My husband thought it was awful but he was expecting Dunkin Donuts type hot chocolate.  The churros are so good.  Cannot wait to go back and try the food!
