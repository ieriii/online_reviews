Indeed, i'm a BIG fan of Cafe 28. Delicious food, great service, outstanding drinks: Between these guys and my good folks at Violet Hour, I've become a MARTINI FAN. (insert round of applause here -- thank you, thank you, thank you, you're all very kind..). I use to be a strictly beer and cocktails typa guy. I'd never drink someting out of a martini glass! Until I had something here called a Brazilian....ummm...i forget. Wait. Blast? Brazilian Blast?? No. I don't think I'd drink something with BLAST in it. This aint Capri-Sun, buddy! But anyway, this particular drink had Cachaca (a popular brazilian liquor that's very strong, and very similar to rum), passion fruit, grenadine, and something else. It was YUMMIEEEE. I had like 9 of em..then my eyes started getting smokey n squinty n all sexxy...I think my date liked that... On to dinner, I had the blackened duck, which was pretty damn good and juicy. It came with some mushroom sauce and yummy ass mash potatoes. I tried some of my dates cuban style chicken, which was equally good. It was served with plantains. She didn't like plantains so I finished hers and ordered another side of it. I mean, WHO DOESNT LIKE PLANTAINS??? Good stuff... Decor is very comfy. We had our dinner outside in their sexxy ass outdoor "terrace" or patio. Good food, folks, and fun abound. The night was wonderful, i think that in itself helped a lot too. Inside you find plenty of exposed brick, giving the place a lot of warmth and good character. And to find out that they serve BRUNCH??? Yeah, these guys will definitely start getting tired of seeing me.
