This place is awesome. I never would have known it existed since it's not really advertised and you could walk right past it on the street. Even on a Saturday night, the line wasn't too long and we only waited for about 15 minutes to be seated. The lighting is very dark so it's a little hard to read the drink menu, but boy, what a menu it is. Easily one of the most extensive, crafty and interesting cocktails I've ever heard of! There were 3 people in our party and we each ordered something different-a pimm's cup #7, el diablo (not on the menu but the waitress recommended it to us), and a rosalita. Each cocktail is $12, which we were a little taken aback by at first. As soon as we took the first sip, we could see why. These things are delicious, beautifully constructed, and strong! If you're a bit of a lightweight like I am, one or two drinks is all you need. The atmosphere is very dark and intimate-a perfect setting for a date, but I wouldn't recommend it for a group larger than 6 since most tables are smaller. They have a no cell phones policy and dress code, but I don't know how strictly they're enforced. My husband was wearing khaki shorts and got in just fine.
