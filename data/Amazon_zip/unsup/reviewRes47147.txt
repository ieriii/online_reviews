We got off to a bad start coming in the door and having a hostess with an attitude asking if we had reservations. The place was nowhere full and she acted like she was doing us a favor. Although the food was good, the service was slow and our server had a habit of disappearing for long periods of time. We waited 30-40 minutes for our food to come out after placing our orders. We only were given a late lunch menu, so there was little to choose from. Everyone in the group seemed happy with the meal. Although one had requested sweet potato fries and received regular fries. I felt the cost was a little bit high for what we had, but I guess given the area and what it is, it would be considered normal. I think I would be inclined to give it another try, but I don't think I'll be running back any time soon.
