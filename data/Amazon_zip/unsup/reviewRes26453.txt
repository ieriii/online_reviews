Went there early on Saturday evening before going to a show. The food was delicious, we were a little disappointed we couldn't order the paella since it took about an hour and we wanted to make sure we could get to the show on time. Our server said we should order 3-4 tapas each (there were 4 of us). That seemed a little much, we had a total of 6 that everyone shared and that was plenty of food. Loved the tomato bread, however when we asked for more bread, no one told us there was an extra charge. The extra bread ended up costing an extra $1.50 per person.
