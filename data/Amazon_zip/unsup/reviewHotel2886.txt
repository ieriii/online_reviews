Really- this was the worst hotel experience I have ever had. I am not a complainer but I felt like everytime I turned around there was something to roll my eyes about with this hotel. My girlfriend and I arrived after a 12 hour car trip from Philly at around 12 am. We knew that places like this fill up quick and called to ensure that our room (that had been reserved 3 weeks prior) was kept even though we were getting there late- no problem. We arrive and they have no rooms w/ beds left...so they gave us a room w/ a sofa bed and told us they'd upgrade for the following night. The sofa bed had no sheets on it, there were no pillows in the room and no remote control for the t.v. OK. Called the front desk, asked for these items and waited. Waited some more. Called again. A guy came up with 1 pillow (when we asked for 2-not an unreasonable request) and sheets. 10 minutes later someone came with the remote. Next day they told us the room could not be upgraded so we were moved to a traditional room (lower then what we originally booked). We got back from doing our touristy stuff, got the keys for our new room and our luggage was nowhere to be found (they told us they would move it), so we had to call a couple of times and have it tracked down. To be fair they discounted us $150 dollars and sent up some free fruit and water(whopee). Not worth the mental hassle and time it took away from Chicago enjoyment. The valet guy - Ed, I believe his name was - was very nice and patient while we unloaded a ton of bags from our car.
