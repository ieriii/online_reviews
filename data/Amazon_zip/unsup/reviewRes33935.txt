Yolk on Michigan was such a cool place to be. Not only was the food awesome, but seeing Chicago Bears Linebacker Brian Urlacher come in for breakfast at the same time made it that much cooler of an experience.  At first I thought the menu was a little pricey, but for the amount of food they give you its not bad at all. I had a Crepe Combination, which gives you two delicious Crepe's of your choice (I had nutella with banana's and walnuts - so so good), eggs, bacon and sausage. I can eat a lot, but I couldn't finish this meal. Overall the service and atmosphere were great and I would definitely go back next time I come to Chicago. Since we had walked there in the morning during a snow storm the streets were really quiet, but when we walked into this place it was packed wall to wall. For so many people to go out of their way to eat here, that's telling you all you need to know.
