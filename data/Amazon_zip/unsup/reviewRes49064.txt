The Publican has been on my 'to do' list for quite sometime. I finally stopped in for brunch yesterday, and was not disappointed. We enjoyed the granola/yogurt/pomegranate combo to start and then had the red wine poached eggs (benedict essentially - which was to die for) and the ham and eggs with polenta. It was all phenomenal, I will definitely be back! My only reason for docking a star is that the communal table seating is quite cramped, not my favorite arrangement.
