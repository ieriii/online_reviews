We came here for an anniversary dinner a while ago with big hopes but received mediocrity. We frequent Tapas Valencia and have ventured out to Ba Ba Reeba so we were familiar with tapas bars. We'd heard great things about Mercat so we went in with high expectations. All of the workers were nice, the host sat us immediately and, when he was around, the server was friendly. We found the food to be nothing special and the portions small, even for tapas. It wasn't a bad experience, just nothing stood out.
