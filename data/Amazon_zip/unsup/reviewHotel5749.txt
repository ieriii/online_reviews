I stayed here with my new wife for my wedding weekend along with family members and had top-notch service. Lena Lahart made sure everything was set up perfectly for our wedding party and even cleared up a minor glitch. She was attentive, flexible, and not just another robot salesperson. Contact her if you need to stay here for a wedding.
