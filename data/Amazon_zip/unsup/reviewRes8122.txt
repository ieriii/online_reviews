Fogo de Chao is a great restaurant for meat lovers! I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place. Went here for Valentine's Day in 2009 around 6pm, the placed was packed. I had a reservation so my husband and I only waited a few minutes to be seated. My experience was great! I ordered a glass of white wine and had some salad. My recommendation is to not make too many trips to the salad bar; leave room for the meat and sides, especially the potatoes! All of the beef, lamb and pork was very well-seasoned and quite tasty. I loved it! I would definitely return. Service is speedy when your card is on the green side so pace yourselves accordingly! Dinner after drinks and tip was about $150 but it was ok for the occasion. Some people were there with their families and dressed casually in jeans. Others were dressed up in slacks or skirts. It's a pretty restaurant but I suppose it's safe to say dress for the occasion. 4 stars.
