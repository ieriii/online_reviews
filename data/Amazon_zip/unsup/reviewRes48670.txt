We love Publican. Breakfast is delicious, and you can get fries and pork rinds with your coffee and juice. Dinner is delicious. Sunday dinners you just sit back and let the food come to you. The menu items are described so minimally, we often don't know what to expect. Just about everything we've had has blown us away! The menu changes frequently, but there are some standards like the roast chicken.  The food is quite similar to food in Belgium which is the absolute best place for food in general. The fries are just like Belgian fries- very crispy on the outside and soft and flavorful on the inside. Each dish is solid with just the right amount of different types of flavors that don't overpower each other. If you ever get the chance, try the pizza. We've only had it a couple of times at a Sunday dinner. The crust is so good! We are not fans of communal tables, so we make sure to ask for the booths.  The service friendly and attentive. It's a fun place to go!
