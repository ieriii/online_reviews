OK, Publican, you deserve my 5 stars. Our service was quick but not intrusive. The cutie that delivered most of our plates looks an awful lot like Adrian Grenier. We had the pickles (good, but a little sweet and similar across the board), the pork rinds (very crunchy, just OK tasting for me), mussels (love mussels, and the sauce was soaked up and delivered to my mouth with delicious crusty bread), the asparagus (GET THIS!! I never thought I could be so excited about asparagus!) and the pork belly (yum, yum! Best described by Kristin as candied pig love). Between dinner and dessert (the waffle, definitely not IHOP-style, this was light, fluffy, amazing, I wish I could have put the little bit we couldn't eat in my pocket), we had Roger Mooking and Aaron Sanchez come by our table and introduce themselves. Maybe it was the star-struck look on my face? They were so, so nice. I know I'm a nerd and that's A-OK with me.
