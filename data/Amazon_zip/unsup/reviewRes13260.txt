I came here for my cousin's birthday so everything was free. You name it, it was free: the beer, the food, the silverwear (don't tell anyone). The party had wings, sliders, and pizzas which I'm assuming all came from the appetizer menu. They were very filling. I'm sure the five beers had nothing to do with it.
