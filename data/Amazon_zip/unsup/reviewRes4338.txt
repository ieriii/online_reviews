The bartenders are door guys are ass holes, but once you get past that everything is great. Take a seat somewhere (if there's on available) and let the waitresses serve you. Even when it's busy they do a good job of keeping your glass full. Needless to say, the music is always great. They're open late (5 am, i think) and no cover past 1 am. Great place to close out the night.
