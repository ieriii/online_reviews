A MUST-TRY: The Vegan Avocado Lime Cheesecake!!! -the cheesecake is light and airy in texture and smooth/palatable on the tongue -the crust is quite thin, it doesn't interfere with the simple, mellow flavours of the cheesecake -the taste of fresh avocados and vibrant limes are definitely evident in the cheesecake -excellent flavours and textures make this cheesecake a must-try, indefinitely! My entree, the "Reuben" Sandwich, http://bit.ly/d8Y077 though highly acclaimed by many, was tasty but not mind-blowing. I was impressed that the faux meat actually tasted like real meat, but the sandwich itself was too sour in taste and too soggy in texture for me. Glad I tried it though. Happy vegging!
