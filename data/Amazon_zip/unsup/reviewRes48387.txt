If a restaurant is trendy and doesn't have good food, I don't get it. I get The Publican. It's trendy, yeah, and filled with hipsters, yeah. But the food is just really good, and that's why you should go, even if you're not a hipster (like me, not a hipster). First of all, if you're interested in beer, the beer list is extensive and very interesting. Secondly, there is a separate HAM menu, which if you like fine hams, is incredibly awesome. Thirdly, there is an assortment of small and large plates to choose from, and that lends itself well to trying lots of different things, which is fun. Yeah, there's a lot of pig on the menu, but is that bad? I guess if you don't like pig... We tried a bunch of things: the ham sampler (awesome), the daily pickles (tasty and fun), the pea sformato (weird and delicious), the fries (sans egg, but yummy and served with a luscious garlic aioli), the skirt steak with feta (perfectly seasoned and lovely with a bite of everything on the plate), the country ribs (by FAR my favorite dish of the night. Simply gorgeous.), and the potee (which I didn't care for; too mustardy, kinda bland as far as the meat). We tried a lot, and liked a lot.  I'd go back. This isn't gonna be in my normal rotation of restaurants, and I doubt I'd want to go more than once or twice a year. But it's good enough to go back.
