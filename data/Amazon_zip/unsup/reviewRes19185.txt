Xoco is definitely worth a visit -- or twenty, as my neighboring diner was quick to note how many times he'd visited the Mexican street food restaurant since it opened. I ordered a chicken milanesa torta with crispy chicken, black beans, cheese, jalapenos, and salsa. But the food runner accidentally gave me the ahogada torta after some confusion over the table numbers. The ahogada, in fact, belonged to my loyal neighbor. I bit into the ahogada before the mistake was realized -- and was rather thankful I did. The torta, halved and wading in a tomato broth with cilantro, consisted of tasty dark pork carnitas and crunchy pickled onions wedged between two thick, slightly crusty pieces of bread, which sopped up the (too) salty broth. A single, made-on-site churro with a generous side of dark chocolate dipping sauce complemented my carnivorously savory meal. And to top it off, the gracious food runner gave me my original order, at no extra charge, in a to-go bag. Dining alone on a late Friday afternoon meant -- hooray! -- no wait. A previous attempt at Xoco on a Saturday afternoon was unsuccessful because my three dining companions were not inclined to stand around for 45 minutes. Excellent food, zero wait time, friendly service. Now if only Xoco could improve the process of assigned seating and food ordering. After stepping inside, confusion awaits as first-timers don't know whether to talk to the hostess, who is set off to the side, and grab a menu or walk straight ahead to the line and order.
