I love to eat vanilla ice cream with smashed up pretzels marinating in the softening ice cream. The longer those salty pretzels linger the better the blend of sweet meets salt. The white chocolate and caramel pretzel pancakes always satisfies this craving. The presentation of white chocolate drizzled across the pancake creates excitement for the eyes awaiting that first bite. The taste was divine. Perfection of blend of textures awakening my taste buds. It was such a pleasure to dine at the Bongo Room. We were a party of 4. Each of us ordered a different selection and each of us was again quite pleased with our dining experience.
