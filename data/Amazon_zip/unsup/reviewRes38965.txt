Everything here is so amazing! I never know what to order, whenever my family and I come here we now we will have a great meal! Chris, the owner, is such a sweetheart. She truly cares about her customers and makes sure everyone enjoys their meal and has a great experience. They have a parking lot, which is great for Chicago. They also have amazing prices and great quality food. They were featured on Check Please! and got great reviews from all 3 hosts, which is rare on that show. From what I hear they are also to be featured on American's Best Bites, on WGN, and they are rated at America's Top 5 Italian Restaurant. Honestly, you will not be disappointed. The food is great, they give you A LOT of it, the prices are amazing, and the atmosphere is so warm.
