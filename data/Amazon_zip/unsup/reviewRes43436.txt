This place is the real deal. They deliver, they have cheap lunch specials (they differ each day of the week), they're friendly, but most of all, the food here is just unbelievable. I ate a lot of pizza in Chicago, I mean a lot, and this place ranks at or near the top of my list. Their stuffed pizza may be some of the best food on earth. When I go back to Chicago, I'll be making my way back to Art of Pizza.
