BEWARE when you buy a groupon that they interview you when making a reservation and only give you certain times to dine. They also automatically add a twenty percent tip to your bill WITHOUT POSTING IT on the groupon or menu. Attentive service but you PAY FOR IT with what it cost...not inexpensive. The singer is delightful and talented. The food is tasty. I gave it three stars because the place feels deceiving. Thanks.
