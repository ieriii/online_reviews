i spent two days with my girlfriend, last week end. The location is perfect and there's a great view of the lake. The hotel is gorgeous, the staff very helpful especially at the concierge. The amazing part is the bar downstairs, pretty cool. We spent a pleasant night on the dance floor with live entertainment. A must to do, if you go during the week end, it's so much fun and relax at the same time.
