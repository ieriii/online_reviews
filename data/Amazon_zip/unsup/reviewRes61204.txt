Absolutely love Gino's. Been there multiple times and I honestly feel that Chicago style pizza does not get better than this. Any place that serves an entire layer of sausage (like a manhole cover) in a pizza will get a 5 star rating from me! I also feel that Gino's is the best crust of the top Chicago pizza places. The reason I think this is because it is "buttery." I feel like many Chicago pizza crusts are dry but this one is not! The atmosphere is awesome and you are right off of Michigan Ave. The only thing is that one time I had pizza at the bar to watch a Sox game and the bartender was annoying. I think he was trying to seem like a cool Chicago yuppy but I think his services would be more appreciated at an Applebee's in Rockford, IL as opposed to downtown Chicago.
