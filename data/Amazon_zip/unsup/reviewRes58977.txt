Oh god, Sunda, you are a hot mess. You're like the bitchy girl in high school that just ruins everything. You f-ed up my plans for the rest of the evening because you made me wait around for my "reserved" table and I also waited so long for my food to come out and i spent way too long sitting around your restaurant. I still have ringing in my ears from how obnoxiously loud it was in there. I hear from the rest of my friends who were waiting somewhere else that I missed a good time while I was waiting for your shitty sushi to come out. Do you know that I spent way past an hour waiting for sushi that I've already had at Whole Foods, painfully perched on your rickety Ikea barstools when I could've been somewhere else? Do you even have clocks in your restaurant, because no one seemed to be aware of the time it took for anything to happen! No apologies, no acknowledgement! I was held hostage in your restaurant for 2 + hours on the premise of a good time and you didn't deliver. Fire your PR guys, because nothing you say is true.  I hate you forever!All kidding aside, this was pretty much the worst dining experience I've ever had. I don't even have the strength to go into detail, it was just awful. Don't go.I'll give a more detailed review later, but right now I'm just pissed.
