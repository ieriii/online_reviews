I likey.  We've only had delivery and both times it's been really quick. The first time it was Thai, tonight it was sushi. Both times really good. I like the Tom Yum and the Penang Steak was really tasty. The fish was very fresh. We only ordered nigiri and sashimi, no rolls. It's not cheap, but good quality.
