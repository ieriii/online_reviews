My wife and I did the seven course tasting menu. Some dishes were better than others. The first course was lobster and octopus which was very tasty, however it took almost 20 minutes to get! My wife's favorite was the scallop and crab with aioli- so rich and creamy. Soup was the third course- nothing memorable- warm soup with mushrooms. It was not bad, just nothing i care to have again. Main entree was steak and tongue. Good, but lacking vegetables. It only had a few sea beans- which were very tasty, but it needed more. We had a granita, and dessert. The dessert was milk and cookies- i wish it were more exciting. Not the fireworks at the end of the meal. The milkshake was a bit runny, and the cookies were bland. We didn't even finish it. The waitresses were great. There were only 2 girls for everybody, but they were on top of it. They gave us privacy, but if we needed something they were there. Our wine glasses were full all night! One MAJOR compliant, is that is was SO HOT in there! Everyone was sweating including our waitress. I felt bad even asking her if the air was working. She replied there is nothing we can do when it is this hot. That is unacceptable, but not her fault. I feel they could warn the guests or figure a way to keep it cooler. I was sweating just sitting there. Even the table next to us complained. I will return maybe, but not in the summer time.
