Excellent smoked BBQ. My favorite sauces were the Carolina style. Pulled pork was excellent and the bread an butter pickles were crisp and especially tasty. I bought a jar. Service is excellent and the bar is a great place to dine, as well. Pork ribs were very good and smoked chicken very tasty. Love this new place in my neighborhood. OPEN FOR LUNCH.
