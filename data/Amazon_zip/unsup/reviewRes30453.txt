What happened to this place? I used to live in Chicago and had several fine meals here. But, boy, has this place gone downhill. Had the braised brisket, and it was tough and tasteless. The tortilla chips, pitched on the menu as fresh fried, were cold and nothing special - certainly not worth paying for. Even the salsas, which used to just floor me, seemed toned way down in flavor. Worst of all was the huckster routine by the waiter and the unpleasant atmosphere. From the start the waiter went into his shtick, always trying to upsell. "How about an order of guacamole while you look at the menu?" "We're famous for our margaritas, which are made with . . ." Whatever. Everything everyone around me ordered was an "excellent choice," as if we're 7-year-olds who need to be reassured we're not ordering incorrectly. The restaurant seems more a shrine to Rick Bayless and his products than a place serious about food, and I don't recall it being that way 10 or 15 years ago. I hate to say it, but if it walks like a tourist trap and talks like a tourist trap . . .
