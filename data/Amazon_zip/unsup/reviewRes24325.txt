Always a pleasure to spend a few hours at Geja's! They've been pretty savvy with discount sites - I've seen both Groupons and Travel Zoo deals - not bad when it takes $30-40 off your bill! The best part about getting their deals? It's encouraged us to try a few pricier items - pricier bottles and some of the more varied premier dinners. Don't get me wrong, I still love my tofu and veggies, but lobster and shrimp is lovely too! We always make a reservation, arrive pretty close to the time, and usually kill about 10 minutes in the "lounge" in the back corner. It's usually a bit crowded with people also waiting for tables, but the bartender is quick to get you set with a glass of vino while you wait. The one downside? You'll have to settle up here before you get to your table. I understand that from their side, but it's a little hiccup in a system that's usually flawless. Wish they could just take that tab and add it to our dinner. As of late, we took the opportunity to try the veggie broth instead of oil. I must say, it's so much better!! No over-fried veggies! We rarely can finish off all of a course, but with the veggie broth everything felt a lot lighter. We actually were almost able to finish the main course! My one frustration with the main course - I wish they'd switch the sauces more often. I'm a big fan of the dill, horseradish, and butter sauces, but I get annoyed every time I see teryaki and bbq on here. Do people really use those?? A little more creativity would be nice - as well as some smoky flavors. Some of the "spicy" ones are more bitey than smoldery. My favorite thing here?? The cheese fondue. Hands down. I get so excited about it the moment we walk in. Crusty bread and that cheese? AMAZING. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it! A tip to those that like to be frugal about parking - Clark usually has a few spots open and is only a block away! Super awesome if you have a 9pm reservation or later!
