The pizza is outstanding (spinach, tomatoes, feta & garlic = delicious!) You can order a huge pizza too (16" I think). The rest of the food I've had there is good, but not the best. I love the decor, but the guy singing made me think it was kareoke until I realized he was working. Go for the pizza and warm bread they bring out to your table.
