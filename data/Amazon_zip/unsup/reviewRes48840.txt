We had a lovely dinner here last week to celebrate my husband's birthday. To start, I had the tomato salad and he had the rilettes. To drink, a Lost Abbey beer and a Three Floyd's wheat beer with which I was unfamiliar. For dinner, we had the kobe sirloin and the potee. No detail was left untouched in the decor of this place. It was simply stunning inside. Even the restrooms were glistening. We loved it and will definitely be back!!
