The best part of the Holiday season= work Holiday party. Let's start off with the looks of this place. It's super cozy and everything I love in a place. I felt like I was walking into someone's old home in the south, like straight out of Paula Dean's show or something. Our party was upstairs, which is laid out a little funny, but comfortable. The servers were great, bringing non-stop drinks (which I guess ended up badly for a few of us in the end). The Passion Fruit Martini is strong! The Pimm cup is the way to go, refreshing, and crisp. We had a slew of amazing appetizers ranging from shrimp and polenta to wings. The dinner was family style and included Kobe Beef Brisket! Woah bear, so good! Overall, everything here was pretty good but I'm not too sure I would spend that much money on this type of food in the future.
