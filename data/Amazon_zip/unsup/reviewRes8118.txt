Holy meat lover's fortune. Unapologetic carnivores like me will die happy at Fogo. The house special (Picanha) must be among the most tender morsels of steak I have ever had, perfectly seasoned with just a slight bite of sea salt. The pork sausage (linguica) and roast leg of lamb were major highlights, both juicy and perfectly game-y. Also, I am not a salad bar girl. To me, bars are for liquor, not for vats of slimy shredded lettuce, mayonnaise-drenched mush and neon canned beets. I was tempted to walk right by, take my seat and demand hordes of grilled meats directly from the skewer to my mouth. Then the manchego caught my eye. And the lox. And the marinated olives, jamon iberico, fresh fruit, hearts of palm, artichokes and roasted bell peppers. Delicious. I suggest keeping a plate of salad around as a palate cleanser between meat courses. The whole game at Fogo is fun - the stop/go signs, friendly waiters and strong capirinhas make for a delightful time. The only surprisingly unimpressive bit was the filet mignon. It was chewier than I would have hoped, but so easily overlooked among the dozens of other sizzling skewers this churrascaria has to offer.
