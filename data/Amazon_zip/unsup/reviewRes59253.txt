Depends on the day and on the cook...I use to go to the old location before it moved. It was real rough lookin' then, but now it's larger and cleaner. However, some things never change... the service! It's a deal killer!!! Sorry folks. The waitresses were terribly slow to non-existence. I don't mind waiting usually; I'm patient gal. But, how long is too long?!! I tried to leave, but unfortunately, I was with two knuckle heads (my brother and mother). Or else, it's see-ya!!!So, let's get to the grub review: The duck is always good. When in doubt, go for the duck. My brother ordered: lobster, fried rice, kai-lan (chinese broccoli), beef with black beans, and half order of roasted duck. SHOCKED... and mumbling @ssHOLE 'cause I had to pay, AGAIN. I just ordered some soup with wontons. We shared all the food ordered tho. All I can say was," THANK GOODNESS!" The food was good but the wait staff rarely came to fill my glass of water even though I asked several times. Overall, the restaurant is worth a try. Now parking...Chic-town is hard to find parking but in this area???Come on, ppl!!*This is for the BMW prick and his evil family- remember KARMA, dude. Karma will bite you for being so hateful. I will meet you again and SURPRISE...my turn b*tch!!
