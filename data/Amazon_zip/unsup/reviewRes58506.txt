I LOVE this place! My husband and I were searching for a good Vietnamese place, and most that we came across were kind of French fusion, making them very expensive. NOT the case with Simply It. It's really great food at reasonable prices, and the owner (Tuan I think?) is very kind and calls everybody my dear. This place is great for groups (BYOB), and it's great for a lazy weekend lunch (lunch specials valid even on weekends). Lunch specials come with a fried spring roll, soup, salad, and iced tea or lemonade. Really good deal. Shrimp papaya salad and calamari salad are especially great...no matter what else we order, we always order one of those.
