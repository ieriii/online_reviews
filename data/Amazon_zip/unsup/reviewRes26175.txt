I am a salty girl, I'd rather have a grilled cheese and bacon or a meaty entree over dessert, but for restaurant week, I met the best dessert of my life! Chocolate croquettes, in rosemary caramel, olive oil and banana marshmallow!!!! HELLO ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?!?!?! It was every bit if not more amazing than it sounds. Will be going back for more than dessert, but that's all I can write about for now.
