Located across the street from the Logan Square Blue Line stop, getting to L&E was easy. Our party of two arrived relatively early in the evening last Saturday, and L&E was already packed to capacity. Our determination was strong, so we gave our name and phone number and went next door for a drink. I had mentioned to Gina, who was working the door, that we were interested in having drinks at the bar @ L&E if possible. within 15 or so minutes I received a phone call stating a large party had left/been seated and more room was now available...success. Reentering the bar, it was still packed, but not to the point of over annoyance. The crowd at both the bar and restaurant was very diverse in both age and image. I am very impressed with the amount of options L&E provides for drinks. Extensive beer, wine, spirits, and cocktails at $8 a pop are fantastic. After about 80ish minutes of waiting (total, and accurately guesstimated by the staff), we were seated in the back room. Appetizer: Pretzel. Hot, delicious, soft, and full of flavor. Great for two people to split. Main Course: we split the bone marrow (small plate) & venison (entre). The bone marrow was an experience, give it a shot. Both were very good. Dessert: Donuts w/ whipped citrus goat cheese. Again, excellent with an interesting twist in the goat cheese. Overall, I'd highly recommend Longman & Eagle and can't stop raving about it.
