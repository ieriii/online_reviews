I come here to get away from my usual's in Lakeview. You only have a few choices if you're looking for a place to study, sip coffee and surf the internet for free around here. You have Alliance, Lovely or Ballou to pick from. I'm thankful some places still provide free wifi with their coffee. Alliance is a bakery, everything else comes second. The study room next door is not really a cafe because you'll be stared at or hushed if you talk out loud. Make sure your notebook is fully charged before you head here because outlets can be scarce. If you want to chat with friends and don't need free internet you are better off going to Milk & Honey further down, or Starbucks across the street, or better yet, try Letizia's.
