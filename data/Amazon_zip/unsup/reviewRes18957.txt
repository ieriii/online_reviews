Finally stopped by XOCO because we were both starving and couldn't fathom the hour-long wait for Frontera. I was impressed how quickly we were able to get seats - don't be intimidated once you walk in, we had been planning to just get take out, but our wait was less than 5 minutes even for a full house. We got the Chips & Guacamole/Salsas, Choriqueso Torta and Ahogada torta. I'll start with the Chips & Guac, which are really the reason I can't give this place 5 solid stars. The guacamole was just OK - not good or bad, definitely more dense than I like mine and seemed kind of pedestrian in general. Neither of us cared for both of the salsas, one too sweet, the other too tart, and neither had much heat at all. The chips are my main gripe though - I have to assume they're using house made chips because it's Rick Bayless' place....but they were entirely undistinguishable from the cheap grocery store kind. Totally killed it for me. The Choriqueso torta was good - on French bread which was weird, but the sauce was a very heavy tomato base and seemed kind of like a Mexican street-food take on your meatball sub. Overall tasty. The Ahogada was both exciting and weird. There was just way too much going on - tart, spicy, sweet, sour....there was something new in every bite but not necessarily in a good way. More like torta going through an identity crisis. The heat was nice though and overall tasty. That said - their 'Mexican Style Hot Chocolate' is maybe the best thing one I've ever had. I have fantasies of bathing in this stuff after enjoying a cup of it.
