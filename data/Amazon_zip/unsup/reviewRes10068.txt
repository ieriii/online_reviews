Pieces of yum! We came at a perfect time because by the time we were done eating there was a line literally out the door. The pizza is fantastic and the beer is top notch. I thought it was weird that when we walked in there were many tables open, but we were told we had to wait twenty minutes. Then five minutes later we were seated at a table that was supposedly "off limits." The service was terrible and slow and the place was so packed, our server couldn't even get to our table half the time (poor planning, I think). But whatever, the food is great so I'm (mostly) ok with that. When you go, be prepared to wait for years and have reeeeeeally shady service from people who dont really give a shit because well, there are lines outside the door so why should they?
