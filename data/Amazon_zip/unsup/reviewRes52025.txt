Goodness gracious, this place is bodacious. Yeah I really just said that. The pizza is unlike anything else you've ever had. If you are in Chicago, it's a requirement that you eat here. It just is. The wait was a little long for the pizza but we ordered apps and were taking in the upbeat vibe provided by the packed house of characters (more out of towners than locals for sure but still fun) so it was all good. Gino's is known for a reason. It lives up to the hype.
