We usually go to the Bongo Room, but I wanted to try Yolk out to see if I was missing anything. I'm not... At 8:40a, there wasn't a wait. We were seated quickly and I liked that there were different kinds of coffee creamers. The menu is very extensive, but I ordered the omelette. When it arrived, it seemed more like a frittata rolled up with cheese on top. It didn't taste bad, but it was the worse "omelette" I've ever had. The potato side was good. The portions are ridiculous. I had to leave more than half the food on my plate because it was just too much. One last note - I liked that there was an option to have potatoes or fresh fruit as a side, but fruit dishes no matter where you go always has melon and I hate melon.
