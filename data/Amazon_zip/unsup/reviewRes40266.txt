This should be 3.5 stars actually. The menu is really interesting and the ambiance is nice. The service was probably the best part of L&E, and gets 5 stars just for that. The only thing that keeps me from giving it more is that while all the menu descriptions of the items got me really excited, what I ended up eating was not all that amazing. It seemed like the food was less than the sum of it's parts if you know what I mean. I had the Pork Belly Confit for an entree. I also tried the catfish and a couple appetizers which I found somewhat forgettable. Don't get me wrong, it was all good. I guess I realized I am not a huge fan of pork belly confit. The flight of the pig tasting menu (where they use all parts of the berkshire hog) sounded really good and adventurous, but I wasn't really hungry enough for 5 courses, and at $45 it seems like it would have been a waste. Most of the food is upscale and priced accordingly, and the portions are on the smaller side. I'd like to go back and try some of the simpler things, sandwiches and maybe the burger. The cocktails were really well made. It's a little fancy and pricey for me to return to regularly. It would be more of a special occasion place.
