My mouth is watering just thinking about that spicy red cabbage appetizer. I need more of it in my life. I thought the pricing was a little high for Chinese food, $10-15 per person, but the quality was great and the portions are very large. We didn't wait long to be seated (we arrived a little earlier on a Sunday night) but there were about 15 waiting as we left (closer to dinner time). My only problem with the experience was the service. Our servers argued in front of us, acted very annoyed by us at some points, brought us the wrong check and then took about 15 minutes to return the check once we paid. I will be back, and will just keep my fingers crossed that the service is better next time.
