I walk by Nana every day, but I have been to there twice. One would think I would go there all the time, but, it lacks draw.  My first experience was lunch. My friend and I shared the antipasto. When I asked the server what was on it she repeated what the menu said sort of, "meat and cheese and some sort of salad." We ordered it anyway. Everything was very good! A little pricey but I believe that the ingredients were worth it. We also shared the large macaroni and cheese. It was not great, but it filled us up and worked well with the antipasto. So, one appetizer, one entree, 2 drinks each and tip = $90 lunch!? Yeah, I saw the prices on the menu but it is just amazing how quickly it adds up. My second experience was breakfast. It was a Friday and Polo only feels the need to serve breakfast on Saturday so I had to take my mom somewhere else. I like strong coffee but this tasted burnt and my mom found it undrinkable. We had some sort of stuffed french toast and some sort of pancake thing, no extras or sides... Breakfast was just under $40 including tip. We ate in silence because it was so loud that morning that mom could not hear what I was saying. I have no issue with paying for good food. But when I spend that kind of money on a meal I want to be amazed with the food, the atmosphere and the service. I have never been amazed at Nana. Satisfied, but far from amazed.
