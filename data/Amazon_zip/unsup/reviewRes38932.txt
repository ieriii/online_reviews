Went for brunch on a short weekend trip to Chicago. The place was quite busy but got a seat after about 30min wait. The food was slightly disappointing. A couple of the dishes, especially the duck egg hash was overly salty. The pork belly was creative and tender but I thought it lacked flavor. The crab benedict was well executed. Overall wasn't overly impressed with the meal.
