SLOW service! Server showed irritation that we had a large number of people in our party and showed no interest in getting anything to us in a timely manner. It seemed he wasn't concerned with making our table a priority since we would have automatic gratuity added to our bill. There were five tables that were sat after us that got their food long before we did. We had to ask twice for water and finally got water an hour and a half after we were sat. One person ordered a soda and it was not brought to the table until an hour later and that was after they were reminded. All in all we were in their establishment for almost three hours and only actually eating for about a half hour of that time. The staff was rude when we requested anything and as best was unable to attempt to assess any needs that we might have. We are in Chinatown often and will not be returning to Lao Sze Chaun.
