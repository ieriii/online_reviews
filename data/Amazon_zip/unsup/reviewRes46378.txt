Great food.....inflated portions. I suppose that's why the prices are inflated too. One plate could seriously feed 3 people....or just 1 major fat ass. It's a great place to go with friends, but I wouldn't go here on a romantic date. It's very loud in there most of the time and it would be difficult to carry on a good conversation.
