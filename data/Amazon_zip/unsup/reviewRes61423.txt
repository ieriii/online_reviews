I found this bright yellow truck one day right in front of the doggie beach at Montrose. So I walked over to this food truck and wow it was a Doggie Heaven Food truck! They have assorted doggie cookies and ice cream/yogurt they even sell toys! My dog Hokulani just loved it! She would jump up to look into the window to see all the yummy cookies. They also feature an item of the week and a percentage go towards charity, like this month of July 10% of their sales of their doggy frozen yogurt item goes towards Don't bully my breed charity, August is for K-9 unit pups! They even take credit cards/debit cards with a minimum purchase. You can find out where they are and where they are headed to through Facebook and Twitter.
