My gosh, this place is fantastic! I brought my boyfriend (who is from Philly) here as a suprirse because he's a fine beer fan. He loved it and even the beer selection baffled him. I chose this place because of the good food choices as well. It didn't disappoint there either! Yum, we had duck meatballs, the CB&J, and the brisket. The risotto cake in the duck meatballs was divine! Wow, I'm so coming back here!!!!!
