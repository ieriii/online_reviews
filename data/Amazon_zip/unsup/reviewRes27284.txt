This ones on the list of must go to on each trip to ChiTown. Great Vibe, Great Drinks, Great Food. I know this place is Mexican, but Im Caribe, aka Rum is my liquor of choice, plus my bf and my first date night we drank Mojitos, so we are always looking for a good one, Frontera makes a great one! As you are waiting for a table, you enjoy chatting with random people at the bar, sipping your drink, chomping on chips and maybe an appitizer or two and before you know if you are sitting at a table next to the bar and checking out the people next to you food and deciding what to get. You cant go wrong with anything. If you hate a crowded area with people talking and enjoying great food and drinks this place isnt for you. Expect an enjoyable wait, that will be worth it.
