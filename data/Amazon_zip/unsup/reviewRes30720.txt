The service was chill and very helpful. All the staff was very educated on the menu and the specific individual items within the plates and meals. The atmosphere is a very fun and friendly vibe. Now the food...I wish there was a word to describe what the onomonopia explains so well..."Mmmmmm". Delicious, wonderful, fucking-awesome, all explain but can't really envelope how great this food is. Recommendation: Chicken C-Zar Sandwich with a side of sweet potato fries and black tea.
