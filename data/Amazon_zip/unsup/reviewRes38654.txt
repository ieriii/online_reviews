I love this place..if you're a beer drinker, it's a must go. The food is fantastic and always a treat. I tend toward the staples...mussels or the ham sandwich or the sausage plate...but when I do stray from my mainstays, I've never been disappointed.  They recently opened up the back "deck" so you can sit back there and eat now which is really nice. I however, will continue to find my spot at the bar and enjoy all the tasty beers and conversation. Just beware that this is a BAR and that they will not - under any circumstances - allow children or babies in there. They card everyone, so be prepared.
