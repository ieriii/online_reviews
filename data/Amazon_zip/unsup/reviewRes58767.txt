In my 27 years of dining , I have never experienced a menu that paired such modest portions of mediocre quality foods with 5 star pricing. My scallop entree was uneventful and the rest of the items we ordered, despite sounding enticing, were as interesting as watching paint dry. At over $100 a person one should expect a much more pronounced mastery of ingredients, techniques and flavors.In summary, Grahm Elliot is standard hotel fare of modest quality, served in small portions. In Grahm Elliot's defense the plates are artistically presented; if the taste and quality matched its appearance, they could be on to something. Unfortunately Grahm Elliot is less than what meets the eye and $100+ later you will remain hungry and underwhelmed.
