Amazing lobby! The room was beautiful as well but it's hard to compete with the splendor of the lobby. The only thing that was problematic was the wait time for the elevators every morning...you must plan at least fifteen minutes for this. We waited and waited and then finally gave up and took the stairs. However, twenty-three flights of stairs with luggage is not optimal.
