I will be naming my first born "Mayan Palace." The Chile Verde is delicious and I crave for it in my sleep. Honestly, this place is awesome. The margaritas are great and the food is soooooooo goooooood. I'm glad I don't live close by otherwise I'd be enormous. In fact...I think I'll go there tonight!
