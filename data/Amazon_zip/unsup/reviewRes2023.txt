seriously good hot dogs, which isn't something that even a reluctant foodie ever expected to say. nor did i expect to be surprised by the offerings and the condiment suggestions, but i didn't imagine encased kangaroo would ever reach my face nor could i have selected a good slice of cheese to pair with it. great stuff. bonus: doug (the owner and punsake) works the counter and is friendly and funny. despite all this, i am not sure i would again spend most of an hour in the swampy july heat waiting for these things. to other doug's rookies - don't go just before cubs games!
