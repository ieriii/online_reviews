Sunda's a good place for both large and small groups. The food was fantastic. Of course we had to get the crispy rice; we ordered the spicy tuna one. At first, I didn't really think it was anything special but after having a few more bites, I appreciated the flavors and became a believer! My favorite dish of the night was the pork/duck bun- I liked how it came in the basket too. We also got some fish dishes which were great--very flavorful and tender--and finished it off with a molten chocolate cake. The cake was pretty standard but with a unique sauce that I very much enjoyed. The atmosphere and decorations are also very nice. Our waitress was very attentive and informative. The manager also came by to make sure everything was going smoothly, which was nice. I'm taking off one star for the hostesses. They were quite abrasive from beginning to end.
