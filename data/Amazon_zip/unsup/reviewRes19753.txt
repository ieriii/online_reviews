I LOVE this place!!! I'm a big fan of sushi and this is the best sushi i ate by far ,hands down!!! We moved to Bucktown area last summer and this place is 2 min away from my house. Always get great service , excellent food and awesome atmosphere. the dark room with the lighted candles makes the place really romantic & sexy:) Ask for the daily specials - they always have something unique! My favorite is the Moo Roll (Vegetarian ) We introduced that place to some friends and now they are hooked like us!
