We had gone to Piccolo Sogno a year ago and were blown away. We decided to go again in celebration of a new job and were expecting the same experience. I don't know if it was because Check, Please! television crews were there or not, but our food was sub-par. We are big eaters and ordered appetizers, salads, a pizza, two pastas, and two entrees. The best item was the special pizza with sausage and chicory. Completely authentic and tasty. For appetizers, we had carpaccio and seafood mixed grill. Both were less than stellar because neither one had any sort of fresh taste to it.  We also had the zucchini flowers stuffed with cheese, which we had last year and THEY BOMBED IT. The breading on the flowers was so heavy and not even cooked all the way through, leaving a big doughy taste in our mouths. The waiter offered to make us new ones, but we said no thanks. We had the beet salad with bufala and the artichoke salad. For our pastas, we had gnocchi with a homemade tomato basil sauce and a black spaghetti with seafood. The sauce on the gnocchi was tasty, very natural and not salty. However, the gnocchi themselves were bland. Tasted like pasta water. The black spaghetti had good flavor but the seafood around it was tasteless. Our entrees were porchetta and chicken. The chicken was good but nothing to rave about. The porchetta was drier than British humor. For dessert, we had the thousand layer pastry. Just fine, but nothing to die for. We had calvados to finish and lamented over the fact that we had been so giddy with delight about coming back and now would never return. The prices warrant only the best from the kitchen. Our waiter was a delight and we made sure to compensate him properly but we also left a note on our bill listing our main issues and said we would never come back. I'm sorry Piccolo Sogno. We dated for a brief moment when I thought you were charming and not an Italian poser. You showed me you are now just flash and no substance. Sob. I will miss you.
