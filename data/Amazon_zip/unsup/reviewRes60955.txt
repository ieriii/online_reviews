Chicago locals should not shy away from BIN 36 - it would be unfortunate. BIN has been around for 11 years, and there is a reason for that. This place does wine like no other wine bar does - it makes it fun, light and easy where every other wine bar in the city is dark and intimidating. The cheese selection is unbelievable and if i ever want cheese, i know where to go. The menu is always solid and offers a great variety. Things that should not go unnoticed: the BIN Wine School....also, it's so much better of a place to buy a bottle of wine from than dominick's or jewel! You know you are going to get a great bottle of wine, cause they have all been selected carefully and thoughtfully! I've never had a bad bottle here!
