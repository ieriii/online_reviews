Picked up a pan pizza on the way home from shopping, it was really fast under 30 minutes and it looked pretty busy inside and smelled good too. I'd heard good things about Pequod's, so I was looking forward to trying it. I didn't love the pizza but there isn't any left...so I guess my hunger got the best of me. The pizza just tasted burnt and the dough was dry. If friends are going I would give Pequod's another try but if I'm looking for pizza I am going to order from 'Art of Pizza' or 'My Pie'.
