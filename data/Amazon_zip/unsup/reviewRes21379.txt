Just moved to the city and was looking for a great Mexican restaurant to get dinner at. This place got great reviews so I decided to try it out. I ordered the Fiesta Chimichanga and it was so good! I was definitely pleased. The reviews also raved about the margaritas but my boyfriend wasn't too impressed. We both agreed they were too sweet, but some people do like them sweeter. Overall, I was really glad we went there, prices were not to0 bad especially for being in the city. The place is small but cozy. Also very friendly and attentive staff. You should try it out!
