Kinzie probably makes most of its money from business diners crossing the street from the Merchandise Mart. Most of the people around me were on business dinners, and I had a lot of business lunches there when I worked in the Mart.  On my last visit, I sat in the lounge area and ordered their house salad, the Delmonico steak (because they were out of the dry-aged strip steak I originally wanted) and ranch fries. The salad was nice, the steak was perfectly cooked, with nice marbling - it appears that their Delmonico is what others may call a rib-eye cut. I ordered the ranch fries because I like well-made french fries, and even though others may find it odd to order french fries at a nice restaurant, they're usually light-years better than at fast-food places (for example, the fries at the nice French place Cyrano's a few blocks north on Wells are awesome). Service was attentive and prompt, the drinks were well-made and delivered on time (I ordered wine with my meal), the atmosphere is calm and relaxing. Because of its focus on business dining, Kinzie doesn't really do cutting-edge dining, doesn't go overboard with being friendly, but does execute solid traditional steakhouse fare with professionalism, quality and consistent results. For that, I'm a fan.
