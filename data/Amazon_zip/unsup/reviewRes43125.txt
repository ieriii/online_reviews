We've been back to Gilt Bar a couple more times and have not liked the food and subsequently the bill. It's just not very flavorful or the right flavors, and the prices are too high for mediocre food. The duck confit pasta tasted a lot like sweet jarred pickles. We never left feeling good about dining there. Everything needs more punch. It is nice that they have outdoor seating, and the service is friendly.
