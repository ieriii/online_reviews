Yum, yum, yum. I went here on a whim with a friend of mine the other night. It was a nice sunny evening and we wanted to do some al fresco dinning. We stopped in at Chicago q and was seated quickly without a reservation. The server was pleasant and the service was fast.  They start you off with pickles and BBQ chips.... all I can say is "you had me at BBQ chips."  The chips had great flavor and a nice crunch. The pickles were fantastic.  The corn bread is to die for and the mac and cheese was, pretty much, a religious experience. I loved my pulled chicken sandwich and I liked that I got to try all of the different BBQ sauces they had available.  I will be going back.... oh yes,I will be going back.
