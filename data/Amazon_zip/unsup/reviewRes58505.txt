5 stars is compared to other restaurants in this price bracket. Not the same category as Bon Soiree, Schwa, or Alinea.The lunch specials are insanely cheap (I think they're all under $10) and include salad, spring roll, rice, and a drink. And so so so delicious. I have yet to try anything I don't like on the menu... although the chicken soup is a bit standard (not a bad thing, I just like my food a little weird).Delivery is great - you often get a little extra treat with your order - fresh fresh fruit (no half assed fruit salad), some fried rice, etc. The owner is a treat to talk to over the phone, and delivery wait time is reasonable. Everything arrives hot, packaged separately when needed.Dining in is fantastic - it's BYOB and I hear they have some insane deal on a multi-course meal. (I've been ordering delivery lately but am wayyy tempted by a $25 six course meal for two!)Support this business and give it a try - I guarantee you'll like it. There is no wrong thing to order, unless you expect a specific version of Vietnamese food.
