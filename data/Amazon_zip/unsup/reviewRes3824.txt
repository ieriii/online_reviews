Sweet (Seoul) sassy molassy! I heard this place has the best fried chicken in Chicago. Due to torrential downpours, our original plan to go to Crisp was replaced by our back-up plan to order in. Holy cow (chicken)! What an appropriately named restaurant. Now despite the one-hour wait for delivery (we were warned and we were still willing to wait), the chicken was hot, crispy, juicy, and delicious. And that's just the Plain Jane. Then when we dove into the Seoul Sassy: oh man. I was very close to licking the inside of the styrofoam container clean. On the website, they say not to call it teriyaki. Why would you call it teriyaki? It's BETTER than that. The chicken's fantastic. And here's the kicker. We ate the stuff an hour AFTER it came out of the oven. Imagine eating it at Crisp itself. This place is the real deal. Awesome. (Footnote: "Sweet sassy molassy" is a reference to Ray Romano's ESPN sketch on SNL years ago.)
