If the sight of large numbers of trendily-turned-out youngsters turns your stomach, proceed with caution. The duck fat fries are available only on Friday and Saturday. If you want them, don't go on a Tuesday, as I just did. For $8.25, I got 2 lovingly prepared char-polish, 1 large fry (handcut and huge; equivalent to the amount you'd usually get with 3 to 4 polish at most places that throw in the fries for "free") and 1 Cel-Ray (hoo-rah: a hot dog place that sells this NYC/Jewish favorite). Tax included in all menu prices. The Cel-Ray was $1, a good deal, which left me spending about $7 for two really nice char-polish and enough fries to choke a horse. I'm really happy with that. Many places in town charge that much, many charge more, and the quality in many cases can't match what Doug serves. Doug could probably get away with charging more than he does, but refrains. The owner had a very long-winded conversation with the couple in front of me. I'm usually an insanely (insanely) impatient person, and was starting to wonder to myself when the f*ck they were all going to get around to filling out an order form, but outwardly I kept my cool. The owner seems to be sincere in the personal touch he brings to the front counter. The hospitality at Hot Doug's is truly a 180 from places like Jimmy's at Grand and Pulaski (which I visited earlier this week and liked quite a lot). I didn't try any of the exotic specials, which are a bit spendy. Based on this first Hot Doug's experience today, I'm willing to extend the benefit of the doubt that they are a good value, and will probably get around to treating myself to something "gourmet." In any case, Doug's is doing quite well by the classical verities of the Chicago hot dog stand.
