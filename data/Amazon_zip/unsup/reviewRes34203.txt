Great, great, great food, reasonable prices - this place would even be worth the 25+ min weekend wait if the service wasn't so so dreadful..... Our brunch turned into an 1.5 hour ordeal in which our waiter ignored us most the time. After our food was delivered he didn't come back to check on us our give us our bill - after 50 min we had to hunt down another waitress just to get our check. Our section (which had 2 servers) was using team work to pass extra silverware, ketchup, ect back and forth while the severs ignored us and chatted away (in our view)! The bottom line is the food is really great just GET IT TO GO!
