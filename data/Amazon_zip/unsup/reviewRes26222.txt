If the people at the front of the house (the hostess and some sort of manager guy) were nicer, I would give Geja's a 5. I'll start with the bad and end on a happy note. I find it really annoying that you can't request a certain type of table. We made reservations probably two months in advance and they would not let us request a booth. They said the tables were first come first servce, which makes no sense to me if you have a reservation. Even though we had a reservation, we waited 40 minutes to get a booth, per the recommendation of other yelpers. It was so worth it. We waited in the bar and had some nice wine and cheese/crackers for a snack. I didn't mind waiting at all once I got over the initial annoyance. The hostess also told us that there would be a booth opening in 10 minutes only to tell us 1 minute later that she was wrong. Once we finally got to the booth, we ordered the Price geja's premiere and then an additional seafood a la carte. We almost ate all of the protein, didn't even eat half the veggies, and we were too stuffed to eat hardly any of the dessert. EVERYTHING WAS AMAZINGLY DELICIOUSLY GOOD. For the people who say the cheese is too strong - I mean these people obviously don't know what gruyere cheese is. It's strong with a distinct taste but it's good! Cooking the food was super fun (I highly recommend the broccoli with the dill sauce and the garlic butter sauce was perfect for all the seafood). The scallops were amazing. The beef tenderloin tasted great with the teryaki sauce. Also I found the atmosphere very romantic, which I appreciated. I would definitely return. Just make sure you get a booth b/c the other tables are close together (where you're literally brushing elbows with the people next to you) and get there early if you want to wait for a booth.
