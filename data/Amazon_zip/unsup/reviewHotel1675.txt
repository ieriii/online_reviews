I fell in love with this sweet boutique hotel the moment we checked in. The staff was helpful and courteous, and the "lounge" serving free wine and beer for happy hour was fantastic- a gorgeous fireplace, modern and funky decor and furniture, and good wine to boot. And the room! The room was AMAZING. Perfect pink and gold striped walls (okay sounds tacky, but trust me, it was DIVINE), beautiful crown molding,a fantastic chaise lounge, luscious brown silk headboards, and gorgeous high thread count bedding. Okay, I have hit my adjective threshold for one review...Suffice to say I was sad to leave after my week stay here.
