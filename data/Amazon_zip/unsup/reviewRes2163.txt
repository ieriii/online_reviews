Will I come back to eat Hot Doug's? YES. Will I wait in line for 2.5 hours again? NO. I think this place is worth maybe one hour wait at most..... but I think people wait longer because there are a lot of tourists who come here from far away, and it'd be ridiculous to not wait, since they're already here. I'm a BIG fan of foie gras, and that is one of the reasons why I want to eat at Hot Doug's. But expect fancy preparation of foir gras, that's all I'm saying. It's not bad, worth a try. Very interesting to incorporate foir gras in hot dogs I must say. My friend and I ordered 80% of their menu... spent close to $100...I mean, go big or go home right? Might as well if we spent 2.5 hours of our lives waiting to get in. Some hot dogs are good, but some are just like "what the f*uck did I just put in my mouth?" So you just gotta try all of them I guess. But I must warn you, it'll cost ya. Towards the end I felt like a blood vessel popped due to overload in grease. (yes, we ordered duck fat fries, and they're good). So, a good strategy to attack this place, is to bring a bunch of friends, order one of each on the menu. Everyone gets a bite, so everyone gets the most out of waiting. And go run 5 miles afterward. P.S. don't get the nuclear green relish. It's absolutely disgusting.
