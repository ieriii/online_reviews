Ok, I went to Sultan's Market yesterday, for about the three-hundred thirty second time in my life. The schwarma, lamb or chicken, is sublime. They take a better-than-most pita and slice it open and slather it with sensual hummus. Then they gob on the jerusalem salad (or tabbouli if you want that, I think) and add in some onions and lamb or chicken schwarma. If you want it spicy (YES, PLEASE), then they add chili paste to the mix. You could add chili paste to my cheap Old-Navy sandals and I would probably devour them. Well, at least suckle the chili paste off in my bedroom where no one could see me, then lie about it profusely. The lentil is possibly POSSIBLY the best I have ever had. Very creamy and very lentil-y.  The salad bar has a great assortment of traditional veg as well as some Middle Eastern themed veg and dishes. Normally, I would say the only down-side to Sultan's is their lack of room for indoor seating and the lack of fountain soda. However, the former makes acquiring a seat that much more of an accomplishment (I have literally stood at that cashier counter and wolfed down my schwarm sammie). And that there is no fountain soda actually compliments the restaurant. I enjoy lapping up puddles of water from the sidewalk outside.
