Even if you have already eaten, it's worth it to stop in for the best churros and hot chocolate you'll ever taste. The hot chocolate is more like liquid ganache, rich, thick and absolutely addicting! On a side note, Rick Bayless is often visibly present and working at all of his restaurants (as he was when we visited). It's nice to know he's hands on with his business rather than being a mere figurehead.
