Today I came here w/ my family. First we started out with an appetizer of fried zucchini, which wasn't even fried, and was just ok. We then waited almost 45 minutes for our pizzas. However, the pizzas were worth waiting for. They were amazing. We got two pizzas: a margherita and an arugula pizza, which were both amazing. For desert, we got a type of chocolate ball with cocoa powder, which was very good, and because of the wait, the manager brought us a nutela crepe. It was to DIE for. It was rich and creamy, on of the best deserts I have ever eaten. Overall, great restaurant.
