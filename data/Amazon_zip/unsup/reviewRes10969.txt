The best pizza in Chicago isn't deep dish, and it shows by the constant crowd at Piece. I've been in on Sundays around 3pm, and the place was still full. If there's a wait, it's worth it. The crust is outstanding, and the quality of ingredients is just as good. Still not brave enough to throw mashed potatoes on top, but I got some delicious anchovies last time. If you get more than 4 toppings, make sure the pizza is cooked well done, so the crust doesn't fall apart. While the 'wd' term is frightful, there are never major carbon markings on my pizza. Great beer selection makes Piece a dangerous dining option.
