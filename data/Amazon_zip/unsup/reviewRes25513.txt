Um, this place is amazing!! The atmosphere is so fun - it's a cafe, and a bar, and a bakery, and a market and a pizzeria all in one! They open the floor-to-ceiling windows during the summer, and the balcony area is a great idea. We came here for dessert after dinner at Pegasus down the street. We had the lemon tart, Greek rice pudding, and lokomades. All of them were absolutely incredible. Definitely worth going just for dessert, if anything.
