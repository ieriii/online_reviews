After hearing about my coworker rave about rj grunts for months we decided to hit it up last night. We got here before the dinnertime rush, about 6 pm and the place was pretty empty. It was hard to read the menu with the cartoons and writing but my companion and i finally agreed to share the french onion soup, pulled bbq pork sandwich and mac and cheese. Everything was outstanding. It's one of those restaurants where everything on the menu sounds delicious and probably is. The seating isnt the most comfortable but luckily we got a pretty big table so there was plenty of elbow room. I'm sure they put some kind of crack cocaine in there baked cookie dessert because i can't stop thinking about it and want more and more of it.
