First time tried the restaurant went about a half hour before it closed in the early afternoon. There was a table open right when we arrived and immediately our waiter (Danny) came and took our drink orders. After ordering our food, our waiter continued to stop by and make sure we had enough coffee, as well as updating us with the status of our food. Despite being probably his last table, the waiter was very outgoing and pleasant. The food was awesome! Great portions and quality for the price.  Will definitely go back, especially around near closing time to avoid the long wait.
