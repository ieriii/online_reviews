This is my go-to place for thin crust take out. To date, it is the best thin crust pizza I have eaten in Chicago, and I have tried a LOT of places. One secret if you do get take out. When you bring it home, warm the pizza up on a flat top or a pan. It brings the crisp back to the crust without reheating the cheese, etc. The only thing I think they could improve on is the sauce. If the sauce just had a little more flavor, it would be pizza perfection.
