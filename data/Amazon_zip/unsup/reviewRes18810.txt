Ahogada Torta! It's been 2 weeks and I still think about it. Delicious crispy torta with pork carnitas dipped in that delicious, savory tomato broth with just the right tinge of smokiness and spicyness. Gosh, when I think about this dish, I start to wax lyrical like an enthused judge on Top Chef. Enamoured by Rick Bayless from Top Chef Masters, I've trekked down his restaurants in Chicago. Having been to all three Topolobampo, Fronterra Grill and XOCO, I've gotta say that XOCO is by far my favorite. Mexican Street Food at it's best! Chef Bayless, when are you opening a XOCO in NYC? For dessert, try the Churros. Amazing, tasty things coated in sugar and that je ne sais quoi. Best Churros I've ever tasted. Go for it. Get the 3 churros. You won't regret it. I've been here twice. Once with a 30 minute wait, the second time with a 15 minute wait and we got to sit outside on a gorgeous Chicago day. It's well worth it! PS. Did I mention that I love the self-help water and fizzy water with lemon on the side?
