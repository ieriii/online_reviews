Fox and Obel seeks to offer the best of everything. The areas where I think they succeed the best are their bakery and pastry goods. Especially the pastries, everything is good! Their deli, meat and cheese offerings are also very good. Where I find to be lacking are their fresh produce and dairy product quality. I have seen expired eggs and milk on the shelf. Fish is also very pricey, I would strongly suggest going to Isaacson & Stein Fish Market instead for cheap and super fresh seafood. Fox and Obel also has a great restaurant attached. Highly recommend their breakfast/brunch, though it can get pretty packed. In terms of parking, they offer complimentary valet service with purchase. However, a lot of times I am just in and out, so I just park along the side street and put on the blinkers (you can park on the side street for 15 minutes with the blinkers on). By the way, their plastic bags are prone to tearing, so be careful.
