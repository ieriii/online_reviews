I am writing this review specifically for the cafe.  The food quality is good.  On the foods merits alone, I would rate this 3.5.  However, pricing and service are negatives here.  The pricing is a bit high at over 10/plate for fast casual food.  Service sucks...rude cashiers in the cafe and slow service mean I will never be back to dine in the cafe. I might be back for groceries, but I do realize their groceries cost 30-50% more than elsewhere.  The selection of cheeses and meats sometimes makes up for the high pricing.
