Hands down, unequivocally, the best meal I have had to date. 20 courses of sheer, amazing, inventive, creative, artfully prepared foodie goodness. Every course has the plate, bowl, etc. custom made just for serving that specific dish. Talk about paying attention to the details! - Steelhead Roe - Yuba - Oyster Leaf - Scallops - Razor Clam - Foie Gras - Venison - Rabbit (parfait, rillette, and consomme) - Wild Mushrooms - Hot Potato - Short Rib (this was a handmade pasta that you prepare yourself... like a taco) - Hamachi - Agneau - Black Truffles - Yuzu Snow (wild) - Sweet Potato - Lemongrass (a shot in a test tube... and have you ever even heard of finger lime?) And then for the kicker, Grant Achatz himself came out and prepared out chocolate/blueberry/honey/peanut/etc dessert-as-artwork on our table top. This course was certainly the highlight of the meal and watching the chef painstakingly work to paint each drop very specifically was quite fun. The wine pairings are phenomenal and everything in the wine was as playful and interesting as the food it was paired with. If I could only eat out once a year, it would be at Alinea.
