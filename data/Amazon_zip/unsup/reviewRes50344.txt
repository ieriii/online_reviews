I'd never heard of this place til a few weeks ago when I started dogsitting down the street. I walked the pooch past it several times before I finally decided to head in and check it out. Like a lot of Chicago establishments, there's a welcoming sidewalk patio. It's a cute sports-themed bar with several large flatscreen tv's about. I love it because they have $5 Kronenbourg bottles and good drink specials. The waffle fries were awesome, and I'm looking forward to delving deeper into their food menu. A lot of it seems like it'd be pretty good. There's also some pretty solid dj's there on Thursdays now, so that makes the experience just that much better. I wish I was still living in Wicker Park, because I'd be there a LOT more frequently. Oh, and for those of you who use American Airlines' Aadvantage Dining Program, they participate, which for a mile whore like myself is a very good thing.
