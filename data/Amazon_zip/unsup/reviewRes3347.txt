The chicken wings are to die for. I am a sucker for crispy wings and this place delivers. Let's not forget that is the name of this place. When I first when I got the 5 wings. Yes you're thinking 5 wings won't fill someone up. But these wings are large in size and they come with the drum still on the wing. So it's actually like having 10 pieces of chicken. I had the Seoul sassy which was amazing. Added fries and a drink for an extra 2 bucks which was worth it. It felt like the fries were endless because the fries were small but there was a lot. Similar to mcdonalds fries which is a plus in my book. The next time i went i had the spicy BBQ. Not as spicy as i wanted but still very tasty and still very crispy. The Seoul sassy would have to be my favorite so far. They do have other flavors i would like to try as well. They also have Korean style burritos which also look appetizing. And they also have the traditional Korean bowls with bulgogi and other Korean favorites. The staff is nice but it is shared public seating. Large benches but if you have a big party you might have to wait. Paper and plastic accepted.
