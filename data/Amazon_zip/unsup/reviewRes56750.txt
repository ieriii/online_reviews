I've been to Sapori Trattoria three times total, and twice in the past two months. Overall, I think it's a great spot. I love the atmosphere. It's a great restaurant because it feels like you are eating at an old school independent restaurant. They have an awesome wine list and I have never had a bad experience there. It's nice that the restaurant is always full and lively but not too loud. My boyfriend had the pumpkin ravioli once and thought it was delicious. I enjoyed the gnocchi but ordered with a spicy marinara sauce that was DELICIOUS. The portion was HUGE and the two of us shared leftovers after being out on New Years Eve late night.They also send you a $15.00 gift card for your birthday... that's always nice! :)
