My favorite Chicago deep dish pizza! It may not be the "traditional" deep dish, but I think it tastes the best. You gotta love that slightly burnt, caramelized pan pizza crust. It's kinda like Pizza-Hut-meet-deep-dish (but better tasting). I really like the large chunks of toppings. The red sauce complements the crust and the toppings well. Unlike Giordano's or the other big name pizzas, Pequod's isn't loaded with cheese. That's a good thing - it's nice to be able to walk somewhat after a meal, rather than being immobilized with cheese in your veins. It's also cool that Pequod's still remains more of a local restaurant than a huge chain (like the other Pizzerias) that is expanding to every suburb known to man. Recommendations: gotta get deep dish, be prepared for a wait unless you go early, and order some meat toppings even if you're a vegetarian :)
