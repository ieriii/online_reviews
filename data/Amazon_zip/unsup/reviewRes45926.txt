I went there in a group of eight. To be honest, I'm not really this restaurant's fan. There were so many people waiting, all over the entrance and stairs. Maybe we chose the bad time to go there. We went there on Sat evening. I ordered the chicken pot pie. It tastes good, but not in a surprising way. I saw some of my friends had spaghetti, and they really look good. Maybe that's the better choice. I think that place is definitely for hang out with a group, but not for a date. I feel the phenomenon is too crowded and pressured. Just a feeling. Maybe go there in a breakfast or brunch time would be better.
