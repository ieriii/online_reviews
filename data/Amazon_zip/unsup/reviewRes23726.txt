This place is definitely a clean Chinese restaurant. When u walk in, the servers are wearing the black and white bowtie uniforms. The food is pretty authentic and flavorful too. We ordered the Mapo Tofu and the eggplant with pork since there was only 2 of us. Both of the entrees were defintely good. I would have loved to try more items on the menu. Will definitely come back. Our total bill for 2 people w/ tax and tip was about $30.
