Many dinners here as the food is delicious however the service and hosting situations always seemed frustrating to say the least. We have only gone back because of the food. Last visit despite a reservation we were seated about 4 inches away from a 2 top table on one side and a railing on the other. The waiter couldn't even squeeze by. When I spoke to the host about the seating he looked at me and said that is all we have. i looked around at other open tables and he replied that those were reserved. Umm, we had reservations. Needless to say, we left hungry. My out of town guest was shocked .
