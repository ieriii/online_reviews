Given it's hype, Gino's East was so...disappointing. First, the faux-artsy decor. As soon as you walk in, you see that absolutely everything is covered in writing in what looks like white-out pen. There are people's names, dates, the cliched Bobby + Jane 4 Ever...at first I thought it was pretty cool that they basically let their decor be created by their customers who could come back in 20 years and see their writing...until I saw a sign that said "No writing on the walls please!" Mentioning it to my date, he pointed out that all of the writing was in the same handwriting, from which we have reached thefairly confident conclusion Gino's had actually paid someone to come in and make it look like customers had done it. I hope that this isn't the case, but if it is...wow. I could have let this kitsch ambiance slide if the pizza was good...before coming, friends in the area (and internet research, duh) had implied that this was the gold standard of the Chicago deep dish pizza. After having basically gone through a four day pizza tasting tour in the city though, this didn't even come close. We got the Gino's East Supreme, and there was barely any cheese on our pizza and the crust was nothing special. If I was visiting the city again and had only a limited number of meals to experience the culinary culture of Chicago, this place would be a definite skip.
