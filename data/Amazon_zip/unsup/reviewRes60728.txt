I've been to Kuma's Corner at least 5 times before I heard of Lockdown, and I'm glad I finally got the chance to check this place out.First of all, half-priced burger Tuesdays? Fuck yeah. The burgers here are pricey but they are delicious and will definitely hit your spot. They don't have as many pre-made burger options as Kuma's but they do give you a list of all their toppings, plus they give you the option of adding them to your burger for just $1 per topping. At Kuma's that doesn't really fly, they even have a sign that asks customers to try and avoid changing the ingredients on their burgers. Also, the staff here is SUPER laxed and friendly. Not in that creepy in-your-face kind of way but they genuinely seemed happy enough to put some personality and fun into their work and customer service. Even the owner himself went around hanging out with everyone. Overall I had a really great experience here and it seemed that all the other customers were too.When it comes down to it, I would pick this place over Kuma's in a heartbeat. Why? 1.) Amazing burgers. 2.) Awesome staff and great customer service. 3.) Customizable burgers. 4.) Half-priced burger Tuesdays. 5.) They serve aioli with their fries, yum.
