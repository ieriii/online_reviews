I had totally forgotten about this place until I saw it on the ROTD. This place is excellent. Clean, good service, great food. Really good food. I had never had Costa Rican food and I was pleasantly surprised. It can be difficult to find a spot at times which is why I hesitate to give Irazu five stars. A bigger location would be nice but all in all I can see myself going back real soon. Hell maybe this afternoon.
