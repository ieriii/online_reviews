Given the small language barrier I initially had with the Indie Caf staff when booking our GNO reservation, I have to admit I did get a tad nervous with how they would handle the rapid-fire service of 20 hungry, fabulous and semi-critical yelpin' women. I love to be proved wrong though and the folks at Indie really catered to our group impeccably well!! Totally on top of their game, we had wine and champagne (it's BYOB - score!) chilling in buckets in no time, a round of pre-ordered apps sailing to our lips and a fantastic table in their 'red room' set up with flickering candlelight and lots of modern, stylish touches. I have not one complaint about any of our dishes, either. Our rounds and rounds of apps were so very budget friendly and insanely delicious!! We all went bananas for their crab rangoon - those delightful pockets of sinful goodness were gone in nanoseconds - they come with that ubiquitous sticky, sweet sauce only kicked up with a really nice touch of spicy heat! More flavor = Me so horny, er, happy!! Do go for the fresh spring rolls if you want a more waistline friendly option, these vegetarian delights seriously make up in taste for what they lack in calories. I think I can safely speak for everyone and say we all adored our sushi dishes. Amazing presentation and taste made standouts like the La Fiesta maki, White Scorpion maki and Sweet Potato maki well received unanimously. Even my sashimi was excellent - and the addition (finally!) of the fried shrimp heads to accompany my ama-ebi (sweet shrimp) made me a huge fan of Indie on the spot and even triggered a group singalong of the roly, poly fish heads song. Nice! A solid 5 stars for Indie Caf and their great digs although I'm sure the 18 bottles of champagne we toted along didn't hurt to skew things in their favor either!
