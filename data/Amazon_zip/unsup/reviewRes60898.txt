I was forced by my girlfriend and friends to visit and dine again at this Brazilian wannabe steakhouse, I don't know why I listen to them, the service was the worst in Chicago AGAIN, servers didn't care about tables it could be because the gratuity was included ? I don't know. And an Asian American manager got the attitude to high pitch his voice to the host of my party (my boss !!!) .... Ew ZED
