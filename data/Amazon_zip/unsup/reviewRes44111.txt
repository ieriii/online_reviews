This review is only for their pain au chocolat and their ambiance. I'm 8 months pregnant at the moment, and all I can think about is their chocolate croissants, which sucks for me, cause they're not really close to where I live. They're really good. So we've been going every weekend for breakfast. The inside has a nice bakery feel. I hate when I walk into a bakery and it feels dirty. This place has a great balance going on. Feels clean, but warm and not sterile. I haven't tried their coffee (I usually get our croissants and eat them at caffe streets). I suppose I owe it to them to stay and have a cuppa with them this weekend.
