I would have given this place 5 stars had the waitress not messed up our Margarita order and given us the wrong check. Thankfully, our friend pushed the waitress who was unwilling at first to switch the margarita to provide us with the right one. I mean, we know what we ordered. This place has 1/2 price margaritas on Tues/Thurs. (a steal).. If you come here on a Thurs, make sure to come by 6. we came shortly after, and had just beat the mad rush... and the restaurant is pretty small. We had a large pitcher of mango margarita (frozen) for $13 - normally priced at $26 per pitcher. A large pitcher would probably allow each person 1.5 glasses - which is pretty good if you're not looking to get plastered :). The chips & salsa (free) are really good.. we also ordered the guac and chips which were good as well for apps. For dinner, I had the carne asada for around $13 - MmmM MMm Mm. I'm not a big fan of Mexican food, but it was cooked extremely well - not too dry, not too rare, tasty, the beans and rice were so good. I also picked at a friend's fajitas - which were really good, and the super burrito was huge and tasty. Overall, with the app, entree, and pitcher, I ended up paying $22.. which was pretty good for a delicious meal. I'd definitely come back here.
