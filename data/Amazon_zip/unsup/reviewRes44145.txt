Checking out a new bakery is always fun, because there's a chance I might strike gold and find my favorite dessert on Earth - the French Macaron. You know, the little pastries that look like tiny burgers, that come in dozens of different flavors and colors. The macarons here are a bargain compared to other places that make quality macarons, at $1.50 a piece. They didn't have the price listed, so I was shocked my total was so cheap. I've only been able to try a few flavors, since they were running out when I stopped by. I tried the Pistachio w/ Dark Cherry, Coconut Lime, and Passionfruit Chocolate, which were all really good. Their macarons pack a flavor punch and have a perfect airy chewy texture. They also make a variety of other pastries, including cupcakes, cookies, croissants, bagels, cake pops, as well as sandwiches and java. They make nicely decorated mini tarts, cheesecakes, and other sweets, perfect for giving as a gift. If you're looking for a unique cake, they whip up some nifty designs, which you can check out in their window display. The 3D bloody heart with an arrow through it looked pretty sweet. The bakery itself only has a tiny table, but they do have a lounge next door where you can take your baked goods. Free wifi, macarons, and coffee - sounds like the perfect place to get some work done or read a good book. This place is now my go-to macaron joint and I'm looking forward to going back for their other flavors.
