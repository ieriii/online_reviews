i went to la pasadita for late night tacos. maybe my senses were dulled, but this seemed to be a legitimate taqueria, which made me really happy. ingredients were really fresh and simple, definitely not gringo tacos. just steak, onions, cilantro and salsa verde. the atmosphere isn't great, but i tend to think that's the mark of a good taqueria.
