This is my FAVORITE Italian restaurant in Chicago. The ambiance is so charming, with exposed brick, sparkling lights and small rooms. The pasta is all homemade and the sauces are delicious, but it also has great seafood offerings. I love th e salmon! I dream about the tiramisu, because it is so tasty and such a generous portion. They have a great wine menu, overflowing bread bowls, and a charming head chef who will send you generous monthly coupons and birthday coupons once you get on his mailing list. This is the first place my husband and I take people when they visit, and it our birthday tradition to go to this neighborhood gem.
