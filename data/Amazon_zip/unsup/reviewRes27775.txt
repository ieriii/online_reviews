WOW. g.e. is a cool, cool place with excellent service, a beautiful space, great wine list and delicious, interesting food. I started with a deliciously fruity and balanced glass of sparkling rose -- i dont know if i was simply just really happy last night or what but even the color of the rose seemed better than i had ever seen. their caesar salad is DELISH.....three hearts of romaine, three strips of anchovy, two twinkie brioch squares with garlicky something or other inside (holy hell...YES...give me more) and my date had the oysters - which really, i dont like, but they really looked beautiful and he said they were good. we also split a great bottle of something or other barbera asti...it was delicious and didnt overpower my dishes. my main course was a PERFECTLY cooked halibut filet mignon tht came with a tart and tangy fruit salad, lemony hummus and some sort of olive compote. it was delicious and all the flavors worked together seamlessly...although i must say it was alot going on on the plate. but now...drumroll please....the apple fritters. thank you god for bringing them into my life. my date doesn't even get dessert and really doesn't even like sweets and i had to make sure to save exactly 1/2 to give to him! they were DELICIOUS....light, perfectly fried and the sweetness of the caramely sauce and sweet batter was tempered by the tart apples....i truly could have just eaten those things all nigh! my only gripe was the is was a titch loud (but major props for playing the entire postal service cd) and the service was a little, uummm, starchy. also- we didn't get the popcorn!!! hrmph. i would definintely recommend g.e. for anyone in or visiting chicago...would be great for girls night out (excellent cocktail list and lots of bubbly) or on a date....
