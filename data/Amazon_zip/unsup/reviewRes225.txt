Come on. It's Alinea.  * Don't be cheap. Get the wine pairing, and enjoy! * TIP your servers. At least 20% if not, 30. * Show up early or at least on time. * They were respectful and even made special courses for my friend who didn't drink raw alcohol. Lastly... STOP TAKING PICTURES!! YOU'RE ANNOYING! And it takes away from the experience of other diners....like myself.  Eat, enjoy and take in the wonderment that is this experience.
