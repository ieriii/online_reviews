Oh Hopleaf, how I missed thou! I'm not a beer person, but I feel compelled to order beers every time I visit you. And when I moved outta Chicago, I went on an aimless search for something to replace the void in my heart where you used to be. Now that I'm back, I just had to order your succulent & fresh mussels, crispy and somehow never greasy fries with the wildly addictive garlic aioli. I'm determined to go through your extensive beer menu methodically. Not even your hour long waits could deter me. I'll be back soon. xoxo
