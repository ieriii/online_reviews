Tank is 100% solid. I haven't had anything bad here - from Pho to Fried Rice. But really, go there for the pho, it's the best I've had. They also have amazing spring rolls, 100 varieties of beef/chicken/pork, great bun (imagine the ingredients of a spring roll served over noodles) and even pretty good bahn mi! (although they're better across the street at Ba Le). The prices are low, the atmosphere is bustling, and the food's always good. Don't ask, just go!
