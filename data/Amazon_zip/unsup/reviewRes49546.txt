Although I've been to Bin many times for drinks, last week was my first time for dinner...all I can stay is stick with the wine and cheese!!!!! The menu is overpriced, and even though the oysters were actually good and fresh (we took a gamble ordering those!) the fish special was disgusting...the fish was NOT fresh and there was no flavor in the other ingredients. The dish was also lukewarm so you could tell they had 20 sitting in the back ready to be served. And for $25!?!? I would have rather spent the money on another wine flight and a block of aged cheddar. I'd come back for the wine (the Italian White and Spanish Red flights are awesome!) but never for the food. You can also shop Bin 36 online - the prices are reasonable and a flight of 4 bottles of wine makes a great gift!!
