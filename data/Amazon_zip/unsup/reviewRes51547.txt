I went to Garcia's for lunch and didn't know what to expect with such a divergence of reviews here on Yelp. It was not as bad as some reviewers indicated and not as good as others - an average quick/cheap-but-not-a-chain kind of place. Yes, a bit greasy but not horribly so. Kind of rundown looking (I imagine it used to be a former Greek/American type of place) but clean enough. Prices were very good and the service was quick and cheerful. The food was good enough but not special. Average chips, salsa and guacamole. Kind of bland. I order a spinach quesadilla and a steak quesadilla but was served 2 steak quesadillas. Annoying. Taste was OK. Coffee, pretty good. Overall average.
