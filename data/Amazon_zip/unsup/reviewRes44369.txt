You'd think after a brunch of decadence and about four cups of coffee, I'd think twice about stopping in at Alliance. But I'd heard about Intelligentsia for so long that when I saw they served it here, my friends and I had to pop in for a coffee and a cookie. I ordered a cappuccino and a chocolate macaroon and immediately headed out front to scarf streetside. The chocolate macaroon was absolutely amazing, melt-in-your-mouth perfect -- a satisfyingly chewy coconut cookie topped with a creamy dollop of chocolaty gooeyness on top. And despite this not being an actual Intelligentsia cafe, the barista did my cappuccino up right -- rich, flavorful espresso and expertly foamed milk. By all rights, I should have had a massive coronary right there. Maybe there is a god after all.
