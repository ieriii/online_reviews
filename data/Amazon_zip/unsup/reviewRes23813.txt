Mooove over pancakes!  We came here on a lazy Sunday afternoon and were happy that it wasn't overran with brunch-ers. Who wants to wait when your tummy is grumbling for some nourishment?! I la-la-la-loove crepes and they do them right.  The cucumber in the water was a nice touch, it added a refreshing flavor. We then had the Icosium crepe w/merquez and the crepe-de-roma w/chicken as our savory portions of the meal. The palace crepe had a little of everything that I love- spinach, pine nuts, garlic, goat cheese. The merquez had enough spice to add a little kick to the crepe. The crepe-de-roma was a lighter in taste but equally good. The soups were nothing stellar.  I wanted to order one of everything on the sweet crepe list. I always get full and have leftovers from my entrees but I manage to ALWAYS finish good dessert. We ordered the perla (dulce de leche, coconut, banana) and within a span of 5 minutes I finished it! I conveniently forgot I was sharing (who was in the bathroom) so we had to ordered another one...oooops ;) So we decided on the crepe aziz (strawberries, kiwi, nutella) w/vanilla ice cream. I think I could of licked the plate clean, delish! The place is cutely decorated and service was prompt. The next time I'm craving crepes I know where I'm headed to!
