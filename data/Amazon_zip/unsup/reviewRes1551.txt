Dont ever try this. It has been 6 months since Ive been to Hot Dougs and now Im craving it so bad that Im coming up with schemes on how to beat the system. Look, Ive eaten here before. I know the drill. I know how awesome it is and I know how long it fu**ing takes. That being said I tried to get sneaky. Knowing full well that they close at 4pm. I showed up at 4 thinking I could get in quick. The line was still half way down the block so I decided to wait and come back at 5 (1 hour after they were closed). When I showed up the line was almost gone. I was so fired up. I parked and walked up and got in line. Thats when I got bitched slapped. Hot Dougs must have an employee that waits at the end of the line once they are closed because he stopped me and informed me that they were closed. What a drag. I thought I was onto something. Now I am craving this place like hell and I just dont want to wait 2 hours.
