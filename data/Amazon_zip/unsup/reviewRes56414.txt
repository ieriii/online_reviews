UUUGGGHHH!!!! loveitloveitloveitloveit!!I found this place on urban spoon, had great reviews there as well. It's such good food, even better atmosphere. Small, BYOB, and the owner is this little man who smiles and bows his head ten times while he thanks you for coming. I want one.I've had great memories there - went one night with friends, it was some other guys birthday. Everyone in the restaurant ended up cheering and singing happy birthday to him. Also on my roommate's birthday. They obligingly held on to a cake I had brought in earlier, presented it with candles after dinner, and we cut them all pieces afterward.The food is so fresh and I always order too much and force myself to eat it all. My only... criticism.I was somewhat tempted to rate it 0 and tell everyone there was a human finger in my food so it would remain undiscovered...
