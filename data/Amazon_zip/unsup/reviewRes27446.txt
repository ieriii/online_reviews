I hate to be the bad one to deliver the news... but this place is way over rated. The food is good, it is not great. And it is definitely not worth waiting in line for. Would I eat here again, sure. It is edible. Went here three or four times in the last 12 months. This place has been around for years so I am expecting that they have perfected their dishes and know what they are doing. Order the steak a couple of times and they are hit and miss - it was served overdone at one time which to me is unforgivable for a place like this. Ordered the duck breast in two different occasions and both times missed it completely - un-evenly cooked and overdone (I'm not even sure how that is possible but they managed to do it). My motto is, if you can't cook it the proper way, then do not put it on your menu.  The drinks are good. Still, much too much hype for what you get. It is a downtown option for dining but I think you would be surprised with what you can find nearby that is MUCH better than this place. This would have been a 2.5 stars but no half star ratings here. So... Frontera, you can thank me for the extra half star that you do not deserve.
