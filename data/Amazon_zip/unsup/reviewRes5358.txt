Better than The Gage. Won't say my night here was really all that great, but I'm still glad it's an option to the lovely, but limited, Michigan Avenue. Did not enjoy: Prosciutto Bread Balls, Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs, and some broccoli type antipasti Did enjoy: Milk Braised Pork Shoulderwith Mashed Potatoes, Salt-roasted Beets with Whipped Goat Cheese & Pistachio Vinaigrette, and half bottles of wine. 3-3?
