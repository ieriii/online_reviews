Wow! I have to agree with Michael S. Sprout was a great experience... One of my girlfriends and I went to sprout on a Sunday. We were originally planning on dining there on Saturday but ended up changing our plans to go on Sunday. The atmosphere was great it had really relaxing music playing and wasn't crowded which was nice. We both had the Prix Fixe menu. Everything was amazing!! I started off with the foie gras and short rib for my main course.I finished off with the lemon dessert. I cannot explain the short rib it was probably one of the best dishes I have had in the US. The truffle in the potatoes were incredible while I was eating this plate I was speechless...amazing! I also have to mention our waiter did a excellent job of explaining everything. My friend and I were slowly tasting everything we felt like we were on top chef and at one point my friend looked at me at was like I am Tom you can be padma It was pretty funny. All and all Sprout was an great experience.. loved it! Oh by the way I had the pleasure of meeting Dale!! After our meal he came out and greeted us! I will be back to try everything!!!!
