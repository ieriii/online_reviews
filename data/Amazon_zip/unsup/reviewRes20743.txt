This place is across from Millenium Park...expect to pay for it. They have a very nice selection of bottled beer and whisky (although the taps are a bit ho-hum and all from the same beer distributor). The food is expensive, but the menu is impressively diverse and interesting (especially for the location). I went with something a little boring, but the fish & chips were fantastic. The goat cheese soup with crispy escargot (special) was creamy, rich and delicious. Overall, I highly recommend The Gage and will probably stop in for drinks or a snack again soon.
