Wow. Not impressed. I was so excited, as an avid Top Chef fan, I almost passed out when I saw Rick Bayless behind the counter, (he was consulting not cooking) ...do not go here on Friday for lunch if you have a desk job, because I returned to my desk 2 hours later and my coworker didn't even get to eat at the restaurant. They "lost her ticket". Wanna know what's even better? They sent her home with the wrong sandwich!! I realize they were slammed with eager diners, but yowzers. I must say that I was impressed with my jamon sandwich but then again... who pays $14 for a glorified panini and churro? (the churro was only $1.25) I thought this was supposed to be street fare? So, my suggestion if you want to pay out the wazoo for a sandwich and have a couple of hours to kill on a lunch, with no real service, Go here! I'm guessing you can have a better lunch experience for a lot less. Or just save your pennies and go to Frontera where you get the same quality of food WITH an actually pleasurable dining experience.
