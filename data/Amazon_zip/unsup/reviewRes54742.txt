Just a friendly warning to others...we experienced horrible service at the greektown location. We will not be back. We arrived at 9:30am on a Sunday and got a table right away. If you decide to try this place on a weekend, I would recommend going before 10am, because it did get busy at that time. We were rushed to order right when we sat down and the menu is quite extensive so we asked for a few minutes. Even though she came back twice in one minute, it wasn't that big of a deal and we ordered several things off the menu. The coffee smells a little burnt and tastes bitter--not my favorite--had to put a lot of cream in it. The juices we tried were smooth but not good flavor combinations. The donut pancakes were fine but doughy in the middle. The potatoes and eggs were fine. The service was frustrating. We weren't there but 20 minutes and they tried to clear my friend's coffee cup away from her. It was empty because no one cared to refill her cup. There were 4 young girls (hostesses?) standing behind us just staring at tables to get them to leave. Plus there was an older man breathing down my neck and instructing the bus boys to clear away everything immediately. We were still eating when they took one of our plates. We had to ask maybe 4 times in the meal to leave something on our table. I am very aware of people waiting for tables and will not stay at a busy place just sipping on coffee for hours, but I started to feel angry that we were rushed throughout the whole meal. It was rude and unnecessary. We were there for less than 40 minutes for a party of 4 spending $25-$30 each plus tip. Plus, there were only 2 parties waiting for a table at the time.Bottom line: there are so many options in Chicago that, even if the food was great, it's not worth rude customer service.
