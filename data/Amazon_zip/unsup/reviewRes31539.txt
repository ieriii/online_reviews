My first impression was that SUNDA was very 'sceney'. I went there during fashion week and there were several models there. I felt like there was a little too much attitude but then I was pleasantly surprised when the host offered to sit us down an hour early since my wife is pregnant. We were able to get some appetizers and drinks at the comfortable lounge area. They mixed my wife an off the menu non-alcoholic mango drink and we munched on some incredible sushi. They also had my favorite San Miguel pilsner.  Dinner was even better, but beware, it is better to eat family style there. Being Filipino I tried the few filipino dishes there, lumpia and crispy pata. It was great. They also served up some great vegetarian substitutions for our vege friends. They did some amazing things with cauliflower which under normal circumstances I can't stand.  Someone also ordered the shakened beef which was a very tasty, spicy version of sauteed beef.  it is a little loud but the vibe is young and relaxed. had a great time and will definitely be back.
