Excellent choice of hotel in Chicago with courteous staff, spacious rooms, great location, and free wifi and business center (as it should be!) I lived in Chicago for four years and was thrilled with the location. It is just north of the river - 10 minute walk to Navy Pier, Mag Mile Shopping, and most importantly Gino's East, Frontera, Giordanos, and other great dining spots. It is walkable down to Millennium Park/ Art Institute but allow for a good 20 - 30 minutes. The staff was courteous but not in a robotic manner. Very approachable and if they didn't know the answer, they were happy to look it up. They also demonstrated empathy. Came in on a red eye on a very busy weekend (35K people in Chicago for a conference) and they gave us a room right away at 7am without any fuss.  The rooms were standard for any hotel chain - comfy beds, good tv channel selection, etc. We were fortunate and got a top floor room overlooking the lake and skyscrapers. If there was one thing I would have liked, it would have been complimentary bottle water to take on the road or to make coffee with in the morning - only because Chicago tap water has a slightly chlorinated taste to it. Also, the bottles of conditioner and shampoo were on the smaller side - enough for me but my wife needed more. I LOVED the fact they didn't charge for WiFi nor for use of the business center to print boarding tickets, maps, etc. On another occasion, I ate at Viand and it isn't bad - seems to be a popular function spot. (At the same time though, there are plenty of other great restaurants within close walking distance).  In summary, the courtyard has the best of all worlds: good location, free useful amenities, approachable staff, AND one can actually earn points for a stay.
