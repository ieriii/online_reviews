Geja's was an interesting experience. The highlights of the evening were the salad and the excellent dressing that it came with and the chocolate fondue for dessert. The salad dressing was the kind that you only get in a restaurant and can never recreate at home. And, the chocolate fondue was fantastic. The main course was fine though I'd recommend the meat over the seafood; the lobster was very bland. However, the vegetables that it came with, particularly the peppers and onions were fresh and very tasty. The cheese fondue that started the course however was not good at all. They need to re-think their type of cheese choice. Great wine list. Service was superb. The biggest drawback: we smelled like hot oil for hours afterwards.
