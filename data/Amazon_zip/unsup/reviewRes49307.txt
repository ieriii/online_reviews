Alliance is pretty awesome. I mean, everything I've had has been quite good, but I'll admit that I've only had the macarons (proper French and the American style w/ coconut and an extra "o" German chocolate version). My girlfriend tries the Milette once, but I didn't since I suspected it might have gelatin and gelatin and I are enemies. Oh, and we've both had perfectly tasty but disturbingly similar veggie sandwiches here (both w/ pesto and tomato but one with mozzarella and one with goat cheese and red peppers). I really enjoy the food here. Good macarons are not easy to find and Alliance has some tasty and interesting flavors (raspberry-rose is one of my favorites). But the service here is always a little aloof, the people up front aren't aware what ingredients are in which pastries (I asked today which things contained gelatin so that I could avoid is and the girl at the counter didn't know and made no attempt to find out, only stating that, "Probably just the things with mousse in them," which doesn't clarify much since that's 50% of the display). I think the fact that the people working in back don't really talk much to the people working the counter makes this a big problem for them. What about people with food allergies? They always treat you as if you've no idea what things are, explaining that they are fragile, best at -blank- temperature, etc. and it gets a little annoying hearing that every time you buy something. Also, I have to agree that the Alliance Lounge next door is a little unwelcoming. There appear to be regulars and they don't like their peace and quiet interrupted. I went there once, and only once, with two friends and we felt eyes on us every time we talked. Not the best atmosphere for a lunch with friends. So, in conclusion, the food is lovely, but the service is less than thrilling and the seating options are a little intimidating.
