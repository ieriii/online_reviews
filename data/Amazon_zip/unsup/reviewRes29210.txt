Blah--do not order their thin crust pizza by the slice! I ordered a slice with pepperoni, mushrooms, and black olives. The man said it would only be 7 minutes...cool! When it came out it looked like they already had a pepperoni pizza cooked, and then just threw on mushrooms and olives on top and threw it back in the oven for 5 minutes. It was really gross because the mushrooms were still raw. I will have to go back to try their deep dish everyone raves about.
