What a surprise. Drove by a thousand times, finally found parking one lucky night right in front. So crowded, so happy for a Monday night. Sat in the bar area, very nice service - but they seem a bit overwhelmed. VERY happy with the "Presidente Margarita" - it's a beautiful blend of Brandy, Grand Marnier, and of course Presidente Tequila. Yum it was good - roughly about 8 bucks. Had the fish tacos - 2 white fish tacos on a soft corn tortilla w/ very good rice and beans - roughly about 8 bucks. Flowing chips and pretty good salsa - not quite as good as across the street at Los Nopales - more tangy and less hot - but very good. Ice cold Modelo beer - real cold. Generally happy with everything - happy atmosphere, come as you are, no put-ons here.
