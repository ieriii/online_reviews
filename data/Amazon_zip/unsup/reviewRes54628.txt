I've been coming here for over 3,000 years, so I feel particularly qualified to pass judgement on this establishment. It's truly heart-warming to think back to the days when Sultan's was a decrepit little corner shop offering a full selection of canned goods. How far they've come. In general, the outstanding quality has remained despite the increased attention to the glamorous surroundings, but I do have a few complaints. 1. Food servers and cashiers: you don't need to fake like you've been dying to see me since I last came in a month ago, but at least say something to me. Or grunt in my direction. 2. The assembly line operation that Sultan's has become is indeed a marvel of 20th Century industrial science, but just as with Ford, more ends up being less. The quality of the now mass-produced food has declined enough that I can no longer in complete honestly tell people who haven't yet been here that it offers the best falafel ever. Still in the top ten, though. My humble advice is to avoid the most tragic victim of this Taylorization of Middle Eastern delights: the legendary falafel sandwich itself. More over-looked items like the spinach pie and the curry basmati rice are still given enough TLC to ignite anyone's palate. 3. Delivery is a waste of your time; it always takes so long that anything that was once hot arrives stone cold and anything that was stone cold to begin with was probably left out of the bag. Dine in only.
