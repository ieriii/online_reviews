Finally I can order!!! A much long wait to try eating at Rick Bayless's place. After a long wait in line to order, My family ordered up!! I ordered the "meal in a bowl" Carnitas, Thao ordered the short rib red chili soup, Natalie ordered the Cubana torta, Amaya ordered one of the special torts, Jenni got the Cubana torta as well. EVERYTHING was amazing. My meal especially, the Carnitas in a bowl was like eating Pho. The vietnamese soup. I couldn't believe how mouth watering it was. Better than some Pho even! (Yeah I said it!) Before you leave, order the Churros! A must, with chocolate or ice cream.
