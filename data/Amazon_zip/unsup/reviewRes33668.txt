Love this place, but remember the word 'market' when envisioning your fabulous feast. After ordering your food and sitting down to eat, you start to embrace the atmosphere. It's only missing a magic carpet and an snarky genie with Robin Williams' voice. I thought it looked cluttered when I first walked in. This is the single reason for ranking 4/5. Don't let it stop you though; the food is 5/5: The best falafel I've had outside of the Mediterranean and their lentil soup is to die for.
