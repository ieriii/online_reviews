Very good food. I took a client and we got there before it officially opened but they let us drink (heavily poured mojitos) at the bar while they continued to ready the restaurant. I appreciated that and we tipped accordingly. We had the red snapper & the filet and they both were really good. And of course we polished off a bottle of pinot noir. It's a little expensive, but look at the address.  Also, good Rush Street people watching. The only other place on Rush with better people-watching is the patio at Tavern.
