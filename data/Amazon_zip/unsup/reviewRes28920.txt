Decent food for a moderate price. I have eaten here numerous times and been happy eating in or carrying out.  However, I would not recommend this place for delivery. Delivery takes 45 minutes to 1 hour. This is a problem with pasta dishes where they always put melted cheese on top. You end up with a lukewarm dishes with a solidifying glob of cheese on top that is not exactly appetizing. While waiting for carry out I had noticed that the delivery orders were piled up on the counter. I think this is the problem right here. The restaurant consolidates orders for the delivery guy but don't care that this badly affects the quality of the food.
