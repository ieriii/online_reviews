This is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants. It combines great food with fantastic service in a comfortable environment. What stands out about Garica's is that it is the *only* restaurant where the wait staff doesn't seem like they want to get rid of you quickly, even when it's busy. Sometimes it can take a while to get your order placed but I tend to like this quality. For this reason it's a nice place to go on a date or to catch up with friends. Plus, the food is really amazing. I've tried a lot of different menu options and I love everything from chips and salsa to tacos, burritos, and the carne asada. It's all very tasty and relatively inexpensive so it's my default choice for good Mexican on the north side.
