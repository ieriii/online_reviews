I LOVE this place! I've never been let down and the staff has always been pleasant and informative. The food is fresh, clean, and from what I've seen, very contentious and sustainable. I'm on their email list and there is always some kind of tasting menu, class, or a roof top garden event going on in the summer. I appreciate this business for being so green and so modern. I implore you to stop in and try this lovely restaurant. Maybe have a seat next to the fireplace and try out brunch. You wont be disappointed.
