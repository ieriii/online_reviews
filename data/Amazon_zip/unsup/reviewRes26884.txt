The best mexican food in Chicago, perhaps the World. I am not kidding. The fried cheese is so delicious I have sexual fantasies about it. Not really, but if I had to make sweet love to a food object, it would be the fried cheese. The staff is nice, the place looks good, parking is easy, you can bring your own booze and I dont know if I have mentioned the fried cheese, but its pretty good.
