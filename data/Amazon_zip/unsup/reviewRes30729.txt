I travel to Chicago every month or so for work and always make sure to check out at least one restaurant that's buzzing with favorable reviews from my fellow Yelpers. Sunda was at the top of my list. Sunda is an asian-fusion restaurant that offers Chinese-Viet-Thai-Japanese dishes. Not sure if there's much of a 'fusion' since each dish is distinctively from their origin, but each dish shines well on its own.  Stand-out dishes are the oxtail potstickers and duck hash. The meat in both dishes were flavored perfectly and extremely tender and juicy. Let's put it this way, I dined solo and both portions were enough for two. I wanted seconds, heck THIRDS after I was done.  The service was decent. My waiter disappeared a few times throughout the night and my water glass was left empty of two occasions. I actually had to flag down another waitress to get a second glass of wine. Despite the lack of service, I would gladly go back to Sunda for the AH-MA-ZING potstickers and duck hash and the lively atmosphere. For some truly stellar food, I'm willing to overlook an absentee waiter.
