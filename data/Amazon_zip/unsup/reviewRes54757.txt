I can not say enough about Meli Cafe, the chef Frank Georgacopoulos creates so many interesting items on his menu, one has to go on Saturday and Sunday to fully enjoy it all. Wait is long on weekends but what do you expect from a place with kick-ass food. The owners are cool mellow guys, who entertain the customers with their antics, the girls up front are a riot....the younger of the two (a little hottie F.Y.I.) is worth checking out.Item you have to try is the Meli Honey Cakes, and Spicy Flamenco omelet.
