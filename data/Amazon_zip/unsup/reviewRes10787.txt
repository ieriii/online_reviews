Listen, I usually hate pizza. I'll eat it if I haven't eaten all day, and I'm too poor to afford anything else and someone else has footed the bill, but I won't like it. Pizza is usually a means to an end for me. The other day, I ordered their small cheeseless pizza, with chicken, and broccoli, and ate the entire damned thing. Piece converted me!
