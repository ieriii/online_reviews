Being from the East Coast and L from Az, I have a stronger opinion about pizza being thin, and oily, but we both love pizza. Chicago pizza to me before trying it, is to thick and to much tomato sauce. We went to Ginos before going to Alinear with L's two sons., I am a great pizza eater and can eat a pizza by myself. So, I wanted to order 2 pizzas. The waittress said we only need one pizza, and it wiil take awhile to make. I could not believe but between me, two college boys, and l we could not finish it all. 2 slices left. The wall decor was something, with the writing on the walls, different, we will go with. We wanted to find a real chicago experience, and a more independent place, read not a chain, but did not have time to locate one. It seems chicago pizza is more chains than the local pizza guy. It is still warm cheese and bed, but good east pizza is still preferred.
