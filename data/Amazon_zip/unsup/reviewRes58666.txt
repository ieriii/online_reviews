I've been to Bucharest and this place doesn't even come close.Food was meh and way overpriced. My schnitzel tasted like a Tyson chicken patty. The Award Winning Sausage-Stuffed Chicken Thigh was dry.The service was fine. They were very attentive. As other Groupon users reported-I was auto charged a 20% tip. I think the owner must have an issue with people using Groupons because he gave us an incredibly hard time. On the Groupon voucher it says that you can show the restaurant the voucher on your phone. However, the owner insisted that I must have a hard copy in order to use it. After 30 minutes of back and forth we finally got it figured out. To be fair the owner was nice, but kind of a tech-idiot.Mediocre food. High prices. Tons of hassle. I won't be going back.
