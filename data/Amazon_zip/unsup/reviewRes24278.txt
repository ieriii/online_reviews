Back for the first time in a while. We booked dinner for 6 for my husband's birthday and were hoping for a very special night. Service was beyond terrible. Food rushed out at first, our table over crowded with old plates, no one picking them up etc. In fact, we had to start clearing it ourselves and insisting that the army of people crowding the food on our table take them away.  Then we hit a food drought. Nothing came out for what seemed forever, and again, we stared at a dirty table while no one came to check on us. Final straw was that after we finished eating our main server was doing the Absinthe demo at the table next to us and again, NO ONE came to check on us. We sat waiting for someone to see if we wanted dessert or after dinner drinks for so long that we decided to go elsewhere.  The food was not as good as remembered. EVERYTHING had saffron aoli and was way too heavy handed. The only good thing about the night was the lamb chops... and they really were amazing!  Our dinner for 6 people was $600! Our server did find time to add a 19% tip to our bill. At this price point, that type of service is unforgivable. At no point during the night was it acknowledged that it was a special occasion despite my calling several times to mention it.  We weren't looking for anything free, but just something to make it more than just a dinner out.  Dessert at Hot Chocolate made us all smile again and remember what awesome service could add to a night out. We will NEVER dine with Mercat again.
