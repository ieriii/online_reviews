If a 6'2" red headed irishman signing italian songs with an accordian doesn't work for you, I just don't know what to tell you. The food here will not blow your mind, or your bank balance. It'll be fine, pretty much classic Italian American dishes, all done well. The food is fresh, which you'll notice and is better than some other places. But its not creative or edgy or contemporary. La Villa feels like 1955 came to dinner and never went home. One thing you will never call this place is pretentious. Service is a standout. Our very young waitress was nonetheless knowledgeable on the menu, had good suggestions and was really good with our 2 year old boy. He loved the place, by the way, and its really family friendly. Parking was ample.
