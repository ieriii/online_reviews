Stopped by for brunch before seeing Les Miserables. Since it was Sunday, there was a large crowd, but if you're okay with sitting at the bar instead of a table the wait time isn't too bad. Menu is standard brunch fare - I had eaten at one of the other Yolks in the city before (I don't remember what I had), and I wanted to try a different item from their menu. The menu recommended the eggs benedict, so that was what I ordered. It tasted on par with other eggs benedict that I've had before, and it comes with potatoes and fruit (i.e. super filling, food coma-inducing meal). Definitely got my money's worth.
