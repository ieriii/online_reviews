I actually ate here for New Year's Eve for the first time. They had a 4 course or 8 course prix-fixe and we opted for the 1st seating which offered the 4 course. I've heard that Bowles has a young, humor filled outlook and his restaurant truly represents that. You get fine dining in a comfortable, casual atmosphere. The service was good, the food was great...made with a twist, yet familiar, and the complimentary popcorn is a true unique delight. When I get the chance, I'll be back to try items off the regular menu.
