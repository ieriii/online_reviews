Friends recently had a party where more than a dozen people got food poisoning from their beef stew. The public health department found more than 10 violations, 2 critical in their kitchen and were cited and later fined. (11/19/2007 Citation #H00003642715) A follow up showed some violations remained but were eventually cleaned up.The worst part about it is that the owners showed little regard for the adults and children who got sick that day. Many of our families have a long tradition of going to Nuevo Leon but not any more. Their behavior is unexcusable.
