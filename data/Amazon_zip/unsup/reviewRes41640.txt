We finally got into Bonsoiree on a Saturday night, and I am so glad we held out for the underground menu. It was six delicious courses, each one meticulously prepared with many different ingredients, it is a foodie heaven. There is an offer for more than six courses on weeknights, six is more than enough as it does start to get overwhelming. Also, I wanted to agree with a previous post, the lemon cake was not very good, and a disappointing finale to a great experience, but by this course we didn't care, the fruit components were delicious. Finally, the place was super noisy and for two hours it started to wear on us. The servers were awesome! I would definitely go back for a special occasion such as bringing out of town guests. It is a Chicago treasure for sure.
