Had the tofu-eggplant dish, fried rice, and lychee smoothie. The smoothie was amazing, but I did not like the food that much. The owner, as previously stated, is incredibly nice and generous, so I really appreciate that. I will probably go back and try the Banh Mi sandwich based on service alone. I would give the service is 5+ stars, while the food is a 3.
