Excellent value! Very friendly and helpful staff. Rooms are good-size, with 12-foot ceilings. We had a king suite, with separate living room area. Nicely appointed. It is very convenient to all the Chicago activities and transportation. Lived in Chicago area my whole life and had no idea that this has existed, and dates back to 1896, and is on the National Register of Historic Places. Definitely will stay here again!
