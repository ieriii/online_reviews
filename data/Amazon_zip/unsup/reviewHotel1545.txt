I booked this hotel (1 king size bed, city view) through Expedia and managed to get a pretty good deal on it for the dates 12/28/09 - 1/1/10.. A few days later, I found it cheaper on Kayak and called Expedia for their price match guarantee. I spent over two weeks waiting for them to process my credit before I called to check up. They told me that the Kayak website did not specify the exact room (i.e. deluxe or not) so they couldn't credit my account. I argued and ended up with a $50 credit. Bleh, at least I got something. Anyways, as far as the actual hotel goes, it was better than average but not great. It felt like a hotel that tried to be modern and hip but wasn't quite there yet. Service was excellent with nothing to complain about. Two elevators were available for my floor (they separate it into two halves, each with two elevators) and I never had to wait long. Most of the time the elevator is already at the bottom waiting for you. Room was nice. King sized bed was cozy and sheets were adequate. I love the wireless connection in the room and used my laptop from the bed often. I wish the TV was upgraded to a flat screen. I used their business service center to print out my boarding pass the day before my flight and it was easy to do. The biggest downside of this hotel which is enough to dock off 2 stars for me is the bathroom. First of all, I didn't like how the closet was located in there. Second, no counter top?!? All they had was a skinny ledge below the mirror which is barely enough to hold things. The shower curtains were crimpled and the toilet was horrendous (weak flush and it kept making a pumping noise for a few seconds after you flush). Tiles were old school and nothing to write home about. Besides the bathroom, everything else was good. The biggest plus for this hotel is the location. I found it very convenient to the Magnificent Mile (just a 5 minute walk) as well as the Metro stations. Would I stay here again? Probably.
