The food here is phenomenal. Very unique Mediterranean cuisine, and it's dirt cheap. My falafel was $3.75. If this sold at Panera it'd go for $6-7 easily. So, I get it. Great food at a great price. But there's more than that to a restaurant. You have cleanliness and service... and this place fails at these in some aspects.They were quick to make my falafel, smacked it on a tray, and that was it. Nobody was at the cash register. I walked aimlessly around trying to figure out where to pay. Eventually I got greeted by a gentlemen who said You gonna pay for dat?!?!? I apologized saying I wasn't sure where to pay -- the cash register is awkwardly placed high on a table which is hard to recognize. I can only imagine the people that run off not paying at this place.So Sultan's, I give you 3 stars. You were good -- but there's room for improvement.
