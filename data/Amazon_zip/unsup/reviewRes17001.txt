I just joined Yelp and am getting caught up on reviews! Have been many times and the food is awesome and the atmosphere is hip and trendy. The beet appetizer and Ropas ...YUM!!! The arrachera and steaks are very good. The pernil(pork shoulder) is tasty as well. Good mojitos and just discovered they do lunch as well. The menu is different at lunch but is very reasonable and there is something to please all.  Cheap valet parking rocks as well!
