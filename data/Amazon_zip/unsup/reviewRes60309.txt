If this rating were based on food alone, Wakamono would get 4-5 stars from me. Unfortunately, as countless other posters have written, the service is deplorable. These entire staff has such an incredibly entitled,, snobby attitude, it's turned me off for good. They recently refused to honor a gift card and when we pressed the manager on the issue, she started yelling, "I'M NOT WRONG!!" and threatened to call the police. Who does that?! I cannot imaging going into any other restaurant and having the manager, of all people, whine and scream like a child. Such a disappointment.
