What a disappointment! On Sunday evening the place was full but relaxed. Our server was a total disaster. He couldn't stand still long enough to get a wine order till his third visit to our table. They offer sharing, tapas-style portions yet he gave no advice on how much to order for 6 people. We asked about a few items and chose some. One dish that was listed among a group that looked like main courses was ravioli: it was literally one, large ravioli. It would have been nice to know this when it was supposed to be split for 6 people! When we had finished several items, we asked the waiter if the other items were coming. He said he hadn't ordered them but we were then brought another ravioli, which we hadn't ordered. As we began to chuckle, wondering what more they could mess up, they brought the check - and the bread we had requested with the salads! The check had a $7 corkage fee, though we ordered wine from their menu and did not bring our own. The extra ravioli we did not order and sent back was on the bill. We spoke to the manager who corrected the bill and said the waiter had gone home. The runners/busboys were great. The special pork shoulder ragu over mascarpone polenta on a plank was memorable. The pizzas were crisp and tasty. Alas, we shall not return. There is one truth: something will certainly go wrong, once in a while. One of the keys to customer retention is how a business handles those moments. They get a grade of C for handling this awful evening. If this is truly one of the Francesca group restaurants, many of which we've frequented over the years, I would have expected them to be more chagrined by this lapse and more eager to retain our business. New places think the sole key to success is good press. Repeat customers are apparently not needed. Spend your time and money somewhere else.
