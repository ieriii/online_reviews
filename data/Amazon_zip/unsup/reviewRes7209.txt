Being from Texas, I was a bit skeptical about upscale bbq, but excited to try it in hopes of finding a great new restaurant in our hood. Boy am I glad we tried it.  The place was relatively quiet for a Friday, but I can only assume that was due in large part to it being the day after Thanksgiving, and most people wisely staying home to recover from Thanksgiving day gluttony. Not us. Completely overwhelmed by what to order for a table of 5, we contemplated the menu over 4 bowls of chips and a bowl of pickles. Both were delicious. The poor waitress kept offering up suggestions, none of which we ended up taking her up on...oh well. We had the hush puppies and the onion rings...and my goodness, the onion rings were so delicious. The hush puppies were nothing special. For dinner, we went family style with ribs, pulled chicken, and brisket, as well as cornbread, fries, mac and cheese, and slaw. Everything was really delicious. I think I could do without the slaw and the fries, but the mac and cheese and cornbread were a huge hit. For dessert, we split the pecan pie...which really was nothing to write home about. Portions aren't super large, but we had more than enough food for 5 of us. The restaurant is really pretty inside, and the waitstaff was terrific. Thrilled to have such a great bbq restaurant so close by!
