POUTINE! I have found poutine in Chicago. This is important. I was born and raised in Canada, very close to the quebec border. 3 Years ago, upon my arrival in the USA, I realized a sad fact: the states lack poutine. Not any more. the gage make a wonderfully prepared, authentic, french-canadian poutine. It stands far above typical canadian "fast food" poutine, and would make a run for a contending position in the better quebec poutine eateries. Not to mention, their wait staff is wonderful, the environment is comfortable and elegant, and their prime rib steak was wonderfully prepared. I will be heading back to this location within days.
