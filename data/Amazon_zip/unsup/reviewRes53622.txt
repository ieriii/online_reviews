Best dogs ever! Keep in mind it is cash only. My wife and I didn't realize this until it was time to pay, and Doug ( nicest man ever that takes your order) let us eat, and then run to the ATM to pay. Sweet as apple pie. I had the corn dog and the gator, and my wife tried the blue cheese and pear sausage as well as the foie gras ( you have to try, right??!!!!) They were all delicious. A friend told us you can even bring you own beer, which was well needed to digest. The line wasn't too bad as other complained. My wife and I scarfed everything down! I recommend you try at least two dogs a person!
