not really sure what the big whoop was all about. only the mussels and pork belly were good. here's what our table of 6 thought about the rest: spicy pork rinds - not spicy at all, frito lay does it better and cheaper lamb kidney - gross. anthony bourdain and andrew zimmern make people think this shiz is tasy but it ain't. you don't have to make it gross and exotic to make something taste good. what happened to the good ol' reliable chicken leg? country ribs - too much gristle ham 'n hay or some sh*t - it was just soft ham. and the beans tasted like flowers. little gem salad - pig ears ain't all that. chewy and flavorless. whatevs. fries with egg - that's all it is. our waiter was friendly but a different server knocked over our pork rinds and didn't apologize, she almost blamed it on us when it was her wrist that pushed it over. then with her bare hands she put the rinds from the table (which i hope was disinfected prior) on our plates. sick. however, when the co-owner of the joint arrived, all of a sudden she was all smiles. behtch. i'm a pretty adventurous eater but i don't think you should try so hard or pick nasty organs to make a menu interesting and tasty. the purple pig did some weird stuff but they executed it deliciously, why can't the publican? on a side note, the people watching was pretty interesting. a lot of grinders out there in chicago. strange, strange folks. the evening was crazier than an episode of twin peaks. dang.
