These five stars are some hard-earned five stars. The staff deserve a medal for being this busy and still having a great attitude and doing all they can to make people happy.  The beer is fantastic. Definitely on par with GI and Piece and I'm excited to watch them develop their brewing. The Porter is amazing and I love the Mild and the IPA. They have what is easily the best Pizza in Logan Square (which isn't saying much at all but it is really good). It is really meant for one or two people though so don't try and split it among a big group. The burgers look amazing too and I love the fries.  If you don't get their early you will have to wait for a table. Keep that in mind.
