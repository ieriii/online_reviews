Went last night with friends, and were fortunate to snatch some seats in front of the draught at the bar. Beer selection was as impressive as I've seen in Chicagoland for sure. We ordered a side of Frites and Fried Smelts (with pickled cucumber & peppers)...both were enjoyable and complimented the Arrogant Bastard I had. Place was packed at 6pm, we did not eat dinner there. I liked the upstairs bottle service and open seating for overflow. Would recommend highly if you're in the area...be prepared to fight for a seat though.
