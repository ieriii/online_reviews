The chicken here gives Harold's a run for its money. It's cooked perfectly and well seasoned. I recommend the Seoul Sassy sauce if you don't like your chicken spicy. It is flavorful and slightly sweet. I also tried the bi bim bap bowl and it was quite good. They offer brown rice as an option, which I really appreciate. The real star here is the chicken. If you go here and don't order chicken, you are a damn fool and you will probably walk out of here thinking "Meh, I've had better". So get the chicken! It's all about the chicken.
