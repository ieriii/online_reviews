I went during a football game day when they have $5 burgers and $3 drafts in the lounge. I am a huge huge burger fan and I gotta say they serve a pretty adequate burger. Not the best I've ever had but probably the best I've ever had for $5. Probably one of the better I've had for $10 which is the normal price. Its a 1/2 lber with cheese, and they offer a variety of cheese to choose from, and bacon and lettuce and tomatoes and pickles on a pretzel bun. My only issue with it was that juices weren't dripping from it while I was eating. It was well seasoned however and cooked to my request- medium rare. The accompanying fries were almost shoe-string thin, crispy, and also well seasoned. The beer selection is great. No bud or miller lites that liter the limited offerings of other bars. This place had like 8 different types on draft, and all for $3!! Great great place to watch the game with a group of friends. Not too loud or crowded in the lounge area. Good service.
