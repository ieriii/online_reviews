This is a really nice place to get Sunday breakfast/brunch when you're in the area and don't feel like going through the hassle of Lou Mitchell's. When I lived in the West Loop, I enjoyed walking over, taking a book, and ordering some pastry and coffee to just linger over. Aside from nice baked goods, this spot also has really nice salads, hummus platter, and soups. I haven't tried anything else, but there are always good-smelling things going by me when I'm there!
