I had always heard such good things about this place and scooped up the Groupon when it came available. All of the promotions I had seen them at and the reviews made it seem like this place was definitely going to be amazing and so worth a trip downtown. Nope. The buffet was not the huge spread I was hoping for, just your average buffet. The food was all warm and good and flavorful but nothing stood out. We did enjoy the fresh nan and sizzling tandoori and appreciated the seconds they brought out.  This place is fine if you work downtown but not worth traveling down town, paying $8 to park and $15 per person for the meal. But if I am making a special trip I want more than "fine" I want "Yay! Yummy!"
