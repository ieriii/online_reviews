Simply Fantastic! More than just a must...a necessity in your lifetime. I've had the pleasure of enjoying the Tour (23 courses) on 2 separate visits to Chicago. The dining experience at Alinea is absolutely amazing. the FOOD: is beyond words. the combination of flavors, and the delivery of those flavors is truly masterful...beyond imagination. the PRESENTATION: is simplistic & beautiful. between your larger plated courses are a mix of smaller tastes on the most interesting contraptions. the serving apparatuses are just as fascinating as the morsels on them. the PRICE: is not cheap...but WELL worth it. the SERVICE: is great. very polite & attentive, not overbearing or snooty. exactly what you expect at this price point. As a food-photo maniac, it was disappointing that they DO NOT allow flash photography, my 1st experience was a photo bust, BUT the 2nd time I was prepared with my adjusted settings & got great photos! ALSO! when you do the tour, they give you a little souvenir of your gastronomical journey; a description of each course you enjoyed & the date you enjoyed it.
