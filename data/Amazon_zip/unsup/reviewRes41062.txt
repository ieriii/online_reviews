Food was great, but the service was bad! We had a person in our group that could not have any dairy, so he asked our waiter to not put any cheese on his salad. The salad came and it was covered in cheese. I asked for a soft drink but never received it, I had to ask again after about 15 minutes. Desert was ordered, we had two of one item and one of another, but when they brought out the first item, it was only one and we had to tell them that there were more deserts remaining. Next thing we know, we now have to many deserts, so we had to tell them that we did not order all of what they brought. The we received the bill, which had the extra deserts on it. Like I said, the food was great, but what good is that with bad service.
