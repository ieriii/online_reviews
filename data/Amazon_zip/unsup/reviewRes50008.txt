Despite the awesome 40 oz. nights, and generally good/strong drinks, I think this place is pretty lame. It's like the worst kind of bait and switch ever. It looks cool, it's in a neat building, the food is decent, and it's always jumping. All of these things might lead one to believe it's a good time... Unfortunately it's just not. The layout sucks, especially for the amount of people they pack into the place. The lower level becomes like a crowded basement party where getting drinks/not getting groped become impossible. The middle level is a joke because it's totally linear with tables on either side of a very small pathway that is constantly filled with LP frat boys filing in, and neighborhood peeps struggling in desperation to file out. If you get there early and snag a table or booth somewhere/have a server and don't have to order at the bar, you're probably okay...except for when you take your life into your own hands to hit the head. For my sports bar fix I would much rather head down the street to The Boundary. Bigger space, better food, (surprisingly) less douchey clientele.
