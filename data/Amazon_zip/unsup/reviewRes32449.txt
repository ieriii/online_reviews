We've been here a handful of times since Demera opened about 2 years ago and each time is a little less satisfactory than the other. Service is polite and pleasant but very sporadic and flaky (though this has always been my experience at Ethiopian places- I don't really hold it against them at this point). Our very first visit my girlfriend and I split the vegetarian combo which is your choice of any 4 vegetarian entrees. I think it was about $12 and we were both totally stuffed (and I'm a giant fatty, so this is a statement). Ever since we've always ordered the veggie combo and every time we go they give us less portions and the price is bumped up a bit. I think it's now at $15 and it's closer to appetizer size. Oh, and one time I ventured into meat ordering and pointed at someone else's entree and said "What is that? Can I have that?" and they told me what it was. When mine arrived it was... definitely not what the other guy had. Oh well. Anyway, the food is good, Ethiopian beer is good, and the wait staff is polite. They have a nice outdoor area in the summer but.. it's on the corner of Lawrence and Broadway and the one night we sat outside we were 2 feet away from some hookers and a homeless dude smoking a j kept ambling into the dining are asking for money.
