I'm a huge pho fan and this place was just a total let down!The pricing is right but the food is just terribly bland, yuck, and just EW!Here's an example, my pho tasted just like chewy beef in hot water and noodles. The broth had absolutely no flavor to it! I also sampled some of my friend's entrees, again very flavorless in everything. It might look good but don't let it fool you, it's not that great.Would I come back here? no. I've sampled better pho from lesser known places. Actually, I'm not even sure why this place is so busy, probably because it's on a corner but the food does not live up to what some of these customers are saying..
