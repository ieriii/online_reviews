I love love this place. Got to meet and talk to Dale and Sara when we dined there. They are terrific chefs and so nice!  I hope this place does really well. I had the crab (seasonal) and the skirt stake and something the waiter called "state fair on a plate". Yum! Did I say YUM!?! I thought the portions were perfect and a good value. Love the grilled cheese he serves -seriously the best grilled cheese you will ever eat. I wish the sold that solo. I'd eat like 10.
