I went to Zed451 for my birthday over the weekend and it was even better than I had expected! It is basically a Brazilian steakhouse but better because of the amazing salad bar and hip yet comfortable decor. I also peeked at their rooftop balcony/outdoor bar area which was closed due to weather conditions, but looked like it would be a nice place to grab drinks in the summertime. Meats: The ribeye and asian style pork belly were my favorites. The salmon was also quite a hit at our table. Salad bar: My boyfriend kept going back for the truffle butter and focaccia bread which was delicious. The Thai slaw was also memorable -- very refreshing. Service: Our server was very attentive, asking us which meats we hadn't tried yet but would like to. The next thing we knew, all of those meats had been sent to our table! Also impressive was that our water glasses remained full throughout the meal, even though they were itty bitty and had to be less than 12 oz. Then at the end of our meal, our waiter informed us of their shuttle service which can drop off patrons as far Ashland. That was a neat tidbit to keep in mind for our next visit. A+ for sure -- I had an all around excellent experience here and would recommend it to all.
