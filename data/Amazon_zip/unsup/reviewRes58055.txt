We came to Chicago as a getaway from Cleveland and to find good Chinese hot pot. Read all the reviews and decided to give Lao Sze Chuan a try. The service was absolutely terrible. Took 15 minutes to get our first drink. Ordered appetizers and the hot pot. The hot pot and the food came out before the cold appetizer, they only brought one drink, and I almost had to trip someone to get their attention. The food was okay, but I have definitely also had better hot pot. In fact our hot pot went almost dry before I could get someone's attention to top up the broth. So with terrible service and okay hot pot, I can't see giving this place more than 2 stars, which is really disappointing, as this was to be one of the highlights of our getaway weekend.
