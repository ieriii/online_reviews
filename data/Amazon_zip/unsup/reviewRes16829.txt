We went here after buying one of the $50 gift certificates for $25 and were excited to try it because of the great reviews. So here is how the night went...it was a Friday. Made a reservation for 7:30pm a week in advance and got there at 7:25pm and could not find any street parking, so we paid the $5 valet. When we went to check in, they told us there is a wait for people with reservations. I thought that was interesting, but mostly I thought that did that so we would go and buy over-priced drinks at the bar. We ended up waiting until 7:45ish until we were finally seated. While we waited, we had a weak sangria and a tasty rasberry mojito. When we were finally buzzed in, you walk into a large room that reminds my of the Rio casino in Vegas. Our waitress came to us right away and we ordered a bottle of wine and some manchego cheese. Both were delicious. For the meal, I tried the often-reviewed braised short rib and just thought it was just above okay. I did like the potatoes it was served on a lot. My wife ordered the ahi tuna, but the waitress put the order in wrong and brought the special of the day which was a ton of seafood on a dish. She loved it! For dessert we got the churros. Do not waste your money on this. There is nothing special about them and the sauces are nothing spectacular. In the end, the waitress realized she brought the wrong thing and ended up taking it off the bill which was really nice and she did give great service...thus the 4 stars. I don't think I would ever go back unless I had a gift certificate like the one I did.
