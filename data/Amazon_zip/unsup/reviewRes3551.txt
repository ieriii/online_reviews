It's an awesome place and the price is right. I would consider it healthy food if the portion were not that huge. I had some chicken wings which were perfectly marinated and cooked; and the BAD BOY BUDDHA BOWL (perfect mix of rice, veggies and meat). I'm definitely going back, it's the perfect place in this time of recession!
