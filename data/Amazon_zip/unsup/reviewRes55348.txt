Went here on a Saturday night ! Beautiful restaurant, great service, good ambiance. the kebabs (chicken, lamb and kourbedeh) were amazing. Portions were good too. Great place to go be it on a date or with the family. I wanted to give 5 stars but can not because they have a lack of sauces to serve with food. Authentic Persian Food always serves homemade yogurt with food, this was not the case here and no other sauces were there to add that kick in the flavor. Everything else was just great, Do try the Tea after your dinner. Bon Appetit
