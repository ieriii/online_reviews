I now live in DC, and among the many reasons why I miss Chicago, Giordano's is one of them. Every time I come home, I demand that my parents have a fresh hot Giordano's pizza waiting for me. There are a lot of good options when it comes to Chicago-style pizza (I'm also a fan of Gino's East and Pizzeria Uno... or Due) but Giordano's is hands-down my favorite. I love the stuffed pizza concept and it comes out to an amazing slice of pizza. I'm pretty simple when it comes to my pizza, so I usually just get the stuffed cheese, and I'm in heaven every time. The crust is nice and hearty, so if you're still not full by the time you're done with your pizza (an unlikely story, but it's been known to happen) then you can easily fill up on that. The cheese is warm and gooey and plentiful, and I can't complain about that. Chicagoans will always be at odds with which place serves the best Chicago-style pizza, but my vote will always lie with Giordano's.
