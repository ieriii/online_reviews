I only wish I lived closer to Cafe 28. Even if the food was not so heavenly and the outdoor patio was not so cute, I would go back there every weekend for brunch just for the Bloody Mary! So good with the glass rim coated in a chili powder/salt mixture and the giant green olives and the lime and I want one right now! What the 3 of us ordered: Cuban Steak Sandwich - Rib eye slices sauted with garlic & caramelized onions on French bread., It was served with enough black beans and rice to make a meal on their own. I ordered a small side of guacamole but didn't really need it because the sandwich was already so tasty . Cafe 28 Omlette with Serrano ham and goat cheese served with a salad . Such a delicious egg dish! (Not what I ordered but I probably will next time)! Honey Jalapeo Pork Chop with eggs, potatoes & toast. Takes a little while longer than the other dishes because the chop was HUGE! You need a big appetite to eat this enormous plate of food. Blueberry Pancakes - Best pancakes I have ever had! Next time I want to try the ones with lemon zest. They might be even more amazing! I intend to eat my way through the entire Cafe 28 Brunch menu this summer! I must thank Groupon for turning me on to this restaurant.
