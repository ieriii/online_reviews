Just got back after staying here for Memorial Day Weekend. After looking at all the pictures online and reading reviews, we were excited to stay here. The hotel did not disappoint. Upon reaching the hotel we were amazed by the gorgeous exterior. The hotel itself is a beauty. The inside is equally as stunning. The lobby area was very pretty and we really liked the long fireplace. Its a small lobby compared to other hotels, but it was extremely opulent and pretty. I guess we stayed in the basic room and I was really impressed. The floors are hardwood - I don't know why more hotels don't convert to this. It makes the place feel a lot cleaner and open. The bathroom is extremely large - maybe a little too large. There is a big bathtub and a big separate shower. The weird thing about the bathroom was there were no towel hooks or racks? This made it tricky to reuse towels or even just keep things looking tidy. The bed was comfy and they gave you plenty of pillows. I think there were over 8! There was also a large closet area with shelving inside. In terms of location, it was a little out of the way of Michigan Ave, but maybe that makes it more appealing. It wasn't loud in the area and its a short walk to Milennium Park (and the bean!) or to Michigan Ave. The staff were all very friendly and pleasant.I do recommend this hotel - it is a bit of a splurge compared to the other hotels in the area, but its a great place to treat yourself. If I am able to return to Chicago one day, I would stay here again.
