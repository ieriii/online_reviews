What a lovely place. Driving by, it caught my eye, and my instincts were correct. Their very seasonal menu is appealing, the service was great, and the food excellent. Desserts are 5-star. We had the assortment, and you just can't go wrong with that. Especially when everything was so right. Lemon basil panna cotta was exceptional.
