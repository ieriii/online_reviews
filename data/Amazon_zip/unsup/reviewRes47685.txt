Had an opportunity to come back and enjoy Wednesday happy hour on the rooftop lounge and I have to say I liked it--a lot. Ok, maybe not as much as my other favorite rooftop lounge but nevertheless, I liked it. Mainly because it wasn't pretentious--there was a very relaxed and casual atmosphere, casual dress, friendly service, and good food to boot. It just happened to be 90 degrees with 90 percent humidity so I did not enjoy sticking to the leather/pleather lounge seats and would have liked my drink and glass of water to be much colder (not lukewarm as served), but I'll let it slide this time. My watermelon cooler was delicious though it could have been stronger. We ordered some appetizers to share: BBQ chips, sliders, and flatbread pizza--all surprisingly good. Very pleased with Zed.
