Oh my goodness! My friend and I are visiting Chicago for the week and I was craving (not fried) seafood- this was just the ticket. We sat in the oyster bar, which had a really cool buzz about the place, and arrived in time for oyster happy hour- half off! We ordered two samplers so that we could each have a taste- my friend's favorite variety was the Island Creek oysters, mine was the East Beach Blondie. Highly recommend getting a sampler and tasting the differences in flavor and texture between the varieties. On to dinner- she had the sampler, which came with garlic sauted shrimp (large, butterflied), scallops (small and very tender- not a but of chewiness that comes with being overcooked) and a decent-sized crab cake (which happily was mostly crab and NOT stuffing...can't stand that!). Her meal was accompanied by a bit of rice and sauted spinach. A nicely proportioned meal that leaves you satisfied, not overstuffed. I ordered the lobster roll. The roll was accompanied by a large pile of fries- they were ok, not as crispy as I prefer, but it's difficult to ruin a fry. The sandwich on the other hand, was a star!! Our server (who was great, very knowledgeable and friendly!) mentioned the bread and mayonnaise are made in-house from scratch and the lobsters are fresh-shucked at the restaurant as well. I cannot emphasize how delicious this sandwich was- a very generous amount of lobster stuffing in a light, toasted roll- the sweet flavor of the lobster really shone through and while most of it was manageable, there were some pretty big mouthfuls in there (this is a good thing!!) All in all, I would not hesitate to visit Shaw's again or reccomend it. The food was well worth the cost and I'm actually considering squeezing in another oyster night before our trip is up, mmmm.
