We had an amazing dinner and night out at Zed 451 when friends came into town to visit. As a proud Midwester, I was amped to try all the meats at this famed churrasco. But after we hit the Harvest Tables a few times, we all decided to stick with these tapas-style delights and catch up over bottles from their extensive wine list. Our waiter, Gaston, helped make the night even better - he was super attentive and so entertaining for our whole table! It was definitely worth the money for the Harvest table selections; if only I had saved enough room to try all the meat!
