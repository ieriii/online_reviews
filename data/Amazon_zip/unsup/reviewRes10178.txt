This is place is good. It's very good. Our server was attentive without being over bearing. And the food was wonderful. My fiance and i both started off with the chef's platter for appetizers. It's basically an assortment of grilled vegetables (asparagus, zucchini, caulifower, etc) with olives and prosciutto. The amount of prosciutto they gave was generous. The grilled vegetables and whole slab of prosciutto were displayed on a table in the dining area and after we placed our order for it our server headed over to that table and assembled our platter. We also shared another appetizer which was the truffle and celery root flan. Yup, it was flan but not for dessert! This savory flan was amazing and not too rich. For my entree, I ordered half portion of the pappardelle with wild boar ragu. I asked my server if a half portion would be enough for me and he said that it would be more than enough. + points for his honesty. The portion was just nice especially after we've had two appetizers! My fiance's entree was the veal cheek which was one of the daily specials. I tried some of it and the meat melted in my mouth. It was so good. This place was reminiscent of Coco Pazzo Cafe in terms of their grilled vegetable assortment display table and the choice of ordering half portions for the pasta items. I read on their website that the chef and owner used to be with Coco Pazzo Cafe, so I guess that explains it. We would definitely return to this place. We live close by and pass by it alot and the whole night I kept asking myself "How could we not have eaten here before until now?!"
