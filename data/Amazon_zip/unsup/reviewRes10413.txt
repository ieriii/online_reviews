Quite honestly, one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. I have been looking for homemade pasta and I found the spot.  Food: excellent pasta dishes and entrees. My girlfriend and I typically split 2 different half past orders and the dishes are quite large for being half orders. We also split an entree and it is huge, not to mention tasty.  Service: Very attentive. Friendly server and water glass always filled, which is a big deal to me because I go through about 5 or 6 glasses of water at dinner.  I would definitely recommend
