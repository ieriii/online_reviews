I visited Hot Doug's on a cold, drizzly Friday morning shortly after it opened since I have heard a lot about the restaurant and I happened to be in the area. There was a line already forming along the building entrance and although intimidating, the wait was only about 15-20 minutes. I had the Anna Kendrick ("fire dog") with all of the "Chicago-style" trimmings and it was amazing. I also tried the celebrity sausage of the day which included a curry pork and veal sausage with spinach raita and haloumi cheese. This one was not really my cup of tea, but I did add a bit of yellow mustard to it to taylor it more to my tastebuds.  The food here is great and the customer service is excellent it well. Doug, the owner, took my order and he was very friendly. The place is also very efficient considering the overwhelming amount of customers this place sees. I think that the unique choices and variety truly makes this place stand out (where else can you find everything from elk to fois gras on a bun?!) Overall, I would definitely come here again and I am looking forward to trying more varieties including the duck fat fries!
