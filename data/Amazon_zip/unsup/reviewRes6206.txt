Went there for a dry run and they did a great job (they do have tons of experience). I prefer vegetarian dishes and Davanti has very good choices for me. I have to comment on the ceci beans. They were very tasty and presented in a unique style. The sweet red bell pepper and onion toppings really made this dish. The wine list was good. I love the wine cellar look to the place. What I respect about this place is the decor. The interior has been recycled. I feel this shows that the management is sensitive and educated in current events.
