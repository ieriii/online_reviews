I went to the Grand Lux with a friend for lunch and overall the experience was ok nothing to rave about. The food was great the service on the other hand was mediocre. I am a waitress myself and felt that the waitress was rather pesty when reminding us numerous times about their baked to order desserts. I realize that they take 30 minutes but frankly if I am sitting and enjoying my meal, a good conversation in good company, I could carelss if I have to wait an additional 30 minutes after I finish my meal for dessert if I chose to have it. I do not need to be reminded 5 times about how long they take, I heard loud and clear the first time. The only other thing that got to me was that at the end my friend picked up the tab and I was going to pick up the tip, the waitress assumed that the change from the tab was hers and did not return it. Unless someone says keep the change, an assumption like that should not be made. Given that it was Christmas I left an additional tip despite her assumption (for a total of about a 45% tip) because I know how hard servers work and didn't have the heart to be grinch.
