Oh man, I am dreaming of Uncommon Ground's hot meat loaf sandwich as I write this. They build this delight with a hearty slice of crusty bread, layered with creamy mashed potatoes, a generous hunk of bacon-wrapped meat loaf topped with caramelized onions. Paired with their incredible Bloody Mary, it's a downright soul-satisfying comfort food experience with a buzz. On a chilly Chicago weekend afternoon, there is no place better to spend an hour or two than in UC's beautiful brick-walled room in front of their comfy fireplace. I've been to their Wrigleyville location and twice to their Devon location. Just for the ambience, wonderful service and ample FREE parking, I give the nod to Devon. UC has a permanent place on my list of reliably satisfying restaurant destinations.
