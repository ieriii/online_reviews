oh hells yee-ah! this place is absolute deliciousness. We had a girls night out for my friend Janelle's birthday. Between the four of us we ordered the crab cakes, fried green tomatoes, pecan catfish, burger, pulled pork and jambalaya. the server was very matter of fact and made helpful suggestions (and he was a fox!). he declared the burger "possibly the best in chicago", and he may be right. i was on the fence about ordering the catfish--i've had catfish done way wrong in the past and wasn't sure if i was up for it. i'm glad i went for it--it was crusted with a pecan/butter topping, sat on a big bed of mashed potatoes with some greens on the side. a tad salty, but with the potatoes and greens it made for a great combination. for dessert we tried the red velvet cake and the bread pudding. both were good, but i could have gone for a few more bites of the mac and cheese and skipped dessert. all around fan-freakin'-tastic. i can't wait to try brunch...
