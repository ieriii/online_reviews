For the price, the mexican food is competent.  I usually get the carne asada burrito, and aside from the couple times they overcooked the meat, it was tasty. Their chips and salsa is really good also.  Now the main attraction: the margaritas. Simply put - the best margaritas I've ever had! Only 5 bucks a piece and 20 for a pitcher (which equates to more like 6 margaritas at least) is a great value and delicious! I don't know what kind of tequila they use but it's the bomb!
