Went with friends and got to sit in the side booth-boxes. Cool, modern setting, albeit a bit noisy. We had several plates including blood sausage, bone marrow and frites with egg. If you love pork this is the place to go. Great selection of beers (and had beer-istas that were very knowledgeable). I would go back for sure.
