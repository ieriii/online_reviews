Luckily, a friend took us there, because I would have never been able to find it otherwise. There are no signs or storefront - it's basically just a large brick wall with a wooden door (cool deco painting) and a yellow light above it. Once you walk in, you enter a small room and wait to be seated (calling it a room is generous...it's maybe 15 ft x 6 ft). In the room, you're facing a violet velvet curtain and can't actually see into the lounge. While slightly pretentious, the set-up added to the ambience. We waited about 15 minutes (in the cold), but it was worth the wait. Once you enter the lounge, it's just a really cool vibe where you can sit, sip, munch and chat with friends without screaming at each other. There's a no cell phone policy, which is a nice way to get away and focus on the people that you're with. The drinks were great - not too strong, not too weak. They have an extensive menu of cocktails and alcohol.  The food menu is small, but selective, and tapas/small plate style. My favorite plates were the fried green beans with orange soy sauce and the peanut butter banana bites. However, this place is all about the drinks, so don't come hungry.
