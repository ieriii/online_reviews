Overrated? Or is there something wrong with me? I feel as if everyone I know raves about the Hopleaf, so I may have been overcritical. I was also incredibly hungry by the time we sat, so I was not in the best of moods. I'm one of those people. That points to my issue with the long wait. I expected to wait, after having heard and read about the place, but the hostess definitely underestimated it. I usually expect when places are used to long waits, they can at least provide an accurate wait time. Getting over the wait (spent enjoying a beer or two on the wooden benches and tables upstairs), the food was very good. Less than superexcited about the mac and cheese, but brisket was tender and tasty. They definitely have a good beer selection, but I think it might be comparable to other places, dare I say that? I'll check it out again but have a snack beforehand. Oh! A friend tried to join for dinner who was underage - we thought that'd be okay in the dining room - but no siree. Just an issue that's probably not common but worth noting.
