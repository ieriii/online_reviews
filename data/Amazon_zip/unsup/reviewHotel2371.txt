We stayed here a few nights for a graduation in Chicago. It was a great location and quite nice being so close to all of the Chicago attractions. The room was clean and quiet, and the check-in process was quick. My only gripe is that it is an older hotel and you just get that old vibe from the place. But if that doesn't bother you, it's a great place to stay.
