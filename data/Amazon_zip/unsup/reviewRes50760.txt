I come here often for brunch, so I can't speak much to the lunch and dinner menu. I was really impressed with my first visit, but my opinion has declined steadily over time. Its not Wishbone's fault, whatever I've ordered has always been pretty good.  But I'll have to agree with Amy R's review in that this place is overrated. There are many ways to cook an egg, but only a few ways to make your egg better than anyone else's. Its hard to drag yourself halfway across the city for andouille hash week after week.  In Wishbone's defense, although making brunch-type foods isn't rocket science, finding a good brunch place is more challenging than you'd think. If you are looking for a decent Sunday brunch menu, I would definitely give this place a try.
