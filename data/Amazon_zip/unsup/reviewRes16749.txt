Try the Roja Vieja . . yum. The tender tasty beef on top of a huge plantain with various mayo & a slightly spicy cheese sauce. Worth the $8. . . since there's 4 pieces. Skip on the empanada. There's better for cheaper. I also ordered the Jibarito Sandwich. The ribeye tasted a bit over cooked and a bit salty for my taste. This place is definitely ambiance priced meals.  I'd recommend this for groups & a place somewhere different than the norm.
