So when my Chicago Food Friend took me here he told me we'd probably have to wait. Boy was he serious. We were in line for almost two hours! The specialty dog I got was oh so good. Who knew one could enjoy a hot dog so much? The entire staff was so friends and not in a rush at all. (in a good way) I think the best part of the visit was the over all experience. So glad I went. Oh, and I'm pretty sure Doug was there.
