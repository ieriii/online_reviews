We stopped by XOCO to grab a late lunch before our 9:30 dinner reservations at Topobampo. The logistics of the place are a bit confusing, but the hostess quickly explained that you wait in line to order and pay, and are given a number in line, then are seated at that particular table and your food is brought to you. Sounds easy enough. I ordered the Woodland Mushroom Torta, and the Churros with chocolate for dipping (desserts get brought out later) and my husband ordered the Choriqueso Torta and Homemade Mexican Vanilla soft serve with the caramel sauce. Water was free and easy to serve yourself, which I love. We were seated and our tortas came out in a reasonable amount of time. Mine was good but VERY messy to eat--slippery mushrooms and cheese everywhere. My husband enjoyed his as well and we were soon finished. Our plates were cleared and we sat, waiting on our desserts. We waited. And waited. My husband had to finally get up and ask somebody where they were. It appears they were forgotten, although no one said as much. They were brought out shortly after asking, but we must have been there for 20 minutes in between tortas and dessert. The churros were good, although the chocolate was a bit strong and I think I would just get them plain in the future; I didn't do much dipping. My husband LOVED the bacon-caramel topping on his ice cream! Overall, the food was good, service not so good, but I haven't written them off. We go to Chicago a few times a year and I would be willing to try again!
