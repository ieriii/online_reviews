The food here is flavorful and delicious, and once seated, the service was good too. Went on a weekday night (no reservations for parties under 5), and was told it'd be an hour's wait. Ended up waiting at the bar for about 20 mins--the specialty drinks are yummy--and so the wait turned out not to be too bad. Would recommend it on account of the food, which though more expensive than your average Mexican fare, is worth it.
