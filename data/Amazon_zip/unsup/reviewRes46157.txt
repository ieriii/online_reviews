Oh Grand Lux, I do love you so. It is always a nice environment, and I have never had anything but great service. Their menu has a good selection and I have never had anything I didn't like. Also, if you haven't had one of their bloody marys I highly recommend- and I am a picky one when it comes to bloody marys. Any of the desserts I have ever had have also been especially delicious.
