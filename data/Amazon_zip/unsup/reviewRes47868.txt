A fan. Recommend this spot. The overall ambiance is classy. The staff is incredibly friendly and warm. I went with a group of 4 - two vegetarians, two meat eaters. All were very pleased with the food. The vegetarians paid $25 for access to the "Harvest table" buffet - cheeses, spreads, salads, noodles, eggs, vegetables, soups, etc. A lot to choose from (I particularly enjoyed the cheeses, the tuna poke, the brocolli rabe and the apple mint salad). The non-veg people paid $44 and had access to the Harvest table as well as about 8 or so meat dishes that are brought out to the table once ready. About 5 of the 8 meat options were great. The Moroccan chicken was delicious. Our plates were cleared on time and the meats were brought out quickly. Our waiter checked in frequently. Overall, I would recommend this place for sure. I look forward to returning.
