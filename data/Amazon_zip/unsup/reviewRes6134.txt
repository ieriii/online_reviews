Scheduled and early dinner,630, knowing that they don't take reservations. Great idea considering that we were seated immediately. Almost didn't come here after a friend said it was "ok." It definitely is more than "ok."  Everything and I mean everything we had on the menu was great. We shared our plates so we were able to try tons. Favs: Truffle french toast and Rissoto. Although it seemed out of place, the burger was yummy. We didn't order pizza though, but it seemed most tables did. Wine is sold at shelf price with an extra $7 fee. Add it to the list of must go places!!
