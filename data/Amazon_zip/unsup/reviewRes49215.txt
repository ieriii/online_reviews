Some people assign genders to their cars. That said, I think Bin 36 is a boy. An intellectual, dorky boy with great cabernet in the cellar. Went to celebrate the birthday of a good friend. I liked the sleek, generous booth the party was seated in. Plenty of room for presents for the birthday boy. The service was spectacular, helpful without being obtrusive, and gracious without being overbearing. And the server complimented my shoes! Good man! Birthday boy ordered some kind of epic cheese plate and I ordered a red wine flight that included this 2006 Carmenere, Casa Silva Reserve I may still be dreaming about decades from now. Yes, go, order it. Now.
