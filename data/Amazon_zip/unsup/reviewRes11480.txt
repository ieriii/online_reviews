Holy banana oreo pancakes. This place is not messing around. It's not huge and on the weekend you're definitely going to wait for a table, but it's worth the wait. Their menu is decadent and motley, their service was suitable and friendly, and they were able to accommodate a single table of 8 which was impressive given the space. I actually didn't have the banana pancakes, but those who did enjoyed them wholly. I had the pumpkin walnut pancakes, which were also phenomenal. I really enjoyed this location and would come back again.
