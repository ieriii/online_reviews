The burritos are just plain awesome. You could probably feed a family of four on the Ultimate Burrito. As with any place that stays open as late as this place does, there are usually drunk annoying people at the 2am hour, but if you're there at 2am, you're probably drunk yourself. I always order the tacos or burritos (steak or pork) and they are always great. Maybe next time I'll try something else.
