Extensive beer list, ranging from the cheap to the not cheap. The food menu is refreshingly unique, with such items CB & J (Cashew butter and fig jam) sandwich (a favorite of my friends) to Organic Brisket ( a little red for my taste) but as a student, it's not a place I could frequent due to it being a little pricey. The atmosphere is crowded and buzzing with conversation, but not difficult to hear. Very popular ( we had to wait an hour on a Thursday), but once you're seated, the staff is friendly and the beer and food comes quickly. A great place if you are looking for the Belgian beer experience combined with an organic menu in a comfortably animated atmosphere.
