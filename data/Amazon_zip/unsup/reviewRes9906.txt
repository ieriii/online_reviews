Let me be specific: I am not a pizza and beer fan, but I have a partner that wants nothing more in life than to eat pizza and drink beer. It all started with a miscommunication: I wanted lots of sauce, very little cheese, and clams. He had it figured out - go plain, with clams, but things went awry and it wound up being a "white clam pizza." I was scared, and though he wound up eating all of the pizza except for one slice, I really liked mine. The beer list seemed to impress him, and I found a hefe I really liked. At first I ordered wine, but I'd strongly advise against that ($8 for watery Pinot Grigio?). All in all, I like this place and could go back, despite the fact that I'm not a pizza and beer person.  Oh, and the partner? I think he wants to move to Chicago just to be closer to Piece.
