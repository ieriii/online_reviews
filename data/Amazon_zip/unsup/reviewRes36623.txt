I'm not usually down with restaurants that combine different asian foods. Both cuisines tend to be subpar, BUT I live right around the corner so I thought I'd try this place out. Maybe it was because I wasn't expecting much, but the food was actually pretty good. I had the pad thai which was a pretty large portion. Its neither the best thai or the best sushi but for the proximity? It was great! I was a little disappointed by the price range. Perhaps with the ambiance and location, they were pushing for a more higher end thai joint, but for me it was slightly overpriced for thai food and well, sushi in Chicago is general expensive. All in all, not the best thai, but great for local fare.
