Pequod's deep dish pepperoni pizza pie with jalapeno's? Hell to the yes! I have tried deep dish at all the Lou Malginoseastgiordano's Uno and I am NOT a fan. This deep dish was really tasty and the caramelized crust is arguably the best part of the pizza. But the pepperoni is my first love; sliced thin and just a bit spicy, it wins my heart over.
