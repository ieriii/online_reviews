this place was good, but service was strange. maybe i've just never been to a place this nice or something but i showed up for my 930pm reservation and still had to wait and we were the only 2 people sitting in this huge waiting room really far apart and it was really quiet, so i didn't even feel comfortable talking. anyway, service and food was really great (but that dessert truck/tray thing at the end was SUPER disappointing. i tried one of each thing on there (probably 6 or 7 things) and i didn't even want to finish any single item. also the main fish dish was absolutely tasteless. i understand that you have to use the sauce but they really should have somehow marinated that fish or something
