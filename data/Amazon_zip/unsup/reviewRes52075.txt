Gino's East is a solid four stars. I had this pizza the night after I had Lou Malnati's, and the deep dish here was so much better. Ordered the deep dish sausage patty pizza with mushrooms, onions, and green peppers. Delicious - the sausage literally covers the entire surface area of the pie, which ensures that you get a bite of sausage with every bite of pizza. The cheese was also good - not too overwhelming. I also liked the fact that the tomato sauce was chunky, and more than enough to keep this pizza moist. My favorite part of this pie was probably the corn meal crust - it it not a doughy crust that others use, but dryer and more like corn bread... really unique. The wait can get tedious at times - don't come here with a huge group if you want to get in. 2-4 is probably the best option, but you are looking at 45 minutes to an hour just to get seated, and then another 45 minutes to get your pizza. They don't put your order in ahead of time like they do at Lou's, but this pizza is so much better and worth it.
