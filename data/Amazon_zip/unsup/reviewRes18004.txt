I know a number of people have reviewed this neighborhood gem, but it never hurts to keep the light shining on a really excellent establishment. You have to know they're good if they can survive for 11 years BYOB in a neighborhood that isn't exactly on the beaten path. But you come for the food, and it doesn't disappoint. Approaching the table with water, wine glasses, bread, fresh garlic and red pepper flakes, your server is ready with the cork screw and a great attitude. Others have commented on the homemade pasta- it does really make a huge difference in Italian dishes- and fear not for the portions are more than generous. Yes there are specials as well as a fairly extensive menu, all worth perusing. So in a word: go! You'll be dazzled. (Note: address on their card is 1827 W. Wilson, not 1825...)
