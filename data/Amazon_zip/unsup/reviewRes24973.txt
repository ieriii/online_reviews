This is one of my favorite lunch places in the area. My favorite is the Artopitas, which are puff pastries that are filled with all sorts of delicious things - they change from day to day, but my favorite is the mozzarella and chicken. With your artopita, you also get a salad and a bread basket so you don't leave hungry.  It has great atmosphere and when it is warm they have a patio that has big windows that open to the sidewalk - so it is great for people watching. The desserts and coffee also look great, but I haven't tried those..next time.
