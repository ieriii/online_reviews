This review is specifically for the patio and it's dog-friendly nature. I'm dog sitting, and I feel really awful every time I have to crate the little guy, so I was looking for a place that would let me have him on the patio, while I was having dinner with a friend. Fifty50 came up in my yelp search and while not all of the reviews are great, it said dogs allowed, so we tried it. The patio is really nice, the furniture is spaced out enough that you don't feel like you're on top of anyone else, and there's plenty of room for the doggies. We were seated immediately when we arrived and the busboy brought us our water, and water for the dog very quickly. The service was attentive without being naggy, while my friend took almost 40 minutes to decide what to have for dinner. The menu is kind of small and a lot of the food is like a little bit weird. Mixed greens salad but with pears, no simple burger (unless you "build your own"), fancy spreads on everything, and so on. I ordered the smoked chicken wrap and subbed a salad, it was very good, and very filling, but I'm not super interested in having it again. My friend got the onion rings with his burger and they were awesome, light and crispy with almost a baked feeling to the breading. No super heavy, wet oily mess here, and served with a ranch for dipping, yum! The beer special was 24oz drafts, of good beers, for $8. Overall, a generally pleasant experience, I would come back to the patio, if I ever need to have a dog along again.
