I've never stayed at this Hilton before. Usually I'm close to the river, but I was in town for a conference at the Hilton and the conference rate was good, so I got to check the place out. It's a big, old hotel. It's well maintained, but there are things about big, old hotels that aren't great. It's a long walk from your room to the elevators. If you want a hot shower, you'll have to let the water run for a while. If you want a great view, you probably won't have it. Check in was efficient, housekeeping usually gets it right, and the catering was decent enough that we didn't go out to dinner after eating the snacks at our conference reception. The rooms are ready for a refresh, but the public spaces were impressive. John McCain and his entourage were in the hotel for a while in the afternoon and evening. Security was there, and they did a good job of not inconveniencing people who were there for other reasons. Supposedly when this hotel was built, it was the biggest in the world. That's not hard to believe and the staff manages things well but if I could pick a hotel for next time, I'd pick a newer one that was maybe a mile further north.
