OK...where to start? I guess with the food.  I have to say that everything we ordered was really good...I probably would have even had said delicious if half of what I ate wasn't cold by the time I got to it. The menu consists of four sections: Appetizers, Salads & Sandwiches, Plates (similar to Tapas as the server explained) and Entrees. We started to order a few appetizers and we were informed that the kitchen likes a complete order from the table since they were small in size. So...OK we went back to our menus and figured out our entire order. We ordered a lot of the Plates which we were told were meant to be like tapas and a couple of the sandwiches with the intention of sharing them all (and our server was aware of this). A little bit later our food was brought out all at once...not only was our table now completely crowded with food by the time we were able to try everything... parts of our meals were cold! Issues with the temperature of the food and being a bit rushed aside the food was very good and I don't think you could go wrong with anything that you ordered. Now the service is a completely different story. The host was extremely rude throughout the night and while the server was better it still felt like there was an air of superiority surrounding us at all times. I am a resident of the local neighborhood and believe me I was super excited to see this type of place opening up in the area but I think Longman and Eagle needs to remember they are not Alinea...they are a bar that serves really good food in Logan Square. I have been to Alinea...and received better and much friendlier service there.
