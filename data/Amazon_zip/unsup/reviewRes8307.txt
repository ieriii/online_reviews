I should love it here because I love Ravenswood and I love cheese. Cheese + Ravenswood = bliss. Or so you'd think. But I just can't warm up to this place. The restaurant interior has a cold, unwelcoming feeling to it that I don't like. It seems drafty and everything is hard, which makes it really loud. I think the food is nice enough, but not as good as Pizza Art Cafe or Pizza DOC (and the ambiance of those two restaurants is much, much nicer).
