My wife and I booked a room through Priceline from 9/6-9/10. As you can see I'm reviewing on 9/8, because I've checked out early. It was so bad I opted to lose the last night I prepaid on and eat the loss because it was so bad. The one saving grace, and sole reason I'm going with 2 stars is because the hotel did refund my last day of stay. As I said we booked a room through Priceline name you own price. We requested a room with a view. Upon checking in they told us the room did have a view, but once we got their, it did not. We took in the basic interior room they gave us and asked about upgrading. They said we could upgrade for a $20 a day charge. So we did because they hotel room was SO DATED. If I hadn't entered in through the Chicago Sun Times building I would have thought I was in public housing. After upgrading to a King room with a view, which they also informed us that they couldn't do this for free because we booked through Priceline, we tried getting settled in. If you didn't catch that, they saved the worst rooms in the hotel for the Priceline guests. They penalized us for booking through a 3rd party. Be warned, the pictures posted online for this hotel show some very nice rooms. Those were not the rooms we saw. The hotel is so dated, it's like going back in time. My wife described the bed linnens as scratchy. If there was one word to accurately described this hotel it is DATED. So finally we had a room with an amazing view of downtown. However the room is still extremely dated. We stayed for the first two nights of our trip. But after waking up with our backs aching from the awful, awful bed we opted to move to another hotel. Both mornings we woke up feeling like we'd been in a wrestling match and our backs were so kinked we were literally in pain. We will never stay at this hotel again. It was easily the worst hotel I've ever stayed at in Chicago.
