Peking "quack quack quack"s are the yummmiest!!!!!!! oh my, it's so crispy, so tender, so deeelush. I can taste the chinese five spice so well, and it's sweet, it's salty, it's deeply marinated that you can taste the spices down to its bone. This is the first Asian restaurant that I'm actually so fully satisifed. And I truly mean it when I give this place a 5 star. I will take my parents here for every single meal. I even heard that if you bring your own bird for thanksgiving, they'll roast it for you!
