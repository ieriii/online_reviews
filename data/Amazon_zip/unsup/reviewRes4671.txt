Ahh purple pig, I was so excited to finally get a chance to try you out. You were so promising from all the hype and reviews I have heard. Sadly, it was really just all hype. Came here last night with the gf for her birthday and we had high hopes and expectations. You know, like it was your child and that he/she would become great when they grow up. However, my dreams were crushed when the Purple Pig turned out to be a tweaked out salt-addict. We basically ordered based on all the other wonderful yelp reviews. What we had: 1) Fried Pig Ears 2) Bone Marrow Spread 3) Blade Steak 4) Pork Shoulder with Mash 5) Turkey Leg Confit The fried pig ear and bone marrow was delicious since it was the first two dishes that came out and we were both starving. The new flavors was a welcoming taste to my taste-buds. However, by the last few bites of the first two dishes we started noticing a pattern, it was overly salty. The blade steak came with a side of nduja and greens. The flavor was there, but again - over-salted. The greens was the worst, why does veggie have to be so salty!?! Next came the pork shoulder, we both each had literally two bites before we gave up because of salt-OD. Last came the turkey leg, and same thing. We took two bites and packed the rest to go. Overall, I was disappointed and even more surprising is only one other Yelper commented on how salty everything is. The potential is definitely there, because I can taste a lot of flavor and assorted ingredients in every dish. Sadly, this is all drowned out by the over-seasoning of salt. Someone please let the Purple Pig know that salt is not going out of style, and there is no need to use it this generously.
