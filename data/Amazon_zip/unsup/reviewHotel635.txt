Reasonable rates. Friendly to families. Great location. Beds were very comfortable and the shower was HOT! Down the street from a grocery store, and several other cheap dining options.  Market House, the in hotel restaurant was very nice, a bit upscale but not prohibitive, and very welcoming to children. We would stay here again.
