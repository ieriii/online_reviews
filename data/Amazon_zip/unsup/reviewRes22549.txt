Growing up with a mother that couldn't- and didn't try to- cook, I came to life-on-my-own with a pitifully unsophisticated palate. At the age of 18, salad tasted to me the way cut grass smelled. I didn't eat tomatoes (too exotic), or sandwiches (you know, with all the food touching like that)......or a lot of other really great stuff. It was around that time that I first made my way to Greek Islands with my then-boss and now-friend (and soon-to-be-employer again) for a business lunch with a large group. Picture it: octopus, squid, flaming cheese, lamb, garlic, fish roe....I was in over my head. Totally petrified and grossed out and, well, angry. I was hungry, dammit, and there was no way I was going to eat any of that 'stuff'. Thankfully, I've pushed past those days and worked hard to develop my palate and eat a more well-rounded, adult diet. I went back to Greek Islands this past week and, well, what a difference a few years makes! Everything was delicious, and I scarfed down my entree of meat and rice stuffed grape leaves so fast I could barely move after wards, like one of those big snakes that swallows its prey and then needs all of its body's energy to digest it. The service is great, and everything is fresh and tasty. The prices are surprisingly reasonable, especially considering the portion sizes. I'm so happy that I've grown to love Greek food and that I know about this restaurant. I plan to come here again and again!
