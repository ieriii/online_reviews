I have only written 5 star reviews so far, I think, and nothing changes with Mayan Palace..It's like to restaurants in one..You have the quiet area, you see when you walk by, and then a huge beer garden area you can't see. Just love the food we have had and the drinks..Prices are fair, portions are great, and worth the $$$ to go out..We prefer that beergarden, even this time of year it's great..The owner is there a lot, and the staff is cool.Fresh quacomole is excellent as well..This isn't just another Mexican place. Truyly, a hidden gem to most folks in Linoln Park and Lakeview..Check it out
