Oh...my...god... I'm leaving Chicago in a few months, so I'm trying to enjoy as much of it as I can before the Big Move. I came here today for the first time with a group and am kicking myself for not finding this place sooner. The tempura sweet potato sushi is just to die for. The avocado was nice and fresh, too, which always makes me happy, because I've had some narsty avocado sushi, yo. But this is great and I'll definitely be back.
