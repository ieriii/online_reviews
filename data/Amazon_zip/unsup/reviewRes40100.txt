I tried it at least 3-4 more times after my last review. I had Samgyupsal (pork belly) with tofu and kimchi which was good. I also had more bbq there. I would say the general food is pretty good. Service has seemed to gotten better. I think they replaced certain waitresses so the service is okay now. Again the major perks are that they are open really late (4 in the morning?) and lots of panchan (sidedishes).
