For those of you who adore their Sunday brunch be aware it has greatly changed! Last time I went the suckling pig had been taken off the buffet which I was ok with since they still served it as a course on the tasting menu. The cheese and meat has also been greatly reduced. Before there was about three choices of meats and cheese each. Now only one meat and meat. There were other cheeses on display but when asked I they could be cut into we we were told no. As well the bottomless bloody Mary's, sangria and mimosa's are no longer but to il law??? Very sad turned our normal Sunday brunch bill from $45 to $80 per person ( more money for less offerings). Yet a lot of other places in Chicago still run bottomless specials. Sad to say use to be one of our go to brunch places but will probably look around to see what else Chicago has to offer. I do have to say our waitress was was awesome!! Great service and smile!
