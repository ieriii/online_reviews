Entirely organic..?!?! Who knew organic would be this yummy. I have had brunch and dinner there and both times were fantastic. The atmosphere of Nana is very cozy and casually chic. I highly recommend their Nana-dict if you're going to do brunch. Not entirely sure what they put in the sauce, but it was addicting!! The skillet was okay, nothing that will knock you off your feet. I will definitely return to try more of their brunch menu items.
