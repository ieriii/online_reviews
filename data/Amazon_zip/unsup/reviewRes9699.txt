I came here on a date and i was very pleased. The setting is wonderful: elegant and romantic. The service was wonderful and unpretentious and food was great (but no incredible). Entrees were in the $20-30 range and, though i don't think the food was worth the price (definitely made up for by the ambiance) , I walked away very satisfied and definitely looking forward to another visit next time an occasion arises.
