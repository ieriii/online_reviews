With a big name (rick bayless!) behind XOCO, I thought I would at least like whatever I got but everything was a bit disappointing. Perhaps socal has spoiled my palate for Mexican/Latin food, but nothing was particularly memorable. The carnitas in the Ahogada were juicy and flavorful but served *IN* a bath of spicy arbol chile sauce, I could only taste the salty, vinegar flavors of the sauce. Pepito was slightly better because the sauce was served on the side. The churro was subpar but with the chocolate shot, it was actually quite amazing. The chocolate shot was like rich, thick, dark hot chocolate that wasn't very sweet and had a hint of velvety nuttiness - like real dark chocolate. Ok, I lied. There was a memorable part.
