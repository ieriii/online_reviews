so i got dragged here by a friend who loves to go do all of the cheesy, annoying, and not my scene things. and I spend most of the evening making fun of all the the d-bags in plaid shorts and polos. So the place its self is fairly nice, could be really nice if they didn't have the tvs and sports paraphalia. I just think if you are a sports bar, embrace it, but don't ruin a good atmosphere with tvs. The food made me change my mind about this place. They have some of the best, most crispy, wonderfully sweet and salty sweet potato fries I've ever had. Which they served with BBQ sauce- something I had never thought about. And I LOVE sweet potato fries. Everyone with me loved their food, so I could go back and try to tune out the idiots there. You know, if everyone on here who complained about d-bags went a lot, maybe we could push them out? Just a thought....
