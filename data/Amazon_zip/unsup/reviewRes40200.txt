It was okay. I don't understand how it got a Michelin star, though. It wasn't THAT good.  This was one of the first places we ate when we moved to Chicago. I don't remember what we got, which is not a good sign. I remember getting gnudi and being sent anchovies (ah, the benefits of being with a guy who cooks for a living...). I know we ordered 6 or 7 things. I remember that the cocktails were way too strong. I'm a lightweight and I acknowledge that most people like stronger drinks. My drink was almost as though they poured some liquor and put everything else in by the drop. I didn't finish it. The food was almost there. I mean, it could have been pretty phenomenal... But there was always something a little off. It seemed as though the main portion of the dishes were always lacking a bit.  I remember now that I got a scallop dish. The scallops were cooked well, but a little fishy. Everything else on the plate was fantastic. It was as though the backgrounds were overtaking the stars. Oh, and our server spent a lot of time ignoring us. He walked by us about a million times and we kind of had to flag him to get refills or order anything else. I understand being busy, but at least acknowledge us, dude. AND THE DESSERT. (so some parts are coming back to me...) We must have gone on a bad night. There was some kind of strawberry shortcake, a creme brulee, and a chocolate dessert with bacon ice cream. Chocolate? YAY. Bacon? Double yay.  Except they were out. Lame. You can get creme brulee anywhere, so we went with the strawberry shortcake. It was about five strawberry slices on top of a biscuit with some whipped cream. In my opinion, too dry and lacking enough fruit. My husband has mentioned returning. He'll have to do that with friends, because I wasn't impressed enough to go back. There are too many other places to eat in Chicago.
