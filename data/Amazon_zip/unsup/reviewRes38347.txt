This was my last experience with chicago deep dish pizza. (previous 2 were Lou Malnati's & Gino's East). I went solo around dinner time 830/900 on a tuesday evening. The hostess said it would be a 45 min wait. Turned out to be only 25 min. Once you check in with the hostess she tells you to pre order the pizza and toppings you want so that when you finally get your table/seat your pizza will be ready. I waited 30 min until my pizza finally came to the table. I was a little angry at first when I received my pizza. I ordered a cheese, sausage & pepperoni small pizza. I looked at the pizza and didn't see any toppings at all! I took a bite and realized the toppings were inside the pizza! That surprised me. The cheese was also really good. I agree with the other reviews that the cheese had so much flavor. I couldn't finish the small pizza I ordered. The small had like 6 slices all together. I was only able to take down 1/2 of it. If I ever goto Chicago in the future, I will most likely eat at this pizzeria. Here's my deep dish chicago pizza rankings: 1.) Giordano's 2.) GIno's East 3.) Lou Malnati's
