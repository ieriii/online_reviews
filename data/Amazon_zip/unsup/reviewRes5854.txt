I've been here twice - once for brunch, once for dinner. Have loved both! Two favorite things? Truffle Egg Toast. Yelpers recommended it and did NOT fail me. Super yum. Also? Get the ricotta & honey comb toast (vasi). AMAZING.  What else? At brunch, the bartender let me talk him into making me a grapefruit version of a mimosa (he did it with half moscato, half prosecco) - it was delicious. I told him he should put it on the menu and name it after me... So if there's a "Holly" on their brunch drink menu ever, I shall feel victorious! For dinner, get wine - since they sell it there and sell it at retail, rather than mark-up. Many other yummy food items, too!
