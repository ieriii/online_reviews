'Enchanting' is the word I would use for our experience at this bistro. The other night, my boyfriend and I who live within walking distance of this little gem, sauntered in to an exuberant and very friendly welcome from the owner who immediately made us feel like family. After escorted to our seats, with a -few jokes, and pats-on-the-backs, our attentive waiter came over and again welcomed us. The menu was as expected with traditional fair from Eastern Europe. We started with the saganaki, which was perfectly done, and tasty. Then we ordered the goulash- my boyfriend, the braised short ribs, and I, the vegetarian. Each came to our table with a miraculous presentation and tasted equally fantastic. It was fresh, and flavorful, and devoured entirely.  At the end of our meal, the owner came over and poured an Eastern European liqueur down my throat directly from the bottle in an over the top demonstration of hospitality which was quite fun and memorable. After telling him of our satisfaction, he announced to the whole restaurant "Hey, they like my food!"  Yes, yes we did. And we will be back.
