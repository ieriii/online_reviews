I didn't stay long enough to get find out how everything was, but honestly how can you screw up a one night stay? Well I'm sure there are ways. But overall I had a good stay. The decor was that of a Kimpton - eccentric and themed. They wanted you to feel like a rock star so the decor reflected that. The bathrobes in the closet were leopard print and zebra print. There was Mr. Bubbles bubble bath for the bath. My favorite amenity was the Aveda products. I also had a end suite which had a separate sitting room area complete with an oversized round stool in the entry way. I ordered room service for breakfast and that was probably a mistake. The coffee was terrible, tasted pretty water down so I didn't finish it. It was also pretty spendy but room service usually is. Don't order fruit yogurt, they take plain yogurt and add strawberry jam to it - or at least that's what it looked like.
