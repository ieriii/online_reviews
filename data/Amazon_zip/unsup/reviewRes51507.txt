Fair enough.  I stand corrected.  I have given the Garcia's on Lawrence two different chances since my first visit to the Western/Lincoln location and I've concluded that I must have ordered the wrong thing for my first time.  In my first review, I wrote that I had the vegetarian fajitas. This was a BAD choice. Since then, I've had veggie tacos and a veggie burrito and both were very good! The burrito is a particularly great value too ($4.50 plus another $1.40 for cheese and avacado--it's huge and delicious). I fully intend on frequenting Garcia's from now on.
