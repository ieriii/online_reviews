I don't think I can add to the glowing reviews of this dining experience. I would say that I enjoyed 80% of the 24+ courses. The presentation of all the courses was outstanding. The service was excellent. The staff was very friendly and quite down to earth which made the long dining experience not seem as if it was drawn out. This is not an everyday restaurant and many people will struggle with the descriptions on the menu. My suggestions...save your money, get a reservation, don't look at the menu before you go, do the 12 course dinner before you consider doing the 24, do the wine pairings and have a great time.
