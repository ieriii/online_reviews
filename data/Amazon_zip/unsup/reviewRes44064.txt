Pretty place. I enjoyed myself thoroughly. This was a "third date" location, and I was super nervous. I was all "does my hair look good?" "do I have on too much cologne?" "is he going to judge me because I eat kosher?" All of that aside, I braved the evening when I started by ringing his buzzer. (no not that one, that was later). We met down stairs, and he had a great bottle of red wine from some trendy wine shop. We walked there from his place, and a table for 2 had about a 5 minute wait. Lucky for us. We are both tall, and thin, and gorgeous...sadly this place is small, and stout, and has close tables. Outside of hearing everyone's conversation (which is usually fine with me because I am so damn nosey) I tried hard to focus on us. He ordered, and didn't bat an eye when I said no to eel, squid, and crab. The bathrooms are small and clean, and they had a coat check, which was good because I wear a big coffee colored wool jacket with horn buttons. It's totally cute, and everyone wants to steel it. We had lots of good sushi, and they did cork our wine for us. They served us out of plastic cups, which surprised both of us...that aside, the music was good, the atmosphere was just right, and best of all the food was super delish. We started with edimame - and moved into our rolls - which I think we ordered too many of, but in a show of respect, we ate all of them.  Even though I worried he would think I was a pig.  He didn't.  And I got lucky after dinner. I totally suggest trying this place out.
