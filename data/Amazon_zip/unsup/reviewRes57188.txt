I went to Carnivale for a pre bridal shower. I really didn't like the food it was just a little too spicy for me. However, the drinks and the service was great. I love to try new and different things, so we had a couple specialty drinks and our waiter was coolest guy. He wasn't hovering around us but at the same time he was attentive and sociable without being annoying. If you like Latin or spicy food this is the place for you. I will go back but only for drinks.
