Before I get to the food, I would like to share a little bit about you can expect when you come here. Firstly - the wait. During the week when I've come here for lunch there hasnt been much of a wait. Weekday evenings have been mixed I've waited for max 12-20 minutes or didnt wait at all, very random. (the place isnt very large) Weekends- now almost every time I've come here on the weekends its been around lunch i'd say 12ish to 4ish, I've waited 0minutes to 25minutes. Now with that said, there have been times when it has been busy and i've gotten food very quickly and times when its been empty and things took a little longer, not sure why, but the service of the staff is generally consistent= friendly and helpful. Now the food, I will tell you I've tried a lot of different things meat and meatless, and going here, you definitely see how some people can live on a strict vegan diet. The sandwhiches are my favorite part of the menu, I would say the Reuben is my top choice, but you defintely should not be afraid to get adventurous (whether its a burger meatless wings) the food is great and most things are very tasty and the sauces and dips they are delicious (dont be afraid to ask for more)! PS. good place to take out-of-towners
