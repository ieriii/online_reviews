Well then - they should rename this place Piece of CrapI went there last night for the live band karokee. You pick a song from a playlist and the band plays it, you sing. Sounds fun.The band showed up late and after they got going it seemed like they were taking a long time to play my song. I went to check the list and to my disdain found that they had crossed out my song as well as few others that I knew they didn't play. Is not the the point that they play what people want and we sing? Its not like I picked some random songs - these were from their playlist. Very disappointing.In addition we got a seat in the back of the the bar and were singing along to other songs. This isn't a quite lounge to whisper amont your friends, but a loud bar to yell and make new friends. Despite that, I was told I was too loud and needed to be quite or get kicked out. Very weak.I would not recommend this place to anyone.
