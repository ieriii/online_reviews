My friend and I came here for the empanadas, but I will be coming back for the sandwiches. While the spinach and cheese, beef and potato, and zucchini empanadas were perfectly done, nice and crispy on the outside, the black bean fell kind of flat, with a pasty texture. But the sandwiches that we ordered as an afterthought made both of us pause after the first bite and look at each other in awe. Definitely worth the trip if only for the steak sandwiches. I will have to return to try the oatmeal shake I just couldn't fit in..
