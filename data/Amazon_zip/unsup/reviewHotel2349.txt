There are a few things I like about this hotel, and a few things I absolutely hate. The lobby is a nice open area. + The employees are helpful and nice, even house keeping was nice! + The hotel is easy to get lost in. - We requested king size beds, we got twins. - WiFi is not free, despite it being 2010. - (It's 14.95 for "fast 256k service for 24 hours") The rooms don't have microwaves or refrigerators, seriously? - The room is small, it compares to a $40 room. There's some obnoxious banging that happens outside the door every 10 minutes or so, and I can hear a buzzing noise coming from the room below. makes it pretty hard to sleep. The food that the hotel restaurant serves is strange/unappetizing. -
