So Thursday night was my third time at Revolution Brewing Company and I think it might be my last. I like the beer and the food is pretty solid. However the service was not good. When we came in the host said there was no waiting list and that we couldn't be seated until all four of us arrived. So my girlfriend and I took a seat right in front of the host station and each had some tasty beverages. 10 minutes later my our friends showed up and all of a sudden there was a 25 minute wait. I would have gotten over that if our waitress wasn't awful. When you are in a brewpub you want to try a few beers. It was a solid 20 minutes between visits from the waitress and the busboys. No water and no beer and the waitress was not friendly. Despite the beer being pretty good and the food being tasty I am sad to say that this experience has left a bad taste in my mouth. At least the company made it all worth while. My friends and girlfriend all get 5 stars for being awesome. 3 stars for Revolution Brewing Company. No stars for the dude in the affliction t-shirt.
