another one of my favorite restaurants evar. the beer selection is fannnnntastic with tons of great belgian beers on draft. my personal fave is kwak, a dark amber beer, but it's hard to go wrong (unless you venture into lambic section, then it gets a little funky). the food here is equally great and really compliments the beer...or vice versa. the mussels are as good as advertised. i personally like the curry flavored version when its available, but the traditional belgian style is always a good choice. i highly recommend the duck reuben and the cb&j. cashew butter and fig jam sandwiches are surprisingly good with beer and is a sweeter alternative to some of the more savory menu items.  be prepared to wait for a while on popular nights and try not to have too many beers while waiting. those belgian brews are sneaky strong and 3 or 4 usually mean the girlfriend is driving home.
