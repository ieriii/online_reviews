For a spot in the loop, it's surprisingly good. They have an above average drink selection and the food is above average as well. It's conveniently located on Mich Ave, and is a great starting point for a night out, especially if you are entertaining guests from out of town etc. Get the Mussels, a scotch, a bourbon, a beer and enjoy. They have a great private event space downstairs if you're into that.  Cheers!
