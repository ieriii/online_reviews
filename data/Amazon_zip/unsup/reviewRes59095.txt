I went with a group of friends to Yolk on a recent Sunday morning, only to be told the wait would be an hour. We weren't thrilled, but decided to wait anyway (happily enjoying the gorgeous weather outside). Surprisingly, Yolk was worth the wait. The food was deelish, the service was awesome, and the price was right. I'd **totally** go back again.
