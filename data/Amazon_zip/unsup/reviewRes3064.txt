Koricious!! I was trying to combine "Korean" and "Delicious," did you get it? (Crickets) I stopped in on a sweltering, humid, muggy day for a quick dinner. I was also meeting a friend for a movie afterwards, and didn't want to be all "fried chickened' up while sitting next to a pretty girl in a crowded movie theater. Instead of ordering the fried chicken, which is the go-to hear as I'm told, I decided to go with the chicken tenders, and some fries. I know what you're thinking, "he went the healthy route." You're right, chicken tenders and fries is skimping it a little, but it's the summer, we need to watch our figures. The tenders were well cooked and not dry. I got them tossed in the Crispy BBQ sauce, which was good, and tasted like soy and gochujang and sticky goodness.  The fries were skinny and forgettable. I ate a few and ended up tossing most of them away. Only crazy people throw away french fries (global currency), but again, I was trying to keep it classy, not gassy. I'd definitely come back here to try the Bowls and that sexy fried chicken everyone's talking about. **The small amount of seating here is communal, meaning you may make some new friends at dinner. If you're not down for that, call your order in ahead, and bring that Seoul Food Home!
