I used to live 3 blocks from here and I really wish that I took more advantage of that. Great hummus and falafel. The spinach pie is really good, too. The spinach is soaked in lemon juice, making it a lot healthier than the traditional deep fried filo pie with tons of feta cheese. I also liked the egg pie. It is a real version of one of those breakfast pizzas found in your local grocer's freezer (which may make you a good looking corpse from the preservatives, but not a good eat). Very good prices, too.
