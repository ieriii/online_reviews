I heart this place! Obviously the BYO is huge, but the sushi itself is delicious. I've been several times in groups ranging from 2 to 8. One of our group of 8 literally brought a case of beer bottles and the waitress kept them in the cooler, bringing out bottles whenever we needed it. They will open wine for you and provide glasses if you're waiting for a table which is great. Definitely make a reservation. Coast gets crazy crowded on the weekends.  The sushi is awesome! As others have recommended, the Volcano and White Dragon rolls are soooooo good. Make sure to ask for the fresh wasabi -- extra charge, but so much better than the paste. The exotic tempura is good for a starter, too. Service has always been friendly and attentive -- comfortable atmosphere -- my one complaint is that there's only one bathroom, but I've had some good conversations while waiting in line!
