Mojito, croquetas, ropa vieja, extra plantains, tres leches. In that order. All of which will be sumptuous and delivered by a super friendly server. How about another round of mojitos? This is a great place for all occasions - a date, dinner/drinks with friends and family, brunch... I've been here a few times and it has never disappointed. The ropa vieja mentioned earlier is a real hit - kicking with cumin, served with black beans, rice and sweet, gooey plantains on the side. Parking is fairly easy across the street or in the alley on Ravenswood, right along the train. They only take reservations for groups of 6+ and the place starts filling up fast (by 7), so get there a bit early, grab a table by the bar and enjoy some apps while you wait.
