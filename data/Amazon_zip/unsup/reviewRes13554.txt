Glen's Diner is great if you love Seafood. I live in the neighborhood and have been here several times so I figured I should let my fellow yelpers know my thoughts. I have eaten brunch here on Saturdays and Sundays and it is truly an average meal. Whether you are getting eggs or pancakes or an omelette it is pretty much the standard. HOWEVER, I think that the crab cake benedict is one of the best in the city. As far as dinner goes, I do find the prices to be a bit high, but the fish is very fresh and is probably comparable to any higher end seafood restaurant. The deal is the "First Catch" which is only $13.95 Tuesday-Saturday 11-6. Soup, Salad, vegetables, potatoes and 1/2lb of fresh fish...you can't go wrong.
