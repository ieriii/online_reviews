Solid. I had Pequod's for the first time several days ago after hours of basketball. My exhaustion and hunger must have added to the flavor of the pizza. There are not too many places where I enjoy their thin crust pizza. My buddies and I ordered the large thin crust with spinach and sausage. The sauce was thick, but tasty (where have i heard that before? kidding, kidding). My buddy didn't think it was tomato-y enough, but I thought it was pretty good. The only gripe I have about the pizza was that the spinach did not mix well in there. It made my mouth feel weird from the texture of the spinach, so I would recommend not getting the spinach in the thin crust. We also ordered some chicken wings. It was not that great. I can cook some better wings off my foreman grill to be honest. Which is why I had to knock down the rating here! Come for the pizza, but don't stay for the wings!
