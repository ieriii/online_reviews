Whilst on a shopping excursion looking for new glasses for my good dear friend, we decided to stop in at Piece to grab a pie to discuss some upcoming sketch comedy adventures.  They seated us promptly, it was not too packed because it was lunch time. We were really just out for a quick dining experience and talking over ideas and writing on napkins. Mission accomplished.  The overall experience was ok. Maybe I'm spoiled by my home town pizza eateries, or I think that the atmosphere seems a little too forced or generic? I'm not sure. The service was adequate, but not wonderful.  On to the pizza. It was good. Over priced. Yes. Each individual topping on a pizza here costs you $1.75 or $2.00. Say you want a pizza that costs $11 and you want four toppings. You are going to spend $20, easy. Okay. You are right Mr. Nay-sayer. I AM spoiled by cheap college pizza that is delicious, amazing, and cheap. I have been to Bacci's for a $5 slice that is the size of most mid sized sedans. Don't get me wrong. The pizza here is good. Really wonderful toppings, and it is thin crust. Truly thin. A rarity in this city. Although today, my pizza was a little bit soup-y.  Enough said. This place is over rated, and you are paying for the location more than anything else.
