Neat place. Originally heard good things about this place thru my hubby. He is the one that found it and wanted to go so we went this past Saturday for lunch. I usually give a place at least 3 stars if I frequent there or would frequent there again so that's why 3. It would be a quick fix for korean fusion food. It is not quite 100% korean food but close enough and I did say quick .. It is a unique place. It's communal seating except a bar type seating on the side so I like the atmosphere. We got the sassy, crispy bbq, and bi bim bop. It was enough for both of us amazingly since both of us eat a lot. The sassy chicken was great! I guess it's the closest to just regular fried chicken. The crisp bbq was a bit too spicy for me but the meat was tender. The bi bi bop was really good too. The cucumbers in there had a fruity taste which really added a uniqueness and sweetness to the dish. The closest food I can think of that I was reminded of when tasting the cucumbers was that korean Melona ice cream bar which I love! The cashier was nice as well. He was very talkative to like everybody. Service was quick too. Parking is like impossible to find in that area even on the side residential streets..it is a busy shopping/eating area so watch out for that.
