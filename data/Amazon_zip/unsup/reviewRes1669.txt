This place is spectacular. Don't be intimidated by the long line or the moronic one-star ratings complaining about the wait -- it's worth it! This place is best experienced by those who have adventurous palates. If you want a boring, traditional hot-dog-and-fries combo, go somewhere else. The many people in line will thank you for cutting down their wait for truly unique food. On my second visit, I had a bacon and cheddar elk sausage with bacon-garlic mayonnaise and black mountain garlic white wine cheese. The only reason I know that is because I took a picture of the menu selection with my iPhone. I tried to get the sausage fried. Doug stopped me and said, "No. You can get it fried if you really want, but that sausage is best if it's grilled." Doug knows more than me. The line out the door says so. I took Doug's advice. I made the mistake of ordering ONLY the elk sausage and some great, well-seasoned fries. It leads me to my second piece of advice: order something simple along with your gourmet plate! I say this because you'll want to scarf down food that should truly be enjoyed deliberately. I was starving when my girlfriend and I arrived. After ordering and taking a bite of the elk sausage, I'd wished I'd ordered a hot dog to go along with it. That way, you can scarf down the hot dog before or while enjoying the main event on the tray in front of you. I loved the elk sausage, but I had to exercise restraint from scarfing it down because I was so hungry! Visit Hot Doug's and behold its awesome culinary nature. BEHOLD IT. DO IT.
