My group of three was pleasantly surprised to be able to walk in on a Monday night and get a table. The deconstructed caesar salad with the brioche "Twinkie" was great. Arctic char had LOTS of components on the plate but for a icy January evening, it was just perfect. LOVED the truffle popcorn in lieu of bread. I could eat a vat of it. I think my highlight of the evening was the wine. We picked out the 2002 Grasberg blend from Alsace. What a lovely wine! Michael the Sommelier seemed particularly excited that we picked it out. He may be enthusiastic for everyone but it made me feel even better about my choice. The only reason why Graham Elliot lost a star is that service was a bit slow and spotty at the beginning, strange since the place was pretty empty. They finally got things together and we had a great meal.
