Absolutely nothing less that five stars here. We came on an early Friday morning. We are huge Rick Bayless fans and this was a must-see for us on our trip to Chicago. The food did not disappoint. I had the green mole and I finished every last bite. One of our party was from Mexico City and he complimented the authenticity of the food. It was a pleasure to be able to dine here and can't wait to go again on our next trip out to Chicago.
