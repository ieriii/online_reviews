Side note. I'm not a Korean, but have visited several pretty amazing food joints in Seoul. The food here is good enough (perhaps 3-3.5 stars), but one cannot discount the experience. Know that you will be cooking your own food and creating combinations of meat + side dishes wrapped in lettuce leaf to consume. If you are with a group and expect to have a Korean BBQ style experience - this is the place to be. Know also that you will smell like a Korean BBQ for the next day or so...
