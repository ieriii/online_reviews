This place is awesome! I'm not sure what the revolution is all about, but count me in. With bears like the Cross of Gold, Anti Hero IPA, and The Workingman Wild, you may start to wish we lost the cold war. A Micro brew with really good beer is no great surprise, but the food here is another story. Honestly, I was excepting pretty forgettable bar food. However, the food was delicious the Pulled Pork Burger was excellent, when I went back for brunch I tried the Pancetta Biscuit and Gravy , which was also pretty awesome. Service is pretty good, but keep in mind this place is pretty popular; we had trouble getting in on a random Thursday night, not the place if you're looking for a quite night out drinking. The bar is sort of communist themed also (if that offends anyone), but in a fun way. Overall, the quality of beers is tough to beat and this is among the best bar food I've had in the city so far.
