I went to this place for this first time, and although the food was good, there were a few things I didnt like. I got an omelette and the ingredients were very fresh. Definitely one of the better ones I have have. On the other hand, the wait was very long. It was a nice day, so we didn't mind waiting outside. Also, parking is a HUGE hassle. Although the validate parking, it was very hard to find a spot on the street. I don't know when I'll go back considering there are a ton of brunch places which are much closer and more convenient.
