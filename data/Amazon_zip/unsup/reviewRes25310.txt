I really have enjoyed Pequod's every time I've gone there. They cook their pizza in a deep cast iron pan, so it makes the outer crust a bit crispy. Since it's a cast iron pan, the pizza also absorbs many delicious flavors, making it to die for. The slices are large and thick, so I can only have one every time I go. The reason I'm only rating this with three stars is because of how it makes me feel. I have eaten here three times now, and each time I have had an awful stomach ache afterwards. I gave it three shots and had the same reaction each time. Sorry, Pequods, but I just can't frequent you if it's going to cause me pain.
