An absolutely stunning pizza place. Very interesting toppings compared to the other "haute" pizza places I've been to in Chicago (crust, pizza doc, coalfire, etc). In particular, highly recommend the bianconero- porcini mushroom and black truffle awesomeness. Wine selection is small but reasonably priced and very well chosen. Again, a rarity in Chicago.
