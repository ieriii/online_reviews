We went to Frontera for lunch on a wednesday afternoon. Beautiful day, we had no problem getting a seat, outside. I found it to be very casual and inviting. Inside was a bit loud but the FOOD! The best mexican flavor I have ever had. Huge fans, can't wait to go back. I had the fish taco's and my husband had shrimp quesadilla. The flavors are intense and smokey and sooooo good!
