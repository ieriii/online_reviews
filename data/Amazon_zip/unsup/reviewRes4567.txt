Came here for lunch and was pleasantly surprised to find no line and seated immediatley. The tables are so close to each other it took me a few minutes to figure out how I could get in the booth without my backside knocking anything over at the table that was 6 inches away from us. When the table next to us was seated, I noticed they had trouble sitting down without knocking over our drinks.  My friend and I shared the roasted beets with whipped goat cheese and the tomato smear. The beets were outstanding and the bread was average. Our waitress was not very interested in our table. Fun atmosphere and great people watching, not so sure I would come back for the food.
