Walk in and you probably won't see any Asians in here unless they work here. The ambiance is attractive with dim lights, cute tables, candles etc. It's too bad the food isn't as good as it looks. Indie has the potential ..just not there yet. Such a shame. Such a pretty little place... Portions are small. Pricing isn't cheap. Sushi is mediocre. If you do end up here.. bring a bottle booze or something. Maybe it'll help you get through the meal.
