If only eating vegetarian was always this fun! Highly recommended by Chicago Yelpers, Boyfriend and I found our way to Chicago Diner when I was trying to be a good Catholic and do the no meat thing. How about it was amazing? I had a ginger and Jameson (my current drink of choice and it was on the menu-me and CD=synergy) and a great black bean burger (sidenote: why doesn't avocado come on everything? WHY?). It has a fun 50s diner feel and the waitstaff was GREAT--not only were they good at their job, they were cool people in general. I had a great conversation about the crossword puzzle with one of the girls that works there. Here's a direct quote from that guy I'm seeing: "I love meat and I didn't even mind that I wasn't eating it [meat] because it was SO GOOD THAT I FORGOT" (my caps, not his. I know, hard to believe). The man had "chicken" quesadillas, in case you want that magic.
