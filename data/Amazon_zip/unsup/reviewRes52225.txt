"Ok, I'm going to be reviewing the "Big Three" Chicago deep dish style pizza places: Lou Malnati's, Uno's, and Gino's East. Gino's East, First Place. Of all the Chicago Deep Dish joints, this is my favorite version. It has a very unique crust that definately has some cornmeal in it, so that is the major differentiator compared to the "original" Uno's deep dish formulation. I like it a lot. I prefer the regular sausage than the "slab-o-sausage" (thin layer of sausage over the whole crust which is a Gino's specialty. The sauce is my favorite as well. Overall its really a pick em between this place and Uno's and Lou's. You should just go try em all at least once and choose. Depending on the crust you like, delivery vs. non delivery and the quality of the location you are going to, it can go any way. I do recommend eating any Chicago style pizza at the restaurant (not delivered). As they almost always lose some crispness when put in a box. They are best served out of those hot metal pans. Medium and small pizzas are almost always cooked a bit crisper and better through to the middle than the larger ones I find too.  I remember coming to this location when young, it closed but then reopened I think. What sticks out is they let you write on the walls. As a kid I loved this. I remember the super think clam chowder being very very good. This may have changed since then.
