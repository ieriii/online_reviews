Tank's pho is on par with Pho 777, but a little pricier. Their pho definitely has a nice soup base, but I think they're a bit stingy on the meat. With a $10 price tag for the X-large bowl, I was expecting more. Their spring roll with shrimp, however, was flawless. With all the fresh ingredients, it had a tender texture and savory fragrance. Moreover, the dipping sauce nicely kicked it up a notch. The service was fast. The wait time was totally acceptable (partially because of the increased prices). A solid 4-star restaurant!
