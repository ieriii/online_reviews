I'll spell this out for you in tiny English paragraphs. The beer is fairly priced. Centennial IPA. Four bucks. The burgers are quite good, and are getting better with every visit. You can get Old Bay seasoning on your fried goods. Do it. The fried cheese curds are insanely rich and delicious. The staff remembers me. The bathroom smells like pine sol. Chubs win.
