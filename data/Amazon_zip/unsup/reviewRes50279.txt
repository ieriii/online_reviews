I'm giving Big Jones a 4 and not a 5 star rating due to the service. The food was very good, just wished we could have been attended too sooner and more often. We started of our brunch with the Pecan Wood Smoked Andouille. The anduille was delicious, just wished they gave us more than 4 slices :) I ordered the Antebellum Rice Waffle with crispy duck confit, melted leeks, duck fat fried pecans, sunny duck egg, five pepper jelly! This dish was a definite hit for me, well balanced meal and I flavor enjoyed the flavor of the rice waffle. Overall, i will got to big jones again for the food and hope that the service will improve.
