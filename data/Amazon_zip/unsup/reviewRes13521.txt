Sadness. This used to be a neighborhood favorite, and the food still seems great, but what happened to the old, friendly staff? Didn't see any of the (formerly) regular waitstaff at a recent visit, and our server was schizophrenic. She seemed really angry about having to wait tables when she took our order and when she served it, but came back later with the check and was very chatty (meds kicked in?, or she remembered about the tip?). Weird. Hostess also had a very abrupt and hostile attitude, made us feel like we were undesirables or something. Food's good, but not worth the attitude.
