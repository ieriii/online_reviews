I've been to Wishbone a handful of times, I can't believe I've not reviewed it yet! Wishbone is average Southern food. The last time I went I was debating between the blackened chicken or the special red pepper chicken. I asked the waiter for his input. He suggested the special since it isn't a regular menu item. What he neglected to tell me was that the blackened chicken is boneless and skinless, but the special was bone-in, skin-on. The red pepper sauce with the special was creamy, not very flavorful or impressive. Chicken seemed kind of dry. I ordered the collard greens on the side, which were pretty good. I also got a Bells Two Hearted on Draft, which was of course, delicious. J got the pulled pork sandwich. He liked it, said it was a little spicy and juicy, enjoyable. (He got the Lexington sauce) While we were eating we were approached by a magician that they apparently have visit once or twice a week. He was pretty good, but it wasn't what I expected! The time before I went for lunch and got a sandwich that was ok- I got the collard greens that time as well, but they were inedible because they were so salty that time. One of my biggest, consistent complaints is that this place is SO family friendly that it can detract from a date or business meeting, etc.
