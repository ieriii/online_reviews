This used to be the only "nicer" lunch option near my former offices, so we ended up here at least once a month. I've only been for lunch, but I've never been disappointed. The service is great. It's the traditional steakhouse without the attitude. I usually sprung for the Steak Risotto, which is out of this world.  Also - make sure you sign up for their frequent diner card. Once you spend $250 at the restaurant, they send you a $25 gift certificate. It's great if you get to expense lunch - and then enjoy a nice lunch on the house every couple of times!
