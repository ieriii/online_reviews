My boyfriend and I went to Irazu at around 8pm on a Saturday night. They don't take reservations, and we ended up waiting about 45 minutes. The servers were very accommodating and opened up our wine for the wait. When we were seated, but busboy said that they were out of chips. It kind of confused us, didn't know if they were out for the night or out until they made more. Omar waited on us, and after taking our order, he informed us chips and salsa were on the way. About 15 minutes later and after our entrees were served, I noticed other tables getting chips and salsa, so I had to put in a request for that. Not a huge deal, they were super super busy. Omar suggested for me the chicken tico, and my boyfriend got the bistec casado. Bistec casado was delicious, mine was horrible. The chicken tasted like chicken in water with mushy overcooked veggies. It was super bland. Something must have gone wrong in the kitchen. Omar not only apologized for this, but brought out 2 more entrees - grilled steak and pollo casado, and gave us a gift certificate for 2 smoothies. The grilled steak and pollo casado were delicious! So so good, I could not put my fork down. We ate until we were in pain! So, the hassle of having a bad first plate is why this place got 4 stars and not 5. But Omar and the owner exhibited exceptional customer service skills. I will recommend this place to everyone and anyone, since their menu is so diverse. I can't wait to go back in the summer to enjoy the patio.
