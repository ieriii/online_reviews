So GOOD! I love Piece! Great pizza and plenty of topping choices. I wish they'd create some of their own combos at a set price because it starts to get pricey when you keep adding on toppings. Just wish they had sundried tomatoes and I'd have the perfect pizza combo! Awesome beer and they have their own brews! Expect a wait if you have a larger group or it's a busy time to go out or watch a sports game.
