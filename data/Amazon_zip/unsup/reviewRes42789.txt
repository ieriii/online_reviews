I've been here a number of times. The service is superb, the dining room is impressive, and the food done with pride.  1 thing I learned on my visit today: They open at 445 and don't serve their full menu until 5:45. No big deal though cuz the wine/appetizers they have to offer are original and tasty.  Regardless of the smaller menu, I recommend to go there early cuz it gets busy fast and loud. The interior design and service all makes up for it.  Let me get to the food: It's all good! Tender, juicy, and with love....
