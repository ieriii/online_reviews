This is the perfect place to go on a Saturday night if you're not really in the mood to go to a club and don't want to hang out at a bar where you can hear the crickets chirping. Take a big group, order some pizza and house brewed beer and enjoy the LIVE BAND KARAOKE! It's pretty sweet. If you like to sing, then the idea of being backed by your own band is pretty exhilarating, and if you can't sing (like myself), you will be happy to find that most of the people who do get up there ROCK. No sad, strange warbling here. You may get one or two bad eggs all night. For the most part, it's great, the pizza is delicious and the atmosphere is laid back but far from dull.
