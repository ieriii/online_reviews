My girlfriends took me here to kick off my bachelorette party weekend. For starters, it is an adorable restaurant. Small and you definitely need reservations, but its so charming. The menu is very impressive. Be warned: the portions are huge! You really get your money's worth. Everyone in my group was very pleased with their food. And to top it all off, it is BYOB with no corking fee.
