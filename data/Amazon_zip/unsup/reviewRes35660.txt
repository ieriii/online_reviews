This is truly a mixed review. I was so stoked to come here for lunch because of all the hype and because I love duck so much. Christopher was sweet enough to take me even though he does not eat duck. When I saw the extensive menu I thought it would be a piece of cake to find some good food for Chris. He opted for hot and sour soup and the sweet and sour pork. Both were dreadful. The soup was neither hot nor sour and so full of egg it was more like egg drop soup disguised as hot and sour. We tried to doctor it up with the abundant condiments on the table, but it really didn't help. The sweet and sour pork had a standard sauce, but the pork was extremely tough. I, on the other hand, opted for variations on duck. I had the combo over rice. It was good, and portions here are certainly ample. I also had the duck and shrimp dumpling noodle soup. I enjoyed that as well and we took home enough food to feed a small army. I am still going to try and doctor up the hot and sour soup, just cuz I am perverse like that. I want to come back and try the Peking Duck, but will have to find a dinner companion because Christoper will not be making a return appearance.
