I had my baby shower there last weekend, and it was so fun having it at a Brazilian steak house. It made the atmosphere fun and entertaining. Here are all positives from my shower 1. Brazzaz Staff was so accommodating they made it simple for everyone involved 2. The food was hot, and it allowed for my guests to mingle and enjoy themselves, even though they were at a baby shower 3. The wait staff was so good, I honestly was so impressed 4. The management had my car pulled up, and the wait staff carried all my gift into our SUV All I have to say is well done Brazzaz, it was a perfect day!
