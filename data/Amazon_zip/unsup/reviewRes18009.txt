For my 50th review, i thought i should review something from the past that i liked...and Caro Mio came to mind!!!! Defintely a nice little gem that i never would have found if it werent for some friends. the place is simple and indescrete, but has some really good food!!! first off, it's BYOB, so grab a couple bottles of wine. i dont believe we were charged a corking fee either. We went a while back, so i am not sure what i ordered as an appetizer, but the positive memory in my mind means it must have been decent. i know i had some pasta with sausage/meatballs for dinner and not only was it a BIG serving, it was very good.  the place was very low key early in the evening when we got there but by the time we left(7:30ish), it was packed. definitely will go back...
