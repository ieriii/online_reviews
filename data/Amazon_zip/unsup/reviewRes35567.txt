I have not been to shaws in at least 10 years and I honestly don't know why! I love fresh seafood and it's not easy to find great in the Midwest This is the best/freshest that I've had outside of the coasts! Everything was perfect: shrimp cocktail, bay scallops (to die for..), crab, tuna, key lime pie. Even the coffee was above average. Our server was excellent, all of his recommenations (food, wine, dessert) were on the mark. I can't wait to return!
