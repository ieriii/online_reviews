I visited her for Restaurant Week. As other reviewers have mentioned my sister-in law and I were also pushed to order for the reg menu - we acknowledged that we came with the intention to dine off the RW menu... we were told that the RW menu would not be enough food - so as suggested we ordered 2 additional items - Diver Scallops, and the Meatballs.  We had TOO much food!  I should note that we were told if we wanted to order in addition to the RW menu (which supposedly wasn't going to be enough food for 2) the kitchen needed the order placed all at once. I said that it was my experience in the past when ordering tapas - one can usually order as you eat... our waiter Dante looked at me like I was insane.  I do think the portions were small, we would have been fine not ordering other items, it bothers me that I felt we were pressured to do so. I feel the food was over priced and there are far better tapas places around. I was happy with the cocktails, the service and decor is nice - overall though.... just a bit salty with the experience. I live around the corner and do not think I'll be back. 2 glasses of wine 2 cocktails 2 ppl. dining on Restaurant Week Dinner Menu 2 add'l tapas - scallops and meatballs = $159.00 in my opinion not worth it.
