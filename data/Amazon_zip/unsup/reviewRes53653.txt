My boyfriend and several of our friends were lucky enough to get a reservation here last minute. We brought the chefs a 12 pack of specialty crafted brew, and they loved it!. I highly recommend bringing a small gift of some sort of achohol. It will go along way. I can't really say anything that hasn't been before about this place, but I loved it. I am a huge foodie and have eaten at practically every hot spot in Chicago and this place is truly different. When we went there the head chef ended up sitting at our table and had drinks with us and talked with us about all sorts of culinary delights for almost the whole dinner. The presentation and execution of the food was magnificent, however some plates weren't to my liking. I can be very picky with whats in my food, so it was probably just my own taste for what I like not the chefs preparation. However if you don't like a dish feel free to tell your chef. No joke! They actually like corrective criticism and will not take any offense at all. If you are looking for a quite romantic dinner this is not the place. If you are looking for one of the truly most unique dinning experiences then you have to try Schwa!P.S. Dont forget the Chef's gift of a spirit of your choice.
