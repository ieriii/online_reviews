We have our go to sushi spot, but have recently moved. This is now just down the street, we've always wanted to try it out, so we thought what the hell. Besides the fact that my lady and I both felt as if we were cheating on our other sushi joint, we had a great meal. Tuna flight was a great combo of all of our favorites. Toro, hamachi and super white tuna. Mmmmmm. Hamachi ceviche. Mmmmmm. We typically do not order the fancy shmancy rolls, but thought "what the hey?". The lobster roll was good, but the dipping sauce made my taste buds wet their pants. We weren't a fan of the shittake ravioli, but were a fan of the Yo Yo ramen we ordered to go. Unfort it didn't come with the traditional ramen noodles, rather thin fettucini-ish noodles. Still packed in some flavor though. We hate being unfaithful, but this restaurant just may be a good mistress candidate.
