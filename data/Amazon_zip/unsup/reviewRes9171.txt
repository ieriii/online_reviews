Bang for your buck...my favorite place in Chicago. If you are my wife, friend or client, you know I am trying to make it a special meal if we go here. Classy dining room with wonderful service...it smells so good and its not just the food. Sexy and Tastefully done bar and loung upstairs. Food is wonderful..If you love curry, they have curry. If you are a meat eater, there is a wonderful bo say tay. The chicken is perfectly done, whether its a lemmon grass or with mangos and curry..excellent. Fish is done very well here as well.  I love the 1st course offerings here as we well. wrapped shrimps with mint and cilantro ...devine. Their pho soup is as good as I have had in town. The deserts are excellent ,,,the banana tapioce pudding is so good.  Elegant and Excellent. Make a special night there soon
