The server was very friendly and helpful, and I somehow managed to order one of the least healthy things on the menu, despite it being a vegetarian restaurant... I think it was a monte cristo, and it was pretty good, despite how weird I think fake meat is. I would like to come here again sometime and actually benefit from the healthy options.
