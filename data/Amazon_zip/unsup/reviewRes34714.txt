This place is amazing! I went here with a friend a little over a year ago and have been hooked ever since. I have had lunch and dinner at the restaurant and have ordered countless times. I have never had a problem with the service, though I have typically gone during the week when it wasn't too busy.  My boyfriend and I have ordered from numerous other sushi joints based on suggestions from co-workers, friends, and yelp reviews, but nothing beats Sushi X. The variety of rolls Sushi X offers is amazing and you can't beat the size. Whether you go for the giant rolls or a regular sized roll you will not be disappointed. We typically order the spicy tuna and then various other rolls. Whenever we have ordered the same or similar rolls from other places they are smaller with fewer pieces.  You will not be disappointed if you order from here!
