The quality of the food is literally clouded by the awful ventilation system that cooks you as much as the food. The service is speedy, perfunctory, and makes you feel guilty for not bolting out the door as soon as you finish your last bite. Talk about a volume-based restaurant.  However - abundant banchan for reasonable prices go a long way (they have good "sohn mat" here, meaning good "hand-taste" - great flavor). It's the real deal, for real Korean-food veterans.
