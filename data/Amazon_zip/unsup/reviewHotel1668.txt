We stayed here: 1. Because they are pet friendly 2. Because they had the best rates downtown 3. Parking was only (ha) $36 for the night I was researching places to stay in Chicago for a good week before deciding on Hotel Allegro. It was nice they weren't charging the $50-100 pet fee other hotels in the area seem to think is normal. Also, they didn't have a size restriction. Our dog isn't huge, but she's about 50lbs and a lot of other hotels have a max of 25-30lbs. Dog racists if you ask me! There isn't any grass near the hotel that we could find (within 5 blocks at least) so if your dog needs grass to go, I would look elsewhere. Parking was a bitch. The parking garage isn't connected to the hotel, so you're stuck lugging your suitcases, purse, dog etc. down the busy sidewalks of Chicago. It's only half a block away but when you have a ton of crap, it seems like miles. The room was nice and CLEAN. And it was really quiet the whole time we were there. My only complaint about the room itself was the fact our thermostat was broken and we were freezing the whole night. It was stuck in the "on" position at 67 degrees, there was no way to turn off the fan or anything. We were able to walk to Michigan Ave quite easily from this location, and the Sears tower is close by.
