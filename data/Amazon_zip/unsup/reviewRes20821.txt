Recently returned to The Gage, for dinner this time. What a fabulous meal. Unfortunately, we were in a hurry and did not get a chance to linger of the courses and try several things we had our eye on. What we did get to try was delicious and the service was excellent, not only from our waiter from the the manager, the hostess, everyone. As a started we had the Scotch Egg, a tasty treat. We got he spicy sausage with tomato and fig. It was a bit game-y for my taste, but my husband enjoyed it. I really wanted to give the special soup of hte day a try, spicy carrot puree but felt we did not have time. The table next to us got it and it looked divine. For a main course my husband got fish and chips, he enjoyed them. The presentation is great in the authentic newspaper wrapper. I had the Kobe sirloin accompanied with a salad with coconut vinaigrette. Delicious.  The menu is very diverse, the beer list is great, the wines are great too. I look forward to returning when I can linger over the meal.
