Thanks to the staff at Uncommon Ground who stayed open for us last night! So after attending a memorial service and getting towed from a place that said "free parking" we all really needed a drink and were craving the amazing coffee creations and fireplace at Uncommon Ground. Unfortunately, by the time we recovered the car from the towing service and drove to Umcommon they were closing :( However, we explained our story to the manager (I think that's who he was) and he warmly invited us in to have one round of drinks while they were closing things up. The drinks were fabulous as always and they didn't even try to rush us even though we arrived after closing. Thanks again!
