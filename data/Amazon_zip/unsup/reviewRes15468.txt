5 people- 1 bottle of wine, 4 entrees (1 split), 2 caesar salads, total bill after tax before tip of $104. Not what one would consider cheap, but decent for the food.  Portions are large, servers are friendly, and the atmosphere is lively yet also slightly romantic. Some friends of mine swear by the gorgonzola gnocchi, which I admit, is quite tasty, but very rich- order at your own risk. I ordered the pollo cannelloni, a special, which was pretty damn amazing. Also had at the table- ziti con vodka and the chicken parm. Everyone was happy!   Mama always says don't fill up on bread, but some of the focaccia in the basket is the best bread I've ever had. So maybe you want to, and then just get your entree in a take home box :)
