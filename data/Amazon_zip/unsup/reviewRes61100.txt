This is a great place to really enjoy authentic Mexican found in a real comfortable and original environment. The food is fresh and original, and most importantly tastes great. The service is one to acknowledge, the waitress are friendly and the food gets to you fast and warm. Every time I go the food and the service keeps getting better and better. The restaurant is very easily accessible through either the Lawrence and Western bus or the Western Browline stop. The restaurant is family owned and from Mexican heritage, therefore the food is authentic originates from real Mexican recipes. This place has special meaning to me because we have celebrated many special occasions in this restaurant and until now they have all been great. Overall Garcia's is a great place to eat authentic Mexican food. With great accessibility, great, service and great food, Garcia's Mexican Restaurant is a great place to experience the real deal.
