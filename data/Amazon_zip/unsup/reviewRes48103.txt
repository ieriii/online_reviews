Stopped in for a light meal and beer before a party. One of the best salads I've ever had. The flavors of the different components in the market salad were perfectly paired. No soggy greens, just a perfectly dressed salad. The server really helped us navigate the oyster selection and cheese menu. You could tell she had tried and understood everything she was describing, which I greatly appreciate. Definitely want to go back for a proper meal!
