I ate here a little over a week ago with a friend because I had never been to Pilsen before to eat, even though I literally live like five blocks from it. We got there just in time, because a half hour later the place was packed and there were a ton of people waiting to be seated. I was amazed at the amount of food they brought to our table for free when we simply sat down. It was four or five types of salsa, some chips, some pickled peppers/carrots, and then a corn tortilla with a pile of meat underneath it. All of the salsa was a bit hot, but it was really good. My friend and I are vegetarians so we didn't bother with the meat they brought us. We each got an order of tostadas with avocado which was really cheap($6 each). My only complaint with them was that I couldn't taste any beans, which they were supposed to come with, and the avocado layer was a bit lacking. One other drawback is that they only take cash. I figured that for such a popular place they would take a debit card, but nope. They have an ATM in the restaurant, but instead my friend went a block away to a Bank of America ATM to avoid the fees, so just make sure you have cash on hand.
