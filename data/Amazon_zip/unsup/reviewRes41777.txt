Are you pretentious? Do you enjoy being ignored? Are your jeans the size of a boson particle?  IF SO, go to Gilt Bar!  It's always fantastic to be BLATANTLY ignored while some brats (not the sausages), that were way more clueless than I, get service with a smile. Really bartender? I understand I was a little sweaty and didn't put on my American Apparel's best to go to your bar, but that's the bitchiest service I've ever had.  There are plenty of other bars that I can get a craft brew at and actually like the bartender that's serving me. P.S.  Don't worry, Gilt Bar is not 'that kind of bar.'  Don't ask for a shot. You'll be treated like a leper! /rant Only redeeming quality was the nice hostess with short blond hair. She was funny and talked to me like a *gasp* professional
