I have generally found that no food is ever worth the wait, like especially when your stomach is growling, I don't care how much hype you get. Revolution gets 4 stars because I'm a big fan of their fish and chips. They are pretty darn delicious and probably the best fish and chips I've had outside of Southampton, England. Meanwhile, the other foodstuffs looks delicious too, but a bit overpriced. I had the hombre burger yesterday, it was way too greasy. The fries were nasty (not fresh), fried but left and soaked in oil. They have Goose Island root beer here if you don't drink beer, and plenty of cocktails. Most other times, this place gets slammed. Even though the food and beer is decent, I can't say it's worth waiting more than a half hour. Luckily I've never had to wait more than half hour here, and yesterday we got a booth for 5 people right away on a sweet lazy Sunday evening. I go to the dance studio right up the street, so we stop by sometimes to check out the lines. If it's long, we skip it and head elsewhere.
