Ahhh friday off and lunch on the patio with a great friend. Sunny day sitting under the umbrella and drinking chilled pellegrino. Soothing my hungover belly with a ham and caraway sandwich on a pretzel bun. Can't think of finer things in life. It was a good day. I don't get over to Milk and Honey that often but wish i did. Food is always excellent- prices are superb for what you get, i don't know why one would complain about price. Good times.
