Let me first say that I love this place so much that the first thing I am doing after returning from dinner is writing a Yelp review. Everything about Nana's is so memorable and enjoyable that I can't wait to go back. After reading such great reviews and also loving the fact that the place serves organic ingredients I knew it was a must. However, dragging my hubby somewhere sometimes requires some strategic key words. IE: 4 star yelp reviews, healthy, innexpensive - you get the idea. Well Nana's can be described with all the key words that were needed to convince my husband. The menu had everything from quail, duck, chicken, fish and pork. There definitely is something for everyone, but wasn't too overwhelming. The fact that my husband could easily find something means that even the picky eaters can find something great. I ordered the Chicken Pot Pie from the seasonal entree list and my husband ordered the Chimichurri Skirt steak. My in-laws who were also with us ordered the pork shoulder and the cobb salad. Everything, literally, was absolutely delicious and the best part is that the portions were perfect. My hesitation with getting pot pie anywhere is the creamy sauce that goes straight to my thighs. However, Nana's pot pie was perfect! With a maple gravy and crust that wasn't overpowering, this pot pie was absolute perfection - and felt guilt-free. It was accompanied by an amazing apple salad that I could have had as my meal on it's own. Both were so delectable, but the piece de resistance was dessert. Oh my sweet tooth. I'm more of a salty tooth, but the cookie bar tray and the chocolate caramel dessert could easily convert me. It truly was icing on the cake!
