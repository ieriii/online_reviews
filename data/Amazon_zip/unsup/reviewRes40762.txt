Spring rolls were Kind of weak, and I totally was lost in the mix. But who cares! You don't come here for the spring rolls, I was told that you come here for the Beef Soup. Of course, I had to try the curry chicken soup. Oh yes, it was "nice" but I should stick to what the locals are eating. The place gets super crowded and sometimes you may have to wait (so the waiter told us), but the place definitely has style and you may have to sit with others in the big round tables, but this adds to the charm I am sure. BYOB as stated before, and although I didn't bring wine, what wine really goes with soup? I digress here, just had to throw in my 2 cents worth. Kind of disappointed with my choice, but I would definitely go back because I think I need to try it again and come on an empty stomach.
