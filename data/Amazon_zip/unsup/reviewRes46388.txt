LOVE LOVE LOVE the desserts here!!! I would give the desserts 5 stars. I have tried a lot of the desserts off the menu and none have let me down yet. Well actually.. maybe one which is the chocolate creme brulee. Its a bit too bitter for me. I always ask for the creme brulee duo to be both vanilla (usually comes with one vanilla and one chocolate). The rustic apple pie is to die for and is always so fresh! the molten chocolate cake is heavenly as well! I am giving Grand Lux 3 stars because I am not a big fan of their regular food. I have gotten the lasagna and it was an enormous amount of food but it was just mediocre. Full of cheese and mushroom. I wish it was more saucey and had more ground beef in there. I have tried their mini corndogs/ hot dogs and the outter corn layer was so buttery and oily. I could feel the oil dripping in my mouth. It was not very appetizing. A hot dog (ANYWHERE) else would have been better! Oh and they are overpriced for such mediocre taste.
