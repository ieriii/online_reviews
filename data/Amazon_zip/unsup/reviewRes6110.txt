Good food. Atmosphere leaves a little to be desired. It's very casual. The music selection is pretty abhorrent too... expect the Beach Boys. So, it's weird to be able to get some really tasty food. I don't like the pretentious dining generally. But, this is a bit too kitchy. But if you want decent food and don't care about reading the wine by the glass list off of a comically large wine bottle that the waiters and waitresses pass around, then go for it.
