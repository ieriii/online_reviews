I went with some friends from work 2 weeks ago on a Friday at about 5:30 and it was already standing room only in the bar area.  One of us went up to the bar to order drinks and while he was waiting the others snagged 2 small hightop tables by the elevator after a group left. The waitress made a show of pulling them apart and gave us a dirty look when we pushed them back together. Even worse, when she asked us if we wanted anything and we said we had already sent someone up to the bar, she rolled her eyes and huffed away!  After that she was actually very attentive, so I guess she was just having a bad night. However, when we had already gotten the check but were still finishing our last drink, a bus boy came over and refilled our waters, and both the waitress and manager made a beeline for him to scold him for doing so, within earshot! The manager then came over and asked us if we needed anything else, followed by an overly emphatic, "of course take your time, we're not trying to rush you or anything."  If you want to feel like cattle being herded out of there and gouged on $5 miller lites, then by all means, check this place out!  Seriously though, I hope the attitude we got was just part of it being relatively new and working through service issues. The atmosphere was pretty cool and the reviews on the food seem great though, so maybe I'll check it out again. Also, they have a separate bar area downstairs that looks like it would be nice for a private party.
