Before I moved to Chicago, I had visited the city as a tourist and not knowing any better had waited in line for over 90 mins for pizza at UNO just off the mag mile. The pizza was good, but it isn't hard to find good pizza in Chicago. It isn't even difficult to find great pizza in Chicago. However, if you're looking for that slice made from flour,yeast, and god's breath, go to Pequod's. It all starts with the divine crust, the true foundation of any pizza. Theirs is deep dish, black around the edges, not burnt; caramelized. Yum, drool. They top it with super fresh veggies and meats. I'm fairly certain they make their own sausage, which is often the case with the best pizza houses. If you're finicky, you probably won't like this place. If you love exploring the best food, (not necessarily the most expensive or the most popular in your tour book) go here. If all this doesn't convince you, let me add that they usually have a good selection of local and/or craft beers on tap. Good beer and amazing pizza wins this girl's heart every time.
