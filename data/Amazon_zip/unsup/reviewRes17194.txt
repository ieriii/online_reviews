This has the be one of my favorite dining experiences in Chicago. I was looking for something fun and trendy for one night since I definitely wanted to try one of the famous Chicago steakhouses another night. This place was great from the start, the lounge had a DJ in it and had a very good vibe. People were sitting around the bar drinking and hanging out. The dining room looked like Latin America had exploded in there. The colors were really bright and complimentary to the ambiance of the restaurant. (just thought it was too bright, i tend to like restaurant that are dark). The food was pretty awesome, the croquettas were delicious and so was the Arrachera was perfect, the meat was cooked to perfection and the side of rice and beans was flavored to a great taste. I found this place to be a great bargain I believe dinner and drinks for 2 was about $60 for a great dining experience.
