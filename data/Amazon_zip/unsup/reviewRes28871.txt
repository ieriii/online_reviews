What is there to say about this place that has not been said already? I was in Chi-town for business and we ate at this restaurant. One sip of the margarita and I started formulating plans to make a return visit. Given the incredible taste of the margarita, I was a little underwhelmed with my quesadillas. But when in Chicago again I will most definately come back to this place. Maybe I'll luck out with an entree worthy of the margarita.
