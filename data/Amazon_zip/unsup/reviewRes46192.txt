Grand Lux is very nice place for the massive size. The place is two (or three?) floors and the dining areas are very large and there's a large escalator to get to the next floor. There are plenty of tables so they are usually able to accomodate you if you don't have reservations. The whole decor of the restaurant is fairly classy-looking. I came here without reservations for me and my two friends, on a packed night, and we were seated within 20 minutes, with a perfect spot next to these large windows for a a nice little view outside. The service was fair, nothing over the top but nothing bad either. We got the duck pot stickers for an appetizer that were surpringly very good; I wish I could find them elsewhere to try. We ordered a few drinks that I believe were a little over priced but it wasn't a big deal. I can't remember what my friends ordered but I had a simple chicken parmasean that turned out pretty good. It came with pasta and overall it was good and a large portion size that I didn't even manage to finish (very unusual!). Overall a nice place to go; drinks might be slightly overpriced, but good nonetheless.
