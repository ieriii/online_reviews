I love me some Cuban! The last time I had it was at David's Cafe in Miami, FL, so I've been craving some authentic Cuban. After my friend got pierced at Vintage Tattoo, I suggested we go here, since their other location was closed. Other Cuban restaurants were up for a visit, but the reviews on here were stellar, so off we went. The place was packed, so there was a bit of a wait. Seating is in a heated tent (Well for the wintertime anyway). It was a while until a server came around, but when he did he apologized and offered to buy us desert. We ordered and looked around...as its name implies, it's got a lot of Cuban-American influences, notably all the "notes" and "letters" painted on the walls. We were seated near a pretty cool painting of a family walking in a street in Cuba. At the beginning of dinner, I ordered a cafe con leche (Duh) but it never appeared until I reminded our server. It's worth noting that he comped it and upgraded me to a large...very sweet of him! I ordered croquetas for an appetizer and my friend got the calimar. I loved both of them; it was my first time having croquetas and at the recommendation of my Hispanic literature profesora, I decided to try it. The calimar was basically calamari but without the breading and more sauce...kind of like a thick soup with squid in it. Very tasty. For dinner, I ordered the pollo (That means chicken ;)) dinner and my friend got the veggie dinner, adding some camarones (Shrimp) on to it. I wish I loved my dinner more than I actually did. Maybe I should have ordered a Cuban or a Media Noche, but oh well. I will say that the maduros (Fried sweet bananas) were delicious and my favorite of the Cuban staples. The dinner also came with sides of black beans and rice. For desert, we ordered coconut flan...oh it was heaven. Paired with my cafe con leche and I was on cloud nine :)
