I'm probably not going to say anything that already hasn't been said. We headed there for a early/mid afternoon lunch and the line was pretty long. We went to another bar for a few and came back. The line was non-existent so we ordered We split a torta, that I will admit I forgot the name to- my sincerest apologies. It had pork, pickled cabbage and other spices. It came with the habenero salsa and as the server who brought it to us called it "liquid fire". He wasn't kidding. My friend made the mistake of pouring quite a bit on his half. I took a few drops. Those couple of drops were almost too overpowering. For a few bites I completely lost the taste of the sandwich I was supposed to be enjoying. My friend...well let's just say we needed a few more beers for his mouth to stop burning. I love the concept and I know the ingredients call for a higher cost but if it is supposed to be Mexican street food- I think he can bring the cost down a touch. I would love to work my way through the menu. This place really works as a grab and go, so unless you like feeling like a sardine when you eat either go at an off time or take it back to the office.
