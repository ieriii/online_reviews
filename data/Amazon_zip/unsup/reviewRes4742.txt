I'm kicking myself for waiting this long to try The Purple Pig. My friend and I had a fantastic dinner, and I'm already planning when I can return to explore more of their menu. My favorites of the night: Chicken Thigh Kabab with Fried Crispy Potatoes and Yogurt Tzatziki (definitely not a boring chicken dish). Roasted Marrow Bones (better than Longman & Eagle's). Sicilan Iris (fried brioche filled with ricotta and chocolate). I would order those dishes again. Really exceptional. The skewered scallops with chickpea aioli were great as was the nutella banana marshmallow panino, but I would try other dishes next time. Many rave about the milk braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes and gravy. In my opinion, tasty but overrated. There are more intriguing menu items to be had. The room is lively and energetic. The tables (individual and communal) are close together. The noise level is more loud than quiet. Reservations are not accepted. (My friend and I waited 90 minutes when we arrived on a Tuesday at 7pm). Casual dress code. The service was friendly, knowledgeable, and efficient despite the restaurant being full. The servers and bussers worked at a brisk pace, but we never felt rushed during our meal. Prices are very reasonable given the portion size, quality of the food, and location of this restaurant. $125 pre-tip for two half bottles of wine and six dishes. The kitchen is doing a superb job. Highly recommend. The Purple Pig reminds me somewhat of Avec.
