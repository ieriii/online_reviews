Based upon a glowing report from a friend who had dinner at Sprout, we made a reservation for brunch. We arrived to discover that the restaurant has no espresso maker and therefore we could order coffee, but no cappuccinos, lattes, etc. We ordered the coffee, which, remaining optimistic, we thought would be excellent. Instead, much to our dismay, the coffee was bitter. Almost immediately, we realized that our server wasn't going to go out of his way to be friendly with us. He briefly explained the restaurant's 'philosophy' and left us to our own devices. The word to describe his attitude toward us would be: indifferent. We ordered the Lithuanian bacon buns to start. What arrived was three rather tasteless white buns stuffed with a few bits of bacon and some bacon grease. They were not so fresh or tasty. Two of us ordered the "Egg: Lyonnaise," which is essentially a frissee salad on a bed of greasy fries with a poached egg on top. The menu claims that this dish includes "Canadian bacon" but the Canadians at the table were left longing for the crispy, cornmeal encrusted variety. (The dish included some cold, greasy, tasteless imposter.) One would expect this type of salad to arrive warm - it did not. As for the butternut squash French Toast - also cold! The portion was small and the squash puree tasteless. Even the specially ordered side of eggs over easy was cold. If what you want is breakfast cocktails - this does seem to be the place. (If you drink enough, you might not notice that the room is freezing.) We went to Sprout because we heard that they are trying to do something innovative. Perhaps we just ordered the wrong thing? Overall, disappointing.
