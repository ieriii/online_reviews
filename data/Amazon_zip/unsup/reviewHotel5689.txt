Good location and easy check in. I had a good experience with this property. The view of the river was to die for! My room was on the fifth floor. The room was small but adequate for one or two people. Modern amenities, bedding, desk and chair. The little bar area included a coffee pot, refrigerator and a microwave. They have a filtered water station with free empty bottles in the hall near the elevator. The elevator is programmed to go to your floor with your plastic room key - safety in mind. They have a dedicated computer in the business office for printing boarding passes. Small lounge area on ground floor. This hotel is 5 blocks from the Clark cta station on the Blue line coming from the O'Hare airport (cta fare was $2.25 one way at this writing). I spent most of my time out and about town and the room was fine. My only quirk was that the shower water wasn't exactly hot nor was it cold. When I checked out, I mentioned it to staff. Excellent value for the price.
