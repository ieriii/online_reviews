Delicious! Great BYOB spot in Bucktown. This spot is great for both carrying out and dining in. I just enjoyed the Onioned Steak which was a thin ribeye covered in sauteed onions and topped with a roasted jalapeno. Definitely go for the Costa Rican rice and beans (take the spicy option). The fried plantains come topped with minced garlic which was a big plus.
