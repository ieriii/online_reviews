During my first visit here a couple years ago I ordered this amazing smoked trout salad sandwich with apples on pumpernickel. I haven't seen that sandwich since. I crave that sandwich. But I have been in here several times since then (hoping for the sandwich) and, of all the things I've ordered, have NEVER had anything bad from Milk & Honey. The menu appears to have a few staple-sandwiches, some seasonal offerings, and then the sides/salad, baked goods and specials seems to change pretty frequently, if not daily. Because of this, every time I go in there it's like the first time all over again and it takes me FOREVER to figure out what to order. Little joints like this do well to have a relatively small selection of offerings that are done REALLY well. Milk & Honey seems to be all about this M.O. I haven't had breakfast/brunch here, but the menu is short & sweet, covers the basics, and - from what I hear - does these very well, too. Slightly pricey as far as "cafes" go but the quality, freshness and creativity with the food is worth EVERY extra penny. This place ALMOST makes me wish I lived in WP. Almost.
