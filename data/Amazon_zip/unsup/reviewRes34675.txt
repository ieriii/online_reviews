How does this place get 4 stars!? I didn't try the sashimi because I was skeptical, but I'll give it to you that the rolls were decent and yes a plus that they are BYOB. HOWEVER, above all... where is the sushi bar??? where is the fish coming from? It seems a bit mysterious that it is coming from a kitchen. Also can my server please tie up her hair? Her hair was so long all the way down to her waist. Sushi hair free please!
