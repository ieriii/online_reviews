I LOVED this restaurant! The menu was very unique and exciting. Deciding what to order was a little bit of an ordeal. However, we ordered the mixed appetizer plate to start and I'm pretty sure my brain and my taste buds shared a moment. If I could date the brussel sprouts I would. In a word: wow. Our server was awesome - very helpful and knowledgeble. And patient (let me referenc the heavily optioned menu once again). The space is cute and cozy and the perfect place to catch up with friends OR enjoy a date. This is going on my list of top 10 favorite restaurants. As soon as I decide to make a list.
