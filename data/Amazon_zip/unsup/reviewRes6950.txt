My cousin brought my mom, grandmother & me to Sapori Trattoria while we were in town for a visit. She chose it because she remembered my being a picky eater, &, as she said, "Everyone loves pasta!" My grandma was unhappy initially because she felt it was too loud inside the restaurant; my mother felt it was too hot. Eventually they both came to enjoy it. Our serer was friendly, knowledge & helpful, giving us his opinions when asked & reserving judgment when we went against his suggestions. We split the avocado crostini as an appetizer, which I lived - guac, onions & cheese on toast, basically. My mom felt it was too messy, but I was happy to eat her portion! Despite the fact that I live in New Hampshire & it seemed truly bizarre to order seafood in the Midwest when I get it regularly on the seacoast, I went with the lobster ravioli - and I wasn't disappointed! I wish it'd had a bit more flavor, but I really did enjoy it. Everyone else's meal was WAY too big, but mine was perfectly sized - about seven large ravioli, in a rich, thick sauce. I want that ravioli again, actually....
