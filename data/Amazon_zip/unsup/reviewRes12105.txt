I have lived near Cafe 28 since I moved to Chicago and continuously said, "I really want to go there sometime!" Finally... It was everything everyone told me and more. The fried plantains? To die for. The Ropa Vieja was like butter and melted in my mouth. Speaking of butter, it was just as divine. Who knew butter could be divine? I digress... The black beans had a great kick and complimented the flank steak perfectly. The steak was so tender (almost pulled pork-ish but better) and was great with a bite of the plantains. Before I knew it, 2 hours had gone by and my plate was empty. I can't wait to go back and try the other entrees I had problems choosing from. Great atmosphere and great service (a little pushy at times but I would take that over no service). Oh and the mojitos everyone raves over? Yup. To die for.
