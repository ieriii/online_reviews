i went to Mayan Palace for dinner last Saturday with a group of 10. We didn't have reservations but were seated in 5 minutes. The staff was super accomodating. The margaritas were just ok but the food was delicious. The mole sauce for the enchiladas tasted like actual mole sauce instead of ketchup, salsa and bbq sauce mixed together like most places i've tried. they also have a back room so don't worry if it looks crowded. i would def go here again!
