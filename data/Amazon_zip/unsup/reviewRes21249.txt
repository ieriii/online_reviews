The gold standard for Chicago-style hotdogs. The dogs are specially made for Superdawg by Vienna beef; think the regular frank you know and love, but about 3 times as large and with a half ton of garlic. Delicious. The dog is served as it should be: with mustard, celery salt, relish, onion, sport peppers, and a green tomato. They refuse to put ketchup on the hot dogs, which alone probably earns them a 5 star rating from me (if you want ketchup on your dog, you really shouldn't, but they'll give you a ketchup bottle so that you can commit the sacrilege yourself). The dog is served in a box crammed so full with delicious fries that I'm pretty sure you couldn't fit an extra hydrogen atom in the box if you tried. Perfect. I rarely order anything other than a Superdawg with everything, no relish; however, I had a hamburger once, and a milkshake a couple of times, and both are good. In summary: if you're in town long enough to patronize 3 restaurants, this should be one of them. So awesome, and so Chicago
