This place was packed but we were able to snag a few seats at the bar. The cocktail list is interesting, the wine list is great, and the menu is inventive. The cocktail with the herbs (sage maybe?) was refreshing! The service was attentive and speedy. The ambiance We had the: Beets with Goat Cheese- light, fresh, and delicious! Razor Clams- simply seasoned, a bit over cooked but still tasty. Roasted Bone Marrow, Foie Gras & Membrillo- rich, flavorful, and loved by those who consumed it. Overall a good experience and I would go back for more!
