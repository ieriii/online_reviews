This hotel is centrally located on Michigan Avenue right near all the shops (Apple store right next door, Walgreens right up the street, Trader Joe's & Garrett's Popcorn down two blocks). Very convenient to load up on water and snacks for your room while you call Allerton Hotel your home for the duration of your stay in the Windy City. Between the six of us in our group, we had three different types of rooms. I lucked out and paid $104/night for our king suite. The guys had a two double bed room (decent size) and our other friends got a teeny-tiny queen size petite room. It's all good though, we only picked this spot for the convenience of its location and the awesome deal we got through TravelZoo's website. I must say, this was the swiftest check-in and check-out at any hotel I've been at. When we arrived at 2:00 after taking a cab from Chicago Midway, we were quickly greeted by the front desk and was able to check into our room right away. Awesome. We hung out at the lounge a few times to grab a cocktail and some happy hour food. Five stars for having a $5 menu and for having nightly drink specials.  I loved the $5 flavored-vodka special they had on a particular night. The room was kept clean so no complaints there. We had our own mobile hot spot device so we didn't have to pay to have wifi access in our room, but getting a strong signal between all the buildings was quite the challenge. Oh well, free wifi in the lounge if you ask the front desk for the access code. Overall, I loved the Allerton Hotel. I have no complaints since it served its purpose well in the four nights we stayed there and provided a great deal that fit within our budget. The room wasn't big enough to store a dresser, so I ended up keeping most of my clothes in my suitcase since I had no where else to put it. Oh well, I still managed. If I return back to Chicago, I know I would not hesitate to stay here again.
