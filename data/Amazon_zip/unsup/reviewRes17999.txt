I have been here for lunch and breakfast. Both were amazing... The staff are always kind and helpful and the spot is convenient for walking to if you live/work in River North. For breakfast I have had the chilaquiles, yogurt parfait, and coffee. All 3 items are delicious and very tasty. The chilaquiles look small but is actually very filling. The granola in the parfait is really good. When I had it, it was topped with apples, raspberries, and nuts. For lunch I have only had the Cubano sandwich but I have tried others from my friends plates and none have been disappointing. All around a fun time and great experience eating Rick Bayless food at an affordable price.
