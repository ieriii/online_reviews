This place is very hit or miss. Nice idea, nice place, but bad food. I have been here at least 4-5 times. Out of those times, 3 have been quite bad.  I went Sunday around dinner time, and the hostess asked "Would you like to be seated in the adults only section?" I replied "Sure, I can't stand kids!" LOL, but I love that they give you that option, because it really did have a lot of children running around in the front. The bar area is nice and was quieter. It is a large restaurant and the whole place is decorated very colorful and neat looking, so the atmosphere is good. The food, not so much. Maybe it's just too big to concentrate on quality? I got the veggie burger, which was mushy and bland. There was no sauce on it, no cheese, just a very bland patty, on a plain white bread kieser roll. It came with no side dish, as if someone is going to order a burger and nothing else? You have to pay extra for 1 side dish, so I had the rice and beans side dish, also bland and unappealing. The mac-and-cheese my dining partner had was a small portion and lacked cheesiness. We got two tiny corn muffins and we had to ask for water twice. Before this time, I came once in the evening, late. I understand they were going to close, but they clearly said they were still open and let us in without an issue. The food was nasty, cold in the middle as it had been reheated via microwave. They do have carrot juice, which is good, but carrot juice is hard to screw up. I was also there for brunch before, where I had the french toast. It was bland once again, and had little batter on it. It needed cinnamon and maybe some nutmeg or something, because it was not good. All in all, I would NOT want to go here again.
