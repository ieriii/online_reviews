When you are ready to turn back the clock and head to the era of wild game and caveman-ly eats, Longman and Eagle brings gourmet to the hunter/gatherer community. Bone marrow and onion jelly followed by wild boar sloppy joes will make sure you are packed full of fat, calories, and nutrients until the next hunting party. Drinks are solid, staff is generally friendly, just make sure you don't need to fit into a tight dress the next day.
