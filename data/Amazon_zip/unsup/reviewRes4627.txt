I've heard so much about The Purple Pig that I finally decided to go with a friend to try it out. The wait was 2 hours, which wasn't bad for a weekend night, and the service was great. In terms of the food, we ordered the most popular items on the menu: bone marrow smear, fried pig ears, and milk braised pork. The bone marrow smear was pretty much inedible. The bread was drenched in oil and the bone marrow had no taste. The fried pig ears were also a let down. Not very flavorful - mainly just tasted the fried batter. Per the server, the way you're supposed to eat the dish is by breaking the yolk and mixing it in, however the egg was beyond well done and the yolk was rock hard. The milk braised pork was the saving grace of the meal. It was really excellent - the meat was tender and the mashed potatoes were a good textural contrast with a lot of flavor. Overall, I don't see what all the hype is all about. The food was okay, but not worth the time or the money. Maybe we just had bad luck with our meal, but I won't be going back here.
