While not completely authentic, Simply It provides a really nice change of pace in Lincoln Park as good ethnic food that is within a reasonable cab ride from downtown. The restaurant is run and owned by Vietnamese - quite far away from Argyle, but definitely much more convenient and accessible and at great prices! A bowl of beef pho is only $6.50 here! The staff was very friendly and the restaurant itself was very cozy. They do not have a liquor license, but it's BYOB. SI serves up a range of smoothies on the menu + they have coconut juice (yay) and Vietnamese hot/cold coffee for those interested in a strong dose of caffeine. Our small table shared the special spring rolls with crab, a delicious papaya salad, a bowl of beef pho, roasted duck curry (tasted semi-Chinese, but had sweet potatoes!), and lemongrass pork chop. Initially they got our order wrong and came out with lemongrass chicken - that didn't look anywhere as good as the pork chop. For those not in the know, that's a classic Vietnamese dish and SI's was a good portion and right on the money. After a great meal, it was refreshing to get a small plate of fruit, as typical with most Asian restaurants in Asia. They had good choices for dessert too, we had the passion fruit torte and a cappacino cheesecake. Ate a lot here, the place is kind of tucked away among the fratty LP bars, but it is a great great value and worth repeat visits.
