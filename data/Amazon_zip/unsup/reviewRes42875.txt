My favorite part about this place was the atmosphere. Definitely trendy, chic and somewhat exclusive. Like most places of this caliber you're paying much more for the operational costs of running such a swanky establishment than for the food and drinks. With that said, I'm a fan. Yes, I drank the Kool Aid and I bought into the hype (but not before sampling). The dinner plates are really small and some are better than others. My group stuck with the pasta dishes. My vegetarian friend had the purist. Definitely too salty for my liking. IMO if you're gonna serve me pasta in a plate (no veggies or garnish on the side), then it better be darn good. Therefore a fail. We also added the $5 bread, balsamic vinaigrette and olive oil starter to our meal. It was a HUGE HIT. Really good. I can't quite put my finger on it but they've done something right on that one. The managed to make this bread dipping experience sweet and smooth at the same time. Fantastic. My only complaint is this: Isn't the bread, olive oil and balsamic supposed to be complimentary? Idk, but it was still very good. Finally, the star of the show: The gnocchi with pancetta. Fantastico! (that's how you say it in Italian, right?) The gnocchi was pan-seared (to perfection) with thinly sliced parmesan on top. Definitely, worth a try, because it is absolutely good. I would go back to gilt bar just for that. YUM! As for the speakeasy: it leaves a little to be desired. Ambiance, check, lighting, check, music, check, drinks, check, flair, 1/2 check. The setting was lacking and I couldn't quite say why. Drinks were good (sampled the old fashioned and something else that was sweet and grape-fruity) but i must say that the culinary approach that Violet Hour takes with their drinks is better. Perhaps, next time I should plan to be a little more tipsy when I venture underground again.
