It's time for an update and a couple of quick musings... 1) The service here is absolutely impeccable. Everyone from the hostess--to the busser--to the food runner--to the server, is a true professional. They really know how to run things here. It's a fine line between being efficient and hovering, and they nail it every time. 2) Oysters are half price from 4:00-6:00 daily. Take advantage and try some oysters that you're not familiar with. My bf is partial to east coast oysters but decided to try some west coast varieties since the price was right...and now he discovered some new favorites. It pays to be adventurous during happy hour. All of their oysters are fresh (goes without saying) and are delicious. 3) Speaking of oysters, they serve theirs the correct way--over ice. Some places serve them over rock salt that *looks* like ice, but isn't. Trust me that you want them served over ice because oysters need to be kept cold as possible. Once they get a little warm they start to "turn" and it isn't pleasant. Also, their accompaniments (frozen mignonette, fresh horseradish) are top notch. 4) Their raspberry pie is impossible to stop eating and not to be missed. On my last visit, they were offering a peach/blackberry/plum cobbler that was fantastic. Still, I couldn't pass up the raspberry pie. Naturally I got both. This mantra has always served me well when it comes to food: "When it doubt, get both."
