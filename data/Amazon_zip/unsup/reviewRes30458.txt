Interesting and inventive Asian-inspired cuisine. The sushi was not the best, but decent. There is quite a bit more on the menu than sushi and probably worth checking out (as the sushi is a bit overpriced). The decore was welcoming and whimsical, but not beat-you-over-the-head whimsical. The presentation of the food was another plus - a fun twist. Excellent service with knowledgeable staff.
