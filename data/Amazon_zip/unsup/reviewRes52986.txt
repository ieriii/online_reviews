Having plans to hit up the Logan Theater to see a movie, I asked my date to pick a restaurant in the neighborhood and he let me pick between 90 Miles and Revolution Brewpub. Because I haven't had much experience with Cuban food, I asked the waiter what he would recommend to someone such as myself, and when he recommended 2 of the specials (one oxtail and one steak), we decided to get one of each and share, as well as an order of tostones. None of those decisions were bad, other than eating to the point of being so full that I wondered whether I was going to fall asleep at the movie. I will definitely come back here, keeping in mind its BYOB! Also happy to hear there is a second location in Roscoe Village!
