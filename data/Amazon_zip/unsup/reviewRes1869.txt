I heart Hot Doug (and Hot Doug's). You will too. Everything they say is true. With this yelp, there will be 1,199 reviews with what has got to be a record-breaking high average. Anthony Bourdain said it was one of the 13 places to eat before you die. (Duh) It's the word on the street. It's the encased meat that the foodies adore. All I have to add is a heartfelt thanks to Mr. Doug. He is one of the nicest people I've ever met. He takes the orders himself, and in the process, he, the rockstar, makes you feel like one as well. (Maybe someday, I'll come in and he'll be grouchy. Wouldn't matter - the guy is a gem.) I'm also deeply grateful for the use of Salma Hayeks, the specials with chvre, the classic dogs, and the fries. Also true: Get there early. Bring ice water for the wait in the summers.  The prices are unbeatable. Decide to tip - add to the awesome karma of the place.
