I don't know why I keep coming back here. I've tried a couple different burgers and each time they have been completely bland. I had the big Texan burger which has three onion rings, pulled pork and served on Texas toast. The pulled pork was absolutely tasteless. The onion rings offered nothing at all and the toast was dry. I had to get a side of barbecue sauce to get through it. I've also had a sandwich here which was forgettable. Another thing that bothered me about this place was their ketchup. I think I remember reading that they make their own there. It flat out blows. Is Heinz really that much? Poor choice. Also the fries were soggy and way too greasy. And their service seriously lacks. We hardly saw our server and when we did she asked us how our food was. I told her that it wasn't that great and she actually said great and walked away. Where do they find these people? The ONLY saving grace are the cheese curds. Amazing. I live near here and it's a bummer that this place is so bad.
