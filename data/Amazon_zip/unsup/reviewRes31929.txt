Demera was my second try at Ethiopian food and I enjoyed this meal much more than my first. The four of us ordered a total of 12 vegetarian and meat dishes and every single thing was tasty! Sadly, I couldn't begin to tell you what the favorites were, but the cabbage and carrots vegetarian dish made the biggest impression for me, as did a sauceless lamb dish. The honey wine was divine and our service was great. Next time, though, we'll skip the seafood dishes and dessert. While everything was good, the salmon was dull and overcooked, and the tuna sambusa on our sampler platter was nothing special. The fresh fruit dessert was a little on the overripe side for me. Overall, though, definitely worth a return and the price is right for a date night out or a meal with friends.
