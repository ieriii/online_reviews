I came here for lunch last Thursday with my mom, sister and brother. What a cute place! We found parking RIGHT in front, so already the meal was off to a great start! The outside area looked like it'd be a lot of fun, but it was pretty chilly so we sat inside. The atmosphere was really fun and there were lots of things to look at, which is always great!  We started off with some Green Plantains w/ a garlic sauce, they were a bit different than we had expected, but I thought they were great. The garlic sauce was good too. I got a mango something iced tea- excellent! We all ordered sandwiches, I ended up with the Cuban one, and it was so good! Writing this post now at 11:30am makes me hungry for lunch!!! Best part, we all ordered a beverage had an appetizer and 4 meals and it was under $50! I was shocked (and excited)!!! I will definitely be back, this is a great place to go just because or if you have company in town they'll get a kick out of it too!
