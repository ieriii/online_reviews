A-MAZING!!! Not sure how else I can describe this wonderful place. This was recommended to me and I of course had to make a food stop here. We got there around 6PM on a Saturday night and the wait was about 30 minutes. We were given the option of outside, the bar or a table; which ever came first. The bar opened up first, so we took a pair of seats there. The best thing about sitting at the bar, watching the executive chef make all the food!!! We ordered, Prosciutto di Parma, Pecorino Noce and Whipped Feta with Cucumbers. All items were awesome! The meat and cheese were paired with a sweet raspberry spread; which was a great combination. The feta/cucumber spread was very creamy with diced bits of cucumbers on top; served with 6 slices of toasted bread. This is a great place to stop for an evening snack, good drinks and great atmosphere.
