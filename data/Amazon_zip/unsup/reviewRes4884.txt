If I could pick up just one thing from Chicago and bring it over to NYC it would be this restaurant. Hands down the best one I went to while visiting this past fall. Everything is served tapas style so we ordered about 8 different things, and each one was wonderful. It was a very long wait (about an hour on a Saturday afternoon) but totally worth it. We just went shopping on Michigan Ave and came back 45 minutes later.
