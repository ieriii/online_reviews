OVER-RATED!!! Look, the food here is just like any other trendy pub joint these days. Nothing bad to say about the food, but nothing that is a stand  out. However, the bar is excellent! How do I know? Because our group of four had to wait THREE HOURS for a table. You read that correctly. Granted, we arrived at 6:30 on a Saturday evening knowing they didn't take reservations and expected a wait. We were told a 1.5 to 2 hour wait. We asked at 1.5 hours what to expect and were told "only 6 parties in front of you." Went back at 2 hours and "only 6 partied in front of you." 8:30 on a Saturday and what is one to do, leave - wait it out? Well, we decided to wait thinking it wouldn't be long. After 3 hours.... yes THREE HOURS we were finally seated. Our server was good and clearly understood we were hungry. What we learn (and suspected from watching) is the kitchen is too small to accommodate the place. We were not served dinner for another hour. If you do the math, that means we were served dinner at 10:30pm! On top of that, we asked for bread when seated to help us. We were politely informed "we don't serve bread."  This place is just not work the wait - come on people. Wake up! No place deserved the reputation you continue to give it when they cannot manage their crowds better (or more truthfully). And, to not offer bread knowing that some are waiting 2 or 3 hours is just ridiculous! Maybe I won't go with such an overwhelmingly large group next time!
