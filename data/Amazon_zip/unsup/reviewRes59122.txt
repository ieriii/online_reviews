If brunch is your thing, this place is for you.  Delicious food and great service. But you will have to be patient as there is a long wait time. But to avoid this, get there early. Definitely worth it. If it's just 2 or 3 of you, be willing to sit at the "bar" to avoid wait time. The food is the same. Check out the bike shop next door while waiting. Street parking is available but you will have to drive around a few times.
