This place has the BEST falafel sandwiches in the world. I've been to NY and tried the falafel that has been praised to be the best but it doesn't even come close to Sultan's. The veggies are so flavorful and the falafel is so well spiced. There's only one word to describe their falafel sandwich: PERFECT! Not only is it delicious but it's cheap. How can you go wrong with that? Side note: it is cash only.
