I loved this place, it was a lot bigger then expected,the food was amazing, and our ice cream dessert was really good too! I have nothing bad to say and really liked that a manager (that's who he looked like) took our plates off our table as he passed by not just waiting for the waitor or busboy to do it, ill be back for sure
