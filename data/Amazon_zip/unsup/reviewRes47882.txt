I went their lounge for drinks only on Saturday night, it was packed! nice decor restaurant, nice fireplace, it took me almost 20 mintues at least to get a drink! Overall just OK not too impressed me. Too bad it was too crowd so I couldn't get to the patio upstairs, may go again next time if I have chance.
