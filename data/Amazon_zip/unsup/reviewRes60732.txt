If you can appreciate a really good burger then you will absolutely enjoy this place. These burgers are insane! with interesting names like Conjugal Visit, The Electric Chair and Cruelty to Animals to name a few. They are worth every penny and if you go on a tuesday when most of the burgers are half-off you are basically robbing the place!AWESOME selection of beer (This is a paragraph in itself)!!!! Large spectrum, from PBR to Delirium Tremens.Great mac-and-cheese, you have to try it! Ok as far as the servers go. Bartenders are great and really fit well with the place. Door guy does everything from checking your ID, to seating you, to cleaning your table if he has to, and is really friendly while doing it.Very loud (it doesn't bother me too much, but i thought I should let you know)Look forward to going back as soon as possible!!! I can't wait!
