This place is so much better than the fancy gourmet hot dog joints (not gonna name any names). you want good food? Get some superdawg. Ive been to a few restaurants who were featured on t.v. for having the best of the best. There have also been a few times those experiences have been bad cuz the food actually wasn't good at all! This place isn't like that. It's featured on tv not only for it's history and uniqueness, but also because the place sells legit dawgs.
