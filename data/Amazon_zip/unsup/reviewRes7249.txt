This atmosphere is not what you would expect of a bbq joint, with white tablecloths and an "upscale feel". We ate at the bar, and the bartender was awesome, very helpful and courteous. For sides, we tried the mac and cheese (I was super disappointed after all the hoopla in these reviews, it's just average liquidy mac and cheese) and 2 different types of cornbread (FYI an order of cornbread is gigantic, kind of dry, and I don't think the flavors between the two types were very unique). To dine we split the "competition" st. louis ribs. These were cooked perfectly, fell right off the bone, and were very delicious. The total order was a ton of food. I'd return and just stick to the meat.
