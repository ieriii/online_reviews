we went here STRICTLY on Yelp! reviews and have no regrets and plan to go back. Let's just get this out of the way, who ever said the servers can be hit or miss was dead on! And I hope they are reading these reviews to give EVERYONE on staff a pep talk. It's getting HOT outside and they want the place to stay packed. Now, the prices were reasonable for the amount of food you get. Let them know if you want your meat medium.  They didn't ask and my meat was over cooked for me. Everything was good, fresh and tasty!  The music was excellent, which made the atmosphere bearable (traffic, sirens and train) - which I'm sure is fine for city-folk.
