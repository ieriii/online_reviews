Boy, the other reviewers aren't kidding when they say the service here sucks. My wife and I ate here despite some if the negative reviews, because we were hoping the food would compensate for the poor service. We were wrong. To be fair, we ate lunch here, so the full menu wasn't available, but our server was the absolute worst server ever (a heavier-set gal with tattoos). After taking our initial order, our server was sight-unseen for the rest of our meal. I had to go up to the bar to ask if someone could find her so we could get our check and get the hell out of there. The food was mediocre; I had the reuben and the corn chowder and my wife had the crab cake app and eggs benedict. Very disappointing outcome for a place that I was hoping to be a frequent choice for lunch and dinner.
