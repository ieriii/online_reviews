Read my piece on Piece in peace. I've eaten here a few times over the years. With 490+ reviews so far it's clear this place has a solid reputation. That being said, I'm going to say what most have probably already said. Great beers, good pizza, and a fun setup. Not only do they brew their own beer but have quality imports as well....Chimay and Delirium Tremens just to name a few. Pizza tastes more like a good homemade pizza than from a restaurant. I recommend this place as a fun spot to go with some friends. Don't go to be "wowed" but definitely somewhere to have a fun dinner.
