Pork Eggrolls ($3.95) -- Mediocre. Pho ($7.95) -- Excellent. Combination Fried Rice ($7.95) -- Excellent. Sure, we had to share a table with others in order to get seated quickly, but that's okay. The lazy susan on the table mesmerized me, so I can't comment on how long it took for us to get our food. I do like that they aren't stingy with their plum sauce -- they leave a big bottle of it on your table for you to douse in. Me likey. Yum, yum, yum -- just wish it wasn't so busy all the time.
