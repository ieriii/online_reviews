First off, you start here with the truffle popcorn. I love it. They had to take it from the table, or I would get full off of it, but they definitely offered to bring more if we wanted. We got the 5-course tasting because we had such good luck with it last year when we visited Chicago. Menu: 1 caesar (brioche/parmesan/anchovy) 2 bisque (corn/chipotle/huitlacoche) 3 halibut porcini/pumpernickel/champagne) 4 wagyu (sunchoke/watercress/pecorino) 5 chocolate (almond/apricot/caramel) I don't care what you think of Graham Elliot. I'm an out-of-towner, so I only have the food to base my decision. My husband and I loved EVERYTHING. There was not one bad dish. I scraped the bottom of the bowl/plate on each dish we got. The service was pretty good, and we like the ambience. You know you're in a good restaurant when you get fancy food while listening to Green day. We loved it last year and it was awesome this year. It was one of the main reasons we like to come to Chicago. It was the food highlight of our trip this year, and that included dinner at Topolobampo, Moto, and C-House. It was also the least expensive of the tastings that we had, but by far the most satisfying. Highly recommended.
