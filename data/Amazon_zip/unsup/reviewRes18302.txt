What we ordered: The brother: Choriqueso The girlfriend: Ahogada Me: Cochinita Pibil What we shared: Pork belly Vermicelli Churros (w/ soft serve) The verdict: First off, I should mention that I really liked the bread. Crispy, but not crack-the-roof-of-my-mouth crispy. Good bread is crucial in sandwiches and burgers. I liked the Ahogada torta the best of the three - it had the best combination of flavors. The Choriqueso was good, but not quite at the Ahogada level. And my sandwich was the most disappointing. When I read the description of "wood-roasted suckling pig," I envisioned the suckling pig I had in Peru last year (lechon). Unfortunately, this did not come with the crispy skin that I now associate suckling pig with. Therefore, my heart and stomach just did not feel satisfied. I simply did not taste anything exciting from the sandwich. Side note: I must warn you that the accompanying hot sauce is hecka spicy, so be careful. The Pork belly vermicelli was quite tasty. Maybe a bit too watered-down, but the soup hit the spot as it was pretty dang cold outside. And the pork belly in it was excellent. Finally, the churros. I had these churros during my visit prior to this last one, and I wasn't impressed at the time. I don't know if anything changed over the course of the year (probably not), but I really, really enjoyed them this time. Just the perfect amount of cinnamon sugar and just the perfect amount of crunch. Hands down, the best churro I've had. 3.5 stars
