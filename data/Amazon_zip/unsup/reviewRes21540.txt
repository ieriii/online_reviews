Hands down my favorite Mexican in the whole city. I eat there a lot now, so they all remember me and are very friendly. Even after the first few times they made a point to say hello and ask how I was. Which scores them big points in my book. The interior seems small and crowded up front, which I don't mind. But if you're looking for something more spacious ask to be seated in the rear dining room. It's large and they have a beer garden. Food is excellent and portioned well. Drinks are a little pricey but definitely worth it. Their Margaritas have real chunks of fruit in them. This place deserves the 5 stars I gave them.
