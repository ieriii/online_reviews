We came around 5pm on a Thursday and there was only one other table seated inside. For some reason it took about 10 minutes before anyone decided to wait on us, which kind of sucked because we were really, really thirsty after walking over here. Our waiter seemed like he really couldn't care less about us and we joked that we wouldn't get our drinks until some of our food started coming out...which ended up being true and not a joke after all. The beets with goat cheese were good. The fava beans with prosciutto were awesome. The meatball sliders were really good. I enjoyed the cucumber and feta smear. Really disliked that we were never given clean plates over the course of the entire meal. The chicken kabobs were the highlight. They were amazing. Also awesome was the fact that our busser took time to explain to us questions we had about the food since our waiter seemed lost in his own little world. I'd probably have given four stars if service had been better. I really liked the interior of the place and there are still things on the menu I want to try.
