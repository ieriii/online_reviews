For hotel reviews, I like to keep it simple, and useful. Great location - right in the center / walking distance of shopping, movie theatres, parks, museums, and restaurants. For the more indie/local neighborhoods and bars though, you will likely need a cab. Great service, very polite and helpful. Really pretty on the inside - marble, and very cute restaurant and bar. The place has character - it's not one of those generic, boring eyesores that make me sick. Our room - kind of small, but not uncomfortably so. Bathroom - nice shower / good water pressure. No bathtub - but I think that in the larger rooms, that may not be the case. L'Occitane brand (and great smelling) shower products. If you want to use internet in your room, you have to pay $10 a day, otherwise, take your laptop down to the lobby for a free connection. Everything was clean. The rooms come with an i-pod docking station so you can play your music on speakers / charge it - great perk! Try not to use the bathroom at night if you're sharing a room - the toilet's flush is loud enough to wake the dead. Nice gym with little flat screen TVs on most of their equipment. I think that this hotel generally is expensive, but I went through Orbitz, booked it as a package with my flight, and only paid around $260 for 3 nights...if you split that with who you're staying with, it's a steal. Overall - excellent place.
