I'm torn. At first I was going to give 4 stars, but then I realized only the outside part of the restaurant deserves 4 stars. The food is more like a 3. It is OK but seriously nothing amazing and nothing I'd rush back for. The atmosphere outdoors was fabulous! We LOVED sitting outside on a fabulous summer evening with a few bottles of wine. If we had stopped with the wine, I'd say this was a solid 4 stars, but the food isn't worthy of such a rating. If I recall, for appetizers we had calimari (it was fine, if not a little too salty), fried zucchini blossoms (WAY too much breading! definitely took away from such a delicate dish!) and the chickpea frites (the waiter raved and while these were OK, they weren't rave worthy). For dishes everyone got a range of poultry, to meats, to pastas. My pasta had mushrooms and truffle oil, and was tasty, but not stellar. Essentially the same sentiments were shared around the table. We got an assortment of desserts to share, and they were tasty but didn't blow us away. I think we raved most about how tasty the fresh whipped cream was.... It wasn't a bad meal by any means, just not worthy of all the praise this place gets. If we hadn't been seated outside enjoying ourselves in the great atmosphere, we definitely would have been disappointed with the whole experience. I was a little sad, because I wanted to like this place so much more!!
