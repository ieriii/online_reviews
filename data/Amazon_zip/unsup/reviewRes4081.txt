Fine dining for people who don't really do fine dining. There's a time and a place for jackets only, pomp and/or circumstance, exacting service, etc. But sometimes you just want to eat some spectacular food without being judged by your waiter. And maybe do shots of whiskey with the kitchen. I promise, the obstacle course of a reservation process is completely worth it. Schwa practically guarantees one of the best meals you've never had. We opted for the 9 course menu, but got at least 11 (plus a cigarette bummed from the kitchen). Thanks guys. Our vegetarian request was handily fulfilled, although I think the chef was almost disappointed when we told him we were vegetarians - as if they wanted a bigger challenge than "no meat." Sorry guys. The BYOB aspect is fun, another way in which the restaurant is more accessible than other high-end spots. Bonus: it also gave my boyfriend a chance to show off and geek out on some special bottles. Small problem: it also gave us a chance to drink way too much on the cheap-er. Walking through the kitchen to get to the restroom gives you a chance to watch the boys at work as they rock out to Slayer. You may even get hit on by one of the guys. If any of this sounds uncomfortable, I'd recommend taking your business elsewhere. As you can guess by the difficulty of getting in, Schwa won't miss you.
