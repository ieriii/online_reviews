We loved this hotel - location was great & got a really good deal on the rooms. Check out the hotel's website because they may be offering some specials that are way cheaper than the other travel sites. Front desk was accommodating - the power went out just as we were checking in so we had to wait about 10 mintues, but they gave us free internet for the inconvenience (and we weren't even upset about the wait). It's right across from the famous Gibson's & there's a nice "park" area just across from the hotel where you can sit & get coffee in the morning & people watch. We pretty much walked everywhere from the hotel, great view of the city, rooms were actually quite large & bed was very comfortable.  I'd definitely stay here again!!!!
