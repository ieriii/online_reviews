I have been eating here my whole life. The thin crust pizza is the best in the city. The ingredients are fresh and the sauce is right on.  Try the La Villa special and you will never think of pizza the same. There are specials each day and my favorite is Monday Nite Lasagna. They also have a great BBQ Italian Beef!  They have great delivery drivers and the food always shows up hot.
