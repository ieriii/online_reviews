Peter Parker, Connie Chung, Snow White and everything else you could imagine. I really like this BYOB place. I have been 3 times now and the sushi always tastes so fresh. They have interesting rolls along with the standard and they always have a couple of rolls and nagiri on special. The stting is very nice and a little romantic. They have Wang's next door so if there is a wait (which there will be) you have have some yummy martinis. They only negative is that Wang's is cash only. This is probably my second fave to Toro, however that is one place you have to RSVP for a week in advance.
