This is a really good spot with tasty food and really good service. I've never been disappointed in either. I came in with a large group (10) the other day for lunch and we were treated very well and served fairly quickly. The place is a little bit dark, but I guess it adds to the ambiance. The servers seem knowledgeable about the different menu items, which I appreciate. There's a private room downstairs, though we looked into having a party here and it was pretty expensive. Definitely make reservations if you're coming at a busy time of day, especially if you have more than a couple of people.
