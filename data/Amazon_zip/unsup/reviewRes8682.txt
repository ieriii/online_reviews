The food gets a four and the experience a two. Average. 3. I had to wait a long time to get a table which was not good. Then after we sat down the chef/manger came out to give everyone waiting cheese and bread, How come I got no cheese? This was my first time eating here and the waitress was not very helpful, in fact I hardly saw her. Me and the person I was with had salads and two different pizzas, they were both very good. However, with food and 4 beers this place was a little pricey for what we got. I might go back because I live close to the place, but I am still looking for that perfect Italian pizza experience.
