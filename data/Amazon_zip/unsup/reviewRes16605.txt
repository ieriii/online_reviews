Love India House Restaurant! The food menu has very extensive options for all types of appetites. The portions are perfect if not too big! I can't believe when I read reviews for people asking for bigger portions! I hope Weight Watchers or a gym is around the corner from where you live! Great location in my great neighborhood. This is definitely my go to new Indian spot. The service is pretty solid considering it's hard to find attentive/spectacular service at Indian resturants. I'll take it.
