I first came here shortly after moving to Chicago as it was highly recommended by a lot of fellow foodies. We started with one of the specials of the night:hamachi carpacchio with jalapeno, which was absolutely delicious. This was followed by their sunrise, white dragon, and volcano maki rolls, which were equally enjoyable. Another bonus is that its BYO :) Coast has a very cool ambience and can be quite intimate, but it's also great to enjoy with a group of girlfriends (they do have seating for larger groups). Remember to make reservations; even with reservations, we ended up waiting about 20 minutes for our table.
