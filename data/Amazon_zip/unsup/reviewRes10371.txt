I had great expectations and they were met! Went there with my husband for Valentine's day's dinner. The place was very busy, of course, but the service was attentive and aweseome. The food was delizioso!!! We had special of the day - Branzino con Sale - Mediterranean Sea Bass in Salt Crust dish, and Risotto dish. Antipasti was mixed grilled veggies, proscuitto, olives, and pecorino - very very yummy. The fish had the most amazing sauce - I am still dreaming about it. The salt crust added a very delicious twist that I really loved. My husband and I eat gluten free - so we were accomodated with no problem. They actually do have 2 types of gluten free pasta. I was disappointed, however, that I couldn't eat their Ribolitta - my favorite soup of all times. It was pre-made with bread. Maybe they can re-think their recipe to add bread as an option? Hint-hint... That's how I made my Ribolitta. They also had a very nice selection of Italian wine, and other Italian alcoholic drinks. The ambience was romantic, cozy, and somewhat rustic. Looking forward to coming back.
