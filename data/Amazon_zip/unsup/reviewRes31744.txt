This is a great organic little restaurant my husband and I were introduced to by a friend. Our 1st experience was really good. The wait staff was pleasant and the small intimate atmosphere was nice to dine in. The menu was small but filled with good organic options. We are use to having a little more to pick from but we both found something we liked. The food is nothing to rave about. It was cooked well but nothing I ate (and I tasted some of everyone's dish) made me want to come back for more. My husband and I were in the neighborhood last month and decided to stop for a mid afternoon meal. There were only 2 other couples in the restaurant. We were seated by the hostess who told us in 10 min. they would be serving from the dinner menu. We looked at both menus and decided we like more of the dinner options. When our waitress came over she was very cold and have a very fake attitude towards us. We explained that we may want to wait for dinner and her attitude became more apparent. We were growing hungrier and asked to get food from the lunch menu. When we began to ask questions about the dishes we were thinking about getting, her responses were very rude and not helpful. So we left! We are big on service and she sucked. The waitress (a short, Caucasian, chunky, brown haired woman) really ruined our experience and we will not be going back. Not to include the food is just ok.
