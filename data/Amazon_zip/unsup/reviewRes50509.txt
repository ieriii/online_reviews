Can't give it five stars, since I was only there once for lunch. But what a great lunch it was. I had the Crab Cake salad, which melted like butter on my tongue. The crab cakes were offset by a bed of greens that also had artichoke hearts, jicama, red pepper, and I believe slivered green tomatoes. Wow. The wait staff was as friendly as could be, given the fact that my friend and I only ordered water with the meal. And the gospel music played in the background was a hoot. Go, and bring your best friends.
