I think the beer was good, selection amazing. Kinda like a bar environ, this place would be better with more servers, and more bartenders. We basically had to bus our own table. The existing staff seemed overwhelmed and not very interested in picking up extra tables. The door greeter was a bit snippity and uninviting. Again though the beer was tasty if a bit overpriced, but I loved that they had an amazing selection.
