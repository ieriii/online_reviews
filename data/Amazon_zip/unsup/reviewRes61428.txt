Nuevo Leon kinda dropped the ball tonight.Luckily,they made up for it.My waitress forgot to ask me what kind of tortillas I wanted.And Im normally a die hard corn guy.But not when I come to Nuevo Leon!!!! Because they're famous for their hand made flour tortillas.Needless to say,by the time my food was ready I still had to wait ten more minutes for tortillas.And I was in such a hurry that I just asked for whatever was faster.So I got CORN!!!! Yet the food was pretty good.Then I guess my waitress felt bad that I didnt get my tortillas till I was ready to leave and I ended up getting a really good dessert on the house!! I dont know what it was but it was delicious!!! Had fresh fruit w/nuts!!! The salsas were all really good and fresh.I've been to the one on 18th as well.Will return.
