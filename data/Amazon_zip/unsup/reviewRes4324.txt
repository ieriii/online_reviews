Some people may say the Green Mill is still alive and thriving simply because of its history, but I don't care. It's got great atmosphere and amazing music, what more could you need or want in a jazz club? The doorman even attempted to speak French to my French friend.  The waitress was rather surly when we asked for water, but I'll give her the benefit of the doubt and say she was having an off night.  The Green Mill rocks.
