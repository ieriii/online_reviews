I was not all that impressed by this place. A pizza that is supposed to serve one for $13 is hardly my idea of a good value. It would be more understandable if the pizza would have been worth it, but not really. Lacking in the sauce (and I don't even like that much sauce) and the dough didn't have much flavor. "Meh" is right.
