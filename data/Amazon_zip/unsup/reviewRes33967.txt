Made reservations for a big celebration and along with at least 20 others we had to wait for our table for at least an hour. We left after the first "30 minute" quote turned into " probably another "30 minutes" and when showed frustration the teenage host told me that he can't control how long it takes people to eat and that if I didn't like it I could leave. this was after another host told me they over booked the night. So I know I will never go to any of the Francesca restaurants and I know I'm not missing anything. Topogigio, Il Mulino and La Scarola are the best Italian in the city. No need for the unprofessional Francesca's chain.
