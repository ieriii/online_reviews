I like this place because they sell pizza by the slice. Sometimes, you just don't want to order a whole stuffed pizza - you know what I mean? Plus, they have daily specials that makes for a very affordable dinner. However, I would stick to the pizza and sandwiches at this place. We ordered a few pasta dishes once and was not impressed. Tasted like cheap italian. But the pizzas and sandwiches are pretty awesome.
