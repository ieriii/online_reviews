My husband and I found this place because we were planning a trip to the Prop Theater close by. I wasn't sure what to expect, but the Yelp reviews were positive so we gave it a try. The restaurant is really cozy with great lighting and beautiful stained glass. The service was amazing, the entire staff was very attentive and we even got a hug from the owner when we left. The food was great. I had the vegetarian goulash and my husband had the beef goulash. The food was great. You should definitely try it out if you are in the area!
