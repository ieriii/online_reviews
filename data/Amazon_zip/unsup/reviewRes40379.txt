It's was just ok, we tried biscuits n gravy and sloppy Joe that everyone has been raving about. They were ok, nothing great. Sloppy Joe was on a dry side, a bit spicy. Beer was very reasonably priced, Hoegaarden was only $5. Not coming back, why bother when there are so many other places out there. I also have to agree that hostesses are rude and need a class on customer service.
