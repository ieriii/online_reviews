Okay, so you saying to yourself "why is this guy giving one of the most famous restaurants in Chicago 2 stars?" Well, I had one of the worst dinning experiences I have ever had here. After waiting in line for an hour to get a seat, even though they told me on the phone that we had a reservation for 9 and there would not be a wait of more than 10 minutes, we were seated by an extremely rude host, and then sat for approximately 25 minutes without so much as a hello from any of the staff. It was like we were not there. We finally had to flag down a waitress to get water and menus. Eventually some one came and took our drink and appetizer order, which was served promptly, but no came back for the rest of our order for almost a half hour (some one did fill our water during that time) Once the waitress showed back up and took our order, it was almost 45 minutes before we were served our food or asked if we needed another drink. Once we had finished our meal, it took almost half an hour for some one to realize that our table needed to be be busses. All of this was going on as Rick Bayless was sitting about 20 feet away from us at the counter. Now, I know this place is busy and all, but maybe there is a line out the because it take s 3 hours to get to dessert due to the crappy service. This was the worst experience I have had at a place were a meal for 4 runs $225...
