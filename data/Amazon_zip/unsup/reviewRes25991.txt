I had my first slice of deep dish pizza here a few nights ago. It was my first meal in Chicago, so I had to start it off right. I'm a fan of thin crust, so I wasn't sure how I was gonna like the deep dish action. I'm not a fan of things with a lot of dough. (For a long time, I would take the top bun off my burgers...) Anyway, the dough here was perfectly crunchy on the outside, with the inside being soft. The pizzas are made to order and you basically customize your pizza. YUM! I was so full after 1 1/2 slices...which is WEAK for me. Oh, but I also had a side of their fries and chicken wings which were hot, fresh and yummy, too. I would definitely recommend this place for deep dish!
