Good lord, I love breakfast food. Yolk does breakfast right. The make your own skillet is delicious (I had sausage, green peppers and jalapenos in mine). Comes with gigantic pancakes which are nice and fluffy and just perfection. Last time I was here, we were told the wait would be twenty minutes, but it was more like five. Great service, too!
