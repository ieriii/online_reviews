Okay I'm sorry but I'm going to give the good ole' biased tourist review, forgive me fellow chicagoans, I'm sure there are better pizza joints your city has to offer off the beaten path, but Gino's did it for me and I can say I was beyond thrilled to be so satisfied at one of the city's deep-dish staples. I was there with a couple of friends the day before NYE and when we got off the bus, we saw there was a line at the door. This got me a bit nervous, I don't even do lines for clubs in Miami, but there was a dude outside who seemed to have it all under control and that he did bc the line moved faster than I'd have expected, and before you knew it we were sitting in one of the cozy booths on the second floor. The place is just crazy cool, brick walls, wooden booths and chalk graffiti all over. Some really cool pictures and flair as well. We ordered a round of brews (on the pricier side) and a big bowl of the house salad (ya know...to get our fiber). Our server was really nice and she suggested we get in our pizza order if we were thinking deep dish bc it takes about 25 mins to cook. So we made the bold move and just ordered the Gino's East Deep Dish Supreme Pizza...when in Rome.... The pizza actually didn't take that long, or maybe it was just that my time perception was off bc I was having such a great time. Everything was delicious and satisfying and I walked out with the biggest smile on my face. The leftovers were also equally satisfying when we came back from celebrating New Years so yeah...thanks Gino's, you definitely own up to your reputation.
