By far, one of my most favorite restaurants in the city. The flavors are always spot on, the atmosphere is beautiful without being overly pretentious, the service could be hit or miss, but everything else makes up for it. Every single item on the menu is delicious. Its definitely a special occasion place if you can splurge, but definitely worth it.
