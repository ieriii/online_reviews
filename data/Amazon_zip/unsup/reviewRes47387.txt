This place has great prices on everything. Beer and food is a good price for the amount you get. All the burgers I've tried have been great but they could be more consistent. I have eaten here 40+ times and every time something tastes different or made wrong. But... I keep going back. Majority of the time it is still yummy and fun. for non-burger eaters get the Buffalo Chicken salad. Ssoooo great for only $7! Concept is great and everyone is super nice. But the music gets old after a while. If you don't like the band, you still have to sit through over an hour of it. Could pick some better bands too for peak hours. Seems like there is always a seat open! 1/2 price burgers on Monday are fantastic. 1/2 price drafts on Tuesday are fantastic.
