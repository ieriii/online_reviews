My heart's ablaze for this Lettuce Entertain You carnivore and seafood delight. Don't let the North Shore carbon copies deter you from trying this special spot in the heart of River North. I heart WILDFIRE's: * Jazzy Wine Flight * Passionfruit Mojito * Filet Medallions (Good: Bearnaise; Better: Mashed Potato; Best/ Heaven in a Bite: Blue Cheese) * Halibut Special & Asparagus * Wildfire Ice Cream Sandwich * Individual Bathroom Stalls & Bamboo Wallpaper Fantastic service! YUMMMY!
