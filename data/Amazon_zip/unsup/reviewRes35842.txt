My family and I went on Sunday to try the brunch which surpriced us that we were served with 2 words "Quality" and Quantity". The sushi, king crabs and other seafoods are amazing. I am sure alot of people experienced the brunch with only serving you with hugh amount of food, but without the quality food except this place is serving both "Q" words, and it's definitely worth to visit again.
