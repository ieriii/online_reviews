WOW! I was just here the other day and I was IMPRESSED! They could use about 5 times the space, but the food was wonderful and well priced. I went there on a Monday night with a party of 4 total. Don't plan to be seated quickly as this place ROCKS any day of the week (if our Monday outing was any indication). They have VERY few tables. We ended up at one of the high "bar tables" near the windows. They really aren't for more than 3 people, but we squeezed in. It was worth the wait! We had a GREAT time! The food was WONDERFUL. The service was prompt (with a minor glitch--they forgot to take a drink order with the meal order and as busy as it was, it took us a few minutes to point this out to them). I had the chile relleno dinner which was very nice. Milder than I'd like, but I'm a SPICE FANATIC! One of our group had Yuca con ajo (I think--Yuca roasted with garlic)--it was YUMMY! I also had a side of a couple of their Costa Rican Tacos. They were interesting. I'd never have expected them to be basically like Mexican taquitos (rolled & deep fried) with meat inside & lettuce & ketchup & mayo on top--YES, YOU READ RIGHT, Ketchup & Mayo)! They were actually quite tasty. One of our group had the steak with grilled onions--WOW, what a PILE of onions! The plantains were scrumptious also. I'll definitely return. It was a VERY pleasant evening! Our two out of town friends were very impressed.
