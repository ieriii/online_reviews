I'm sorry I have to take a star off my review. And it's not due to anything that Hot Doug has done. I'm sure it's still great. It's just that I will never be able to eat here again due to the ridiculous wait. I went by here the other day and the line was at least twice as long as I have ever seen it. I couldn't even see the end of the line. My time is too valuable. I really don't want to dedicate an entire day to eating a sausage. So we drove on up to Superdawgs as a consolation prize.
