I was recently introduced to Indie Cafe and I was highly surprised. I love sushi, but would hardly call myself a Sushi Aficionado and luckily someone was there to educate me!  Everything was wonderful and the staff was extremely nice. The Las Vegas roll and the spicy tuna stood out the most as my favorites. The menu has a wide arrangement of various sushi. The hardest part is making up your mind on what you want. I've had some sushi that was too fishy and the seaweed wrap was too salty or fishy tasting. I did not experience this with any of what I had.  I've heard people say good and bad things about this place. I don't think I have one bad thing to say about this place and will go many more times. I've also heard people rant and rave about their Rangoon. I didn't have any, but might on the next visit out. They also have a full Thai menu on top of. I didn't have any, so I won't rate it.
