The food was really, really fantastic. So how can I say "eh"?  Client dinner. Expensive bottle of vino. Wrong vintage brought to the table.  Waiter was sent away. Returns with "this or nothing, this is all we have". Ok. No fuss with the clients here, we're having fun. He pours it and says "this doesn't suck, does it"? no kidding. One of my guests notes "he's pretty rough around the edges". Dinner moves on - charming chefs serve us delicious meats. Waiter returns and we order port. We mistakenly order 15 year tawny. Ne never returns. 20 minutes later we call him to the table and says - well there was no 15 year port so he brought us nothing. Really?? I say? Really? We order 10 year - he charges us for 20 year!! Overall - between the younger vintage and the ports - we paid nearly $60 in over rings with no apologies. I found it disgusting. And both errors were brought to his attention with no correction. Ugh. Good food. But for Chicago - really rough wait service. Very unexpected.
