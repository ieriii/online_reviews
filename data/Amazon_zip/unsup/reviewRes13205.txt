So go figure... My original prediction of Rev's impending, massive success came true. Great beer. Amazing food that puts other breweries to shame. The pretzel is awesome... Soft, warm, and fresh and the cheese dip is like liquid crack. Save the leftover cheese for the delicious fries. The applewood smoked wings and potato cakes still rock and the pulled pork pizza and sandwiches are outstanding. This brew-pub is obviously expanding and here to stay. Service is solid for a place that gets this busy. All the complaints about waiting and the like... then go somewhere else. When an establishment gets this busy then you're going to wait. My only advice to Revolution Brew management is to stay on top of service.  This place is popular for a reason. Five stars.
