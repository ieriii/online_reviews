I had lunch with a friend at Demera and couldn't believe that I have been living in the neighborhood for years and never ventured to try this place! It was delicious! I had tried ethiopian food for the first time at the ethiopian diamond in a party and thought THAT taste was the basis for ethiopian food (hadn't loved it really). Then Demera restored my expectations... Try their combinations, the mixes, whatever you call them.
