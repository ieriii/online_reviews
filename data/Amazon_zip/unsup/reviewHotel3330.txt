My second night in Chicago was spent at the Hard Rock Hotel and it couldn't have been a better choice! The gilded art deco building itself is beautiful. I felt like I was walking into a gold bank vault. Much like a W Hotel, the Hard Rock has very chic rooms that make them stand out compared to the average cookie cutter hotel room. Having artwork of David Bowie on the walls is a nice change from the norm. Aveda products in the bathroom to keep me smelling nice and free wifi throughout the hotel to keep me connected were also added bonuses. The staff from check-in, to housekeeping, to the guy who fixed my broken stereo in my room were friendly and quick to get anything I wanted done. I was very impressed with how attentive they were. Honestly, I don't have a single thing to complain about it. Sure it is a little on the expensive side but having stayed at the Hyatt my first night for only about $40 less, I can say it is worth the extra cash.
