Delicious Cuban! Every time I go in here, I leave with my taste buds jumping for joy. Cafe 28 is a hot spot at night, make a reservation and you will be thankful! They offer a wide variety of apps, entrees and desserts ( i am always too stuffed when it's dessert time..can only imagine how yummy) A few times after a long day at work, we have gone in for a margarita and split a few appetizers. I highly recommend the coconut/curry shrimp, and the chorizo-stuffed dates that are wrapped in bacon. Cafe 28 is a great atmosphere for larger parties but it can get loud, so if you are looking to have meaningful conversations, grab it to go...you will not be disappointed.
