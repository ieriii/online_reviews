First things first...I love breakfast food. It's one of those foods that's pretty hard to get wrong, but when a place like yolk does breakfast very very right, it's amazing!This place is very modern and trendy; my roomate and I first ventured out here in hopes of stalking cute columbia boys, since that's pretty much the croud this place attacts. The decor is very modern, and all egg inspired; very kitschy and cute.Their portions are huge! Everything's so good that my roomie and I usually each ordre a plate and then share all the food...it's like our own personal breakfast buffet. Everything I've had there is delicous! Pancakes are awesome; omelts are very good too! They have some interesting juice flavors too.Unfortantly the wait for tables can get pretty long, which is to be expected with trendy south loop places, but the last time we were there we had to wait 15 minutes for service once we were seated. Fortuantly for Yolk, thier food is good enough to wait for.
