Great service (didn't rush us even though there was a line) and decent food but I'd expect a bit more tasty food in Pilsen. Prices are very reasonable and the flan is AMAZING but the taco and tostada was 'meh' and the chicken flautas were pretty bad. Best entree was by far the cheese enchiladas even though the cheese in the middle wasn't all the way melted. The guy behind us ordered 'el majico' or something that looked awesome and he said it wasn't on the menu. So order that if you want a giant, delicious-looking steak thing in a griddle pan.
