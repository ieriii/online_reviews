Amazing food. I had the seared scallops - they were a dream. Duck was cooked to perfection. Fries were outstanding. Prosciutto was top notch. Cons - my chardonnay was too acidic for my liking and the decor/seating is a bit strange. If I were not so picky about ambiance this place would be 5 stars. The food is perfection.
