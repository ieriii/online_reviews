This place adores jazz so much. But there is a pretty ugly side to this place. There are 3 unwritten rules especially in their "New Music" concerts, which strongly disfavors musicians who want to perform the Green Mill concerts "on the fly." For those musicians, you have to find other places to perform if you do not like those rules. So here they are: 1. Unless you are on the bill for the "New Music" concerts (these concerts are very strictly curated and cannot be changed), don't even think of touching that piano except for the post-concert jam. The piano there is extremely expensive to fix or repair or maintain, and is treated like a shrine. If you definitely have to touch the piano, you need consent of the owner. 2. The post-concert jams in the "New Music" concerts, which are mainly freeform improvisations of music, are limited to about 7 minutes or so. Going any longer is generally discouraged and and thus prohibited. 3. No unsolicited music performances especially during the "New Music" concerts. Unsolicited performances during the concerts is, to the owner, a very, very big turn-off because the owner says that it completely wastes time. Even if you are a renowned Chicago musician, you are not immune from this rule. 4. The owner reserves a complete and irrevocable right to disallow the "post-concert" jam at the Green Mill if such concerts is over 2 hours. If it is disallowed, any "post-concert" jam is null and void and hence cannot be done, and you must wait until the next "New Music" concert to do this. Violating these rules (especially rules 1-3) will subject anyone to immediate "powering off" of the music and automatic ejection. Violating rule #4 will also lead to a "power off" and automatic ejection. So, follow these rules and you are 70 percent of the way towards enjoying the music of the Green Mill.
