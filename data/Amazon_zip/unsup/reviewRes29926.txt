I work around the corner from this restaurant and they were even nice enough to let us keep a menu at our business to order carry out. I recently had lunch with one of my classmate/girlfriends and we both enjoyed the service. I will certainly make an effort to eat-in more often. Since it is in the south loop it is great for lunchtime since it is not super crowded in that area.
