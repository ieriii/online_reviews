Gluttony has a home and its name is Texas de Brazil! If you've never been to a Brazilian steakhouse then I don't even know where to begin. Waiters (Gauchos, supposedly they cook the meat as well) bring out uncut slabs of roasted meat (Beef, chicken, pork and lamb) to your table and then cut it onto your plate. Its all you can eat. Thats right. Steak until you are not physically capable of holding it in. I didn't see a sign posted but I'm pretty sure throwing up is frowned upon. There are 2 other Brazilian steakhouses in the downtown area and I've been to all of them. Fogo may have been the first but I find the ambiance at Texas to be just a little more intimate. Food wise, I can't tell the difference between the 3. Texas has been my favorite for one reason and one reason only. Coupons. If you go to their corporate website, you can sign up for their newsletter there and they will send coupons every few months. That's about all the meat I can take in a given year. I was just there this past Monday and we had a 50% off coupon. Same goes for a few months ago. Another 50% off coupon. So yah, coupons ftw.
