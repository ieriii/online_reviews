I really enjoyed myself here. Even though this is a chain and there are ton of other places to go, they just get it right here. We made reservations and requested a booth and after a small wait once we arrived (20 minutes), they were happy to oblige. The crab cakes were amazing, excellent wine and cocktails, great steak, and the service was pretty good although there was a few little glitches. Overall, great time and excellent food although I have to say that I found Capital Grille just a little bit better as a complete package.
