When Check Please was filming who's 8 months pregnant face got some screen time? Mine! My husband thought it was pretty awesome, but he wasn't the one wearing no make-up and with an extra gagillion pounds packed on. Sigh. Anyway, I love Irazu. So much so that the day I got married we chose this place as the spot to have a celebratory feast. The Oatmeal shake is of course yummy, the guacamole is great, and I have yet to have a vegetarian entree that I haven't enjoyed. Tons of meat options too so it's a nice place to go if you roll with a crew the includes both vegetarians and omnivores.  It can be insanely busy so I have had to make other dining arrangement a few times. That is why I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5.
