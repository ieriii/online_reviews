I'm finding it tough to review Tank Noodle... it had some great Pho (some of the best I've had), but its also hard to recommend when even better Pho is just down the block at Pho 888. Tank noodle will be better for large groups if that is what you need, its much bigger. It actually seems to be geared towards that, the majority of the tables are sized to fit about 8 people. It looks like it also may have a better selection of non-Pho Vietnamese food, though I haven't yet had time to try any. I guess its just awesome that in Uptown we have a bunch of options for great Pho.
