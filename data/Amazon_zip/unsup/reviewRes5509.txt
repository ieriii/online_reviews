This place has a different vibe than what you get at most place in Chicago. It's casual chic and the crowd is generally really laid-back and happy (for lack of a better word). Mostly young professionals and groups of friends. Food: much like tapas, they come in small portions so you can order several different kinds and share. I love pork belly and smears. Those were really good!! I must say, I didn't like the pork ears... there was little substance and I felt gross chewing on ear-shaped crispy ears. Presentation tends to be rustic and simple.  The space is really cramped so you're likely to share a table with strangers and get bumped into now and then. In general, I like to get out as soon as I'm done eating so that I can relax somewhere afterwards. Service is generally hectic but quick. I wouldn't say the waitresses are particularly friendly or eager to give you recos (they always look like they're in a rush) but it's not terrible. Overall, a decent and convenient place to grab a bite with friends.
