I've been to Calo's twice for lunch. I've been nothing but pleased with my meals. First of all the service is great. the waiter has been polite, advised of all specials, took our orders promptly and brought us our dishes quickly. I split my entree with my co-worker and we didn't have to do the work ourselves, the cooks made sure they were in separate dishes before they were brought to the table. The taste and temperature were excellent. I had no issues with too much sauce or not enough on either occasion that I've dined here. The prices are very fair, especially for a Chicago Restaurant. For three people, we split on lunch, had a salad and a cup of soup with nonalcoholic beverages for $35.00 a price I don't think can be beat. The best part is, this Andersonville establishment has it's own free parking lot so you don't have to use the pay box street parking!
