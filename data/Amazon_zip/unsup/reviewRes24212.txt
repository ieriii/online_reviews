In a word "AMAZING"! I love the north african feel - I knew they had it right when there was a slice of cucumber in the water! My favorite is the Icosium Crepe and the Chicago Crepe, though there are countless combinations if you want to build your own. The dessert crepes are AMAZING as well - one day they had a special for a brie and blueberry crepe.. I thought I had died and gone to heave it was so good!
