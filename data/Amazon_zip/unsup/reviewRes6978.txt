I've given this restaurant two tries with my wife and friends. The food has been less than average. The last time was the absolute most horrendous pretend Osso Bucca I've ever had. If you can't make a dish take it off the menu. Please don't bring me a plate of tasteless fatty slop and pretend that it's Osso bucca FEH!
