It's a good thing I don't live near here. And that the wait is crazy, 45 minutes for just 2 of us on saturday morning. Because the portions here are huge, and everything is just amazing. I had the eggs benedict, which was really tasty with great hollandaise sauce. And they certainly don't skimp on the hollandaise. I also had the pumpkin pancakes which were delicious. Very heavy and pumpkin-dense. And with this amazing cinnamon icing butter hybrid to spread on top. But top prize still goes to the white chocolate pretzel pancakes, I wish we'd had room to get some of those too...
