I enjoyed Giordano's - I took co-workers here for a Chicago pizza experience. I know that others have said Giordano's is not the *best ever* Chicago style pizza, but its location close to Millenium Park and its reputation made it a good choice at the time. My coworkers and I enjoyed it. The pizza was good. Also got a salad, which was more than enough food. I cannot complain, but I could also see how it is considered quite touristy. I can't, however, give it a bad review.
