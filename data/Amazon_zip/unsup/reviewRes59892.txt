After reading all the great reviews on yelp, I got a cake for my husband's 40th birthday party at Alliance. It was a 3D cake like they advertise on the website for a party of 60 people and I paid $450 in advance for it. I was happy to pay that much since the cake was a surprise and the design had sentimental meaning between us - and you only turn 40 once. The cake we got did not look at all like what I had ordered. It had icing running down and off the cake and the writing was smeared and unreadable. It looked terrible. I was so surprised and dissapointed for my husband that this was the cake wheeled out for him in front of all of his friends. This happened last summer and I still get bummed out thinking about that crappy cake we got.
