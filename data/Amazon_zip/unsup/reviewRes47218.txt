Yup, that's right, we ordered salads. For appetizer that is. Also, we shared a burger because A) we had plans to eat desert later and B) we didn't know any better. Tis was a 10 oz, medium cooked kobe beef patty, with caramelized onions, avocado and Swiss cheese on a pretzel roll. Angels were singing. This is a good good place. Fries and beer were involved - this goes without saying. Props to the cooks and the kind waitress who didn't charge us for the beers. Thank you life for being good to me.
