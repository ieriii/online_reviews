Great place for brunch - even if you have to eat at the bar. I went with a girl friend who generally asks the servers questions of the menu to make absolutely sure of her choices. This time, it proved to be worthwhile as we were vacillating between pancakes and wraps. Turns out you can have it both ways - we each got a wrap and an order of 1 of the delicious, dessert-like pancakes.  There was a bit of a wait to be seated, but Milwaukee is full of little, random stores in which to poke around whilst you wait.
