Almost 2 months to get a reservation here - and it was worth the wait. What can I say that hasn't already been said? If you love authentic Mexican food, locally grown (rooftop garden!) by amazing chefs, you will not be disappointed. My recommendations: * Guacamole * Trio of Ceviche * Cazuela de Tinga (pork shoulder braised with tomatoes, chipotle chiles, homemade chorizo, potatoes, diced avocado, queso fresco.) * Taquitos de Pollo Ahumado (taquitos filled with smoked chicken, black beans and poblanos, sour cream, salsa verde, anejo cheese, guacamole) * Flautas de Carnitas (taquitos filled with red chile pork carnitas and caramelized onions, arugula salad, Jack cheese) The menu changes, so these things may not be available all of the time. I would try the tapas portion of the menu so you can try a bunch of different dishes.
