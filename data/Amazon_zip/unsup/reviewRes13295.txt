Beer and brunch? Sold. We headed here on a Saturday morning for brunch and a tour. When we got there, it actually wasn't that full (we got there about 10:30), and we were seated right away. I decided to go for more of a lunch, so I had the Hombre Burger, which was really good. The portion was huge, and my husband ended up eating part of my burger too. He ordered the quiche, which he said was delicious. His one complaint was that his portion was tiny, and he was left not quite full. For drinks, I had a beer/lemon puree mixture. It was refreshing. My husband had a bloody mary, and he said it was one of the best. During our meal, we asked our server about the tour. He said it was free, first-come, first-served. We put our names on a list to sign up. We finished our meal with plenty of time, ordered a round of beer, and waited until the tour started at noon. The tour itself was brief, but informative. We got a tour of the building, including the brewing rooms. During the tour, we were brought a small sample of one of their beers. I think the whole tour only took about 25 minutes. I thought it was worth it.
