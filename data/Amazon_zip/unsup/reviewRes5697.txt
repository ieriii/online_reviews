Well, The Purple Pig definitely has a catchy slogan (Cheese+Wine+Swine) and Mag Mile location going for them, but how was the overall dining experience. I went here with a group of co-workers earlier this week and was highly anticipating my dining experience. The best way to experience The Purple Pig is too definitely order a bunch of small appetizers, starters, cheeses, encased (or non-encased) meats and try a bit of everything. I pretty much turned off my food knowledge and eat what was brought to us. Other than the beets & goat cheese dish (I anti-heart beets) everything else was really tasty. My favorites were the summer vegetable dishes, pork roasted almonds (yes, they made a veggie dish a meat dish) and especially the AWESOME desserts! I would have to say overall, I enjoyed my experience but may have not reached my irrationally high expectations. In the end, Cheese+Wine+Swine was just fine.
