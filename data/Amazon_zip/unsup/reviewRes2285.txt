Not that Hot Doug's needs an 82nd rave review, but I was so moved by my first visit there yesterday that I can't stop thinking about it. I did a special -- pork catalano with goat cheese and chipotle sauce (on a poppy seed bun, of course) and it was truly to die for. And I love that Doug himself still is the guy taking your order. Success hasn't gone to his head, apparently.
