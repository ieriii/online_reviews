After weeks and weeks of seeing lines outside of this trendy breakfast spot I finally decided to try it. I waited for quite a bit which I guess is pretty standard on the weekends and mornings. The breakfast food smelled delicious and was described to make my mouth water... but... not impressed. I have been to many other places in the city with WAAAAYYYY better food. I felt like I could have created pretty close to the breakfast plate I ordered as it was just standard. Also, the person who was with me ordered one of their famous Nutella Crepe's and the worst thing possible happened- mostly crepe, small amount of Nutella! Nothing is worse than cutting a crepe open to experience the bread with very little filling!  I had much bigger expectations for this place so I was very disappointed.
