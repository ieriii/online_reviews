Met my friend for a dinner to catch up before turkey day last week. Crowded and a bit loud, they have a small menu of food but it does offer some interesting variety. They have a 'vegetarian' menu...which is just the vegetarian items pulled into a separate menu. (Gee thanks for that) Pros --Unique drinks, fun atmosphere, beautiful interior design. Cons --Everything was just slightly above average on taste and portions for dinner very small. This is the first time I've actually almost finished an entree! Had the truffle pasta and it was approved portion size -- a bit more than a cup. Fine by me as I don't eat that much but I realize others may be disappointed by that. Here's the real Con -- our waiter was rude. Not just a little off the cuff but downright rude. He was short with us and impatient, at times rushed us and at others lingered too long and made a few off color remarks. I may have been an ill-fated attempt to flirt with my friend...reminiscent of the ignore and tease ways most 15 year olds favor. He looked a bit like Bud Bundy so if you're seated in his section get ready for some really bad old school flirting. There are quite a few places like this in the city, I think I'll get my overpriced Paloma and truffle pasta elsewhere.
