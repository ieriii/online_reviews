3 stars based on total group experience. I would probably give it 4 based on myself alone. I would like to say that it is definitely old school to the extreme. We had a wacky but nice and attentive waitress. Everyone starts with crusty Italian bread and pizza bread for the table...free. Each person at the table also received a brushetta appetizers to try. All of our food and drinks came out in a very timely matter. While everyone didn't love the food they ordered, everyone thought that it was decent. We all got soup and salad with the meal for no extra cost, which is amazing. While waiting for our dessert, the waitress brought out a platter of fruit. It contained cantaloupe, watermelon and grapes. Unfortunately, we didn't eat much of it because we were all stuffed and barely had room for dessert. Most of us shared the Baked Alaska, but others tried the cannoli(made to order), chocolate mousse cake and tiramisu. Out of the 10 dinners, only 3 had a soso experience. Everyone else said that they would definitely go back again. I thought the prices were reasonable based on the amount and quality of food that we received. I will definitely return and hopefully on Wednesday for Lobster Night!!
