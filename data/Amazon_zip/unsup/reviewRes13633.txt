I was meeting a married friend to catch up- IE- talk about all of the things she and her husband and child have been up to doing.  We chose Glenn's, and boy am I glad we did.  Glenn's provided the perfect amount of background noise, mix of other patrons, and food to keep me interested, smiling, and somewhat engaged.  I went for the Catch of the Day special- tillapia. With that (for 12.95) I had a cup, literally a mug, of clam chowder, a salad- and was full. Then came the plate of Tillapia and potato cakes. The potato cakes were awesome! I loved them. The tillapia was good, just a bit over seasoned for me. It also came with fresh asparagus. Um... if I would have had a clue I was getting so much food- I would have not eaten breakfast! My friend had the perch catch of the day special- with the cream of asparagus mug of soup, salad, and same trimmings. She commented that she liked it- but that it was a bit salty. Maybe it is just me, but I always find perch to be that way.  We were able to chat, catch up, enjoy the day, and not bee too distracted in this upscale dinner.  It is now on my list of places to try for brunch. I HAVE to try their crab cakes!
