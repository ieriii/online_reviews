By far the best Hot Dog stand in Chicago. It's a misnomer to call them a Hot Dog stand because they have so many other items that are AMAZING! Whoopercheesie, SuperSteak and the SuperChickenMidgees are also my favorites! The Super Onion Chips are 100x better than any onion rings you will ever taste.GREAT hours! Open till at least 1AM EVERY NIGHT (even the weeknights!)Super friendly staff that always seem to be a great mood!
