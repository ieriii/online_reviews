Spontaneity is my middle name. Ok. I lied. But I very recently had a spur of the moment getaway that was brief, yet very delightful.  The room was hot. Like whew-eeeeee!! I tried cranking the a/c but it didn't seem to come on. Just a little stream of air. Ugh.  Everything else was great.  The room was super clean. Carpet was spotless. And the bathroom...I could have lived in there! It was all marbley and sparkley.  How do hotels fold the sheets to make it look picture perfect I will never know, but I love that look. Maybe I'll practice on my bed at home.  The hotel boasts a prime Michigan Ave location which probably attracts a lot of business travelers and tourists. I'd prefer to stay at a smaller boutique hotel off the beaten path, but it was very quiet and the bed was dream worthy, so no complaints there.
