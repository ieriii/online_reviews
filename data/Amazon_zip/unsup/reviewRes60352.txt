While I am a native, I am a bit of a foodie and have traveled great distancesto have the best meals. I grew up eating pizza from places like King's over in Oak Park. I have had pizza while visiting Italy, and from coast to coast in the US. I have had deep dish from Lou Malnatti's, Gino's East, Pizzaria Uno, My Pi over on the east side and Giordano's. The best that I have ever had was Giordano's, hands down. I work in Louisiana and Giordano's is one of the things I miss most.
