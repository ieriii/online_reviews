My first thought was "wow, this is the EXACT opposite of any new york institution where they rush you in and rush you out as soon as you get in." There's a reason why Doug speaks to every customer about their days and the line moves at the speed it does. This system ensures every customer gets a seat to enjoy their dougs at their own pace; It's so nice that people aren't breathing down your back for your seats.  My favorite is the Chicago dog, everything, with hot peppers. I was able to try the duck fat fries and the regular fries and I preferred the regular fries. there was a line on a monday at 11:00 am there was a line on a saturday at 10:30 am there will always be a line.. but grab a friend you havent seen in a while and chat up a storm. it's a great way to catch up and the time will go by that much faster. it's worth it.
