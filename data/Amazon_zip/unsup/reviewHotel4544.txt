The Palmer House is well located and has the feel of an old time Chicago hotel, or at least what I would expect an old time Chicago hotel to feel like. One question I have is, who puts a train line in front of a hotel? Perhaps at some point it seemed like a good idea but the noise can be disturbing. Fortunately, from the rooms you can't really hear the L running by, at least I couldn't from the 10th floor. The lobby area is impressive. The ceiling murals are grand giving it the feel of someplace special. Cell coverage in the lobby area and in other parts of the hotel are very spotty. This hotel seems like a popular place for group gatherings so if you're looking for something intimate, you should look elsewhere. I was there for a wedding and the place was overrun. Apparently there where three other weddings going on at the same time. The rooms have been remodeled. I stayed here a couple years ago and the place was looking its age. Now the rooms have been painted and fixed up. The furniture is more modern. However, the rooms are on the small side. Also the hotel is shaped like a U so some of the rooms are shrouded in darkness. Ask for a room with a view if you like light. I didn't have a minibar in my room which was troubling. I can't complain about the price though. I found a really good rate online at the hilton site and with a AAA membership the total came to $143 a night!
