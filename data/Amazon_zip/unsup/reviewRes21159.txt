HELLO tortas. Brunch lines be damned, this is the morning-after emergency room prescribing ahogada, goat barbacoa, chorizo queso and cochinita pibil as a potent hangover cure for the masses. Wood-burning oven fired torta rolls are more upper crust than the wrinkly old ladies on foot patrol all over Madison Ave. above 57th Street. The pulled pork is legit; Rick Bayless I might have to go Agent Sands on you like Once Upon A Time In Mexico if your restaurants keep on having the pibil game locked down at this level. Face-meltingly hot habanero salsa is effectively remedied by cinnamon churros dipped in vanilla soft-serve, and the crowd goes wild.
