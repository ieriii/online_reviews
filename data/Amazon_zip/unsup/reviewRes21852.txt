I really like this place. Yes it's not the best hot dog I've ever had but it's pretty good and it's a fun ambience. Park yourself at one of the menu stations and wait for someone to ask you for your order. I love the supercheesie, superdawg and the superveggies. Don't love the fries as much. The superveggies are tasty and the corn one is the best! The Superdawg has this pickled green tomato that serves as a nice twist to the normal "chicago-style" dog. No ketchup anywhere in sight near my dog and that's a good thing. Love to come here in the winter because I don't have to get out of my car!
