Very good, close to excellent. Decor is world class and if I didn't know better I would think I was in French imperial Vietnam. Great black and white pics of Vietnam day to day life adorn the walls. The green foliage really freshens up the atmosphere. Everything I have ordered has been great especially the scallop salad.
