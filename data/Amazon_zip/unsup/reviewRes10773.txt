The reason it gets 4 instead of 5 is I didn't get the whole Piece experience yet..didn't try the pizza....basically I went there with a few work buddies to celebrate and all I have to say is the Karaoke is AMAZING. I love to sing and i use karaoke as my only creative outlet to pretend I actually am doing what I Love...that's a whole other story...but basically it's awesome being on the stage in front of a huge crowd, and the song selection is awesome.
