Mmmmm, Calo. Mmmmm, Calo. Mmmmm, Calo. If I say that enough, perhaps Penne Basilico will be delivered straight to my door....again. I've only eaten inside the actual restaurant one time. The decor is kind of odd. It looks very suburban mom and pop crossed with Olive Garden crossed with Carabba's. Who cares though. I am not there for the decor. I'm there for the delicious food and delicious it is! Good bread. Average salad. Fantastic entrees with very large portions. There's more than enough food for two meals. I've ordered takeout from Calo several times. Every single time, my food has been correct and piping hot. Seriously, how they keep the food so hot? Does the driver cook it in his car? Does he microwave it while in my stairwell? Whatever the answer is, I don't care. This is one of my standard takeout places. It's just plain good.
