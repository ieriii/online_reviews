My father-in-law found this place online while planning a special birthday dinner for my mother-in-law, and had no idea we would be so lucky to find The 3rd Coast. We were all visiting Chicago from WI & MN, and 13 (8 adults and 5 kids ages 4-11) of us went over Easter weekend...While we are all very happy with our meals, what struck me was the amazing variety. We spanned the globe with our selections; from chocolate chip pancakes for one of the kids to Chinese noodle soup to a Waldorf salad to Cajun chicken pasta to steak, everything was between good and excellent. This is the place to go when you have a group with diverse tastes!The service was excellent. The owner, Janet, made special arrangements to accommodate our large group and also was sensitive to the other guests; we were seated in the upper section and somewhat separated until the restaurant got busy. We had a guy for our server (can't remember his name) and he was very attentive.Finally the ambiance was perfect for our needs. Basically two open rooms it has an artsy, laid back feel that gets a little loud when full. Great neighborhood spot off the tourist track, and worth the effort to visit.
