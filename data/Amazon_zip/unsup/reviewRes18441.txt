Bottom line, come here to drink and avoid the food and you won't be disappointed. Bad Apple's selection of craft beer rocks and they also have a good amount on tap as well. As far as the food goes, well it sounds amazing on the menu. The group i was with ordered several of the 12 burgers they have on the menu but when I asked to substitute the texas toast for the pretzel bun, I was denied. Come on if you have it in the back let me put it on my burger. That should of been a sign right there that it was going to disappoint. The pulled pork on the burger was flavorless and dry, the burger alone was ok but it wasn't anything better then I could of cooked on the BBQ at home. I couldn't even eat the entire thing I ended up passing it to a friend to finish off. I saw on yelp a few people talking about a game room. Well the game room is a sad room behind the bar, I wouldn't call it a game room but rather a room with a game in it. One Foosball table doesn't equal a game room! Although maybe they've improved that since I was there about two months ago. Service and prices were ok nothing good and nothing bad. In the end if you're looking for a place to drink then this is great but move on if you're looking for food.
