The salad bar won't disappoint -- try the risotto, it's killer. But don't fill up too much there. Save some room for the mind-blowing meats. It's hard to play favorites, really. Everything is just awesome. Service is another story though. While there are plenty of people walking around with food, the waiters will absolutely not pay you any attention. We had to ask for things several times before someone finally remembered to bring it. I'm not even making strange requests -- things like the check, an extra spoon, another napkin, etc. Go there hungry. Leave there poor but satisfied.
