I'm in love....with everyone that works at Simply It! I don't think I have ever encountered such friendly people. I want to keep going back just because everyone there is so nice! It's like going home to family! The first time I went to Simply It, I found the food that I ordered to be just okay. I think it may just be a matter of preference since I ordered fried rice with chicken. I expected small pieces of chicken to be in the fried rice but instead a giant slab of grilled chicken was on top of the fried rice. The dishes that my friends got were really good though. I decided to try Simply It for a second time tonight. I walked in and a sweet old man greeted me and hustled me out of the cold. I told him that I wanted an order to-go and he handed me a menu, sat me at a table and handed me warm cup of ginger tea, telling me to stay warm. Someone came by and put a magazine on the table, offering me reading material while I waited. I ordered the Asian vegetables with crispy noodles and it was ready in less than 10 minutes. After I finished the tea and they offered me more. I paid with my Discover Card (which is huge plus since it's 5% back at Restaurants month). As I left everyone there thanked me and told me to have a good night (in a really sincere way). When I got home, I found another package besides my noodles. To my surprise there was fresh fruit: grapes and cut oranges (about 2.5 oranges worth). The noodles were delicious and were cooked with bok choy (my favorite); the fruit was a refreshing dessert. Thanks Simply It!
