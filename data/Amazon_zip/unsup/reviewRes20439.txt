Seriously good sushi. While I can't vouch for the in-house dining experience, I can say my delivery experiences have been generally positive. At first, I was really skeptical about ordering sushi for delivery, but even then it was good! Only drawback is the price; they are hands-down the most pricey option for sushi in my area, and their prices went up AGAIN just last month. $80 for sushi for two? C'mon. There are other places out there with comparable sushi at prices that won't give you sushi bill remorse afterwards.
