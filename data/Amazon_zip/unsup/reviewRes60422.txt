Had a family birthday dinner last night. Fun looking spot, cute area of the city, nice menu. Our service was so bad, we would never come back. We were a table of 8 people....most servers would see dollar signs and know they could keep the drinks and food coming. Our server just kept dissappearing. He also brought out the food in a crazy order so people could not all eat together. Food was pretty good, but not good enough to offset the service.
