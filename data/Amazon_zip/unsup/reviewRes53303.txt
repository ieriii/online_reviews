I've been here at least a dozen times and every time it keeps getting better, sure a Chicago style hot dog is the same everywhere you go, but the different varieties that are offered, the Duck dog, the wild boar, the crawfish, and all other rotational dogs are great. Only problem I have is that it's cash only and there is always no matter what time you go a line that you have to wait for at least 30 min. Really sucks if it rains. Other than that the food is great, the owner is always in a good mood and it's very clean. I always recommend this place to my friends
