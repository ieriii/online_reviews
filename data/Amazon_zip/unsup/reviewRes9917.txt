So delicious and such an enjoyable experience. Next time we will absolutely request to sit outside, which as others have said, looked divine. Here were the highlights: 1. Attentive, knowledgeable waitstaff. Service was on the slower side but not out of negligence, more out of respect for time between meals and I believe it added to the whole European feel. Attention to detail was really appreciated -- several other staff, including the manager, stopped by our table to refill drinks, clear plates, see if we needed anything despite the fact that our waiter was on top of it. 2. Antipasti special was absolutely incredible. I rarely eat meat and made an exception for the Prosciutto, which we could see being carved in an open preparation table. So worth it. Huge variety of roasted veggies, generous chunks of cheese, and house olives. Very impressive-looking spread. 3. GLUTEN FREE! I'm always wary about Italian places, but not only do they have 2 gluten free pastas that they can use in any of their sauces, but all their salads are GF, and the risotto special, which was prepared with Porcini mushrooms, was sinfully delectable and completely gluten free. Our waiter was also completely familiar with GF options, which made it clear to me that this was something they deal with often. 4. While I obviously couldn't have it, the pizza looked beautiful and was apparently some of the "best in the city". 5. Lastly, the prices are reasonable for the quality -- I was actually shocked at how low the total bill was for how happy we were. AND it has great service, nice ambiance, amazing food, but doesn't feel stuffy or pretentious. Will be going back very soon...
