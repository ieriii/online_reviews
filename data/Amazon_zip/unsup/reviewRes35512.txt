3.5 STARS----Good, but definitely not Hugos quality. Wifey & I went here for our 4 year anniversary---Yeah, yeah, the Vegas oddsmakers lost on this bet. Should've taken the over, right? Nevertheless, Shaw's has a "fishy" vibe. Not nearly as upscale as I thought it would be, so we were...well, slightly overdressed. For starters, we ordered the Alaskan King Crab bites---not bad, but too much cartilage. Wifey had the Swordfish---kinda' overcooked & dry. I had the Halibut, which actually was tasty, but not worth the price ($30)? Service---well, our low-rent, portly server was...slow, lazy, and...FAKE! She was tipped accordingly:) *On a positive note (eternal optimist here), the martinis were superb! I may return, just to try the oyster / sushi bar...maybe?
