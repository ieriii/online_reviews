LOVE.THIS.PLACE. obsessed with the stewed beans and pork under a corn tortilla that they give FOR FREE at the beginning of the meal. LOOOOVED my friend's beef stew. it was $6. are you kidding me? I can't get a burrito for $6 in lakeview. Loved both salsas. AND THE TORTILLA CHIPS FRIED IN LARD!!!!!!!!!!!! I wish I'd known they were BYOB before I went but no worries because I'll be back at least once a week from now on. Did i mention this place has the best prices I've ever seen?!?!?!
