I was born and rasied in Bridgeport, and over the past few years, this neighborhood has had alot of developments from new homes to restaurants. I only went here once, for dinner. For a veggie, they don't have the most options, but the several that they do have is amazing. I had the wild mushroom crepes and it was delish!!! My cousin and I also had the watermelon salad. The goat cheese was never a favorite, but aside from that, it was pretty good. We also had some fries, which was amazing. I could definitely taste the major difference. We also had table bar desserts, which was also very good considering it wasn't very sweet, which is something we take into consideration. I'm not big on sweets. Aside from the food, the service was very friendly and helpful! -- which is very important! I will definitely go back, hopefully I'll get to try their breakfast soon!
