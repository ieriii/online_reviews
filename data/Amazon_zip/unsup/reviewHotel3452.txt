The Allerton has a slick interior and accommodating staff. Although the building was old, they had obviously sunk a good amount of money renovating the rooms and lobby areas... if only some of that money had been used to better insulate the rooms. I may be slightly biased because I was stuck in a room directly across from the elevators during a completely sold out weekend... but I could hear every single word of every single conversation every single person had while waiting for the elevator at all hours of the night. Awesome. The rooms were a little small, but compared to a "boutique" hotel in, oh let's just say Boston, they were really not bad. Considering the price of the rooms, I feel like they could probably offer free wi-fi but nothing to split hairs over. The gym however, was wonderful. 2 full rooms, 3 treadmills, 2 bikes and a stair machine. 3 weight machines, mats in a mirrored room, free weights and weight benches... all with a nice view of the city. The only complaint is that the two water coolers were empty for the entire 5 days I was there. I would consider staying here again.. if given a different room, I might even be persuaded to give them an additional star.
