I have been to Lockdown about a dozen times since i've moved about 3 blocks away in Ukrainian Village in May 2010. At first, i would go to other establishments on Western and see Lockdown and assume that it was another lame bar much like the ones up and down division nearby. A few months ago, I was trying to find a bar with a food and drink special that was decent and came across the menu at Lockdown. It looked amazing, and about 10 minutes later we went to the bar, and had a great experience. The burgers are incredible. Ponzi Scheme in particular is absolutely amazing with Apples, provolone and prosciutto, three of my favorite things. They have all my favorite beers either on tap or available in bottle including Dead Guy Ale, Leffe Blonde, etc, and the staff are always very kind and welcoming, complete opposite of what my experiences at bars with a similar theme have been. In fact, every time i've had to wait for a table more than a few minutes they comp a drink for you, which definitely influences my desire to return. I've never had to wait more than about 10 minutes until recently when I was with a party of 3 and we had to wait about 30 minutes, partially because we wanted a table rather than sitting at the bar. I think one of the waitresses could tell we were getting antsy if not a little frustrated, and kept giving us updates which is much appreciated. As mentioned early, the staff are always so friendly, which is a complete contrast to other bars with somewhat similar clientele such as Exit, Delilah's, and even Empty Bottle across the street. And that's why i keep going back.
