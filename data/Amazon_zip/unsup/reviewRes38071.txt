Chicago pizza just isnt my thing, and Giordanos is not even one of the better chicago pizzas. Too much everything. Too much crust, too much sauce, and just smothered (strangled really) with WAY too much cheese, and im someone who has never said the words "too much cheese" in one sentence before. I'll pass.
