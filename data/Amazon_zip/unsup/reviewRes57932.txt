Went here for dinner on an early weeknight, and we were totally impressed. From service to food to saying goodnight, everything was fantastic. Little Bucharest Bistro is a great place for date nights but it has a great family vibe as well! I loved the Saganaki for appetizers, Gnocchi for entree with braised short ribs, the meat was cooked more than perfectly, it just fell right apart; amazing! And for desert apricot crepes! The owner Branko is good enough reason just to go and chat about their place, very nice family. I suggest it!
