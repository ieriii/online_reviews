My girlfriend and I were looking for a new burger joint to try, and we came upon RJ Grunts on Yelp. The place was packed, but we were able to get in right away.  The restaurant has a laid back feel with 70's hits in the backdrop. They have a funny story describing how each item of the menu came to be. The food was good... the cottage fries were awesome. The service was absolutely first rate. Overall I would have to rate the total experience a 5 out of 5.
