Yeah, I know this is an institution and all, but I was let down. Maybe I should have come for brunch and gone for the pancakes. But, I ended up here for a late lunch on a weekday and found the sandwich menu to be somewhat boring and unappealing. The salads were the same. I ended up getting an omelet, which was fine, but nothing special. I also found it odd that they have both "gorgonzola" and "blue cheese" as options for the omelet on the menu. When I asked the waitress (who was very sweet) why this was the case, she responded that gorgonzola is "just the white part of blue cheese while the blue cheese option is both the blue and white parts." ----WHAT?!@??!?!?!@# ---Clearly someone has never had gorgonzola cheese.
