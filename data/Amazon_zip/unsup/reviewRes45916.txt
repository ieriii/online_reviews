From the makers of The Cheesecake Factory comes... Food that actually tastes good!!! I hate the regular Cheesecake Factory. I've never understood the hype with that place, so imagine my surprise when, AFTER leaving Grand Lux, I found out that they're owned by the same people. I had a club sandwich...tasted like "buttah!" And I know what you're thinking, "It's not hard to mess up a sandwich." Trust me...it is. Then came dessert...and basically the star of the show. My wife had beignets and I had an apple tart. I was full before dessert came and I sat there for an hour until I finished mine and hers. It was one of those meals that you know you'll never have again so you just accept that you'll have a Maalox moment later. We sat by the window and the snow fell just as our food came. She submitted my nomination for husband of the year at that moment. "A nice romantic dinner overlooking magnificent mile."
