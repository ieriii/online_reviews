Such a great group of people! Food is wonderful and their staff is attentive. Food has a wide range of Italian flair. Its not just pasta and meatballs! There are also 3 truly different dining environments: the bar area/the dining room/outdoor seating. Def try any of the pizza's for an appetizer. We also loved the griglia mista. And you can't go wrong with the short ribs!
