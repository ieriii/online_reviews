We went here the other night hoping to enjoy the fireplace warmth people talked about, but the library area is pretty small and it's hard to snag a spot there. Still, our party of four was very cosy in a booth. It took about 20 minutes to get seated on a busy Saturday evening, which wasn't bad at all since we waited at the bar -- but they apologized for the delay anyway. Most of what I ate was fried, and fried well. :-) The onion rings at Wilde are awesome -- they won compliments from my onion-loving friend who doesn't usually like to sully her favorite vegetable with batter -- and the fish and chips are similarly well done. Crisp and good. The coleslaw served with my fish and chips was pretty blah, though. My husband ordered a special, stuffed rainbow trout (I can't remember for the life of me now what it was stuffed with), and was quite pleased. Service was cheery. It's pretty loud in there, though, so not the best place for an intimate dinner.
