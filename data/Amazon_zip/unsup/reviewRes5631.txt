The food is excellent and the wine is even better. This is one of those wonderful places where you can get wonderful pairings of food and wine - a wonderful and complete gastro experience. I am not so crazy about the open and cramped seating but that is part of their cache. I am all about the food anyway, and this place does not disappoint fine foodie types. It is a bit on the pricey side, so for that reason, it has tough competition in that price point and I that's the reason I gave it 4 stars.
