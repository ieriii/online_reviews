I went with a friend, we each ordered a meat. About 25 dishes of sides came out and a big platter of raw meat. A few seconds later a flaming hot pot/grill of charcoal came out and the fun began. Service could have been friendlier, but the meal was quite good. I wish I lived closer, and was within walking /stumbling distance because I would love to get this on my way home from a night of drinking. 10am - 3am 7 days a week is pretty amazing for something like this. I will go here again.
