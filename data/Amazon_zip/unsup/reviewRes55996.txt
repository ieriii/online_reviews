Definitely a good neighborhood restaurant. I live just a few blocks away and I can always count on it for a good burger or fish fry. Not very parking friendly area and does not have valet. Been here a couple of times and food is consistent and service fast and friendly. I would categorize it as a .. gastropub. Upscale bar with great food! Not really great for celebration dinners but great casual neighborhood restaurant with a kitchen with talent.
