Mashed potatoes and bacon white pizza. Enough said. I absolutely love Piece. Amazing pizza (I don't typically care for "new york" style, I'm a deep dish guy all the way). With a good size selection of ingredients, including meatballs, anchovies, mashed potatoes and lots more, it's hard to choose. The right combination is key though. Don't over load or else it won't work. This hipster style place (just how I like it!) has a decent amount of tvs, a full bar and lots of space for small or bigger groups. They open the windows in the summer and it's a great place to spend Sundays. They have a large pie and growler (take out only) for like $25. Amazing deal. Amazing beer. They rotate some of their taps with the seasons so I suggest finding your way here each season. Staff is always friendly and helpful, right there when you need a new beer.
