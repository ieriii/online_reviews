You have to love the live band Kareoke. Being one of the 5 worst singers on earth, what better way to showcase it than on a Saturday night in front of 100 strangers? Drink up a pitcher of their excellent house made beer aka liquid courage, and get up on the stage. Show up at 11 or you're not getting on the list. Order a yummy pizza while you wait! Final step, make an idiot of yourself!
