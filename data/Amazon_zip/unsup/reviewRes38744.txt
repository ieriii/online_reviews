If you love trying new beers, you will love Hopleaf. There will almost inevitably be a long wait for seating at dinner, but head upstairs to the (cash-only) bar and start the night out with a couple of fabulous brews and good conversation. Once you get seated, continue the brew fest as you drool over the incredibly extensive beer menu (so good that if they published it, we would buy a copy...) And it's true, CB&J is the perfect dinner to soak up the hops.
