Am I in Ann Arbor? That's what it feels like here. It's a brew pub. I liked the beers I tried. Food is best of its kind for the immediate zone (i.e. better than Logan, rivals Rocking Horse). The communist fist bar columns are pretty cool. When this place gets over its newbie hype it may be pretty chill. Right now its a mad house. Good place for grub, but if you're looking to drink head across the street to Cole's.
