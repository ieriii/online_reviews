This was great, and $60 for the three (five) courses is really reasonable. I'll definitely be back. First, we changed our reservation a couple days before coming from 6 people to 8. They were super accomodating. I had scallop (with grape and verjus) as my starter. It was perfectly cooked. The passion fruit granita was nice, not necessary, but nice. My main course was rabbit...spring on a plate. It was served with peas, pea shoots, and these fabulous gnocchi that had truffle in them. It was great. We were then served an extra little grilled cheese sandwich with a pour of matched white wine. It was great too, though it didn't quite work that I stopped drinking my glass of red wine so that i could drink their glass of white wine...and then go back to my red. No matter. My dessert was corn. Yes, corn. I loved it! It was some sort of corn cake, served with corn ice cream as well as corn and caramel corn. It was really terrific, though, as the waiter said, "you really do have to like corn for this one". Service was friendly and attentive, but not overbearing. I'm so happy Dale has found such a great home and is making a success of it!
