We came here for dinner and my stomach and my wallet both left empty after leaving this restaurant. The food: Four stars for flavor The portions: Two stars The price: Two stars The service: Four stars I know tapas are small plates, but this was ridiculously small. We shared our tapas between two people and ended up with one bite per person! We started off with the complimentary garlic and tomato bread. It was delicious. The biggest portioned dish out of our entire meal! Next was the bacon wrapped dates. Total four dates, two per skewer. Flavor was excellent. We continued on with the Shellfish Croquettes. Five little tiny shellfish on top of a bed of rice. Surprisingly, this was very good. It was something in the rice.... We then tried the butternut squash dumplings. These were OUTSTANDING!!! My favorite dish of the night! There was only three small pieces!!!! I wish there were more.... For substance, we ate the shrimp, chorizo, and garbanzo bean puree flatbread. I made sure to drink lots of water, hoping this would expand and fill my stomach! To end, we ordered a cake with plum sauce and almond ice cream. It was the least memorable part of our meal. Four tapas, one dessert, and one martini was over $80. After we left, I wanted to hit up Dairy Queen for some dinner. One last thing....make sure to head upstairs for the restaurant. The bar is at the bottom and there is a podium that looks like a hostess should be standing there, but no one will ever come. We stood there for a while and no one attended to us.
