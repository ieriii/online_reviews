The food was spectacularly mediocre. I went there today with my mom on my day off after a big move to North Center. We split the Denver Omelet and potatoes. The waitress was nice enough, came when needed, not too annoying. Really, I can't even say THAT much about this place. The decor was colorful, filled with Roosters everywhere, which added a cute aspect but not a place I will frequent.. frequently.
