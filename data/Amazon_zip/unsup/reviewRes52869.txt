For our second outing of the Summer Supper Club, we met up at 90 Mile Cafe in Logan's Square for some cuban food before going to watch the Bulls game at a bar down the street. Obviously I'm a tad behind on my reviewing, for shame. Their BYOB policy was new to me but I'm not very cultured... you can have them whip up a pitcher of mojitos and you add your own rum to it when it comes to your table. SOLD. Also, learned that Captain Morgan mojitos still taste good but your drink looks like swamp water. Appetizing. In addition to the booze, we started with an order of Choripan, chorizo topped bruschetta. Unfortunately, my bite was the half leftover after my darling husband gnawed off his, but even so it was good and spicy. The empanadas some of the others ordered looked delicious and y'all know I'm a sucker for anything with goat cheese. I got the Vaca Frita dinner plate which was Braised beef slow roasted in grilled onions and pan fried, which made it tender but a little bit crispy and not swimming in juices. Bryan got the Bistec and that chimichurri sauce was fantastic. Plantains were cooked perfectly. Why do I not consume plantains on a daily basis? Also, loved the decor. Typewriters on tables? Sure, why not.
