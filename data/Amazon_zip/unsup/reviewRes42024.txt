I thought this was a cool place to grab a drink. I really like the ambiance... It has those lightbulbs that ever hipster bar has these days.. When you go in and look at them you'll say, "yep, that dude on yelp was right. Them there are hipster bulbs" Eat at mercado then make your way down here for a beverage or few.
