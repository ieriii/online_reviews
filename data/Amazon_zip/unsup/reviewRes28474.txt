Definitely a restaurant for the experience, not necessarily to eat to your heart's (or stomach's) content. We got the small tasting menu, 5 courses. Everything was delicious. Bursting with flavors, simple, but rich, and enough to taste and eat that I felt full but not that "I stuffed myself cause I ate so much" full. I'm actually not a fan of the truffle popcorn. Too strong. Then we were served a palate cleansing watermelon and jalapeno oil shot. The brioche twinkie with mascarpone with the caesar salad was awesome. The corn bisque was delicious. All of the meat dishes were good and perfectly complimented by the sauces and sides. The chocolate cake was good, but I found the cherries to be overwhelmingly tart. Everything was served to be eye-pleasing also, so that made it fun. On a Tuesday evening the place was dead. Different waiters brought out every course but they were able to explain all of the many things going on on each plate. There was a fly and some other bug flying around the restaurant. The music was also really loud, especially given that there was pretty much no one there. We didn't get coffee until we finished dessert, surprising, since there was barely anyone there. The whole experience was mediocre, but the food, if you want a tasting menu, was really good.
