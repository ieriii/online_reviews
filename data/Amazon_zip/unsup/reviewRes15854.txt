Incredible food, but poor service. I would really like to give 5 stars; the restaurant is beautiful and the food was excellent and reasonably priced. However, the service was lacking. I had an 8:30 reservation, but we weren't seated until just after 9 pm and when we were seated there were open tables clearly visible, so I did not understand why we had to wait. The server took our drink and appetizer order, but it took her 15 minutes to come back again. There was just a lot of uncomfortable and unnecessary wait time. Because the food was so great, I will give them another chance. I just won't try to make any plans for later in the night.
