Being two poor college students this is considered a "special occasions" only spot for my boyfriend and me. So on our two year anniversary, after we saved up some cash, we trekked over here to get some good grub. We were not disappointed! This place was amazing! We had reservations for 7pm and were seated by 7:02pm. The prices were actually a lot more reasonable than we had anticipated which was also a great perk. I ordered the prix fixe menu of a 10 oz New York strip and the house salad plus a dessert for $20. Yes, $20 for all that! What's more, I loved every single bite. The pumpkin cheesecake was like heaven in every little bite. And on top of that, the waiter (who asked earlier if we were there for any special occasion) had the staff write "happy anniversary" in raspberry sauce on my dessert plate. Too cute! And very yummy! It is definitely a place we will return for our special occasions and maybe even just when we're craving amazing steak.  Only downside, the waiter was running a bit slow with the service. Nothing absurd, but could use a tiny bit of improvement
