WTF. I can't believe nobody ever took me to Mercat for brunch before this weekend and I've been in the city for a whole TWO YEARS. This place is amazing! Well, outside of the fact that they don't believe in opening doors. I literally wandered around for fifteen minutes trying to figure out how to get in before giving up and going to the Starbucks. Turns out that even though there are doors that say "Mercat a la Planxa" from the outside, you actually have to go in the main entrance of Blackstone, and then take the stairs up on the right.  The space is airier than I expected -- maybe I've spent too many frightful nights at Ba Ba Reeba being jostled by waiters from all sides. As soon as we sat down, the server welcomed us and told us we were welcome to the buffet. The charcuterie was AMAZING... the tenderloin was literally perfect. The person behind the counter also introduced us to all the cheeses. In addition to this, there is a dessert table full of luscious cakes and tarts and fruits.  AND THEN... we came back to the table to find out that we actually get ALL the tapas on the prix fixe menu, starting with a delicious eggs benedict. Eight good-sized tapas later, I am stuffed. I wanted to lie down on the table and take a nap. Spanish omelets (POTATOES! AND SPINACH!), biscuits with manchego and bacon, pork belly... All this for $25? Add a $8 all-you-can-drink assortment of mimosas, sangrias and bloody mary bar... and you've got yourself an incredibly decadent three-hour brunch. OMG. I'm drooling just remembering it. So the only thing that doesn't make it five stars is the fact that they charged us $5 for tea. I mean, I'm all for restaurants making money and everything, but really, that was the most egregious upcharge I've ever seen in my life.
