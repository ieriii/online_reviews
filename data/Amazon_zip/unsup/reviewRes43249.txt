When you move out of your comfortable neighborhood, you quickly realize the wonderful little gems that you miss!!! This is one of those little neighborhood gems. I recommend if you go to eat in, then go early....especially on a week-end or do as I did and carry out. I ordered two sandwiches to go: Turkey Reuben and the Tuna Melt. The Turkey Reuben was delicious however the tuna melt was dry, way more cheese than a mouse requires and super soggy. Friendly and helpful staff, you will wait a bit for your food but most of it is worth a little wait. Be aware, if you eat in, you will wait in a very long line to order....just in case, you have been warned. Great neighborhood joint but not as great as I remembered....parking is on the street and most of that area has permit parking.
