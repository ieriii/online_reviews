I only seem to review restaurants for the breakfast menu. I love breakfast. This place rates right up there near the top of my list. The prices are a bit high for breakfast. The selection is very broad. Took me almost 1/2 a cup of coffee before I decided what to order. I ordered the strawberry stuffed french toast. Yummy and the strawberries were fresh. My friends ordered the spicy flamingo and the honey, nut pancakes. Everyone loved their food. The waitress, Christina, bent over backwards to help us -We kept asking about our neighbor's food -everything looked so great. I may order the granola with yogurt next time - it looked fabulous.
