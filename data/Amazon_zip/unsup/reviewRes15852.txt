My most FAVORITE restaurant in Chicago. Yelpers, that is a big declaration. In a website in which I review food, to declare one as my MOST favorite is a big deal. Take a seat, sit back, and read the top five reasons why you should go here. 1. The food is awesome. I always try to order something new whenever I revisit a restaurant, but this is one of those places where the thing you had the first time is way too good to try something else. That being said, I've had my fair share of eating off other's plates and hence, I feel as if I can honestly say everything I've tried here is AWESOME. My favorite item is the Pollo: "Peruvian style chicken, potatoes, green beans, olives,queso fresco, aji amarillo sauce" (straight from the online Carnvale menu) The chicken is juicy, full of flavor, and the accompanying sides are paired perfectly. The fiance usually gets some sort of beef and it's always tender and full of yummy flavor. 2. The atmosphere is ALWAYS fun. The decorations are great, bright and full of color. Perfect for a fun dinner night with friends or for a romantic meal with the significant other. 3. The sangria is top notch. Sometimes I'll try a mojito or another cocktail but this the sangria is always a staple. Full of juicy fruit and alcohol, I wish I could always have a pitcher of this treat in my fridge. 4. They cater to really large parties. I recently went with a group of 14 girls. Not a problem whatsoever. This place is huge. A family friend just got back from a wedding reception there and the pictures are WONDERFUL. If I could afford to host my wedding reception there, I totally would. The colors painted a gorgeous backdrop and everyone raved about the food. 5. It's a different dining experience. I always feel like it's not just a dinner and I'm not just there to simply fill my stomach. I'm there to ENJOY myself and have great food, great drinks, and a really fun time. Whenever I have friends or family in town, I make it a point to take them here.
