Found Nana via OpenTable two days ago and they looked great. I placed the reservation and asked whether they could offer some kind of dessert with a candle for a delayed birthday celebration. Because that was an important aspect of my making the reservation, I placed a call to the restaurant to confirm the special request - the reservation was just a few hours later and I needed the new experience to be on-point. I was told that that the dessert deal could be done. Our Nana 1st-timer experience was very pleasant; great food. We had the fried green tomatoes (the tomatoes were a bit less cooked than we prefer and the popcorn sauce was a tad nondescript). The andouille sausage had a sassy 'kick' to it. The pork shoulder meal with poblano grits - awesome, Soft crab meal - great, Kids chicken tenders-great.  Follow-up on birthday dessert with candle - terrible. Didn't happen and the waitress didn't seem terribly bothered by the omission. The table was cleared after our meal but no dessert as requested followed. The waitress brought a regular dessert menu to the table, so we ordered two desserts TO GO (big hint waitress; still waiting for the birthday dessert / candle!) because they looked great and we could enjoy them later. The desserts we ordered were bagged and delivered to the table. I whispered a reminder to the waitress, trying to preserve the last vestige of a surprise ending to a very good meal. But, alas, no birthday dessert delivery. Then came the bill - $126 for the 2 1/2 of us (we're okay with that) AND I still paid a full tip! I took the time to bring it up to a staff member on the way out as an FYI. The owner came over to find out what had happened. Nice gentleman but offered a very weak apology and no attempt at any service recovery. Really! Not a deal breaker though; we'll go back at least one more time! So in my 'best' Top Chef restaurant wars imitation: Back of house - Grade A, Front of house - Grade C-.
