HEY YOU VEGAN! You too can get love at Calo. Yes, the very same Calo that people talk about with those glazed eyes that hearken back to their last pork rib & cheese coma! Ok, maybe that's not so appealing to you. Let's just get to bidness. Their Veg Delight pan pizza rocks ass, and the thin crust is pretty good too, but it's not their specialty. The focaccia is really good. Good enough to make you tug on a waitperson's sleeve to ask for another basket please. Good enough to order in and toast yourself in the broiler so that it tastes like it does in the restaurant. The house salad's just ok, but if you're really aching for some iceberg, it'll do the trick. Lastly, I have *never* had a crummy martini here. After you're done, you'll be fully carb-loaded for hours of jukebox madness at Simon's down the street. That is, if I haven't yet already loaded half my paycheck into it.
