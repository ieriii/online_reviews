The only reason this place is not getting a 5 star is because I am convinced that it is the sole reason I gained 5 lbs while visiting Chicago but oh so worth it. I know there is a battle over who in Chicago has the best deep dish pizza but when I asked all the locals who had the best, they all pointed in this direction. They did not steer me wrong. A-mazing. I love that even though there is a wait (and why wouldn't there be), you can order so it's practically ready when you get seated.
