"Korean meets Fried Chicken meets Mexican" This place is almost always bumping. Sometimes its so busy, all three of their order phone lines are off the hook. What makes this place different is the re-imagination of dishes what we are familiar with. There are two that would serve as the most popular orders: Fried Chicken and Bibimbap. The chicken is made to order and when put together is part of the same bird versus the assortment stuff. There are three sauces that you can get: Seoul Sassy (kinda sweet and sour), Crisp BBQ, and Bud's Buffalo. Now they might be what you think they are but they all have a spin to it. After many tries, Bud's Buffalo is my fav. If you are aiming for a different kind of asian fusion CrIsp might be what you are looking for.
