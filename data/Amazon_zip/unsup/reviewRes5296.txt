We came to this restaurant before going to a show at the Chicago Theater. Though it's crowded we got there early enough to snag two seats at the bar right across from the stove. It was very enjoyable to see the chefs at work...and they worked hard and fast! We tried a lot of different items including the fried deviled egg (so rich and delicious), the beets, the brussel sprout salad, the bone marrow, a cheese plate, and a beautiful Tempranillo. Everything was wonderful, the service was great and I would 100% go back. I have nothing bad to say about this place!
