4 1/2 Stars - Gilt really is delicious and they have definitely upped their game in the service department. The mussels entree is just divine - the sauce is delicate and memorable. I will also add that their gimlet is amazing. I only hope that next time I have enough room to try the coconut pie - which looks absolutely sinful!
