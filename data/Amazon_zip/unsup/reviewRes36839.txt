I love finding cute little neighborhood places for a casual brunch or lunch. Since moving to the West Loop I haven't had the chance to explore many restaurants until recently.... and when I was taken here I was looking forward to it, based on what I had previously heard, and it did not disappoint. We went for a late lunch on a Saturday and only had to wait under 5 minutes to be seated. It isn't a huge restaurant, but seemed to keep things moving. Everything on the menu is reasonably priced - and the menu is HUGE! We really took a while to figure out what we wanted because of all the good sounding choices. Two of us had lunch, one had brunch. The lunches we had were good, but I did take a bite of the person's meal who got the strawberry stuffed french toast and it was a little over the top for me. But they really enjoyed it. Service was friendly from the moment we walked into the restaurant. Oh, and I tried my friend's juice and it was great.... I just wasn't in the mood for spending $6 on a drink.... but I'll probably get one another time. I cannot wait to return for brunch!
