Sapori Trattoria is straight up decent, but nothing stellar. I dined there with my boyfriend on a Saturday night, and was instantly charmed by the ambiance - a very comfortable space! The food, however, was nothing to write home about. We ordered the Crostini di Avocado, which was nicely executed. I had the Spaghetti Barese (spaghetti and meatballs with sausage) which was okay - the sauce didn't have a ton of flavor, however, and the meatballs weren't well seasoned. My boyfriend ordered the Zuppa di Pesce, which came with a ton of seafood, but the sauce, again, lacked flavor. Additionally, we ordered this dish "extra spicy" but there was barely a hint of heat. As others have mentioned, the portions are huge (hooray, leftovers!) but Sapori ultimately disappointed, especially when you could go to nearby Angelina Ristorante (where I've had much better meals) instead.
