The Best Chicken I've ever eaten! All the flavors are tasty, but the one that surpasses them all is SEOUL SASSY! Our last visit to Chicago my wife and I stopped in at Crisp everyday we were in town! The Atomic sauce tastes great with the chicken, and on the white rice. My wife and I miss Crisp and we're looking forward to coming back during our next visit to Chicago.
