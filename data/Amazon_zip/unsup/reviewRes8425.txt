I've eaten here a few times in the past and went back last night with da wife for a mid-week pizza fix. Spacca used to be closed on Tuesdays, but as of early June they decided to let people dine on their delicious pizza on Tuesdays once again. We were able to snag a table on the sidewalk, which is set up nicely and very quiet due to the location off of Ashland. They had some specials, but my wife had her heart set on the Prosciutto e bufala appetizer....essentially a giant ball of fresh mozzarella, surrounded by prosciutto and served with some toast. I'm not a cheese fan like she is, but I gotta say, this dish hit the mark! After finishing off a giant ball of cheese, we opted for just 1 pizza, as we knew they are fairly large. The Funghi pizza was delicious....absolutely. Mushroom, sausage, crushed tomatoes on a crispy and thin crust. It really does remind you of the pizza you'd get in a small Italian village. Overall, this place is a crowd pleaser. You see all ages here, families/dates dining and some babies/kids scattered in between. The owner is a very friendly guy and is always present making sure things are running smoothly. Chat him up and he'll be more than happy to talk pizza or Italy with you.
