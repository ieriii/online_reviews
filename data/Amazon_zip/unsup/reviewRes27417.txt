Oh yes, believe the hype. We sat at the funky and very busy bar (walkins!! only an hour wait for a table but two spots opened up, and who cares when you have that for a margarita list?) at Frontera and tried the guacamole (good!) and a ceviche that proceeded to have a party in my mouth. I have never tasted anything like it, and even now am having a Pavlovian response just thinking about the lime foam. My main was goat, which is all the rage right now, and Bayless.. dude, te amo. Mmmmmmm. (pssst .. they only take so many rezzies and the rest are walkins.. take a chance and you will NOT be disappointed!!)
