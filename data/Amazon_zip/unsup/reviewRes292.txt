Most of what needs to be said has been said in reviews here. Acknowledged today as the best restaurant in the US, Alinea lived up to it's billing last night. Dinner, running three hours, was paced beautifully. The service...spread across at least a half dozen servers...was note perfect. The food ran from good/fun to amazing to transcendent. (For a listing of the menu visit http://www.alinea-restau). Grant Achatz, the chef, actually was not only in the restaurant cooking but came out to prepare the dessert table. How rare is that for superstar chefs nowadays? Just a brief story on this. Our table was cleared and a silicone table cloth was brought in to cover the table. That was the "plate" for the dessert. A chocolate mousse, frozen in liquid nitrogen, was smashed on the table and surrounded with various flavors...coconut, menthol, hyssop. We chatted with Grant about his inspirations for such a creative menu. Very nice, thoughtful guy. Ambience was welcoming, service great, food amazing. Dinner wasn't cheap but was worth every penny. Most highly recommended.
