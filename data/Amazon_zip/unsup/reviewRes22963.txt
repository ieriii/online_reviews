Friday night, you ain't got no place to be, i'm going to get you chinese. That was our mentality last night, but the problem was, the weather sucked and we couldn't motivate out. Solution=delivery; let some poor sap bring it to us for the $3.00 delivery fee (plus tip of course).  This would have been a five star review, but the dumplings were cold when they arrived. That said, they were still wonderful. This place has some great flavors, spices and sauces. I'm sure when its warm enough to walk, i'll try going there, but south loopers- if they deliver and you feel like a bottle of wine, movie and your own couch-with some good chinese food....this place is it.
