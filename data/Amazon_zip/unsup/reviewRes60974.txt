Came in with my girlfriend and another couple last night for dinner. There was a bit of a wait, but we wanted to watch the Illini game so we had a drink at the bar and waited about 15 minutes- they quoted us 20. There were a lot of attractive people there and servers there so we thought we were in a for a Rockit-esque night. The first surprise was the big bartender John, who I recognized from Keefer's. All smiles and a stiff drink. Really friendly and asked us if we were from the neighborhood. This was my first suprise- the only place on the street where I've been asked that and I started feeling like we were in for a fun night. When we got to our table we were greeted quickly and had waters and more cocktails quickly.The waitress recommended that we try the smoked chicken nachos and onion rings which were right on. The nachos were actually really, really good. Everyone was happy with all the food. We expected bar food and were blown away by how fresh and well prepared everything was. For me it was between the burger and the skirt steak and I went with the burger. It literally melted in my mouth and I've never had a better one. Seriously, I could write a short story about the experience.The service was great and we felt special, even though there was a party of 8 with some of the Blackhawks next to us and a bunch of overexposed blonde girls. We stayed well into the night and got pretty drunk. It did get very crowded there and as many other reviews note, there were a lot of yuppie types there... Oh yeah, I'm one of them. It's nice to be at a place in this neighborhood where you can go with some friends and not feel like your unwanted by the hipsters that are slowly being pushed out of this neighborhood. Realistically, though that has nothing to do with my review. Food and Service were great and I'll be back with more friends from River North and the Gold Coast.
