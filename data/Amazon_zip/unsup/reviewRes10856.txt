This is a really great change of pizza pace from the normal deep dish rut us Chicagoans can sometimes get into. The dough is fabulous and light, toppings seem ultra-fresh and creative. The atmosphere is bar-ish, with plenty of nice spots to sit for an actual dinner instead of pizza and pitchers. I had their house salad with pears and walnuts which was huge and yummy. Gripes: 1. Parking in Wicker Park has gotten ridiculous. I had to valet for $10. 2. Prices seem a tad steep for what you are getting. Individual toppings are as high as $1.75 each. 3. Service seemed like they were stoned (probably were).
