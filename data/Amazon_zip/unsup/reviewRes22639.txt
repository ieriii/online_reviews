Oftentimes, after I get the bill at a restaurant, I end up doing the Squinty Bill Scratch, even though I should know better by now. I mean, it's not like the prices magically increase en route from the menu to my tab, right?  (And stop feigning confusion here. The Squinty Bill Scratch is that thing that happens when the bill first arrives at your table & sets off a contagious eye-narrowing head-scratching combo that spreads like wildfire as you try to find the high-priced drink that broke the camel's back.) Anyway, I was all prepared to do the SBS when the bill arrived at Irazu. You see, the bf & I went a little bit crazy with the food ordering, which is easy to do when faced with such a fantastic menu.  First, we each ordered a horchata, which was quite cinnamon-y & delicious. Next, we got the chips & spicy guac, followed by a side of fried yuca with mojo (garlic oil), & a side of fried plantains, also with mojo. (FYI: it's best to get just 1 mojo-based dish, regardless of how much you love garlic.) Finally, I ordered the veggie burrito (which was as scrumptious as it was HUGE), & my bf ordered the pepito sandwich (he was in heaven). However, after enjoying plate after plate of fantastic vittles, it occurred to me that my prior "dinner's on me tonight" declaration might have been a mistake. So, I began doing the math in my head, expecting at least a $40 dinner, not including tip. (That's a lot of dough when you've got a non-paying internship, okay?) Thus, when the bill arrived, I was already mentally prepared to take a hit. Then, something amazing happened: before I could even start the Squinty Bill Scratch, my eyes darted to the bottom of the bill, which clearly contained a mistake. The total was $27.50!  Yep, that's right, TWENTY-SEVEN FIDDY! For all of that food. For garlic & cinnamon breath. For fantastic service. For leftovers, even! I repeat: $27.50!! It was not a mistake. And for that, I am in love with Irazu.
