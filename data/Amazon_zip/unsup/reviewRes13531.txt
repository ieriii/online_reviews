Another place that exceeded my expectations, yay! I love when that happens. I just wish this place wasn't so far from me. We went here with some friends last night, and it was packed. Which is a good sign, I suppose. We ordered some beers (I ordered a pale Belgian style beer) and started off with the bacon popcorn and the soft pretzel with cheese ale sauce and spicy mustard. OMG. The pretzel was to die for. The mustard was so spicy, like, "Oh My God, I have to stop talking for a moment."-spicy. The cheese sauce was super tasty as well. I probably could have eaten one of those by myself. Anyway. Ok, this place is actually really awesome for vegans/vegetarians. There are so many options! For my main course, I ordered the tofu chili dog. It had chunks of tofu, chili, chihuahua cheese and it was topped with onions and avocado. It was surprisingly good, I was impressed. Though, I ate what was inside the bun and discarded the bun....it was just too bready. I got it with a side of cream cheese garlic mashed potatoes. AHHHHH. I think these are the best mashed potatoes I've ever had, and that's saying something. I've eaten a LOT of mashed potatoes in my time. I drank the Eugene beer with my meal, which was a really dark, dense chocolately beer. It was ok. It was a little dark for my tastes, but that's more of a personal preference than a complaint. For dessert my husband and I got the chocolate bread pudding, and our dining companions got a mousse with cookies and ice cream. The bread pudding was the tits, I would definitely order that again. The mousse was AMAZING, so fluffy and delicious. I wouldn't argue with eating that everyday. It's a ways from where we live, but I would totally go back here.
