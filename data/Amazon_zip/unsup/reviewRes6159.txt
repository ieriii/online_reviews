This place is really good. A bit pricey, but good. My favorite is the chopped salad. The smallest size you can order is meant for 2-3 people to share, presumably before ordering steak. The salad is all I really need! I have also tried the steak and it is pretty solid. Stormy Night martini is a go as well. This location can get super busy. It can also take a really long time to get a reservation as well.
