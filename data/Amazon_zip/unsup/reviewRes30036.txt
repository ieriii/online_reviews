Not exactly sure why there is a 2-month wait for reservations here. Maybe there is a shortage of Mexican restaurants in Chicago? I live in Los Angeles, so I have been to some great Mexican/Latin restaurants including RED O (Rick Bayless' L.A. restaurant) which was a terrific experience. At Frontera there were only two of us, so we ordered strictly appetizers to hopefully get the best variety. The food, while decent, was not extraordinary. And the service I would describe as chaotic. For some reason I got my tortilla soup LAST - a full 20 minutes after my previous course. Plus there were long stretches where we couldn't find our waiter. I think we expected more from a place that has a two-month wait.
