Hello, FOOD SNOB here. Well, not the most romantic place the the food does seem authentic.  Very crowded and noisy inside.  This is your typical heart of the South Side Pilsen eatery. When its 4 o' clock and the place is packed with people coming in and out, you know it should be good.  I was kind of worried at first because the chips and 3 different kind of salsa's were just O K.  Even the Guacomole was very bland, no seasoning.  The entrees made up for it.  I made sure to taste a little of everything. Enchilada suiza: Excellent Flavor Chicken Mole: Melts in your mouth. Steak and Egg Tacos: Great. My whole Red Snapper which was only $10.00 was more than worth it.  However I have had better Rice and Refried Beans. They were just O K. Prices very reasonable, total for 4 people $37.00
