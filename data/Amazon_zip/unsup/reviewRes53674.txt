Finally made it in to Schwa, on somebody ELSE's reservation as I refuse to try any more. This was after having dined recently at Alinea, Manresa, some other amazing places. My response: yes creative and dramatic, but without complexity, cohesiveness or focus. It felt like they were trying so hard to make the food unusual that no one taste was really amazing, and nothing made sense with what came before it. Anybody who compares this place to Alinea needs to go back, as it is nowhere near the same level, or at least admit that they are largely responding to the difference in price. And as goes without saying, my vist was marked by plenty of attitude from the staff. If this were really the casual neighborhood place they are pretending to be, I might give a better review, but compared to the work of really great chefs, I'll take a pass.
