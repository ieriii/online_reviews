Finally! I have been here! I came for lunch and my oh my, it was busy. 30 minute wait but the host was very gracious and took down my number so we could grab a drink somewhere close before dining. The menu is vast and reasonable. The seafood is fairly priced but that doesn't equate to cheap. The other items that aren't seafood are very reasonable. This is what I tried: Bloody Mary - if you like shrimp or shrimp cocktail, order this. It comes with a skewer of shrimp which isn't bad but I think the garnish should include something other than just shrimp, a carrot and celery. Also, the drink itself is very similar to eating shrimp cocktail. That's all it tastes like. Not my favorite. French onion soup - SCORE!!!!! great soup. Get some! Chowder - very creamy with tons of seafood Lobster roll - LOTS and LOTS of lobster on perfectly toasted french bread. delish! Everyone who works here is super nice. They are all in good moods which puts the customer in a good mood. I really enjoyed myself here and I think I'll have to come back for the "All you can eat King Crab".
