Are you kidding me? We were lucky enough to have a friend that had a reservation invite us on a friday night. I was very excited to eat and experience Schwa. Our server Seth was very attentive to us and made the four of us feel right at home. We chose the 3 course meal option, which is actually 6-7 courses when it is all said and done. EVERYTHING!!!! Was fantastic!!!! Nothing could top the ravioli stuffed with quail egg!! IT WILL MELT YOUR FACE OFF!! Absolutley delicious. Big thanks to our friends ERIN and JASON for inviting us. Even better.. my wife and I made sweet, sweet love that night! Thanks Schwa, we will be back!
