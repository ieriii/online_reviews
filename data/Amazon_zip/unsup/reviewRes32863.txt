had a friend's bday dinner at sunda and the food was great. service was first class and very attentive. loved the different asian dish selections - reminded me of home on the islands :) the lobster roll w/ wagyu beef slices was decadent. this is a place to see and be seen - lots of eye candy for everyone's taste ;) The owner Paul and the mgr Aeron were excellent hosts.
