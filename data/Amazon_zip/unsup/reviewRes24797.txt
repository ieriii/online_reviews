My boyfriend always begs me to go here, and I finally went last night. The food was pretty good, i wasn't too adventurous because I wasn't that hungry so I just got the vegetarian taco and it was pretty standard. The chips were delicious though. Our waiter was the nicest guy ever, I loved him and I'd go back just to see him again. But the atmosphere wasn't my favorite, and it's not necessarily the restaurant's fault, but that back room is LOUD. And when you add a table of 6 loud girls next to me .... all I wanted to do was leave. So I will just have to go back and try it again because the staff was super nice!
