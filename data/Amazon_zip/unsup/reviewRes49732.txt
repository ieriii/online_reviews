I like how this place has a casual area and a more formal area and they let you choose (when it's not so crowded on a Sunday night) which one you want to sit in. I recently started using http://Savored.com and picked Bin 36 as my first place to go to. Savored gives you 30% off your entire bill, so I thought to myself, this is gonna be awesome. Well being the social media whore that I am, I checked in on FourSquare when I got there, and the special said, receive your first wine flight for only $10, um could my luck really be this good?! You bet it was! Our server was so nice, he took the 30% off our bill and gave us not one, but TWO wine flights for only $10, how awesome!! The Habla Espanol flight was my favorite, I found the Summer or Riesling to be sort of average. For our cheese flights we got So You Think You Know Cheddar and We Heart Italy, I enjoyed both of them, but wasn't full just yet. We split the Bin 36 Market Salad which was awesome and then a piece of the cheesecake which hit the spot! Honestly, good wine, good cheese, good dessert and a freakin awesome bill, works for me!
