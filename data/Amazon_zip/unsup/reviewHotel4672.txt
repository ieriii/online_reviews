Finally!! A hotel that lives up to its reviews! Cheap motels, budget hotels, sketchy inns you name it I've stayed in them even. So when I stayed here with two friends on a recent trip to Chicago, I was blown away by everything this hotel offered. It was close to a lot of the major attractions, perfectly located on a quiet street not far from public transit stops and just a few blocks from the bars and clubs.  And the room was by no means a let down. Our reservation was originally for a single queen after a little Travelocity snafu. (When booking through a third party you will sometimes be given the next available room if the one you want is unavailable. We booked a double but got stuck with a single.) Desperate and unwilling to share a bed with the two of them, I asked the man at the front desk if they had any other doubles available. Fortunately for me they had one available and he was nice enough to give it to us. It wasn't the biggest room, but the bathroom was decently sized and the beds were amazingly comfortable--so comfortable that the three of us slept through our alarms every morning. The bathroom was one of the best parts of the room, second only to the beds. It had one of those awesome shower heads that makes it feel like it's raining and there was never a towel shortage. And of course, it came fully stocked with bathroom essentials--soap, shampoo and conditioner that delightfully smelled like the lobby, and q-tips & cotton balls.  As if things couldn't get any better, the staff was amazing. Chuck the doorman was super friendly and knew everything there was to know about the city from which bars and restaurants to hit, to the most efficient route to get from one point to the next complete with directions so detailed that they included which set of stairs to take. Even the late night staff was so helpful as to help my friend carry me back to the room after having a little to much fun our last night in town.
