I had a nice dinner here the other night with Anne S. and Cassie D. I am no expert on Costa Rican food, but I ordered the Casado with chicken. It was really delicious. The chicken was a tad dry, but tasty. I would have preferred if my egg were more runny, but now I know to request that for next time. I loved the plantains.  The place itself was super cute. They had a great patio which looked lovely. Our waitress was fantastic and she really knew her menu. Overall, it was a nice evening and although I won't be going out of my way to get here, I will probably be back at some point. P.S. BYOB, no corkage fee!
