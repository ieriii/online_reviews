I visited the Grand Lux Caf 2 years ago on a Saturday afternoon, and it was extremely crowed! The lobby was packed with patrons, and the waiting time was definitely close to 50 minutes. The restaurant is gorgeous and very large!!! It looks like a palace and ceilings are amazing. Unfortunately, the food was bland and not worth the price....I've eaten at other restaurants that were way better. I will visit this restaurant again...only because it's pretty!
