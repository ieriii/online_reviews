Who would think there would be a 20 minute wait for a counter seat for one person at 2 o'clock on a Saturday afternoon? Well, it was worth the wait. The waiting area is actually a big heated tent behind the main restaurant. Much to my surprise, there were about 30 other people waiting in this primitive yet comfortable area. The meal was worth the wait. The soup of the day was barley with mushrooms. Very good, not salty, a nice balance. The chocolate chip cookie dough "milkshake" was rich, delicious.  The "Radical Reuben" was vegan, with a sauerkraut, veggie "mozzarella", slices of seasoned seitan indistinguishable from corned beef with vegan thousand island dressing, served on marbled rye. The only downside of this was they served peppers and fried onions on this. Peppers and onions on a Reuben??? The side salad of kale daikon was fresh, crisp, tasty. Service was prompt, efficient. I highly recommend the Radical Reuben, but tell them to hold the peppers and onions, if you yearn for a vegan substitution of a real Reuben.
