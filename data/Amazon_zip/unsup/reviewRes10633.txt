This is the best brunch spot hands down for wicker park. The food is always amazing and the wait staff is always nice! I think that should be surprising because this place is never empty. I tried to go on a weekday hoping to avoid the lines but had no such luck... I would recommend going about 20 minutes before they open to wait in line.
