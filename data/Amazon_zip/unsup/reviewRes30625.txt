When you want to have upscale Asian food in the city, this is where I would take clients and family alike. It is where I want to eat. I was 10 minutes late due to traffic and they graciously seated the two in my party who were already there. That fantastic service continued the entire meal. Three starters, some sushi, (I cringed and watched someone eat the peppers that came with the Devil's Basket - soft shell crab. Just a garnish. Possibly an edible one, IF you are that woman in India that can consume pure fire. If you insist, ask for the milk before you try the chili roulette.), four entrees, a bottle of riesling, my guests had cocktails with ginger and skipped dessert. I loved their brussel sprout salad. I repeat, I loved their brussel sprout salad. Crispy, not too salty and so delish that we have attempted to recreate it at home already.  The MR loves the Bi Bim Bop for lunch. A fair price at 12$, indeed. I have yet to have it. Fair price for valet.
