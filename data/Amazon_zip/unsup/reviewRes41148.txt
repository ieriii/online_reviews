This place definitely has good authentic vietnamese food. I've always had my sister-in-law's pho...and there's is good as homemade. However, just make sure you don't get the pho with everything in it if your don't like tripe. I got the sliced beef pho and it was delish!  Also the sandwiches are to die for! I've had the plain pork and marinated pork sandwich and it was sooo good. They make the sandwiches on this bread, which I swear is from heaven, that's lightly toasted and it makes all that much better.
