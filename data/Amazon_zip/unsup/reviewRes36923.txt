This place is easy to miss while driving by...but inside is very cute, clean, and comfy. Lunch here is good...they have thai lunch specials. We opted for sushi though. The presentation is artistic and attractive. Even the cups for green tea are unusual and artsy! I had Las Vegas maki which I haven't seen anywhere else.
