I've driven by this place for years and always thought about going - but never got there till my birthday a few weeks ago.  So glad I did.  And I've made it a point to go back since...and will go back again. First of all - how can you not love BYOB. It's the best concept of the restaurant world. And...no corkage fee. Even better.  If you're going to go on a Friday or Sat - I'd recommend early (like 6:30) or late (like 9). Between then - packed. If you're a party of 5 or more - call and make a reservation. I highly recommend the homemade pasta. Anything in this section of the menu is delish! I went basic the first time and had their cheese ravioli - just awesome. Second time added some chicken tortellini. Again - just wonderful to eat. For dessert we had the lemon...something. Can't remember the name. You'll know it on the menu. Very good. A nice refreshing way to end the meal.  I've never had a problem with the service. Waiters and bussers are attentive and we never waited long for anything.
