This place has some of the best burgers in the city (maybe, MAYBE, second to Kuma's, but I've never waited three hours for a table at Bad Apple, and that's gotta count for something). The cheese curds are awesome, the short-story-of-a beer list is comprehensive at the very least, very long with great selections, and, again, the burgers are fantastic (the Red Dragon is great, same as the Ole Imperial, served on an English muffin and delicious).
