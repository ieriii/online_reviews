I had heard bad things about this place from the lovely Nicole B., but I since I had a Groupon, I didn't have any choice but to hope for the best. Everything started off well enough. The music and atmosphere were nice and I started with a mojito that was pretty good. We chose the Tamal Cubano to start (Cuban roast pork & caramelized onions stacked on garlic polenta with a balsamic reduction). It was absolutely delicious (and is the reason why I'm giving this place 2 stars instead of 1) and I started to feel a bit more optimistic about the place. Unfortunately our main courses were totally disappointing. I ordered the Cuban Style Chicken (marinated chicken breast served with a roasted garlic sauce, over beans & rice with sweet plantains). The chicken was dry and bland. Even worse were the rice and beans...they tasted old and had crunchy dried bits in them. The only decent part of the meal was the fried plantains. My boyfriend had the Ropa Vieja (flank steak slowly simmered in a garlic tomato & bell pepper sauce, served with white rice, black beans & sweet plantains), which also sucked. It was tough and dry, and it came with a pile of sauted vegetables that were totally unseasoned and flavorless. Neither of us finished our meals, and we declined to take home the leftovers even though we're both poor students. Bleh...maybe it was just a bad day for them or something, but I still think it's unacceptable when a well-hyped, slightly overpriced restaurant screws up so badly.
