Food was excellent Service was pretty good, could have been more attentive for the price. (ex. - I had to refil my own water glass a few times, not a big deal at all but just an example, almost any other restaurant at this price point that would be unheard of) Atmosphere was great for us, its a place that is all about the food and you can tell. It is not pretentious...you do not have to be completely dressed up to be comfortable there All in all I would go back
