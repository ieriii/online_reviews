Overall pretty good new spot in River North. Definitely a scene on the weekends. Appetizers and drinks are definitely the way to go as entrees were disappointing. Highlights: Rock shimp tempura, "toast and jam" (tuna tartare on shrimp toast points; very good dish), garlic noodles Lowlights: Shaking beef (overdone, tough beef cubes under a pile of greens), sushi rolls (horrible for the price)
