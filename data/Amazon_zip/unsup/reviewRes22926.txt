This is my favorite restaurant in Greektown. The fried zucchini appetizer, saganaki, and octopus salad are to-die-for! Have some of the wine called Anthosmios; it's great. Also, I always get the lamb and pasta special of the day. It tastes so homey and delicious. The service is speedy and friendly.
