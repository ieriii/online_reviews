I have ordered delivery from this place for over two years. Recently the quality has plummeted. The soup that I ordered had, maybe, one baby corn and one carrot. Five times they have forgotten to include soy sauce and/or wasabi with the Sushi. I will never order from this place again. You can get something from Argyle Street for much cheaper and much better. This place sucks. Completely. Don't bother. At all.  Try Hamamatsu, on Clark, though they do not deliver. Again, the place is completely over-rtated. So done with it.
