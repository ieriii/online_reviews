After having the best szechuan food in china, and after a long search having found an amazing szechuan place in Los angeles that i used to frequent at least 1x a week for years, i was super worried that when i moved to Chicago i would be left depressed and craving those little MJ-bud looking, tongue numbing, rascally szechuan peppercorns. After consulting Time out chicago and Yelp, i dared allowed myself to experience a slight glimmer of hope. My big test is the Mapo Tofu. It actually passed. it was really really good. the braised string beans were also tasty and the deep fried pepper and chicken was yummy. Overall, i am utterly impressed and oh so relieved that i have found my spicy szechuan fix. WHEW HOO!!!!!
