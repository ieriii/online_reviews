Best mussels in Chicago! You would be remiss if you didn't order them on your next visit. They're fresh, plump and the broth is divine, and the bread to soak it up is house made, chewy and delicious. You can't go wrong with these! Oh yeah, and The Publican, in general, is awesome. I'll just add "ditto" to all of the glowing reviews.
