My friend organized a huge lunch for 21 people this weekend and I had a great time! There wasn't a ridiculous amount of variety (maybe about 10 dishes), but what was there was very good. They managed to keep the food piping hot without having anything dry out or overcook. The saag paneer was especially good. The dishes tended to me more vegetarian friendly as only 3 options contained meat. The chicken curry was decent, though I found the white meat a little too dry. No complaints as the flavours were excellent and I ate 3 plates with lots of basmati rice and soft chewy naan. The naan was brought steaming hot straight from the oven and I ate at least five of the pillowy pieces while sopping up the sauces from my plates. The tandoori chicken was served on a sizzling plate straight out of the kitchen - it was juicy and had a slight tang to it which I really liked. I ended the meal with some mango kulfi, which was the perfect sweet (but not heavy) ending to the meal. My only complaint was that we asked for the check 4 times and it took them 30 minutes to get it to us even though they had cleared all our plates. However, it was definitely a great value at $20pp for unlimited Indian food. When the weather gets down to 1 degree Fahrenheit (but feels like -20), 3 plates full of hot, spicy, carb-heavy Indian food will make me very happy. And very sleepy.
