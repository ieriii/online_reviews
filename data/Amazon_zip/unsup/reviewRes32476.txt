I really really enjoyed my lunch today at Demera...on a Sunday at 12:30 it was pretty empty...and as it got to be closer to 2 it started filling up... The food is phenomenal...I went to Ethiopian Diamond in January and that was good...but I have to say the majority of Demera's food was better....the gomen here was definitely better...but the Shimbera Assa was better for sure at the Ethiopian Diamond restaurant... They have a pretty great drink menu as well...the honeywine was ok...and the Addias Ababa drink was ridiculously strong..but good. We got a family style plate for 4..and had the vegetarian option which overall everything was really good..however we had enough left overs to feed another family. For dessert we tried the Dirksoh which was fantastic...the tiramisu was pretty good too. I will say however..this place is definitely on the pricey side...you would think for lunch they would have specials or some type of lunch menu with lower prices..but they didnt...and service is definitely on the slower side..so don't come here if you are in a rush..but I definitely will be back!
