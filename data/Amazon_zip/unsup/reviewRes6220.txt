I was a little reluctant to go to a place that doesn't take reservations (we had 9 in our party!), but we didn't run into too much trouble for a Sunday night. The interior is really well done, and everything is very well spaced so that you're not jammed up against the table next to you.  The wine is cheap (they sell it at retail price) and although there's usually a corkage fee ($7), on Sunday nights you don't have to pay the fee! The food was all really good - although for a party of 9 it's tough to split the smaller portions, we each got to taste each of the dishes. All of the pizzas were really good (we tried the della terra (truffle oil!) and the della fattoria (potatoes!)). The risotto was a little salty for my taste, but otherwise the texture was perfect. The spaghetti with black pepper - was very very peppery. Some people liked it, it was a little much for my taste. The giant rigatoni was delicious! Perfectly cooked! The wait staff was really nice - some of them were dressed so casually I thought they were other diners at the restaurant. Some seemed to know more about the wines than others though. You'll have to ask around to make sure you get solid information/recommendations about some of the wines you've never heard of (other than, "it goes well with the food". That doesn't really help me...)
