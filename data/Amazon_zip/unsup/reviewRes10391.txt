After seeing this place and reading all the reviews we knew this was a place we had to try. Stepping in on a Monday evening, the place was packed. We grabbed a drink and were seated in about 10 minutes. The menu was very simple, pick your size, choice of sauce, and then pick your toppings. We deliberated for over 30 minutes as there were no pre-made combinations, and finally settled on a pie. It took about 30 minutes to get the pizza, and when it was brought to our table we instantly dug in. We were a little surprised at how soft the crust was, so soft that we had to use our fork and knife to eat it, which is fine and dandy with a deep dish pizza, but you should be able to pick up pizza with a thin crust. With the first bite, we both looked at each other and shook our heads. The pizza didn't live up to the hype for us. To be honest I've made better pizzas at home. I'm not sure what it was, but our pizza was not too great. This is a place we will most likely not be returning to...
