I must say, that based on the pizza here, I would give this place 5 , but as for the service, not so much, starting with the good.....the pizza is definitely one of the best in chicago, if not the best, my tastebuds get confused when it comes to this topic because both lou malnatis and pequods makes every one of my tastebuds in my mouth send climactic signals to my brain. so i cant really pick a front runner. what this pizza brings that others dont is that perfectly carmalized crust. at first glance you think its burnt, but its not, but is it?? then you take a bite and realize, burnt or freakin' not, that it one hell of a crust.. now as for the bad, the service, I feel like i am doing a crime not giving this place a 5 star review based on the pizza, but the service was really poor on multiple occasions....this definitely doesnt stop me from eating their amazing pizza, because you can always take out.......
