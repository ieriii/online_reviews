So excited I finally got to check out the gage. It was the perfect way to fuel up after an afternoon of ice skating across the street in Millennium Park! Even at weird lunch hours this place is still busy! So we decided to park it by the bar seating area. Love the leather couches, wooden inside and awesome music they had going. If you didn't read already, serious beer selection, so feast your eyes. My date tried the chicken noodle soup for a starter, it came out fresh, savory and in a huge bowl! As for lunch he had the gage burger and I had the pork belly sandwich. Both of us agreed the pork belly was the way to go - very tender and amazingly sauced up with some yummy fries. Would love to come back here again when in the area.
