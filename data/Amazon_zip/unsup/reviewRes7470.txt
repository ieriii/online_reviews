Even for a person who isn't a huge meat lover - this place is AMAZING. First off, you walk in the door and the staff is extremely friendly. The decor is inviting and comfortable, not too stuffy at all - though it shouldn't be as a bbq place. You will find a wide array of outfits - you can get away with a fancy outfit or jeans and a sweater. Most importantly, FOOD: I had the bbq flight appetizer as my meal, and it was plenty of food. You get a serving of pulled pork, brisket and pulled chicken as well as a huge slab of cornbread. The rest of the group had a combination of chicken, ribs, brisket sandwich and all loved their food as well. You really can't go wrong. To top off a great night, Lee Ann Whippen (Grill Master/Chef/Owner) came out to say hello and was SO nice and sent out a huge plate of milk and cookies (delicious), as it was my friend's birthday. You feel like you are at a house in the South - don't miss this place!!
