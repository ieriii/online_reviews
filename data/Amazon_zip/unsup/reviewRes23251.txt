I'd say 3.5, overall. This is supposed to be "the" place for authentic Szechuan Chinese and I did have a fun time! I ordered the hot pot with a friend and my husband had the sizzling rice soup (tomato-base instead of the usual chicken broth of every restaurant I've ever been to) and the sesame chicken. The husband felt everything was "okay" but nothing spectacular. I really enjoyed the weird mix of fish and spices in the hot pot. It reminded me of a Korean BBQ I had in Detroit. I really liked the spicy cabbage served before the meal, as well. Overall, it was an interesting experience with fun dinner companions but probably not one we'd rush to revisit. The service was curt if not outright rude (the norm in the area, from what we understand). Overall, I'm just not sure I was as charmed by the experience as most. Decent food, okay price, street parking. I remember being more excited about my dinner at the Phoenix a few years ago.
