Absolutely love this place. Been three times so far and have never been disappointed.  Great oysters to start, amazing beer selection and the pork belly is divine. I almost recommend the frites with a fried egg on top, the sweetbreads, the rillettes and the country ribs. If you love oysters, pork and beer, you will love the Publican.
