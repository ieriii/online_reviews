I love coming here for lunch. Its really close to my office and the food is great. I am addicted to their chips and salsa. I like to order the combo fajitas with the chicken and the steak. It is very very good. I wish I could get chunky guacamole here, but its like pureed or something, but I love coming here, and everyone who comes here will like it.
