Hot diggity Doug, how have I not reviewed this place before? Also, how many reviews do you think I could write in 2 hours and 15 minutes? Because that is the amount of time I stood in line for some specialty sausages and duck fat fries last weekend. With the plethora of minutes I had on hand, I did an assortment of things, including but not limited to: chatting with the folks in front of us in line, considering eating the string cheese and/or banana in my purse, thinking about whether or not I should get 1 sausage or 2 (2, obviously, as a reward for standing in line for so long and because who knows when I'll be back?), and stepping on the bf's shoes. Once inside, where I could fully investigate the menu, I chose the smoked duck sausage with red pepper mustard, olives, and cheese and cognac-infused lamb/pork sausage with fig goat butter and aged cheese. I liked the latter better, but overall, I thought both offerings could have been stronger in flavor, with the exception of the cheese. Upon approaching Doug at the counter, bf went with, "I'll order the whole right side of the specials menu". I wonder if Doug's heard that one before. And the duck fat fries were amazing, as usual! Since the last time I was here, an employee will find you a table by the time your food is ready. Woot! Note: this place is cash only.
