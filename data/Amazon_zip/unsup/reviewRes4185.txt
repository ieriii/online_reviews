Clearly, this place doesn't really need any more positive reviews, but why not. Like everyone else, I tried for months and months until one day, they magically picked up the phone. To be honest, I was a bit nervous when it actually happened because I didn't want to do anything to piss them off and tell me I could never eat there a'la the soup nazi from Seinfeld (I don't know where I came up with this idea). I thought the food was great- it didn't completely blow me away, like Tru or Les Nomades, but it was certainly up there. What I thought was the coolest part of the dining experience was how cool and laid back all the guys there are- and how they clearly just love what they do. Every time they bring out a course, they tell you a little about it, but they're not pretentious about it, like so many places can be- they really just want to let you know about the food in the most down-to-earth way possible. Also, several times throughout the dinner, they brought out some different wines and a couple types of liquor for us to try to help complement the various courses.  Great music too- I've actually been meaning to contact them (ha, I know, good luck) to ask about the stuff they play. All in all, an excellent 'Top 10' dining experience.
