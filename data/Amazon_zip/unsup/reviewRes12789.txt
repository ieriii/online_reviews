I dont understand what all of the hype is about this place. Maybe I had a bad experience? I made a reservation for brunch but ended up waiting a extra 15 minutes. The server was yelling at the bus boy nonstop. The music was super loud and the food was ok. The service was slow. I dont think I will be giving this place another shot without a reason to do so.
