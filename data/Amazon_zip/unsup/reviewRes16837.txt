Want a guarantee on a fabulous dining experience in Chicago? Make yourself a resie at Carnivale. There's something to please everyone from the die-hard foodie to the see or be seen crowd. There might be some sticker shock - but everything has it's price and this just happens to be worth it. The waitstaff is friendly and knowledgeable about the dishes on the menu. Also, they don't make you (and by you, I mean ME) feel like an idiot when trying to pronounce some of the Latin dishes - HUGE plus in my book. Food is outstanding. We started out with the Ropa Vieja and Flores y Camarones (basically open faced shrimp tacos). The camarones were AMAZING - the medley of flavors complimented each other well and just brought a complex taste to such a simple dish. We also ordered the large portion of guac, and if I have a complaint about Carnivale, it's their price-to-portion ratio on the guac. $14 for the large portion only yielded about 2 tablespoons of guac per person at our table (5 peeps total). Perhaps that is the "healthy" amount, but it's just my personal opinion that guac should be consumed until the point of feeling sick. For entree I ordered the pernil, which didn't seem quite as yummy as the other dishes. The pork was a little dry and the rice/beans flavorless. I had bites of the Arrachera and Churrasco - and I immediately was hit with order envy. I'd recommend coming to this place with a large group of people versus taking a date here. It's large, loud, and colorful - so get ready to laugh, drink, and eat till you're bursting.
