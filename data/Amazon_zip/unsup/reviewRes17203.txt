This place is not for everyone and I think that's its charm. The Paloma and Pimms Cup are superb. I didn't mind waiting at all for yummy fresh drinks that are created to perfection and I just love my 1 ice cube that doesn't water down my cocktail. I enjoyed my drink from the start to its end. If room permits you can actually sit down without spending a weeks salary on table service. My servers have always been pleasant and knowledgeable.
