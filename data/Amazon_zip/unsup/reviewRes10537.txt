lovely spot. sat on the patio. normally not a fan of outdoors, but it's so pretty I really did enjoy it. I still don't like sitting outside--bugs, leaves, etc. awesome wine list. huge. most (all?) italian. range of prices.  surprisingly varied wine-by-the-glass list.  slightly light on the pour size, but good enough that I can't fault them. good food. good, good food. fresh, interesting, but not ridiculous. beautifully blended flavors. I had the pizza special--pesto and peccorino (I think?) with prosciutto and figs. yum. reasonably priced for the quality. makes good choices (local produce, etc.). nice wine options. a win. only negative was the service was a bit too intense. lots of people milling around all the time. there was someone at your table the second you finished something. a bit rushed, which was too bad, as the service in every other way was spectacular. can't wait to go again.
