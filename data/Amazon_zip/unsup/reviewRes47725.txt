Interesting dining experience. We sat in the dining room on a high-top table abutting the fireplace (so it got a little warm). Very cheery and helful service, but the place was over 1/2 empty on this Wednesday before Thanksgiving. The many options on the expansive Salad/Pasta/Veggy Bar were for the most part good. A few did not agree with the five of us at the table, but that is to be expected. Not everyone can agree on all foods. The highlight of the Brazilian Style of service (where they bring the meats and fish to your table on a big skewer) was the Butter Beef. Tasted like Heaven. The Mahi Mahi also great. A lot of oohing and aahing at the table, but not everything was oh-my-gosh. You have to try each to see what you like, with some more memorable than others. I liked my Grape Martini. My wife thought her Lemon Drop Martini was a bit odd tasting. We shared the Butterscotch Bread Pudding which met the expectations of the waitress who described it. It was a birthday dinner, so one of the Puddings was served with candle on a plate with happy birthday spelled out in chocolate (nice touch). Given the focus on all-you-can-eat here, we may come here for a large group event (from time to time) but not on a regular basis if it's just the two of us. At least not for the full menu option (about $55, I think). The bar menu offers a scaled down, plated version of the meats for under $20 and I might opt for that next time. Beautiful and comfy decor in bar area.
