It is close to great places to eat, but when I reserved a King room, they gave me two double beds, so my husband & I had to sleep in separate beds for the night. Annoying. They said it was because a conference was there that weekend (it was Thursday night) and they filled everything up with them. And I'm sure they were traveling with their spouses & needed a King bed. They didn't even have any queens & were very rude about the whole checking in process. Like I was doing them a favor by coming there. The rooms were clean, but besides being close to good food that's all the positive I have to say about it. Thank goodness I was only there for a night, I won't be going back there.
