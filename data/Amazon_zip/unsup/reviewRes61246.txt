Garcia's sucks. Used to be decent, cheep and convenient (and dirty). They did a very strange rehab: the outside now looks like a bad suburban McMansion/fortress and the inside is a giant open space with worn out old furniture. The new space is painfully loud and messier than the old place. The hostess and the other waiters seat people randomly--some people seat themselves (even if there is a 30 minute wait list-the oversize guys bully the hostess and/or bartender). If you are looking for Mexican, go elsewhere.
