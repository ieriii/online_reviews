I don't understand what all the deal is about this place. Aside form the fact that they've been around forever, their hotdogs all come from the same factory. There's nothing bad about the place but nothing extraordinary. I'd give it another star for the historic nature of this establishment though.. I'm bumping it from 3 to 4 stars!
