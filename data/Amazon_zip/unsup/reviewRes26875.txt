Nuevo Leon's review excellence was wasted on me. I went there last night with a bunch of friends. First of all, this place is a glorified taqueria. Not that there's anything wrong with that. I was actually excited about that part, because the food is usually better at taquerias anyway. So we had something like 10 people. Luckily I arrived 30 minutes later than we were supposed to, so the other guys already had a table. The line is ridiculous and the whole set up seemed disorganized. We had to somehow squeeze our way past the crowd at the front door just to get in. While we waited, I had some chips and salsa. It was good. I asked for some spicy salsa and the guy brought out this crazy hot sauce. It was crazy hot. I had a couple of dips and couldn't really take it. A few of us around the table tried it and everyone decided to pass. The bus boy actually said the chef wants the sauce back if we don't want it. Hmmm... I guess this sauce gets passed around? Now for the main meal. The food was... fine. I don't think it was special. I couldn't get a tostada because the beans had some kind of meat in them. They do have whole pinto beans, but you can get that on the tostada. So instead I ordered a chili relleno. It was good. I shared with someone who got the cheese enchiladas, which were also good. Again, neither seemed excellent. The good part was definitely the BYOB part, because it really kept the overall cost of dinner down. Everyone brought a few beers/vodka/etc and so we were well stocked. That leads in to the best part of it which was the total can to $10 per person, which is good for dinner. But is it really that surprising give that I started off saying this place was a glorified taqueria? I'm willing to give the place one more shot. Maybe a smaller group and less crowded night. Maybe a different mood... more hungry... IDK. You never know what can make the difference. So far I thought this place was just an average taqueria with a couple of unique twists.
