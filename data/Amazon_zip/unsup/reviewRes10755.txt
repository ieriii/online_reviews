The low-down: Awesome food, great environment, moderate-price range for New-American cuisine, simple menu that makes sense and works. Deets: You enter a calming atmosphere with a relaxed environment and a hefty supply of hipsters lining the walls. On weekdays, the wait is non-existent so thats a big plus for me (aka Mr. Impatient). We ordered the Egg/Ham Croissant with potatoes  AND also the Omelette (with your choice of 3 fillings) of mushrooms, ham, and smoked mozzarella. Both breakfast dishes were "egg-cellent" and I loved them. Btw, the freshly cut potatoes are superb. Yum yum yum. The prices are about $10-12 per dish, not including tax and tip.  Would I comeback here? Absolutely. Would I get an extra order or potatoes? Heck yea.
