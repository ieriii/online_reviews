This was indeed a great restaurant but the darkness is the only reason I am not giving it a high rating. Like others, I would like to see what I am cooking. Having tried Asian cooking that involves cooking at the table (Korean), I like the idea of cooking my own dinner with a friend. I guess others are coming here for the date night experience. I just wanted a cookout. Even then I think the restaurant was too pricey for what it offers. There are still a lot of fine places in this town that aren't too weighty on the budget for what they deliver. Pro: the waiter was very polite. He worked hard for his much deserved tip. If you live in the neighborhood, this restaurant is a must try experience. If you are driving here then keep driving until you get downtown and have a better time.
