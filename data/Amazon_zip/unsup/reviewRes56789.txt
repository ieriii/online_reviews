An OK sauce is what keeps this pizza from being Dominos. The service is atrocious and the prices outrageous. Spend $5 more and have a nice Italian meal elsewhere. If what you are looking for is fast food disgused as ethnic food, this is the place for you. And if you must eat here pay only cash as the owner is shady.
