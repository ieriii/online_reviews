So I ordered from here having no idea what to expect. I didn't know that Koreans had their own special niche of fried chicken. I also have no idea what bi bim bop is. But I do know that I seriously love fried chicken in all of it's forms. We got a half chicken of the plain jane, as well as some Seoul Sassy wings. The plain jane is seriously, seriously plain. I feel like they should have a disclaimer on the menu : 'We mean it when we say plain - no really. Get some sauce with this." The batter didn't have much taste to it, so it was my own dumb fault for not getting some sauce. The chicken comes in small pieces, not a whole breast and a leg or whatnot that you might be expecting. However - the chicken was perfectly cooked, and very yummy once I threw a little sauce on it. My only quam was that it was some tiny little bones in there. I'm just grossed out by chicken bones. My own weird thing. So if you're expecting some KFC out of this place, you're wrong. But in a good way. Now the wings- Oh my god, the wings. It's a whole, huge, giant wing. I'd hate to see the chicken this wing came off of, it must have been 6 feet tall. The wings were amazingly crispy, even after coming through a sauce bath. The 'Seoul Sassy' sauce was awesome! It was sweet and spicy and tasted a little bit like soy sauce, and didn't leave the chicken dripping. Just the right amount of sauce. So so so good. Also, the owners / workers / whoever was there are the nicest! They also seem to take great care in packing up the chicken so it stays crispy by the time you get it home. It was also really good, and still crispy, after I put it through the torture that is my microwave, for some late night seconds. I'll definitely be back here to try the rest of the sauces.
