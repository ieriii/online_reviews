Spacious, white-tablecloth restaurant with superbly spicy food. The vindaloo surprised even the two most grizzled, heat-seeking spice lovers I know. One section of the voluminous menu offers "Bombay street snacks," which make nice little appetizer tidbits. Plus, I ran into G-Rod while I was eating here a few weeks ago. Went back for the lunch buffet a scant 10 minutes before close -- impressive variety for lunch, although the spices had been toned down. The staff put no pressure to leave and even kept up the water service.
