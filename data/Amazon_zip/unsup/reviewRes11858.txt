My son lives in Bucktown but he has never been here. Read all the rave reviews so my wife and I Decided it was time to try it. Walked in just before 9:30 on Friday. Immediately greeted by a charming Asian woman and seated. They have 2 small table for two on either side of the front door. We were given one of those and the hostess turned on an electric space heater for us. Nice table to people watch but every time the door opened I felt a draft. My wife had the brioche french toast with pear and cherry compote. Very good. I deicded the test the basics and had eggs, sausage, with the hash brown potatoes which are not really hash browned potatoes but a ciubed potato with seasonings. Nice, but not hsh browns. I wonder if anyone works in Bucktown because for the entire time we were there, about an hour, there was a steady stream of people coming in. The place must be insane on weekends. Breakfast came and it was fine, not great. Biggest problem was hat everything was warm, not hot. My over-easy eggs were too easy, the egg whites were still runny, not firm. Sausage was nicely seaonsed, but again, not hot. Same for the potatoes. Had a couple of bites of my wife's fresnch toast. Good, imaginative, but warm, not hot. The lunch sandwixxh mewnu looked to be quite promising so we will probably try it once again for that experience. For what it is worth, my evaluation of the breakfast places we have tried in the Bucktown area: Feast--ok but crowded and noisy. 3 starts Cafe de Luca-- 4+ stars. Been here numerous times, always good, usually no problem getting a table. downside--al those yuppie moms with their damn stollers just clutter up the place Toast--ok, not great. Bongo Room is a touch better. And up in Roscoe Village: Orange. nice place, not sure I'd drive there from Bucktown but a 3+ star place.
