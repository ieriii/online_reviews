My friends and I happened to stumble across The Purple Pig when we were looking for after dinner drinks and desert on a Thursday evening. The service was great (our waiter was energetic, but not over the top, and provided suggestions on what food items went well with our wine choice.) They were out of several items on the menu, but there were still many delicious choices. We ordered the grilled cheese sandwich/panini of the day and bone marrow w/ crostini to snack on; both were excellent! For dessert we shared the panini con nutella (nutella, marshmallow fluff, & bananas)... YUM! Will definitely be going back to the Purple Pig soon!
