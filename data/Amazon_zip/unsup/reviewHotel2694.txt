Love this place. Great location. Trader Joes is across the street for all your provisions. Great door staff.Great front desk. Ms. Hampson rocks too. Rooms are fab. Beds are great. Bathrooms are good too. Its attached to one of the best steak houses in the city to boot. Its that new modern boutique hotle all the kids are talking about. Really is my new fav , I've been here probably ten times and every stay was fabulous.
