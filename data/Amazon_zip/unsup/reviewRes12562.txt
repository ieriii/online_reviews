Ate here awhile ago for dinner but dropped in again recently as a recommendation for Sunday brunch, thanks to Yelp. This place accommodated our reservation for a large group, and was very friendly. I had the spinach/pancetta omelet (the restaurant brunch menu was a little updated from what was posted online), and my husband had the chilaquiles. Both were delicious. Service was friendly and definitely capable of handling our large party. The only minor complaint was the fresh fruit juices seemed overpriced for $1.75 for such a small, short glass. One plus is that it is very convenient to the Irving Park Brown Line El Stop.
