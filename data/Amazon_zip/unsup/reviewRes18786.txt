Well now I understand what all the fuss is about! Deliciousness! I found myself in the neighborhood around 11:15 a.m. and there was XOCO all "no line" and everything. We helped ourselves to the sparking water as we made our way up to the register to order. So many wonderful sounding dishes on the menu, the hardest part was what to chose. A special got our attention: the pork poc chuc. We also ordered the chicken tinga and the chips and salsa. That, plus two glasses of wine (total, not each) brought us to about $43. Not exactly an inexpensive lunch (these are basically just sandwiches....albeit the most delicious sandwiches ever!) but worth every penny. The line quickly formed around 11:30 and was at the height of the typical XOCO craziness by noon. We sat outside next to a very friendly couple from South Dakota and were served by friendly, efficient staff. A perfect lunch on a perfect day! I'll be back again!
