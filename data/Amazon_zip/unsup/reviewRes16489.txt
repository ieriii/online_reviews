Best Indian food I have ever had. The food is delicious and the service was great. The menu literally has hundreds of items. It also has different meal specials - which include a generous (impossible to finish) amount of food. I had garlic naan and chicken tikka masala. The chicken was so tender. The portion was far to much for me to finish and I was excited to take it home for lunch the next day. My fiance ordered the India House Special which included soup, a main course, and two sides. Definitely call for a reservation, this place is busy! They had several large groups there - this would be a great place to bring a large group. India House is pricier than other Indian restuarants I have been to, but you get what you pay for.
