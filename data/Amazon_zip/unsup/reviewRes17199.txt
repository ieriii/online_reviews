love this place, so romantic inside, try the romeo and juliet if you are on a date, haha. the wait can be annoying, so go before 9 on a Friday or saturday to grab a couple of well made cocktails before you go out is perfect. don't be fooled by the outside graffitis, the inside is beautiful and elegant.
