This was the second time I've been to frontera. Both times the food was WAY TOO SALTY! I love Mexican food and loved topolobambo! The first time I thought the chef maybe had a cold or something, but two times the food was in edible. I never send stuff back out of courtesy, but really wish I had. The waiter was getting really pissed he had to keep filling up our water, but I really tried to enjoy the food. How hard is it to eff up guacamole? Salt it so much that your lips burn!
