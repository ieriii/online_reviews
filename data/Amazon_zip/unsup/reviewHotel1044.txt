I stayed at this hotel with family over Thanksgiving. I had not only never heard of it, I couldn't figure out where it was even knowing that "it's across the street from Harry Carry's". It is small (only 6 floors) in an office building. So even on the top floor, you are not going to get that 'fabulous city and lake view' that other hotels boast. But the location is great. It's a few blocks from State St. shopping and still only a few blocks from the south end of the Mag Mile. Lots of restaurants within a block each way. It was a 20 min walk from AMC River East. I asked why they picked this hotel vs. the Inter-Continental which was a few dollars cheaper and I was told it was because of all the great reviews and the free cocktail hour(s) and continental breakfast every day! Each floor has their own breakfast so you don't need to go into the lobby with someone watching over you as to how much you take. There is coffee, juices, mini-bagels, muffins, bread, etc and the cocktails are served on the 6th floor and is taken advantage of by probably most, if not all guests. The lobby isn't your usual hotel lobby, they have a piano (that actually was playing cd's), contemporary furniture, and 2 counter-top table like "front desks". There is a fitness center that I did not use but no pool so not a big draw for families although there were kids staying there. The rooms were good sized with nice furniture. Our tv didn't have a good picture as everyone looked white. The bathroom was pretty big with a some-what large counter top and a shower with double shower heads! Either the tub was too small for the double shower heads or the drain was clogged b/c by the time I got out of the shower the water was up to my ankles and took a long time to go down. You can even bring Fido with you as they take in dogs.
