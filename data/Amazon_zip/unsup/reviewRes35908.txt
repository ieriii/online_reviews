I had a really fun lunch here with some old friends. The only thing that detracted was I thought the soup broth should have been more aromatic, with a little more attention to seasoning. The barbecue is fantastic and I highly recommend the restaurant just for the duck but the spare ribs and salt baked chicken are worthwhile too. This is definitely an everyday restaurant for everyday budgets, so don't go expecting the kind of service you'd get at a place like Charlie Trotters. They are just attentive enough, but can seem a bit indifferent. I guess that's a natural when dinner's less than twenty bucks and there are 200 other customers in the room.
