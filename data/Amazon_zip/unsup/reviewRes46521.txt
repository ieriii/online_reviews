It breaks my heart seeing that RJ Grunts doesn't have a 5 star rating! I love this place. You are guaranteed a good time if you go, I sincerely mean that. The vibe is great, very '70s. They pretty much play great classic rock/pop songs which is such a unique thing to do. I love the menu and discovering the little drawings they have on the front. My parents got a kick out of the fact that I found Calvin and Hobbes when they've been going here for years and did not. I don't know what they put in that buffet but it is so damn good words fail me. Patty melt is always a safe bet in other places (at least in my mind...how can you go wrong with beef, onions, and cheese?) but here it is cooked to perfection. Amazing drink selection! I always thought it was cool that you could mix alcohol into your shake. The service is really unbeatable here. The servers are so friendly, they make you feel like you've been friends for years and you're just hanging out and having a good time. If you've never been, please go. A true Chicago staple.
