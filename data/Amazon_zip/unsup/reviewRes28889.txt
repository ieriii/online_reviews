Frontera is a really fun and delicious place. Small sized restaurant and doesn't take reservations; plan on a wait of 1-3 hours depending on how busy of a time you're going at. You can head down the street to grab a drink while you wait and they will call your cell when they're ready for you. I went here with a few of my "foodie" friends and they were raving about how great the mole sauce is, and they certainly were right to rave about it. I ordered the Enchiladas because my friends highly recommended them and they were served with their famous mole sauce of course. We also ordered their chips and guacamole as an appetizer...this had to have been one of the top 5 guacamole dishes I've had in my life. Also, highly recommend the flan for dessert. Overall, the meal was very tasty. Had a nice mix of spice and flavor, unlike typical Mexican places that "wow" you with how hot they can get the food and have absolutely no other tastes to it. Definitely worth the long wait. They originally told us 3 hours on a Saturday night at 5:30pm for 6 people, but ended up getting called around 7 to be seated. Definitely one of my top 10 meals in the city of Chicago.
