Old School Italian in every sense of the phrase. Could have been in South Phila. That's both good and bad - The food is well prepared, but very "pedestrian" from a cuisine standpoint. Priced at the high end of the scale, but also highly service-oriented and very traditional in its ambiance and menu. It didn't rock my world, but neither would I say anything bad. I simply prefer a more imaginative approach to Italian fare these days, ala the Mark Vetri-style that embraces a "Mediterranean" feel.  If you want a taste of the "rat-pack", Vegas, Philly, 60's era-Italian, Sabatinos is worth a visit. If you like a more modern approach, I suggest one of the many down-town chi-town alternatives.
