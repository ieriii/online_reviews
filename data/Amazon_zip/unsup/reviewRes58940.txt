I only had drinks and appetizers at this place, but I' was impressed. Beautiful space, innovative drinks (a bit on the sweet side, but still yummy) and some great eats. Would love to try dinner here, but will probably find myself planted in the bar drinking the same drink and sampling more tasty morsels!
