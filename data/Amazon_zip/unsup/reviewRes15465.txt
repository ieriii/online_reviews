I've been ordering from Calo for well over 10 years. Tonight, I ordered one of their "Neapolitan" pizzas. It took 1 1/2 hours to arrive and it was awful! So soggy that my pizza cutter wouldn't cut it. I brought out my sharp, heavy chef's knife and, with great difficulty, got it cut. When I picked up a slice, most of the ingredients slid off. OK, stuff like this happens. It's what happened next that led me to write this. I called the restaurant and complained. They offered to send another but I really didn't want that. The woman I was speaking to put me on hold. When she came back she told me that they would send a driver to pick up the remnants of the pizza and then credit my credit card. When I asked if the driver would take an hour and a half to get here, she just chuckled. I told her that if they really needed the used pizza I'd put it out side of my door as I really didn't want any company tonight. As I said, I've been ordering from Calo forever. They're usually good and prompt. Telling a good customer that they'd credit his account after they picked up the used pizza is just...well, weird. Weird and more than a bit offensive. I think Calo and I may be done.
