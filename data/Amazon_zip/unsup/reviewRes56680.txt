Delicious food, great service. Had a salad AND a soup to start...everything was timed perfectly with everyone's entrees coming out just at the right time (was with a group of 8). Great atmosphere; and the fact that I got a $15 gift certificate in the mail shortly after my visit just puts it over the top. I have aboslutely no complaints about this place and will go back soon. The perfect venue for a date or a group of friends looking for a nice dinner out.
