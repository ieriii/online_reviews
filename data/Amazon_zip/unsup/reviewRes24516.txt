Nice atmosphere, my friends and I come here a lot for quick dinner. Get the avgolemono soup. It is literally the best soup I've ever had. The chicken parmesan artopita is also really really scrumptious! I just wish they had more options on the to go menu. Other than that this place is really delicious and perfectly priced for us starving college students!
