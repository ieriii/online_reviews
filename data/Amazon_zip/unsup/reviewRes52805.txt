My first Cuban experience and it was a good one. Went to a birthday party with a party of 18 and 90 Miles delivered. There was a slight wait for our table and we waited in a large waiting area with tables and chairs and started enjoy our BYOB selections. Once we were seated Buck was huge help and kept the empanadas and amazing food coming. I rocked the Churrasco which was amazing and not a single one of the 18 of us had a bad meal.  The place was packed and they have I love Lucy reruns playing constantly. Took me a second to figure out the Ricky Ricardo connection! First and definitely not last trip to 90 Miles.
