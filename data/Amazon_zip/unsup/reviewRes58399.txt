Warning warning-Absolutely awful experience!!The ambiance is nice with cute chairs and a beautiful bar. Unfortunately the nice words stop there. This restaurant has amateur written all over it; from the napkin fold to the management to the absolutely terrible food.The food: did I just enter a catering facility or a restaurant? Oh wait, my bad. Smoked salmon pin wheels a la 1995 wedding, pasta with your choice of sauce a la all you can eat buffet, and a bun less burger a la Atkins 5 years ago. They are extremely unorganized and apparently not trained. The server didn't know the answers to any of our food questions and said, sorry but they just finished the menu yesterday and I haven't tried any of the food. When we asked why there isn't any prices on the menu she said that they were still figuring all the details out. What? Why are you open for business then???!!!!This place isn't worth a first or a second chance with all the good dining options in the city. Sorry to say that its a disgrace to the Chicago dining scene and I can imagine it closing down for good sometime soon. Do yourself a favor and spend your hard earned money some place else.
