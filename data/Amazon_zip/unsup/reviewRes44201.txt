Looking for a place with large rolls that have interesting names? Wakamono is your place. I love the Peter Parker roll, which has soft shell crab, and I've never had jalapeno miso soup before this, and it was quite tasty, until I burned my lip with a jalapeno.  It isn't cheap though, 3 rolls, 2 orders of miso and 2 cocktails were about $75. Maybe it's because I'm used to suburban Detroit prices, not Chicago. Great treat though.
