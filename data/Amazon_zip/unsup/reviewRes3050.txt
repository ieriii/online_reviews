Hits all my sweet spots. Every time! I dont' know what they put in their wings or veggies but they get better every time! Sassy something with chilled veggies and onions rings...slather on sriracha sauce and allisons special stuff and prepare for ORGASM! :))) $19.99 for dinner for you and your buds...can't be beat! and it's BYOB but i never have room after we feast on the chicken! The $19.99 deal is usually only Mon-Thurs but sometimes they give ya break :D It's tiny so be prepared to be squished if it's busy...finding a private table is usually a no go but who cares...My only wish is that they were open later lol...
