I recently just came here with my mother and her boyfriend. Usually there is a long wait to get into this restaurant because of the pizza and the service. Luckily we got at the restaurant at 4 in the afternoon on Black Friday and were able to get a table and order our pizza right away. The pizza was amazing as usual. I grew up eating Chicago Deep Dish Pizza and this is my favorite by far. The service here is excellent as well. The next time I come home for the holidays from Purdue University, I will defintely be back for more fabulous pizza!!!
