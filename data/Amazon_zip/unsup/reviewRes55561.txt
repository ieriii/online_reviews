I am really not a fan of waiting in lines. Not at movies, not on roller coasters, not for bars, and certainly not for pancakes. I have waited in the line just to say that I have and to see what the fuss is about. The breakfast was about as good as it can be but its just breakfast food. The decor is pretty typical Wicker Park decor. The staff is soso the good being friendliness and effort. The bad being they seem a little overwhelmed sometimes. (Forgetting stuff)
