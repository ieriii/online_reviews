LOVE IT HERE! Went for my second time this weekend, and for the second time got the egg/bacon/cheese crossaint sandwich. YUM! It could not be more delicious! Wait staff and hostess were very pleasant. Service was wonderful and speedy- my water glass was filled like every three minutes. And I like my water glass full:) Decor is very hip. We got there really early- 9 am- the place was packed with people waiting outside by the time we left! I can see why this place is usually packed to the brim- it is fabulous!
