Great food, but I'm giving this 3 stars because it's nearly impossible to get in for dinner at a reasonable hour and the margharita--which I had hoped would be delectly flavored and properly salted--was mediocre at best. The appetizers ended up being a perfect, filling size. I also wished there was a little more on the menu for vegetarians.
