I was meeting up with Albert K. who I hadn't seen for years, and one of the prospective lunch places he suggested was XOCO. Yes, please! Albert had eaten here many times before, which is good because as excited as I was to be here, had I gone alone I would have been so frustrated by the small cramped space and seemingly unmoving line. Having an experienced diner with me (and awesome conversation with him, too) calmed my otherwise quick to rise dining frustration levels. I avoid pork when I can, and given the type of food, pork is prevalent... So I had the mushroom goat cheese torta, which was pure love. I had a taste of Albert's ahogada too, and it was spicy as we requested (perhaps surprisingly spicy, oops!), and let's face it, when you have a seat in that tiny little restaurant, you feel like a champ. We talked and talked, and when we were ready we asked for our churros...So so so good! And even though we lingered for a long time at our two seats on a bar-style table, I never felt like they were pressuring us to leave and give up our spots to waiting diners. They deserve serious props for that, and for how they have their seating system down to an art. Sure it'd be better if there were more seats and it wouldn't look so chaotic...but it's a Rick Bayless restaurant in a small storefront near tons of offices...no matter what it couldn't be enough! This is no Porto's (beloved *traditional* Cuban bakery/restaurant in Glendale); it's a fantastic 21st-c take on the torta! Do it!
