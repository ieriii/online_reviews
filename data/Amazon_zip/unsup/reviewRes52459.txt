Con: they can't handle vast amount of people. Do not come on Valentine Day weekend. Terrible service because it was chaos and it showed that the waiters were flustered. But the waiter apologized for lack of customer service. The buffet lacked quality and quantity. Not what I expected. This did not satisfy me and I'm such a foodie. Terrible experience. If you want to try some good Brazilian Steakhouse must go to Fogo De Chao or Texas De Brazil
