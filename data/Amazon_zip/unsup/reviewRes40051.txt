Probably more like 3.5 stars, but the poopy feeling I have in my belly the morning after makes me round down.  I liked the atmosphere. The place was past capacity on a Tuesday night. The staff was friendly and service was more or less pretty good, but the kitchen was pretty slow. It took quite a while for us to get our appetizers and entrees.  Our 1st course was simply fantastic. We had the sunchoke soup and some fried clam thing. Both were completely top notch. Our sandwiches were above average, but nothing more than that. My burger was bleeding pretty bad and I thought my wife's wild boar sloppy joe was a dried-out letdown. The beef fat fries were tasty, but I didn't feel too good eating all those fattiness. Our dessert was kind of a letdown too - it was the stiffest, cake-iest creme brulee I ever had. I swore I could detect a faint meat flavor deep within it too which put me off. Not very good.  Definitely a lot of potential in this place. The kitchen was probably overworked. Might give it another try sometime down the road but won't be going out of my way until then.
