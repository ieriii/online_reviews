My friend's company had an event here, and I went along as his date. This hotel has more of a modern twist to it than, say, the Drake or the Palomar House. The lobby and the suites are decked out in geometric and Art Deco patterns -- some pretty wacky and colorful, but tasteful at the same time. The room was smaller than average and lacked a decent view, but it did have a very nice flat screen TV and French doors leading to the bathroom. The booklets on the desk would have been helpful to me had I been a tourist. We had complimentary drinks in the lobby before dinner, along with some delicious little hors d'oeuvres. The banquet room is a little more old-world looking than the rest of the hotel. All the food was pretty delicious, from the Caesar salad to the chicken to the chocolate cake and coffee. The round tables for eight were nice and roomy. Sometimes I feel squished in and crowded at banquet tables, but not here. After dinner, we had some more drinks at Encore, the hotel bar. The round bar in the middle is nicely designed, and the cocktails are prepared with care rather than quickly thrown together. Bottom line, if you love Art Deco and want to stay somewhere close to the theater district in the city, this may be a good option. But with more classic hotels in the area offering similar prices and more of an old-Chicago atmosphere, I'd rather stay at one of those.
