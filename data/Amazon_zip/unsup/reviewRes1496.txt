I probably should have had more than just a coffee for the day, when I lined up for lunch at 2pm, since I'd end up waiting 90 minutes for the encased meats. You get hungrier and hungrier as you inch your way out of the piercing cold shadows of Hot Doug's and emerge to the sunlight of N. California Ave and eventually cram yourself into the three layers of doors inside. When you get to the front, Doug is super nice and doesn't try to rush you - he understands that you waited forever and you might want to take some time ordering the right stuff. You can't say much besides that the hot dogs are very delicious, and for having that much of a menu, it's impressive that the quality's good from the basics to the fancy ones. For the three of us, we had 10+ hot dogs, so I forgot what we got. In the encasement, we had: chicken, pigs, cows, bison, lamb. They were all tasty animals. I was disappointed with the duck fat fries - nothing special or memorable. Another disappointing thing is the buns - you gotta toast the buns. Despite that, as a tourist, it was fun to wait the wait and live to tell the tale.
