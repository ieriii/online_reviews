First breakfast out with Dad on our father daughter labor day weekend extravaganza. Hiked over from Michigan and Delaware. Food was average but the place is hopping and our server was great. I think dad had a little crush. I had the two eggs and pancakes with fruit. Ordered the eggs over medium and they were definitely over easy, the pancakes were ok but the fruit was good. Dad had an enormous omelet that was OK but his potatoes were mighty tasty, lot of salt though. Nice change from the touristy stuff, you're definitely eating with the locals but pretty average food.
