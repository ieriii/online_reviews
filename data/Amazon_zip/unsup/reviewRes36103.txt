Yay for Meli, my FAVE neighborhood brunch spot. They have an expansive menu of delicious farm fresh items, ranging from health conscious to indulgent, and I especially love their skillets. The staff have always been kind to me, and the atomosphere is very pleasant and comfortable. Most recently we brought in my 3 yr old daugter for her birthday breakfast, and the waitstaff was more than willing to put a #3 candle that I brought, in the whipped cream on top of her strawberry, blueberry, blackberry, banana panacakes. It was adorable and heartwarming to see her smile as we sang happy birthday and watched her blow out her candle. It put new meaning to the term birthday cake.Thanks Meli. We'll be back.
