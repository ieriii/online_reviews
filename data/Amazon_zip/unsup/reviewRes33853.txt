A coworker of mine was eating a pita sandwich a week or so ago that smelled and looked amazing. I immediately demanded to know where it came from and the answer was Sultan's. Why did I not know about this place sooner???? My first visit was today and I was lucky enough to find a parking spot very close by. I looked at the menu and was going to try lamb or chicken, but the guy in front of me ordered falafel and then it struck me how recommended it was here. I had to try it. I got the falafel sandwich for $4(!) and....oh it was yummm. The line was super quick and the guy who made my sandwich had a big smile on his face. Will definitely be back.
