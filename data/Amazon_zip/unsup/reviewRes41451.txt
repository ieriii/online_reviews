Can I just say Amazing. It was truly one of the best meals I have ever had. I was simply pleased with everything that was in front of me. Lovely decor. Somewhat of an exclusive feel. Valet for 12 bucks I got a fillet with blue cheese encrusted atop. Sweet potato casserole is freaking amazing. Had the $8 malbec. Delicious. Overall the best dinner I've had in a long time and to be honest I'm not a big red meat fan and I was very pleased!
