I had a really bad all-around experience at Tank, on my first visit there. The smoothy tasted like something out of a machine with cardboard tasting tapioca balls. I ordered Chicken Curry for dinner (a dish Ive had many many times at places all over the city) and it was so spicy hot I couldnt eat it. There was curry powder caked on the pieces of chicken. I asked to send it back and have something else and they refused. We also had pork fried rice and it was all fat. I live in Uptown and always try to frequent neighborhood places, but when Thai Pastry is right next door, why would you go to Tank.
