There's always a line, but it's worth it if you like encased meats. There are many crazy things on the menu, and your wait in line won't be worth it if you don't try something new. You will have "missed the point". The duck fat fries are not that amazing, but if you want to try them just to check that off your bucket list, go ahead. Check the weather and prepare appropriately for a 1+ hr wait in line. DO NOT BRING YOUR KIDS. Seriously, just don't. They have a small dining room that is not built for strollers, and kids don't want to wait in line an hour for a hot dog. Do everyone a favor (I'm talking to you, Mrs. Breastfeeding-At-The-Table-Across-From-Me)
