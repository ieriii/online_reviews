My husband and I came here after working out at the LVAC. We wanted to eat the healthier options so we avoided the fried stuff. We shared the Seoul Steak bowl because it was so big. It was really good especially with the Seoul Sassy Sauce and Buddha Sauce mixed with it. The only reason I took off one star is because there's not efficient seating space. They have these huge wooden tables but some people put their stuff on it (i.e. purse, Redeye paper, etc) so you can't sit enough people. Also the place needs to turn up their AC because it actually felt hotter inside the restaurant than outside.
