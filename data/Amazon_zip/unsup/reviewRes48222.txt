My favorite brunch place in the city! Sort of pricey but worth every penny! I'm not even much of a pork lover but the bacon was cooked perfectly and the combination of sweet and savory made my taste buds tingle with joy!! No one flavor overpowered the other. Every entree was unique. I'm definitely gonna try the wine poached eggs next time. I'd also recommend the mimosas and bloody marys!
