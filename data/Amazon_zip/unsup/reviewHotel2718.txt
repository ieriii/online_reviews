I went to The James Hotel restaurant for my bday Tuesday nite and ooooh la la, I'm glad I did, as it was a unique dining experience.. I decided to celebrate another bday at this place after changing my mind on where I wanted to go numerous times. Thanks for being patient with me. The only disappointment, my martinee sucked =-( , I didn'e even finish it. My favorite martinis are prepared at Wildfire. If my martini would of been good, I probably would of departed tipsy, "not drunk". =-) We partook in a porterhouse steak, garden salad, twice baked potatoes, tempura green beans and I had the crabcake with a pretzel crust. Our server suggested the tempura green beans, but they sucked in our opinion; everything else was eclectically prepared and delicious. I wanted to try the red velvet cake but it wasn't sold by the slice and I didn't want my hubby wasting $24 for a "cake in the pan" and then me not liking it. Thus, on the house, our server presented me with a fancy slice of chocolate cake with happy birthday written in chocolate on the plate. Thank you. It was a unique, celebratory dinner experience at The James Hotel. And to think, I had never heard of The James Hotel. This place is a gem, and the restroom was unique also, magnificent.
