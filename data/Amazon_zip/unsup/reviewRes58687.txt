For real chinese food in Chicago, this is about as good as it gets. All, and I mean ALL the other restaurants in Chinatown don't get it right. The free cabbage at the beginning of the meal is addictive. The lunch menu is reasonably priced and offers a good variety. Even the regular menu has good, authentic dishes. Most importantly, the rice is always cooked well and has the proper texture. Too many other restaurants in Chinatown have rice that is tough and dry and maybe a day old. In terms of a Chicago Chinatown standard, the service is good. The servers are always attentive and they remember my special requests although I always state them just to make sure.  This is probably the only place I would recommend for real chinese food. The one thing the kitchen can improve on is the tea. Currently, it is just brown water. Ever hear of tea leaves?Oh, btw, for all of you that like American style chinese food, there is a whole list of less than mediocre places to choose from.
