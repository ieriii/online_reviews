I will admit it, I was annoyed by how hard it was to get a hold of this restaurant to make a reservation. But we finally made it through and now I understand why it was so difficult. This was an amazing meal. I was surprised and pleased with the laid back atmosphere of the whole evening. The chef's interact with all of the tables and they are all very cool. The food is difficult to put into words, you just have to experience it for yourself. We are already trying to get through for another reservation.
