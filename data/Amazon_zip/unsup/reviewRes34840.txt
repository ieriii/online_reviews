We visited this place because of all the good reviews. And my verdict: Worst sushi I've ever had. The fish was stale and smelled bad.  Lighting isn't great here and I had a little LED flashlight with me, so I used it briefly to get a better look at what was in my sushi. The owner came over and jokingly said, "There's a reason why we keep it dark here". Talk about a Freudian slip! Although they are a BYOB place, they do not have wine glasses. Instead, the gave us little grapefruit juice glasses. And then they didn't have space on the table for their wine bucket, so they put it on the seat beside us. Needless to say, we won't be going back.  Side note: On the way out, we saw a party of three come in. They had a six-pack of wine (!) with them - that's 4.5 Liters of wine...goodness!
