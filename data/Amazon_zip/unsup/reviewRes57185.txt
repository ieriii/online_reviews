Dear Jesus! The braised beef and plantain appetizer (Ropa Vieja) was quite possibly the best flavor combination I have ever experienced. The beef was cooked perfectly, the plantains were great, and the cheese and onions complemented everything perfectly. Also, the different textures - soft beef, crisp and creamy plantains, and fresh onions - worked together absolutely perfectly. Another notable was the side of mushrooms with bacon and leeks. It probably was minimally a thousand calories per bite, but well worth it. Delicious!The rest of the meal and their fresh fruit-mojitos were great too. The only complaint I had was that their soup of the day would have been better suited to winter than summer. It was too heavy for summer - had sausage, garbanzo beans, other big chunks of veggies, and a very thick broth. Flavor was great, but just too heavy for summer.
