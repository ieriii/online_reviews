We stayed here recently for our annual Christmas shopping trip. Since we primarily shop Michigan Ave we alway stay on the Mag Mile. This was our first stay at the Drake and we've stayed at them all with the exception of the Marriott on Michigan Ave.. The Drake was nicely decorated for the holiday and the staff is VERY attentive and professional. We arrived WAY early but our room was ready. We had a King size bed in a room that was about 450 sq. feet. Although the Drake is a older hotel it is VERY clean and well appointed. While it is old it feels very charming not run down like some. The room was warm and very quiet with high ceilings. The bed comfortable although a little lumpy with pancake thin pillows. Hallways are very wide and bright. Elevators are fast and some have little benches in them to sit down (cute!). I'm not sure what others are talking about for 'slow elevators'. We saw the band that night in the Palm Court. A bit crowed but nice. TINY dance floor for a swing band. We arrived 30 minutes to the band starting and told we would have to wait about 45 minutes for a table. The host took my cell phone number and would call me when the table was ready. 10 minutes later we were at our table! Drinks are expensive but not potent. Nice hotel, great staff. Older but a very clean, stately hotel. The only draw back was there is no free Wifi and this is a big sticking point for me. In this day and age where you can get free WIFI just about every place you should really get it at a hotel where you're paying a premium to stay. This is VERY important and might be a deal breaker for me in the future.
