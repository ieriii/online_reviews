Excellent service, amazing french pastries and croissants, and really frickin' good cupcakes! We stopped in during the Renegade Craft Fair and I was quite surprised at the quality of their baked things. They also have a lounge next door with free wifi which might very well become my new favorite spot to study! If this were in walking distance, I'd be 10 lbs. heavier by Christmas
