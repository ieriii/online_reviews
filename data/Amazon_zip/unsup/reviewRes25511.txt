Went here for a friend's birthday with a group of 7 (yes, I was the 7th wheel on this 6-wheeled truck). I had never been to a fondue restaurant so I wasn't really sure what I was getting myself into, and I was concerned it was going to be too romantical. It was romantic - but only if you wanted it to be. The booths seemed good for intimate dinners while the tables in the middle of the room seemed good for groups and less romantic situations. I originally thought it was a little pricey, but they give you a TON of food. And the waitress was very helpful, although it would have been nice if she could have made her schpeel seem less rehearsed. The only confusing part was trying to figure out how long to cook the food. The waitress told us how long everything should cook for, but a timer or clock or something would have been nice - I didn't want to take my phone out at the dinner table so I just had to guess. My only other complaint is that it was pretty cramped. Granted, I wasn't really walking around but between being seated, using the washroom (the drinks were excellent!), and leaving, I'm sure I rammed my rear into multiple people's chairs. They had us all fill out something to join their club so now I get pretty good coupons in the mail which is good because I'm cheap. In a nutshell, a great dining experience good for couples and groups.
