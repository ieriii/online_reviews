I am torn with how I want to rate this hotel. I intentionally returned here for the location. It is the only hotel I am aware of that allows one to easily walk around Hyde Park. People complain of the room layout, the fact it is old, etc...yes...all of that is true. I come here because I don't need all the fancy amenities that others need. Here is why I like this hotel: *It is in Hyde Park and the free art center is a block away. *It is on the line 6, which takes me downtown and fast. *It is cheap. *It is clean. *The shower head freaking rocks. If you want to be spoiled with amenities and pay a shit ton, go downtown. If you want safety, cleanliness and basics, stay here.
