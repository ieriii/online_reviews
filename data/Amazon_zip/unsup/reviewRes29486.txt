I read the special on one of the two boards it was posted on, and was ready to order it even before our friendly waitress made her way to our table. It seemed like there was only one waitress on at lunch time, and she was busy so I did not feel slighted if she took a little while to check on us. The aps came out extremely fast. I had a great, reasonably priced meal, I left satasfied and full. Not the best italian I have ever had but certainly a great meal and an even better price.
