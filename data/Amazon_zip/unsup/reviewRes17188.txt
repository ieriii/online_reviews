I came here for a work function not really knowing what I was in for, but I was pleasantly surprised. I got the Seared Ahi tuna and it was so tender and flavorful, it was all I could think about eating for about a week. Before dinner I tried one of their specialty raspberry mojitos and it was delicious introduction to aworld of mojitos I knew nothing about. The main dining area is huge and intricate, the staff was attentive and the only thing I didn't like about Carnivale was that the bathrooms are down a flight of stairs. If you are on a budget, this is not the place to go, but if you're looking for a good date spot or a place to go with a group of friends and you've got some cash, Carnivale is definitely worth it.
