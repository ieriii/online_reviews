Falling within walking distance of my place I fall into the trap of convenience more than anything when it comes to Coast. I do like the atmosphere (once seated) and the sushi is decent (albeit, perhaps a little over-priced) but each time I go I get the feeling this place is being overrun by LP visitors as everyone is dressed "to impress" and is trying way too hard. But, I've always enjoyed the food so I seem to keep coming back!  Be prepared for a long wait if you go on a weekend night. Luckily, though, it is BYOB and there is a liquor store just down the street to help pass the time.
