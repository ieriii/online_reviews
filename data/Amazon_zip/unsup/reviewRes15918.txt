Your meal begins with most perfect focaccia bread, all entrees come with a soup and salad (when did restaurants stop doing this??) and they have a Tuesday rib special that's tough to beat. Not to go un-noted, Calo also manages to have fountain Coca-Cola that is the best I've ever had. All pasta dishes are plentiful and rich. I highly recommend the lobster and ricotta stuffed ravioli. When dining in, I prefer sitting at the one of the bar high tops. Otherwise I enjoy good old-fashioned delivery until 1:30am on weekends - beats a burrito.
