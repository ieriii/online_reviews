What a great little place. Stupidly I decided to make my maiden voyage to Hot Dougs when it was 8 degrees outside. I thought, "Hey, maybe people won't be standing in line on such a miserable day." I was wrong. We arrived to a line about 10 deep outside, and about 20 more crammed in the breezeways.  Anyhow, after about 30 minutes we made it to the counter. I order a smoked cajun pork sausage topped with a cheese and it was incredible.  Great texture, great taste. The duck fat fries were a perfect compliment. Don't let the line scare you off. The comraderie in the line is part of the experience. Truly 1 of a kind. edit 7/11 I just wanted to re-iterate that Doug's attitude is the icing on the cake. Always happy to answer questions and make suggestions.
