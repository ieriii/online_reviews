0 stars! I was turned down at the door for forgetting my ID. Mind you, I do not drink. I was planning on walking right through the bar and straight to the restaurant.  The young man at the door (he looked younger than me I might add and I'm 27) actually turned me and my 3 other guests away. I'm still gobsmacked. Why would you card patrons of the restaurant? I just wanted to eat! I've eaten here before and it is decent for the neighborhood (though not exceptional) but obviously I will never return.
