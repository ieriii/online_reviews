It took a really long time for me to finally make it to Violet Hour, but since my first visit it's become my favorite cocktail spot to catch up with girlfriends and impress visiting guests. My biggest annoyance has been the hosts, who I have observed acting pretentious and downright rude to some guests on more than one occasion (fortunately, never to me and my friends). I have only been to VH on weeknights and have never had to wait for more than 15-20 minutes (the last time I stopped by it was something like 11p on a Tuesday). The drinks have obviously been raved about everywhere, and rightfully so. For $12 you are treated to an amazingly delicious, well-balanced, strong!, treat of new flavors and combinations. I love the hidden entrance, the heavy curtains that separate you from beyond, the lighting, the space, the no cellphones rule! Really just the perfect atmosphere with perfect drinks to boot.
