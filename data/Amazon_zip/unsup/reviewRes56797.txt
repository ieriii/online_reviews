The pizza was great -- I love Neapolitan style, and they had great options and ingredients, and good salads too. We sat in their newly opened back room for large groups. It was gorgeous space and a perfect setting for a large-ish group. The complimentary Prosecco was a nice touch, too! Thumbs up all around.
