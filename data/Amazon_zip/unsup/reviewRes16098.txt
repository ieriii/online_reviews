Honestly, I was kind of eh about going here because of all the hype. I figured it was just an over the top cocktail lounge that wouldn't live up to it's name....well I can say that I was wrong. We went on a weekday and it was perfect. There were barely any patrons there. We opted to sit at the bar so we could chat with the bartenders. My bf and I decided to browse the drink menu and he decided on a whisky drink and I couldn't decide, so the bartender asked me what I liked and he made it for me. He ended up making me a whisky drink that was perfect. Not too strong but not too sweet. Just perfect. Then I decided I wanted him to make me another drink, but I was still having a hard time deciding on what i wanted. Well he asked if I liked gin? and I said NO (because i don't)! He said that he has a drink that he can guarantee that I will like even though it's made with gin. He said he would give me a drink for free if I didn't like it. Well guess what? I LOVED it! He even made me a second one!  After 3 drinks each, it was time to go. We were getting ready to pay our bill and we noticed that he didn't upcharge us for the better liquor we used in one of our drinks (yeah, we are good people), and instead of charging us, he took off one of our drinks!  The bartenders are great and the drinks are even better!  The one thing that wasn't my favorite is the atmosphere. Now, if it was winter the atmosphere would be great...it's cozy and dark inside. But it's summer and all us pasty midwest folk like to see the sun when it's actually out! However, I won't deduct any stars for that because I'll still be going back for more of those yumtastic drinks!
