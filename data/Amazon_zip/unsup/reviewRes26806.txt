I came here with my roommate for brunch before Lollapalooza on a Saturday morning. We got there around 10:20 (10 minutes before the restaurant opened) and there was already a queue. We were maybe the 30th/31st people in line, and by the time we were seated, the restaurant was only half filled, so it looks like they can seat about 60-ish people at a time. I was really impressed by the extensive margarita menu, since there were just a bunch of options and I love margaritas (but who doesn't?). I opted for the white peach basil margarita, which sounds amazing in concept, but was just way too sickeningly sweet in practice. My roomie got the summer margarita, which was incredible and I was super jealous. We proceeded to get the entrees. I ordered the pozole rojo, which is a stew of pork and hominy with red chili. I was looking for something light and soups usually are, but this was underwhelming. I can't quite put my finger on it but it felt like it was missing something. My roomie got a dish that was like a mexican version of eggs benedict (I think it was called huevos con masa but I can't be sure). It was two poached eggs, sitting atop corn-based english muffins, with some kind of hollandaise sauce infused with chili. Total after tax and tip for our two entrees and two drinks was around $60. I concede that my roommate ordered better than me in all cases at this meal. I can see how this place can be delicious and I understand why it's popular enough to justify a line down the block at 10AM on a weekend, but I guess I just didn't choose the right items.
