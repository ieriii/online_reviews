My first trip to Sunda was underwhelming if I recall correctly but a friend visiting from out of town wanted sushi for dinner, and since we were already going to be in the River North area I gave it another try. We shared 3 rolls: Veggie Q, Golden Child, and The Caterpillar. The latter was the stand out. It was a fabulous blend of spiciness and burnt sugar. We had a bottle of Prosecco to complement the sushi and ordered some sort of Bomb to up our energy before we went out all night. Our server noticed a chip in the rim of the glass the bomb was in and offered to replace it for my friend, who declined and said she was okay with it. He took the glass anyway (which was more than half full), dropped off the bill, and never replaced the drink. That was a little frustrating since we were still charged full price for it. I wouldn't call that amazing customer service, but maybe he knew that we were going to drink too much at our next place and was just trying to do us the favor.
