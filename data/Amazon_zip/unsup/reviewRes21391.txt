We went here on the recommendation of some Yelpers and we were not disappointed. We went here today for a late lunch and sat in the very pleasant front dining area. We were glad to see that most of the tables were occupied by families with children since we were unsure how our 6 year old would do.  The staff warmly welcomed us and was very pleasant. We started with the guacamole and it was delicious - some of the best I have ever had. I had the steak taco dinner. The corn tortillas that these were served on were incredible. They had to have been freshly made to have this flavor...not sure though. The streak was the chopped variety and well flavored.  We will definitely make this a stop for us when we come to Chicago.
