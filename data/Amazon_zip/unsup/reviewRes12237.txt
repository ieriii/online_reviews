Initially was skeptical about thin crust pizza in a city known for deep dish. But Piece did everything right. Crispy, flavorful crust. Toppings are nice, but flavors from plain white pizza with parmesan, olive oil, and garlic can stand alone. Decent beer selection including house microbrews. Karaoke on Wed and Sat (with live band). Everyone's a star. Hilarity ensues.
