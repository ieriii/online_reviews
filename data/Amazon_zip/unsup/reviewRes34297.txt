Yolk is what it is. Lot's of different egg dishes, which is great if you like...er...eggs. I had the Eggs Blackston which I definitely enjoyed. The eggs were perfectly poached and still hot, English muffin hot and still crispy and it came with yummy, crispy potatoes, and fruit that was much more than a garnish. The service left a lot to the imagination and the overall atmosphere created by the staff was a little cool. Other than that, I'd say its a pretty good little eat in the south loop.
