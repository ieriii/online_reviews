I ordered a sandwich from here which was just okay. I'll have to get one of their breakfast items and come earlier next time. I have tried their home-made granola on a separate occasion, which was a really great mixture and perfect for a light and healthy breakfast item with vanilla yogurt and fresh berries or some other fruit.
