I went for my birthday and was not very impressed for the price we paid. The food was good and in small portions, which is to be expected from a high end restaurant. However, I think what threw me off was the experimentation of food taste, presentation, and smell. We just received samples and whiffs of what the food is supposed to be, with different presentations. I thought the service was stiff and super slow. We ordered the tasting menu, and it took about 4 hours to serve. We were still hungry at the end, but disgusted with the thought of more food. I had high expectations of this place, but walked away with only mediocre experiences.
