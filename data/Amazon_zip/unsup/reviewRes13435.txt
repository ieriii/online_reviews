A reservation at a diner? Sounds like an oxymoron ... but not at Glenn's Diner. You soon find out that your not the only one to discover this modest gastronomic jewel on Montrose avenue. As the place fills up with dinner patrons the space gets tighter and tighter ...  With an original diner menu (breakfast all day) married to chalkboards full of mouth-watering specials (mostly fish & seafood), Glenn's has an enormous selection. Having pan-fried Halibut in a horseradish-blue cheese sauce and a cheeseburger at the same table is pretty unusual, especially when the halibut is perfectly cooked and served on a bed of asparagus. Other dishes at our table was pretzel encrusted walleye (our only complaint: the crust overwhelmed the fish) and sturgeon in a creamy bacon sauce which also drew high praise. For appetizers we had Glenns's Mussels, a giant mound of black mussels topped with four triangles of Texas toast garlic bread in a wine broth (delicious and perfectly cooked) and Clam Chowder which was loaded with clams, corn and veggies in a thick cream-bacon soup. Many deserts including ice cream with a bananas-foster topping and brownie pie. Prices are moderate and service is super helpful and friendly (Jules). Ya, I know. There are no tablecloths and the tableware comes wrapped in a paper napkin but if you prefer taste and value over elaborate ambiance put Glenn's Diner on your must-go list.
