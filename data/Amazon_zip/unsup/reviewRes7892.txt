I went here with my brother for his bday. Being a bostonian, i used my fellow yelpers to assist me in picking the best place for the meatlovers. Then I met Fogo de Chao. Can I just start off by saying best SERVICE EVER??? We had like 5-6 people helping just our table every 20 seconds whether it was replacing our side dishes, refilling our water, changing plates, delivering meats and meeting our additional special requests. I think I had my water refilled about 6 times in 40min I was there. That's solid. Their unlimited salad bar was fresh, clean and high-endish (i hate cheap salad bars). On top of that, they kept giving out unlimited amounts of 4 side dishes (all of them were really good but I want the readers to know that their garlic mashed potatoes were impressive). Now, I've been to at least 3-4 Brazillian BBQ places. What they have in common is that they sprinkled more salts than we could ever bear and that the quality of the meat weren't very good (it can get very tough and chewy). The meats they offered were out of this world....fillet minion, rib eyes, beef ribs, lamb chops, picanas, ahhhh...i can't even name em all because i'm in meat coma right now. They were tender and salted evenly for once.  After we were so full, the waiter asked if we wanted any desserts....i was like yea...ok, i can't even breathe right now. But he said that they have this papaya smoothie that has enzymes that can assist our stomachs digest/breakdown all the meat. So i said why not. Let's try it. Oh boy...i don't know about this whole digestion thingy but we could not stop eating this papaya smoothie.  All in all, it was one of the better brazilian bbq experience, but after dropping $150 for my bro's bday, I'm not sure it's it is 5 star worthy.  You take my money, I'll take a star from you Fogo. =)
