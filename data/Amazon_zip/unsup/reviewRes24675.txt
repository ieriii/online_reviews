Food, wind & service were good. A bit over priced for the portion size....which seemed a bit small. Didn't like that you only had 1 choice for cheese and 1 choice for dessert. Like other Fondu places better that give you more choices.  I will warn you though... the place smells like a fish fry..and they use OIL to cook the food in, not broth like other places. My husband and I had MAJOR stomach aches that night from all the grease and oil. I can only imagine what the fat intake was with cooking our food in oil.
