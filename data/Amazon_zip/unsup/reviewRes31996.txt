I thoroughly enjoyed my first tast of Ethiopian food. I attended this restaurant in a larger group to celebrate a birthday and they were wonderful. We tried to keep it simple by ordering the family style (medium spice), and had a great time trying the variety of items that came with the meal. My personal favorite was the beets and lamb. The restaurant staff was friendly and provided a delicious free dessert for the birthday boy. We also had a gluten free person in our group and they made special food for her when we called ahead (very nice). My only complaint is that the day I was there it was around 80 degrees and there was no air conditioning- but loved everything else about the place.
