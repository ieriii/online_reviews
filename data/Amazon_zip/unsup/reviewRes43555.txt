I seem to be going against the grain here, but I really thought this place was just "ok". Not horrible, but definitely nothing memorable and definitely nothing I'd go out of my way for again. A friend and I stopped in at about 2pm on a Sunday. There was no line, so we stepped up and placed an order. I had a chicken sandwich with bacon, tomato, pesto, and blue cheese. And it was really just "meh". The chicken was a bit rubbery and tasteless and the bread was soggy. The tomato slices were huge and overwhelmed the sandwich, so I ended up taking them off completely. And the chips - they're greasy and tasteless. My friend and I looked at each other, wondering where the salt was.  The space is cute, and the staff was friendly, but I just don't see myself going out of my way to go there. I really wanted to like this place, too.
