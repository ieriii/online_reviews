Tru's service is impeccable, but the food leaves much to be desired. I was impressed by the choice of black and white napkins (not even Alinea offers that choice) and even more pleased by the cashmere pashmina they brought me when they noticed I was chilly. I was less impressed by the amuse bouche that was several bites, the cheese offerings that overwhelmingly tasted of dirty diaper, and the assortment of summer melon dessert that tasted of cleaning products. Since this was our first time we opted to add on the Caviar Staircase to our nine course meal. It was lovely and had the appropriate accoutrements, but $280 is a bit high for what amounts to one ounce of caviar.
