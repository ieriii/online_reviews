As Mark K. said, you can have an absolutely relaxing, comfortable time here -- while still having an undoubtedly fine dining experience. Talk about a happy contradiction! GE is decidedly one of my favorite restaurants in all of Chicago. The service is stellar, the cocktails are cute, the beer selection admirable indeed. The food is just SO, SO, SO good!! The food just matches the ambience -- you have comforting, familiar things listed like wagyu steak or chicken noodle soup, but these things are just a starting idea of what you end up again. the dishes are so artfully constructed (a bit of molecular gastronomy, a bit of hyper-expensive, traditional classy dishes), with a twist of sorts, so what you get definitely crosses the line into, not just "classy" chicken noodle soup for example, but something altogether new. Honestly, a little hard to put into words, but I was just plain old EXCITED for every course that was coming my way. But the five star moment? Well, I've only ever had three desserts in all my life which just took all my problems away (ALL of them), put a smile on my face, and just made me laugh with happiness. The Orange Blossom dessert, the ice cream in particular, is one of those three. Exquisite stuff. PS: Whoever made the tracklisting for the evening we were there.... I totally have a crush on you. From Bone Thugs n Harmony to Beach House to Vampire Weekend?? I want to write you a note on lined paper with a number 2 pencil and sign it xoxo. You made my night.
