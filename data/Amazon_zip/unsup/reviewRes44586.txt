I heart this place. I must admit i mostly order espresso and croissants. Occasionally i will get the key-sh (phonic spelling for the sake of a chronic misspeller). I am really picky about my croissants. If you make a good croissant you basically have my heart just dont fuck up the coffee. So they do a good job at that. I usually dont get other things on the menue cause its all a bit out of my price range.... apparently people pay that much for their snacks. Anyway, its super cute. I have never had a problem with the hipster staff. They get the job done. Mostly, i have found that they smile back and thats really all it takes for me. Their other room is very quite. Its true. I like it, cause i usually go there to do job hunting stuff. BUT the thing with the radio station is DRIVING me NUTS! I feel like it is a relatively new phenomenon. I have even requested that they put something else on cause the Menards commercials were driving me nuts.
