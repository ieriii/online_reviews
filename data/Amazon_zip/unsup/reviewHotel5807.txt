Housekeeping staff here needs lessons--dusty fixtures, dirty glasses left in room, coffee and cups not replaced, room not vaccuumed, soap and towels not replaced. The windows in the rooms do not open. The staff (except for housekeepers) try to please, but I was disappointed to pay for a room that was not kept clean--and I'm not a messy person.
