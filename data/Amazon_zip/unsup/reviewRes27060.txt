Awesome! Awesome! Awesome! The food was fresh and came out quickly. We shared a steak Taco appetizer that was very simple but the flavors of the fresh lime,cilantro & onions were delightful. I ordered the Chile Relleno with cheese. The cheese oozed out as I cut into the tender poblano pepper. Quite delicious. The refried beans are surely made from scratch, no canned beans in this house! My friend devoured the steak tostadas...nothing would stop him from licking his plate clean! Besides the outstanding homemade flour tortillas...the best thing about this neighborhood gem...was the unbelievable affordable prices! We will certainly return...next time with a pitcher of margaritas! Kudos!!
