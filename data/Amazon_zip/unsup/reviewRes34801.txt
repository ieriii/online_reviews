You had me at BYOB and I'm glad I finally got to try Sushi X and take it off my "places to try" list. The sushi was unique-mostly in a good way. I love how they combine a bunch of different elements into one roll. Everything blended nicely, but still manage to taste the individual flavors. Some more than others. The cilantro in the White Tiger roll was a bit overwhelming. And the sushi chef definitely has a passionate love for Sriracha sauce. Besides that-the sashimi roll was excellent. Super fresh! I want some now! Mmm! I have a tradition of ordering a spicy tuna roll every time I have sushi, and the spicy tuna roll here is my new favorite. It really is REALLY spicy and they put a nice chunk of tuna in the roll which makes it extra yummy. Service was quick, staff was uber friendly and helpful.
