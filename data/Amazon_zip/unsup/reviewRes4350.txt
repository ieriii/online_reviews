Why have I lived in Chicago for over a year and never been here before? I'm sad that I missed a year of the Green Mill. Stopped in late for a first date quick cocktail. It was the perfect spot. Cozy and full of character. I have no idea on the prices of the cocktails, but they sure to make a good one. I had a lil' buzz after just one and a half G&Ts.  The decor is fab and the crowd is a hoot!
