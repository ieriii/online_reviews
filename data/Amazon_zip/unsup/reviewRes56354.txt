I recently moved from LA to Chi town and was searching for a Vietnamese place to satisify my cravings. This place is the best!! I was definitely impressed by the food and the service. I've been here at least once a week since I've discovered this place about over a month ago. This restaurant is clean and has a nice atmosphere that I would take my in-laws for some authentic Vietnamese cuisines.I've had various dishes and they are all tasty and true to its Vietnamese heritage. Of course because the owner and cooks are Vietnamese! Spring rolls are a bit americanized but still yummy plenty and healthy. Pork chops from lunch combo were so yummy and filling - had to take the rest home because they give you two cutlets. Their lunch combos are a steal. You can't get soup, salad, drink and entree for less than $9 anywhere and it's healthy.Tamarind soup with shrimp is my favorite which is why I visit once a week to get that to go. It tastes just like how my mom makes it.I recommend this place to anyone that is looking for great Vietnamese food. I grew up in Orange County, CA and lived in LA for the last 8 years so I know what real Vietnamese food should taste like and I'm also Vietnamese myself. I'm so happy I found this place and have created a great friendship with the owner. Their Vietnamese coffee and boba blended drinks are also why I go there once a week too.The service is great which is not normal for an asian restaurant but they take care of you well here. They give fresh fruit as a complimentary dessert after your meal. Now that's service!!Check this place out and you'll soon find that it will also be your favorite Vietnamese place to go.
