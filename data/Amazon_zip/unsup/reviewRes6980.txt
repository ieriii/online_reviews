Sapori has always been my favorite Italian and last night once again it did not disappoint. Ricardo, the host and John our waiter did a great job-their service stands out for sure! I brought 5 basketball friends and only one had been there before and they were blown away. We ate family style and could not be more satisfied. Since I am regular we tried some new items and they were incredible. The squid died gnocchi with shrimp was unreal. The risotto with chicken, another unreal dish! We had meatballs, and calamari, and some ribs. I felt like I was having these friends at my aunt's house for a home-cooked Italian meal. Chef Anthony and his staff continue to make Sapori the best Italian on Chicago's north-side, can't wait to head back there again sometime soon!
