The sushi here was really, really fresh. Very good, but some room for improvement. I'm a huge fan of salmon and eel, and none of the rolls I got were that out-of-the-park. I'm not a huge fan of places that are fully BYOB, personally. I'd like the option to get a glass of wine or order of saki when I'm out. The fake candles at each table were really cheesy and stupid. Overall, good and affordable. But there are better places out there.
