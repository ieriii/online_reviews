I heard about this place from a friend who said the food was wonderful. I agree the food was delicious and delivered fast. however the service was a bit strange I was not sure who all was a worker since there was no dress standard of the wait staff.My friend asked the server if there was shrimp in an item and she said it was pork and shrimp. so my friend could not eat it but I ordered the item for myself and it was only shrimp. Staff should know what the food is made of if menu does not list. Our server took our order and never came back till we had already paid the check to see if we were doing alright. I had flagged down what appeared to be other staff and asked them for assistance during our meal. I was surprised that there was so much open seating in the restaurant but we were told there was a 15 min wait to be seated. I will return to give them a second try to see if that was just an off day.
