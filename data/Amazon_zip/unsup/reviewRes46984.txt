I had the best food at this restaurant. We ordered a a great bottle of 1/2 price wine which was the special that night & recommended by the waiter. We ordered a bunch of appetizers and shared for our meal. We ate: roasted garlic, baked spinach & goat cheese dip, grilled mushroom seasonal wild mushrooms, three sisters polenta, balsamic reduction x2 and potato ravioli caramelized cauliflower puree, pickled cauliflower, capers. All of them were to dye for in this green restaurant. I would go back anytime but I cannot wait until the spring when the garden opens on the roof.
