Love this place!! I only get there on occasion - as this place is a special treat for me.  Perfect stop to make on the way to a party for something to share - or pick up for a birthday treat for someone special. They will rave about whatever you choose. The service is always good - even when it's kinda hectic inside, everyone has always been super freindly and helpful when trying to decide.  Keep doing exactly what you are doing!
