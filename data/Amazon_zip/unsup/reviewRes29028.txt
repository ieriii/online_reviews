In the Big Ole Windy City, there is surprisingly a LOT of Thai food places... but authentic Thai? That's the hard one to come by. In terms of pure spice, Opart accomplished this on the only visit that I've had thus far. Decor was nice! Darkwood, greeted with smiles and led to a table immediately... not ridiculously busy for a Thursday night at 6:30 PM, but the quietness was enjoyable as we settled in for our meal. Felt very upscale restaurant. Fiancee and I started with a Crab Rangoon - Crisp, melty, perfectly golden, but suffering from the same malaise that other crab rangoons suffer from: lack of crab. 8 servings for $5 was definitely a good deal though. We had two dishes - Lard Nar (seafood version) and Red Curry with Catfish (I forget the Thai name) Via my fiancee, the Lard Nar deserved four stars. I tasted the nicely cooked shrimp that was done to an excellent tenderness, and the plentiful squid which was tender as well. Tender squid is a tough thing to accomplish (at least in my kitchen) and I'm always impressed by such a feat. When ordering my Red Curry Catfish dish, the waitress asked me if I wanted mild, medium or hot. Curious as to how hot it could be, I asked her, and she let me know that it would be Thai hot. Now in all my time in Chicago, one friend has brought me to an authetic Thai place and I've never had such hot food in my life. I miss it. So I ordered Thai Hot. This curry was phenomenal. Milky texture, soft catfish, and SPICY curry. While it wasn't as hot as my past experience with my friend, this was closer than any other Thai place I've been to and I really enjoyed it. Grand dining total after tax and tip? $28. Not bad, especially with leftovers from my fiancee to make another meal for her. Verdict: If you're looking for very close to authentic Thai spice in an upscale feeling restaurant without ridiculous prices, Opart is well worth a trip. I'll be back for my curry.. mark my words.
