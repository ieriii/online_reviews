So the big question on most people's minds is: better than Kumas? Well... my answer would be no. However, that does not mean I have much of anything negative to say about this place. I came in with a group of (originally six, down to four) and there was no wait at all at 8:30 on a friday. The menu items has a little more than just burgers, but like Kuma's, they are all named after some sort of crime/jail/prisoner related theme. Kinda corny, but hey whatever works. Beer selection is quite good, though not as good as Kuma's, I think. The food came out amazingly fast. I guess if you're used to Kuma time, then anything seems fast. My burger had a nice combination of ingredients, as did the rest of my party's burgers. The burger itself... not quite as good as the Kuma's burger, but not far off at all. What I did like was that there was more of an option for sides. You can get mac n cheese with your burger without having to get that gigantic plate at Kumas... the downside is that it's not nearly as good (but still tasty!) The atmosphere is very strange. There are 10 or so flat screens all around the place. Some of them had WGN news, a couple had sports, and a few of them had this weird iTunes slideshow of seemingly random bands at google quality rez. The music blaring was definitely metal/hard rock, but I'm pretty sure I saw Thom Yorke and Johnny Cash on the slideshow. Nothing against them, just seemed random. It's almost like it's a third of the way to becoming a sports bar. What I really like is that this is about a 10 minute walk from where I live... much more convenient than Kuma's... so I am quite certain I will be coming back to try some of the other menu items.
