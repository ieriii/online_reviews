It's rare that I dole out five stars to any establishment, but The Drake Hotel earns every star. An iconic hotel in every way, from the architecture to the decor - you find yourself ensconced in old Chicago style. The Drake wears its age well, and everything is immaculate and updated without being modern or boutique-like, which would ruin the historic vibe. We stayed in a Deluxe King, with fantastic views of Lake Michigan and the Gold Coast. The room was large, with plenty of space for two to sit and relax. The bed was comfy and the duvet was up to par with more modern hotels. The location couldn't be better, just off Michigan Ave. The common areas in the hotel are spectacular, from the chandeliers, lounges, lobby, and even the hallways are warm and rich with history. We'd absolutely stay at The Drake again. NB: valet parking is a steep $55 a night.
