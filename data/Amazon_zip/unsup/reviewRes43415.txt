This is one of those places where the staff is making ugly pretty. You know the type of place--creative haircuts, fauxhawks, reeboks with the straps, etc.... My hair sucks, but not in a funny and attractive way. Hence, I am not accepted at Milk and Honey. I kid! My hair rules. Still, they're kind of annoyed to take your order at Milk and Honey. Even if you're attractive like me. First off: huevos rancheros. Hella greasy. It's really a bowl full of fat waiting to happen. Barring that negative aspect, the meal is totally delicious and an option for the vegetarian in your crew. The sandwiches aren't nearly as good as Jerry's next door, but they're perfectly edible. Make sure you holler at a cookie.
