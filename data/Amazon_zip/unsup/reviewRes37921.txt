This was by far one of my WORST dining experiences EVER!! We ordered a deep dish pizza and we knew we would have to wait a while- server told us 45-50 minutes... so we decided to order an appetizer in the mean time (which came quickly, but it was a plate of fried stuff so it's not hard to do). Our waitress came back about 10 minutes later and asked us what pizza we had ordered....!!! So now we're looking at over an hour because our waitress couldn't remember ONE PIZZA ORDER. An hour goes by.. no pizza. We also noticed people who sat down much later than us have gotten their food at this point. So we ask for a manager, who was incredibly rude and argumentative!! What happened to customer satisfaction?!?! He let us know our pizza had never been put in, so we he said he would make it and told us (without any apology or humility) he'd comp our pizza and give us free soda. woohoo* (*note sarcasm) So after almost 2 hours we got our pizza and it was less than mediocre. Also, only 3 of us ordered our "free soda," and our waitress couldn't remember who ordered what. Thankfully there are many, many more pizza places in Chicago that are a billion times better than this place. Won't be back. Won't be recommending either.
