PORK BELLY WEDNESDAYS Seriously, Wednesdays are the best day of the week thanks to XOCO's pork belly special. It is my favorite sandwich option. Not always consistent in terms of the ratio of ingredients (some days are saucier than others), but I don't care because it is ALWAYS delicious. Other favorites: -Love love love the pork belly vermicelli from the caldos menu (obviously I have a soft spot for pork). -the hot chocolate. So thick that you actually find yourself chewing the little bits of cacao. Makes me (kind of?) look forward to the cooler weather. YUM. Just thinking about XOCO makes me want to jump on the Grand bus and wait in a probably massive line at this hour. I don't care, it's all worth it.
