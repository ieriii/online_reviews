I know the place has a huge beer selection, but to be honest, it was a bit of a let-down. I thought it had too many Belgians and not enough of other types for my taste.As far as the other customers, they were friendly and polite when we were trying to work our way through the place (it was quite crowded). It was not particularly easy to get to the bar, due to the crowd. I'd suggest checking out the upstairs to see if there's more room up there. As for the bartenders, they seemed a bit pretentious and aloof to me. I had the unfortunate experience of dealing with a short guy that had a striking resemblance to The Fonz, and he was quite rude. Almost as if I was annoying him by asking for a couple beers.Good for groups? Only if you can snag a table. My friend and I had a hard time finding standing room without feeling that we were always in someone's way. You know that feeling, where you have to keep shifting around to let people pass.Most likely, I will not return. This place is not particularly close to me, and I won't be going out of my way to pay for rude service, a cramped feeling, and a beer selection that didn't impress me.
