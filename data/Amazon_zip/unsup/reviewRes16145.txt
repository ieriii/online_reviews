Calo has all the classic aesthetic of a simple Italian Restaurant. Majority of the menu is pasta dishes and some normal main courses including chicken and ribs. I had the lobster ravioli, whose sauce was just too thick. My sister has the Alfredo, which tasted normal. My mom had the ribs, which supposedly there well known for, but I wouldn't recommend. Go there for an expensive date.
