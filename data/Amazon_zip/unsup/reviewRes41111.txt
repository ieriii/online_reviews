I first came here with my significant with Groupon in hand. We've been back (paying full price no less) several times. The food here is such a fantastic experience, super high end fine dining, for a fraction of the cost and BYOB! Amazing! The only thing that brought this rating down to 4 stars from 5 is the penchant for mis-spellings of french words. Now, perhaps I'm a bit of a snob about these things... (moi? mais non!) but it seems to me that a couple of super talented chef could find out easily that "Bon Soiree" is not grammatically correct, and that a "gratin" while pronounced "gratan", alas, is not spelled that way. Call me a perfectionist, but honestly, don't they include "spelling of french cuisine" in the french cuisine unit in culinary school? If not, perhaps they should. In any case, the food is delicious and the wait staff is excellent. (although there was a dude in the kitchen with the giantest dread-lock confining jamaican hat thing--filled to the breaking point with dreads--I've ever seen (esp on a white boy) that, being seated in a chair facing the kitchen, I couldn't help but be distracted by his gargantuan head. But that's neither here nor there.)
