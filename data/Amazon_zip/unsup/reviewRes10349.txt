GREAT PIZZA! What more can I say?...well...to start it's not Chicago Style. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE me some Gino's or Lou's, but when you're in the mood for the perfect thin crust pizza you come here. It's unique in that they model their pizza after a joint out of New Haven. It's served on really large rectangular metal baking sheets, so it takes up most of a 2 seater table. I went with a friend and got a medium. We both ate 2 pieces each and there were still like 8 pieces left...and they WEREN'T small pieces! My only complaint was that they put the leftovers in too small of a box so many of the pieces were folded over to make it all fit. If you take home leftovers, check the box before leaving if you want your pizza to not be a sandwich the next day. My bf ended up eating the leftovers for three diff meals. The price was perfect and the service was ok. Not outstanding but ok. One thing to note is their great beer selection as this is a microbrewery. Also, I'm not a fan of pepperoni unless it's cooked my way and not too spicy and this was perfect. Nice and crispy, smooth flavored with a little kick, but not a lot. My bf and I have been struggling to find a place that can satisfy both our needs for pepperoni as he likes a thicker spicier type than I do. This one did the trick! So if you're in the mood for a beer or hard cider with a great slice of pizza, hit this place up. But be prepared to wait if you go during normal dining hours!
