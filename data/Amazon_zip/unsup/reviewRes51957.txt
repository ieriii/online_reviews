I'm sad to give this place only 2 stars because I know it is one if Chicago's deep dish pizza staples. But, I am obsessed with pizza and this place just doesn't cut it for me. I've never had great service at this place and the last time I went, my service was just pitiful. A friend and I ordered a caesar salad to begin with along with a medium green pepper and sausage pizza. I'm bummed to say I enjoyed my salad more than my pizza (booo!). The pizza was too soggy for me and I felt as if the peppers weren't cooked enough. Overall, I just didn't care for the flavor of the pizza. We each had one slice and didn't even bother to take the rest home. Prices are very fair and a medium pizza is MORE than enough for two people. The decor is very unique and pretty cool. But, with all the deep dish pizza places around here I feel these places need to be on their a-game and this place, just doesn't seem to do it....for me at least.
