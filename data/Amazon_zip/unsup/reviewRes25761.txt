Wow, considering Simply It has 4 stars, my boyfriend and I figured it was a safe bet for good Vietnamese in the neighborhood. Boy were were wrong. We were seated right away, the decor is cute, and the service was pretty good, but none of that made up for the unappealing, flavorless food we were served. We got the lemon grass tofu bahn mi combination and the pineapple tofu. Both of the main dishes were horrible. The sandwich had no flavor, and was literally dripping mayonnaise. The entree was tiny, 7 pieces of tofu max, and was covered in what tasted like strange cheap tomato sauce. Definitely will not being going back.
