We went 1 time only and the night we did the employees were physically fighting in the alleyway behind the restaurant. The people that lived in the neighborhood had to call the police. The neighborhood people said this happens regularly with the restaurant employees. Food was not good, service was horrible (probably because they were all hyped up from fighting) and the kitchen had a bad smell coming from it. I wont go back EVER!
