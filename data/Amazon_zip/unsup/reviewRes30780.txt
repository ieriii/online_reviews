I completely re-fell in love with the Diner. I was off it for the last few years and haunted Karyn's almost daily until recently. The Diner has consistancy, friendly staff and lately really delicious menu items.  The bad part - I like it so much I have taken to ordering 5-6 meals to go to hold me through the week (they only make it 2-3 days) so our average dinner meal comes out to $100-125. Which isn't bad when you think about a family of four (and a fetus) get to have a sit down in the Diner with 2 milkshakes and a dessert and I take home a boat load. My only complaint is the new to go containers. They are some sort of cardboard and when they put hot food in, and I take it back to my fridge in Naperville, the next day half of my meals are stuck to the mushy paper and I wind up eating part of the packing (I'm chalking it up to extra fiber). Only one of the semi-original waitstaff still works here, and I have been eating here 15 years. I have to say this has been their best year. The cakes lost their stale taste, they tofu chocolate cheesecake recipe is improved and I would stab someone with a fork to get more over their pear cobbler (I almost had to but thank goodness my waitress was quick to put a note on it saving it me for later). If you haven't been in a while, give it a chance. My new favs are the: Dagwood, Lasagna, Chikin Parm Sandwich, Spinach Sweet Potato Quesedillas, and Duck a la Orange - everything with a side of mac n cheez.
