Have been to Big Jones twice now with hubby. Both times have been a hit. Hubby is rather old school when it comes to his soul food, so this nouveau Southern cuisine is a bit over the top for him (braised rabbit and similar) so he sticks to the bbq sandwich or the chicken fried something. Last night I had red wine and hubby had an Old Fashioned, and shared a Mint Julep. Hubby was skeptical of their ability to make a "real" Southern drink but he was quite impressed (I'm talking about the Mint Julep - perfectly muddled). For an app we had the beet salad and I would have licked the plate had the place not been so full of other patrons. For din din I had two apps - the sauteed mushrooms on grits and the smaller portion of the chicken and andouille sausage gumbo. Hubby had the pulled pork sandwich with fries. I wanted okra, but hey...it was his meal. Food quality was excellent. Even the fries were great and I'm not a fried potato person. The roux in my gumbo was wonderfully spiced and the sauteed mushrooms were wonderful. Our waiter brought us the okra anyway "to try" (he heard me whining about it), with a side of green goddess dressing. It's sooo good. Just like mom's okra (if you have a southern mommy). My only issue is the cornbread they bring out at the start of the meal. As with most midwestern restaurants that serve cornbread (unless it's really old school), is that "cornbread" it's more of a "corn cupcake". In my mind, there should be a crunchy snap to cornbread (hence, far more cornmeal than flour) and absolutely no sweetness to it. But to each his own. Hey, it comes with the meal gratis. Otherwise, excellent food with lovely plate presentation. Love the interior of this place. Seating is quite comfortable. Great vibe in the restaurant on the whole. Great restaurant. Never done brunch, but will in the future.
