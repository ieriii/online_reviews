By far our favorite restaurant in Greektown! We live a little over a mile away, so frequently go for Greek. It seems sort of silly always going to the same restaurant over and over, but when it's as good as it is, there's no use going elsewhere! I love their Mediterranean Chicken Breast and especially love the buttery rice that comes with it. We always like to try some of the Greek wine which has been tasty and fun! Service is always great, atmosphere is wonderful as well! It'll be hard to get me go anywhere else in Greektown (except in the summer, when I might just wander over to Pegasus to eat outside). Nom nom nom!
