Sexy, tucked away, inviting, candle lit, intimate lounge. All the things I love in a drinking establishment. Our waitress was awesome and did a good job of making suggestions on the drink menu. I settled on a Pimms Cup. I used to dislike gin, but I have found myself ordering it more and more. It was fun to kick back and make up stories about all the couples snuggling up around us. the couple across from me tried several very create positions on an over sized chair before realizing that it just wasn't built for two. I imagined that they probably were equally adventurous in bed. A threesome next to us was more difficult to figure out. I finally decided that she used to date one of the guys, but now they are just friends. Although, the way he was still looking at her made me think she was the one to break it off. The guy with them was hoping to eventually hook up with her, but didn't have the balls to make a move on front of her ex. I play this game all the time when I am bored, but when you are at a bar drinking, you can come up with some bizarre stories. The drink was done beautifully. Drinks are cash only and not cheap, but this is a place where you sit back and enjoy.
