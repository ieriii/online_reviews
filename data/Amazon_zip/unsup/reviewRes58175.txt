After many attempts to get a reservation last minute, we finally just went in late night and waited for a table. Not for too long I must say..plus I got to enjoy the white sangria at the bar which was great.I loved the ambiance of this place, much cooler than I thought it would be. The bast part of the whole experience was the food, which was amazing! This is a place I will eat at over and over again. The menu has a ton to choose from and I will definitely be back to try more items.
