Wow! how have I neglected reviewing my favorite full service restaurant in Chicago? This is my favorite Mexican food that I have ever had. I really think that every part of this restaurant is almost as good as it can get. And because of this one must endure ridiculous wait times. I would say if you try and go around "Dinner Time" on a Friday or Saturday you will probably have to put your name in and wait about 90 minutes to two hours. The best way to eat here is to 1) Go to the bar and wait for some seats to open up and 2) Go towards the closing time of either lunch or dinner. In both those cases you will get more prompt service and better attention overall. The longest I have waited in the bar for a seat is about 20 minutes. I really think the drinks here are some of the best that you can find in the city. The margaritas are just perfect. If you are an adventurous drinker and enjoy spicy things I would suggest you try a "Michelada Moderna". Along with this the restaurant has seasonal drinks on the menu that are always delicious. As for food: I really enjoy the Appetizer Sampler platter as you get to have chips & salsa, ceviche, empanadas, tacquitos, and guacamole for a really good bang for the buck. I really enjoy the ceviche at Frontera and think it is among the best I have ever had. As for other entres you can't go wrong with any of them but for something unique get something with the great dark mole sauce they have. The desserts change fairly frequently but I have yet to have one that I do not like. If you enjoy food I really think you owe it to yourself to make it to Frontera even though it might be a big time sink for your day.
