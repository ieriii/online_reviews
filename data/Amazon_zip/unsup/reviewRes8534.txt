I took my boyfriend here for his birthday, expecting an extravagant salad bar but was disappointed. Seeing that the first Brazilian Grill that we dined at was Brazzaz, I felt that Fogo had a lot to live up to. My 1st reaction was to the mediocre salad bar that had little to no hot items. Other than that, the meats were tender and moist, a little better than Brazzaz. Overall, I was not impressed. Wont be going back.
