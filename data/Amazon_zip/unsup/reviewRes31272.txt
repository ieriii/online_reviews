We came here for lunch and ordered off their sunda set combo menu. I had the shrimp and sea bass curry. My friend had the chicken katsu curry. The combo set comes with miso soup or salad, rice, and three pieces of califoria roll or spicy tuna roll. We both got the miso soup and california roll. The miso soup was delicious! The california roll had itty bitty pieces of avocado. I was a little disappointed in that. The entree was great though. The sea bass in my dish was very tender. The curry was not as creamy as I usually have for curry dishes. But you could tell it was made from scratch and original. They had put a lot of ginger in the curry to give it some kick. Definitely very healthy and good for digestion! The katsu dish my friend had was very good as well. Crispy and nicely fried, and the chicken was tender. There was a lady who had ordered a noodle dish. I had wanted to order that too but didnt want to be a big pig ordering two entrees for lunch. But I am obssessed with noodles and love them so much I may come back here to try the noodle dish!
