We came across this place looking for a sports bar downtown to watch the first Bears game of the season. Their outdoor patio is nice - they have big TVs and tall tables, as well as an entire dog menu (no joke - you can order food for your dog). The place is totally pet friendly. The food is also pretty good - I don't recommend the salads, but my fiance had a fantastic grilled cheese, and the desserts were also very good. Perhaps my favorite point on the menu was a line item for brunch entitled "Make your own sweet ass 5-egg omelette." The beer selection on tap leaves something to be desired, but they do a nice deal where you can get a double sized beer in a take-home cup for less than twice the price (so that's pretty nice). They have an interesting area on their menu for beer cocktails, so if that's your thing, check it out. The service wasn't incredible, but it wasn't terrible; then again, it's a sports bar, so if you're looking for someone to pay a ton of attention to you, this might not be the place (it was packed when we were there).
