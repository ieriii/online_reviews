This place was awesome. The hike getting over there was another story. I went for an early breakfast and we were the only people inside. Food was on point and I enjoyed my PBR breakfast. I would have rather came later in the evening when the atmosphere was different. Also the whiskey menu is unreal. I'll definitely be back again. I think it's a great spot to show new people in town.
