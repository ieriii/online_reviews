I'm consistently poor and this place is perpetually cheap. I was introduced to the falafel a mere three years ago and this place is home of probably the best damn falafel sammie i've had. it's all in the way they fold it! Honest to god! Their sammies are like little gifts just waiting to be opened. and when they are -oh, the joy. the warmth. the pleasurreeeee. Not to mention, the guys behind the counter know not only how to make your meal in a timely fashion but they never fail to be super sexy while doing it!
