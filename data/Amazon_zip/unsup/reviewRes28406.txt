Went here on a Friday night for a late dinner.  The Really Good: --The Cheez-It risotto --The Summer Nectar drink --The Peanut Butter brownie dessert The Pretty Good: --Salmon BLT entree. My salmon was not cooked all the way through, I'm sure it was intentional but I like my fished cooked unless I am getting sushi. Besides that, it was tasty. --The pork prime rib entree. My boyfriend got this and gobbled it up, I had a bite and it was too salty for my taste.  --The Buffalo chicken appetizer. Good, but not fantastic. The OK: --The waiter gave us our drinks, and did not come back to our table until after the appetizers and right when we got our entree. It would have been nice to been able to order another drink. --We didn't get the popcorn. WTF? Overall, I would go there again but try a different entree. The entrees were decent sized, but I would recommend getting an appetizer too if you want to be full.
