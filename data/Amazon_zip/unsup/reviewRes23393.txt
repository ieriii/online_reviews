Again and again, Greek Islands does not disappoint. I studied abroad in Greece, so I will say I have high standards of Greek food. I have tried many of the other places in Greektown, and this is still my favorite. The service, food, atmosphere all combine for a great experience. I always take my out of town guests to this restaurant and everyone is impressed by the authenticity and fun experience. The restaurant offers all of my favorite traditional Greek dishes. The place is huge and the service is fast, so even if there seem to be a lot of people waiting, it moves very quickly. I love the Greek taverna feel and actual Greek servers. Some favorites of the food include: -Tzaziki Dip: Just like how it should be, not the American mayo-based type. This is fresh and made with real Greek yogurt, much healthier too! - Horiatiki Salad: traditional Greek salad, no lettuce, just tomatoes, feta, cucumbers, onion, peppers, and olives. So simple, so fresh, so good - Horta: boiled greens. I feel in love with these in Greece. Very simple, great with some fresh lemon and olive oil. Hard to find outside of Greek town -Moussaka: a traditional favorite. I love that they have the vegetarian version. The bechemal sauce on top s so rich, yet so good - Spanikopita: my personal favorite. I usually just get the appetizer size, but I like that its still the style that is baked in a large pan, rather than small bite-sized pieces. More spinach and feta!  The have a great combo option where you can get half orders of two of the traditional dishes. I definitely recommend this for indecisive diners. Portions are huge, so expect to leave stuffed (in a good way!)
