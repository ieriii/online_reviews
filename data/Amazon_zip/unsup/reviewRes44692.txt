Food: Very good deep dish pizza. As others have said, it will take 30-45 mins before your food comes out. It is a very cheesy pizza and I would even suggest telling the waiter to go light on the cheese. It really makes no sense that there is so much cheese on a pizza. Kind of a turn off honestly. The crust is nice and doughy yet flakey. Very filling pizza. Even "real men" would eat it with a fork/knife. If you are in a party of two please get the size lower than medium. I would assume that is a small. There is no way in the world that two people (man + woman) can finish a medium pizza. Too much food. All of that cheese doesn't help either. If you can, call in advance to place your order so you won't be sitting at your table for ever. Workers: No complaints. Atmosphere: Default. Overall: If you are in the area, go.
