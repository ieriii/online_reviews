A few years back I went here on the 4th of July. It was one of the only places open. My experience wasn't all that great. I felt pressured to try one of their microbrews when all I wanted was a soda. Oh well. I don't remember the details, but that bummer first experience kept me going back for some reason. A few weeks back, though, we got a FANTASTIC pizza for pickup. I'm not a huge fan of super greasy, extra cheesy pizza, and we got the "plain" version. Not the cheapest pizza, but quite tasty. I am kind of kicking myself for unintentionally boycotting this place for a couple of years.
