Having been to the other Rick Bayless Mecca, Topolobampo, several times, I was eager to dine at Frontera Grill (finally!) and compare the two. Although both boast authentic Mexican, the concepts of the two are entirely different. My trips to Topolobampo were excellent, but I found Frontera's menu and service to be much more approachable and fun. Delicious and rustic Mexican (like we all know) at its absolute best, hands down. They don't call Rick Bayless the king of Mexican in the U.S. for nothing.  The margaritas, shaken tableside, are not to miss. And the guacamole is probably the BEST I'd ever had (there was some kind of roasted pepper bits in the guac - I swear! - which was an unusual and amazing twist). Simple, well-made and wonderfully flavored Mole enchiladas were my entree of choice. Loved them! There were really well-done basics on the menu, as well as a few more elegant-style dishes such as duck tacos or barbacoa w/ pineapple, OR Chef Bayless' famed Tongue Tacos, as see on Top Chef Masters. Yum Yum. My only complaint - NO RESERVATIONS! The cattle line up like crazy for this place, and when it opened at 5, and we got there at 5:05, we were already up to 2 hr wait for 2 people. We waited a full 2 hrs too. It was worth it thought - but annoying at the same time. Just accept a reservation why don't ya!?
