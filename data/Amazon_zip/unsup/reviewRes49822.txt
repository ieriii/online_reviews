Years ago I came here and it was a 4 star restaurant. Now it is a 3 star. The wines list is okay, but I do like the extensive by the glass selection for flights. Really great cheese menu. The food itself that they actually cook is just so-so. So, if you want wine and cheeses- good place to come. If you want a really good meal- don't expect anything special
