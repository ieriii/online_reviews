Great for an imtimate and fun eveining. Yes they use oil,,soy oil,,,and yes, you will leave smelling like you've been frying food, lol, but it's a great place to cozy up, and have a great night! Our food has always been fresh, service has always been prompt and fantastic, they are very accomodationg, my husband has a shellfish allergy, I have a shellfish obsession.....and they happily provide any extras that we've ever needed, I'm a bit of a broccoli, potatoe, and horseradish hog,,,,bar service has also always been an A+ Love, Love, Love
