Love, love, love the food here. I've always wanted to try Ethiopian food and I'm glad I did. The tangy bread, sambussas, and platters to share were excellent.Service was good and they were helpful at explaining what the different items on the menu were. The only thing I didn't care for was the dessert, way too sweet!
