If you're wanting great sushi, at a decent price, with some great service and nice atmosphere, this is the place to go. Coast has a great space, with two joining dining spaces and limited seating at the sushi bar itself. They take reservations, and I recommend that you make one if you want to have an "adult dinner time" at/after 7pm. If you don't, you could wait for a bit. Also, it's BYOB....with a 7-11 across the street and boozy shop up on the corner in case you forget to bring your beverages. The sushi always tastes fresh, and the servers will help you figure out which rolls your table would like if there are picky sushi eaters. They do specials depending on the season, and I have never had a bad experience when I've tried them. Their dragon roll is the best I've had in the city, and their shitake roll is delicious (there's something in the marinade they use). Other recommendations would be the spicy tuna and ceviche rolls! P.S. Their take-out is pretty good, too, and is quick!
