Best Italian Restaurant in Chicago! This place is me and my husbands favorite go-to place to fill our italian craving. The portions are generous and the price is reasonable as well. We've never ordered something that didnt taste great which makes this place perfect for always trying something new on the menu. If you want Italian- Calo's is a must.
