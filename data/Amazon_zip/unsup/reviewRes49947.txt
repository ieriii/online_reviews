Not a fan of the layout of Fifty/50, but we've always managed to have a good time here. The key things being: 1) if we're in a large group and don't want to be talking over a million people, we get seated at the very top floor 2) go when DJ Avi Sic is there (she's heavy on old school Hip-hop, JazzHop, Breakbeats, R&B but is unfortunately at Evil Olive, Frontier and Butterfly Social more nowadays). There are some comfier booths by the bar that's probably good for a party of 6-8, but they're right across from the bathrooms, so I'd rather get the table space upstairs even though the seating isn't as comfy. If you want to do a spicy Man vs. food - esque competition with your buddies go for the Hell Burger. That thing is a trip! Only for extreme spicy fans though. The size of their wings are also fairly large, no dinky Buff Joe's wings here, my friends. Get plenty of waffle fries (add chili or bacon if you'd like) to munch on while you gulp down those beers.
