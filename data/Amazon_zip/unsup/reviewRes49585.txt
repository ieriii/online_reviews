Very solid four stars. The skirt steak / chicken combo was just terrific - perfectly done, spiced up well, with great sides. I ate everything in front of me. If I could have licked the plate, I would have. They do have a vegetarian section on the menu as well which was a surprise for a meat centric place. Ohhhhh and the caipirinhas, perfectly made nicely boozy and tart. I was talked into having two. Maybe it was three. Very nice room, comfortable for a casual meal or a dressed up event. It can get a bit loud. A few notes. There is some strange cellphone deadzone here. No signal at all, even out on the sidewalk. And no wifi either. Think of it... you will actually have to engage in real, uninterrupted conversation with your dinner partner. And there is this issue of Las Tablas being listed as a BYOB restaurant. This is only honored during the week, and NOT ON THE WEEKEND. There were three others including my party that had shown up with wine in tow, only to go home with it. They were nice enough to keep it behind the bar for us while we ate. The upside... well... those caipirinhas.....
