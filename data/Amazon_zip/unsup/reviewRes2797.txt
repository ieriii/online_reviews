So, what could I possibly say about Tru that has not already been said a thousand times. Well, I once sent back a dish at Tru...it was lobster. My wonderful and gracious boyfriend at the time was rather disturbed that I was sending something back at Tru. But, it was my anniversary dinner, and I did not feel like eating the lobster so away it went! My favorite part of Tru --- the cart of petit fours and chocolate!  Yummy! I love you Tru!
