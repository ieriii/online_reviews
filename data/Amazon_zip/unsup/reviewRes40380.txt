The experience here can be quite mixed, but the food is always excellent for a VERY minimal price. For $3.60, I can dine in and get a steak tostada, rice and beans, and chips and salsa - a feat not even possible at taco bell. And I can never finish it all, even when I am ravenous. This is my new go-to place for a cheap lunch or dinner for one, and it's is also a place I am happy to bring friends when we want a cheap dinner date. Here are my random thoughts/advice on the place: I highly recommend the tostada over a taco - even though the tostada is more difficult to eat, it contains many more additional (and essential) toppings to the taco. The steak tostada contains generous amounts of steak. The service is hit or miss. I've done carry out and had my food within 2 minutes, I've dined in and had excellent service, and I've dined in and was basically ignored (and had to just leave my money on the table because it was impossible to get my bill). But for under $5, that inconsistency is tolorable. I'm not exactly a fan of the interior, and it's smell turns me off a bit. A few open windows would help air out the place. But when you eat in, you get free chips and salsa. When you carry out, you don't. So I am often willing to put up with the dining room just to get my free chips and pico de gallo.
