India House covers all the popular dishes of the subcontinent, and does it pretty well. My quibble is about their prices (although the lunch buffet it decent value), which don't seem justified by the food. Maybe it's because I have a sneaking suspicion I could make most of it myself just as well at home? Anyhoo, it's a nice place to take people who want an introduction to Indian food - the menu has a huge range of dishes, and the atmosphere is pretty, with paintings, tapestries and muted colors. Try it once, and decide for yourself.
