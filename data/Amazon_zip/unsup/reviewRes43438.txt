Art of Pizza ranks at the top of my list for the best pizza in Chicago. To put it plainly, their stuffed pizza is amazing. I cannot attest to any of the other food, since the only thing I've ever had is the stuffed pizza. Truthfully, the rest of their menu would probably be a disappointment since the pizza is that good. Sometimes there can be a long wait for delivery, but it's worth it.
