For the past year I have lived down the street from Wilde Bar. I have came back now a handful of times and I have to say I have never had a good experience. The food at Wilde is all super rich- even the salads are loaded with cheese and some type of creamy, fatty dressing. The entrees that I have had have been just decent, nothing more. But what REALLY bothers me about this place is the service. It is absolutely horrendous. The last time we were there, the waiter must have been drunk or on something. He kept complaining about how busy the restaurant was while there were only 4 tables in the whole place, and "Thats why the service was so slow". He actually ended up giving us a discount before we even asked. This place has potential from the good beer list and location, but its a for sure fail in my book.
