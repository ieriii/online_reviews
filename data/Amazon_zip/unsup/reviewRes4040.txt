I almost decided to write a one word review: LARDO. Then I decided that a few more points needed to be mentioned. The rest of the courses that didn't include lardo were pretty awesome as well. Amazing creativity, solid flavors and great staff. Thanks for taking extra special care of us. ;) Looking forward to coming back.
