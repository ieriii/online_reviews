I wish I could eat everyday like I did at Brazzaz! I went on a weekend afternoon with my family and we left all smiles and our stomachs satisfied. The service was phenomenal and the staff there just made us feel comfortable. Their appreciation of the customers felt very sincere. Brazzaz is a meat eaters paradise. Sausage, chicken, lamb, steaks, filet mignon and the list goes on. The buffet had a great variety and my favorite dish from it was the risotto. I was surprised at how delicious it was! Brazzaz is definitely a place for special occasions. It's a little pricey for most people but I think it's definitely worth it, especially if you like meat and come hungry!
