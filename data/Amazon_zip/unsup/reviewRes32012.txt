After passing by Demera frequently, a friend of mine scored a Groupon and we finally checked it out. Everything was perfect! With the Groupon, we got an appetizer (sambussa sampler, excellent), wine, a messob platter and a dessert. Everything was excellent! We also had the strong, intoxicating coffee. Our desert included two nut-filled pastries on a plate of raspberry sauce, which we ended up devouring - it was difficult to refrain from licking the plate! And the staff was very helpful and friendly. Yes to everything
