I really wanted to like pho. I really really did. But, after trying it - I'm not sure. I'm going to give it a few more tries before I make a solid decision on it. So, my boyfriend has been raving about pho for a long time now and he said that this restaurant is one of the best in the area. He used to live in the area for college so he ate here pretty often. So, I figured, he knew what he was talking about. Also, I've heard a lot about pho and saw an article in the RedEye about this so I figured that if I was going to have pho - I should have the best. We arrived around 1:45 and the place was pretty packed. We waited a few minutes and were seated at a table by the window, which was great for people watching.  We ordered the pork friend egg rolls to start. We then shared the sliced beef pho with double meat and a Vietnamese sandwich with marinated beef. I loved the egg rolls and the sandwich. I loved the marinated beef and the crisp vegetables on the sandwich. In terms of the pho, I liked the meat, but found it a bit chewy when it got cold. And, I was not a big fan of the broth. Maybe I'm just too used to udon and ramen, but I found the taste weird and not salty enough. Again, I'll give it a few more tries before I make a solid decision.
