Sabatino's is the best Italian restaurant on the north side bar none. First of all, it reminds you of one of those old school places gangsters eat at in movies. The food is great top to bottom, the minestrone soup is the best and their meat sauce would be good on a shoe. Rich's special is a good way to taste a variety of things on the menu at a great price. And nothing beats the baked Alaska for special occasions. For great food, and awesome food at a phenomenal price nothing beats Sabatino's.
