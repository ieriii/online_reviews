Now that I no longer live in Wicker Park, I find myself missing Sultan's Market. If you don't mind long lines and brusque service, the cheap and delicious food is worth it. Bonus points for the plentiful vegan options, including the dry but inexplicably tasty $1 vegan date cookies. My old review of this place was pretty hateful. Maybe it's because I always went after working out at Bucktown Fitness across the street and my testosterone level was elevated every time I went. Regardless, if you're at all Type A about slo-mo service and cashiers who disappear for 10 minutes at a time, you might want to adjust your expectations before setting foot in here.
