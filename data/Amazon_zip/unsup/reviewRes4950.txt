Yum? Hell yes. Was it worth the 1.5 hour wait? Well, I had the right company along with me so it wasn't as bad. The decor is cute, very very cute. The atmosphere is great but I swear I was yelling the whole time. It's definitely one of those places that you go to for a chill atmosphere and the prices were really friendly for being a trendy place. We ordered literally everything. Ok, not literally. But the ribeye definitely made a huge dent in our wallets with the millions of other things we ordered. I was a bit disappointed with the cheeses. The portions were tiny, but the bread and the cured meats were fantastic starters. Get the prosciutto for sure. We had the olives, turkey leg, prosciutto bread balls, ... Holy crap I can't remember everything we got. Everything was perfectly seasoned, perfectly marinated, and perfectly cooked. The turkey leg was a little on the sweet side for me, but cooked very nicely. The wine choices are extremely wide as well. Both the cocktail waitress and the waitress who served us was friendly, but sometimes you can't help but feel that the suggestions they make are always the pricier ones haha. I had a great experience and would go again, but the star is knocked down because it was sooo loud. It's not very well designed inside with some high tables, some low tables. The communal thing is sort of a knock off of avec and blackbird... But food was amazing. Oh I think I left my sweater there. Sigh
