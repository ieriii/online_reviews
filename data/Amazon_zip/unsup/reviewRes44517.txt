This place is amazing! I have been here probably 50 times, but I'm not sure why I didn't review it before now. Their maki are the best I have ever had and I used to get take out from here at least once a week when I lived in the neighborhood. Definitely worth going to if you want good sushi. I am in love with the snow white maki and the sweet potato maki - yum!  Only drawback are that the place is small so there is usually a wait and last I wen they did not take reservations. Despite these minor issues, I still very highly recommend.
