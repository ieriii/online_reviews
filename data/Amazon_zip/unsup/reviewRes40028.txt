24 Hour Korean BBQ? Ummm...YEAH! This place is awesome after painting the town. The service is decent, and the food is crazy delicious! I have been here many times and have had a consistently good experience. I would definitely go back again. This isn't the best place for Vegetarian folk, but you would still be able to find something on the menu. My only criticism is that the meat could be of better quality...but it sure does taste good!
