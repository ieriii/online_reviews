Yes, I'll be back. No, I won't get a room. Yes, I'll eat but I will try the burger. Had the steak and it was not great. It was way too salty, tough, and it lacked anything that went with it. The entree lists asparagus, but they didn't say it was just decoration (three little tips). The desert was good, but not out of this world. I love that they have $3 Old Style and $3 whiskey pours. In this economy, it's nice to know that if you're broke before payday, you can at least have a cheap beer to get out of the house. The space is beautiful. The layout is not the typical shotgun room you find in Chicago (long bar, narrow space). The decor is simple but elegant. It reminds me of a high end pub in London's Camden Town (same type of vibe too).  One thing to be aware of is the 'hood rats if you go late at night. It is too close to Diversy Ave, where they tent to congregate. Try and avoid parking towards Diversy if you drive.
