Um, yum! What took me so long to check this place out? The food was really perfect. I had a special black cod and my mom had the pork chop. Loved both. Also enjoyed the Brussles Sprouts (they had me at Brie and Bacon). They had really nice wines by the glass. At first glance they seemed a bit pricey, but once they bring them out, you really get more than a glass so it seems to even out. Plus this space is really nice. Love it!
