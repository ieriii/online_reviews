Been there twice lately, once on a Saturday morning, the other on a Sunday morning. I understand that it is the busiest time and all, so I came prepared for a wait. On the Saturday, it was also Lolla weekend, so the wait was close to an hour and half for two people. During the wait, J and I split a cinnamon roll to tide over our hunger- it was good, wish it was warm and gooey though. The Sunday brunch, it was only 20 minutes. I got the spinach florentine benedict- it was good, it came with fruit and potatoes- average. Got a side of corn beef hash- below average. The next time I went, I got the crepes combo. Came with sausage, bacon, and eggs. The crepes were good, it came plain, but I wanted some strawberries on it. It was not worth $2 for a few slices of strawberries though- it should have been smothered in it! I found out later that I could have "upgraded" to a specialty crepe for the exact same price of the few slices of strawberries! Oh well. It takes a bit long to get food, both times, the table next to us got their food first, even though we ordered first... no biggie, not the servers fault, its the kitchen. Must be something we ordered. Overall, a good place to eat, just a little expensive $40 for brunch for two people (with sides and add ons).
