Went to Mastro's on New Year's Eve with 6 people. I carefully went over some food allergies and was assured they would be handled properly. Well, they weren't, which led me to getting quite ill.When I called to speak to a manager about it, I got a lot of sympathy and was told the manager would check with the staff and get back to me. But she never did, and even avoided me when I called back several days later.This is unacceptable for a restaurant in this price range. Not only was my $99 steak - ordered since it supposedly met my allergy needs - overcooked and tasteless, other people at our table had really unacceptable food. And then to ignore carefully-explained health needs is inexcusable. There are lots of other steak houses in Chicago - Mastro's should be avoided.
