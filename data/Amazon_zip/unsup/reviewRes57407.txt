I really liked this place. coming from the Bay Area, and being around so many wonderful mexican/latin restaurants I really wanted to find one out here and I sure did, I like the neighborhood, and ofcourse I really liked the food here. They greet you so kindly when you come in, the patio is nice- who doesn't like that? and the margaritas are super good
