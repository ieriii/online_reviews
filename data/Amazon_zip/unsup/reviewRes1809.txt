Man I love Doug and his delicious sausages... No matter how many times I come and how long I wait it is still a pleasure. With a keen taste on flavor combinations and an obviously adventurous spirit Doug can do no wrong (although some of his specials aren't ALWAYS on.) As if the food wasn't enough, constantly reading stories about how cool Doug is and how he has such a following makes it a pleasure to give up my cash to him. see this thread on lth for more: http://lthforum.com/bb/v
