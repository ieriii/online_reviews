Rick Bayless, I would be happy if your food was my last meal! I would fly from NY to Chicago just to eat here. There is no question that this is THE BEST mexican food that we have ever eaten and we eat out alot! We had a 9:30pm reservation that one month ago. We arrived at 9:10pm and our table was already available.  We started off with 2 margaritas. R had the Blue Agave and I had the Mezcal which was STRONG!  Then Rob had the Mexican craft beer which was delicious.  As a wise man once said, life is too short to drink light beer. For appetizers we had the chips, salsa and guac. There were 2 types of salsa - a green one and a spicy smokey red one. I enjoyed all of them, but given that they give you salsa with the other apps and the entrees and chips came with the ceviche, I would not order the chips, salsa and guac next time. In addition to the above, (we have to gorge because how often do you get to eat such amazing food), we had the ceviche trio and the gorditas carnitas. The trio was good, tasty and tart while the gorditas WAS AMAZING. Probably one of the best mexican dishes I've had (and I am salivating thinking about it now). For entrees, we had the chicken mole which had a very unique coconut based mole sauce and very tender chicken. R had the steak which I could not stop eating. If we did not try R's steak, the chicken would have been my favorite dish but the steak was extremely flavorful. We wish we had room for dessert but by this time, we were beyond stuffed!
