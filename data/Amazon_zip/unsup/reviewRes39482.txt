The best part about this place is the banchan (appetizers) and the generous portions of meat! I like the unmarinated kalbi (short ribs), which was really fresh. My fiance had the marinated kalbi and he thought the marinate was just ok, not great. We had leftover meat which never happened to us before at other restaurants! The meat dishes are $18-20 each and you have to order 2 (you choose) to have it cooked at the table. The bbq meats come with the banchan, rice and soup.  I hope to come back again!
