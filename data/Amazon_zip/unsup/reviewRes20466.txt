We arrived just before breakfast was over and didn't have to wait in line which I heard was very lucky! We ordered the wood-oven Chilaqulles with both scrambled eggs and chicken.  The presentation was picture perfect and the flavor was good however I did add quite a bit of their two homemade salsas to it.  The locally roasted coffee was very tasty.  The empanada (egg and pablano) was a bit doughy and bland. I would recommend a visit to XOCO and wished we had been able to try the breakfast torta but they had stopped serving. The portions are not huge so you are able to sample several of their menu offerings!
