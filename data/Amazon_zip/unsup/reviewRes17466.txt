Funny thing is I worked at this place as a bartender for a few months. I have to say the drinks are not the greatest. They are to sweet. They used one of my drinks on the menu the Cantina Verde. Wonder if it is still on the menu? The food is top notch I spent a lot of my down time checking out the kitchen. The lamb chops are better than Gibsons. They use a wood fire grill which adds flavor. Yes the place is huge and things will go wrong. The ceviche is good, the chefs in that place are great the kitchen is like an assembly line its insane the volume of food they produce in a night. Yes sometimes you can wait a while to get a seat. My recomendation is to ask your server what he or she would eat if they came here. The staff get to try all the food and specials so they know how it tastes. Oh the best thing is the meat and cheese plate.
