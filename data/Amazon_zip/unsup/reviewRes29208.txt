One of Chicago's hidden gems! I cannot even tell you how many times I ate at the Pasta Bowl when I was a poor college student. This place is perfect if you are on a budget but still want to go out for a great meal with friends. The pasta portions are big enough to take leftovers home and the prices are amazingly cheap! Take a cab or bus because the chances of finding parking around Fullerton and Clark are nil. I highly recommend the chicken farfalle pasta, I order it every time.
