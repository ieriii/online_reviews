If you're in Chicago on a Sunday night, have a spare $6 and some scratch for a few drinks, you can't go wrong with the Green Mill. Even if you've got other plans -- this should *at least* be your backup plan. Sunday night Poetry Slam has never failed to be a great time. Marc Smith is probably one of the most accessible, friendly icons that you'll ever meet, and if you're standing at the bar during the break, he's about as likely to start a conversation with you as he is with anybody -- he's just that friendly.The staff. I've learned by observation -- be cool, respectful with the staff and they'll be cool and respectful with you. They're professionals, not peons.
