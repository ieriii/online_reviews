You say you want a revolution.... Well, you and about every other person in the city of Chicago. Jam packed at an early hour on a Wednesday night. All I can tell you is brother you have to wait. We'll take it to the bar. Let's have a gander at this brew and food lineup. Impressive. Most impressive. I continued mulling over my options while chatting up the Man versus Food doppelganger that explained the whole growler thing to me. Good options abound. My partner in crime had the Cross of Gold and I had the Wit. I enjoyed the wit, but later discovered another selection that eluded my cursory perusal. About this time we were shown to our table off to the back of the main room and settled in to get our chow on. Round two first. This is where things got out of hand. Goose Island Bourbon County Stout. I'm not crazy about wimpy little pours in those snifters, but this beer was incredible and smelled like a rick-house at one of the bourbon distilleries scattered across the Bluegrass. We're gonna need some food stat. I took full advantage of having another hungryman to help me out with things and we started with the Applewood Smoked Wings and the Soft Pretzel, Dusseldorf mustard & cheddar ale dip. Both were excellent and big portions for sharing. The mustard that came with the pretzel was great. We both got the Smoked Pulled Pork with South Carolina-style mustard sauce, honey-jalapeno slaw. You don't see the Carolina style bbq that often and they did it well. I recommend this one if that mustardy cue is what you like. The food was great and we devoured every bit in front of us. We caught up over round two of the Bourbon Stout, whose 13% abv hit me like Tyson in the Hangover. Don't you know it's gonna be all right.
