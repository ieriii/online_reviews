Coming here since 1988 - way too may years... BY FAR the greatest taco on earth - well Definitely the States - as I have had some amazing ones on the streets of Mexico. Common ritual: +One Barbacoa Taco everything (means cilantro, onion and hot sauce) plus cheese + One Carne Asada Taco with everything (means cilantro, onion and hot sauce) plus cheese And then you are very happy sitting at the east side location (yes - 3 locations right across the street from one another - confusing, but who cares when its THAT good) - its my fav - but sometimes hard to get a stool at the tiny tiny counter - second choice location would be north on the west side. Enjoy!
