I went here with a lady friend who lives in the area on a Saturday night. She had the wisdom to pop in ahead of my arrival and get us on the wait list which was at about 1 hr and 10 minutes wait. We had a couple drinks at Cole's across the street during the wait which I also recommend. Anyway we popped over about 5 minutes before we were supposed to be seated and got sat as soon as we walked in which was great. We started with mussels and they were very good, lots of them too. We had various beers and I really liked them all, each one did a great job at the style it went after in my opinion. I have become such a snob its hard to impress me but Revolution did a excellent job in this department. For our mains dishes I had the buffalo chicken pizza and my date had the burger that comes with an egg on it (I forget what it was called). We were both quite happy with what we got, the pizza was actually a pretty good size for one person. I ate 3/4 of it. The chicken itself isn't too spicy but the sauce has a decent kick to it, nothing hard to handle though. The only negative comment I have is that it was LOUD. Seriously one of the loudest restaurants I've ever been to. This was totally excusable to me though as it was around 9 or 10 on a Saturday night in a pretty hopping neighborhood. Our waitress was pretty awesome and helpful. I will definitely be returning to Revolution.
