I can honestly say I lust over Nuevo Leon. The food is awesome, the prices are great, and the service is top notch. It's BYOB which keeps the costs low and there is a liquor store right next door. They also have parking which is hard to find in Pilsen. I'm hoping the family that owns this place will consider adopting this chubby gringa. I make some mean quesadillas!
