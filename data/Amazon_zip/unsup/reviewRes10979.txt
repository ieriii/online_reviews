This place has had some harsh reviews about service. Yes we got jambed into a corner for 30 minutes waiting for a table, and yes the bussers are in a rush to get you in and out, but the food came out fast and delicious and the waitress was great. She gave us plenty of time to decide from the odd choices we were presented and our coffee was constantly refilled. When we were done she gave us the check quickly and must have asked us 10 times if everything was ok. And they took our plates and returned with doggy bags in no time. Great place, 30 minute wait time was at about 9:30 am on a Saturday.  Basically, cool place, I'd go every once in a while for something different.
