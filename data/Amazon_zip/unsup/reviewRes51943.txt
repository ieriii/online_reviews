My out of town friend had a hankering for pizza so we came here as it was closest to her hotel. Now, in the interest of full disclosure, I am a Lou Malnati's fan. We arrived last night and was informed that they do not seat until your entire party was there. But I think the hostess might have been a drill sargent at once in her life because she commanded us to sit down. We slinked behind her and opted for the bar and my bf kindly said thank you knowing I wanted to kick her in the teeth. The bartender had about 20 plates in the air, he had a pretty full bar of diners/drinkers and was getting drinks ready for the servers. He reassured us he'd be with us in a minute and he was. When our +2 arrived, we were told again to sit down in the waiting room. When another table came buy, the hostess commanded us to move all the way over to the end of the chairs/bench so the next table and the next table could sit and wait. I kinda felt like I was at Ed Debevic's except instead of sassy, I got bitchy. But anyway. Our server was efficient, but not attentive, he was very nice, but really busy. The food arrived in an ample amount of time - its pizza afterall! Admittedly, I didnt love the pizza - I thought the crust was overcooked and the veggies in the pizza itself werent cooked enough. So, yeah - this business isnt ever going to closed down because of its proximity to so much tourism, but I wont be making a point to head back.
