I was more than happy about my stay at Hotel 71. I know what some of the reviewers are complaining about because the first room I was assigned to was horrible. The internet didn't work and the bathroom looked a little worn (toilet made noises and the shower looked outdated). I called to complain about the internet connection so they moved me right away to a different room. The new room was the jackpot. Pros: - free internet - VERY spacious room and even more spacious bathroom - the bathroom was the cleanest and most modernized bathrooms I've seen that wasn't in a 5 star hotel (there was a flat screen in the bathroom). - good location. I was able to walk to most anywhere I needed to go along State St and Mich. Ave. Cons: - not the best view I would definitely stay here again and make sure that I stay in one of the renovated rooms.
