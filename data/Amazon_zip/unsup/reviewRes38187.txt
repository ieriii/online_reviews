My wonderful beautiful girlfriend had to work in Chicago in just flew back with pizza'(S) from every top reviewed pizzeria-this is my first sampling. The stuffed concept at first separates the sensations between the cheese and the sauce and ingredients. The sauce is pretty mild but you get a good onion aroma and taste which counteracts that. The cheese is grade A-and I imagine one of the more expensive ingredients. Now the important part-THE CRUST...it is Chicago perfection-fluffy and chewy on the inside, crunchy and just right on the outside.  This was my 4th favorite out of the 4 that I tried (although still really great! I think I like traditional over stuffed) *Note-micorwaved the first slice and was not as impressed as when I reheated in the oven.
