I have been to Lockdown several times now. Everything I have had there has been amazing.  I always get the Big House (BBQ sauce, cheddar, and bacon) and it is always excellent. It is served on a pretzel bun, which is just a little crunchy on the outside, but soft and chew on the inside. I have to admit that I have never tried their fries because every time I go I get a side order of mac & cheese with my burger instead. Their mac & cheese is silky, smooth, and has lots of flavor. I love the fact that they put bacon and green onions in it, then they top it off with some bread crumbs.  If you are going there with someone and do not feel like eating heavy, their salads are also incredible. I have had the Billy the Kid Salad and loved it, but my weakness if for the Married to the Mob Salad. It has lettuce, of course, dried cherries, blue cheese, candied walnuts, and maple vinaigrette dressing which is perfectly sweet and just a little bit creamy.  Another added bonus is that I have had nothing but friendly, professional service every single time I have gone there, whether I dined in or carried out.  The only downside is that sometimes the music is just a little too loud and I can barely hear myself think, much less hear anyone talk. But the food is so good, I will tolerate the loud music anytime.
