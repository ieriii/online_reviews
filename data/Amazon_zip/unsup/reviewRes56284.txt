Officially added to my 'go-to' list. The staff is extremely friendly, the price is exceptionally reasonable and the food is wonderful! The soup is my favorite - chicken noodle - so much delicious food for so little money!The ambiance is nothing to write home about but great food for a great value.I highly recommend.
