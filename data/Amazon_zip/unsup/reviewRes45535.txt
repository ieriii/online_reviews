After recently discovering the proximity and many delish restaurants lining Broadway street, we ventured down a little bit further to Wilde. It was pretty packed, and we figured crowds were always a good sign. I had the chicken dublin sandwich while my companion tried the chicken pot pie. I started with a side salad with their garlic ranch dressing which is very delicious and maybe the favorite part of my meal. The salad itself was a little bland lacking cheese, but they had croutons made out of pumpernickel which was a nice twist. The sandwich was soggy the bread dripping with juice from the mushrooms that were included in the dish. It was very disappointing to eat a dripping mess instead of a crisp piece of bread. My companion however thoroughly enjoyed his chicken pot pie, complimenting everything from the flaky crust to the the plentiful amounts of chicken included in the dish. I wouldn't recommend Wilde's there's tons of other restaurants in the area that have been much better. Although the atmosphere is charming and if you're looking for a place that seconds as a bar for predrinking then this might be your spot.
