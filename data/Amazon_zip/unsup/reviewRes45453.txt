Wilde has a really cozy atmopshere. It's got some gorgeous stained glass on the ceiling and books lining the walls. The big booth we piled into was comfy brown leather. It was like hunkering down for some comfort food in your grandpa's study. The service was quick and they got all our little details of "dressing on the side, no nuts, subsitute fries for mashed, subsitute fries for sweet potatoe" etc etc etc all correct. I got the steakhouse salad and it was cooked just right and it wasn't drowned in dressing. It really hit the spot after a long day of traveling. My martini was nothing standout but it was a quality pour. My friend next to me got the chicken pot pie topped with mashed potatoes and cheese. That would have killed me to eat myself but the few bites I snagged were really delicious. I'd say this place is a great place to stop in when you're looking for a simple, satisfying meal, good service, and a decent drink but it's nothing to go out of your way for.
