Just went for brunch. Obviously the food was delicious. They really know what to do with sauces; I particularly enjoyed the five spice mustard with the egg sandwich, but the dressing on the mixed greens was also awesome. My bloody mary was great, if a bit big for my taste. In general, the food was great, as were the portions (not too big). It seemed reasonably priced on the menu, but things added up more than they usually do for brunch. It was approximately $80 for 3 people. Worth it if someone else is paying though, for sure, or if you can resist the drinks.
