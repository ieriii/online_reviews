Went to Superdawg for the first time and I was slightly disappointed. It wasn't bad, but it did not live up to the hype. The food is pretty good but not great. I personally don't see what the big deal is about having my food brought to my car. The lot is tiny, jam-packed, and nearly impossible to navigate, even in my compact car. It's located at a big busy 3-way angle intersection, making it difficult to access from most directions. You have to ask someone from the kitchen to let you into a door in the rear of the building by the garbage in order to use the bathroom. The prices are a little high but not terrible. Overall, it's decent, just not worth all the hype. Visit if you're in the area but don't go much out of your way for it.
