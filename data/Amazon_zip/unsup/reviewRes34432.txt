A great place if you are craving a scramble or some pancakes. When I've gone with people since the opening of the new location on Ohio, the eggs have been a little under/over cooked. Apparently they moved all the good cooks to the new location? They have really good pancakes that come with fruit and such. Also, their skillets are my favorite. If you want a jam-packed breakfast/brunch this is the way to go.
