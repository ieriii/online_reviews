My favorite seafood restaurant in the world as well as my favorite restaurant in general!!!! The atmosphere is very romantic and great for a special date. The service is also great. Definitely come here hungry because you will leave stuffed. We literally left and instead of catching a cab right away we walked a couple blocks just to walk off some of the food. So worth it though!!!! I literally dream about their crab legs! I want to come back just to try their sushi and oysters. DEFINITELY RECOMMEND!!!!
