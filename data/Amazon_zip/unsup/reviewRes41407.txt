underground is not so underground but nonetheless it made for an excellent date with my husband. the price is fantastic for a five course meal (though we normally dont spend $50+ per person on food alone - but this was special :) loved the atmosphere and the way they spaced out each course. we were able to talk, relax and anticipate the next course without feeling stuffed and bloated! big props for catering to my dairy allergy: anything on the menu that had dairy was substituted on the spot! as for dessert, only the icing on the cake had dairy so they gave me a piece w/o it and added berries to the dish! loved it - heard others say it was too sweet so looks like i got the better deal!
