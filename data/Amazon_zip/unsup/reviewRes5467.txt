This place lived up to the expectations. The food is as good as advertised. There are many unique and tasty dishes I loved. The food is worth every penny. It is not a great place for an intimate dinner though, since it is smaller and gets crowded. It is a fun atmosphere though. Downside is no reservations. If you go during peak times, it is quite a wait.
