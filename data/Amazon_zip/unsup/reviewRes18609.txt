One of the best BYOB places I've been to. Great food and decently priced! Place was very small and tight, and busy.. but the servers were great. I had some Tri- Color Rotolo dish..it was one of the best pasta dishes I've had in Chicago... not to mention someone else at my table had the Gorgonzola stuffed Gnocchis.. which was amazing. I believe all of their pastas are handmade.
