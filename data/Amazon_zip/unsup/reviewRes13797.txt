My wife and I went on a Friday night - it was packed! But I guess I'd rather be in a restaurant filled with people having a good time than getting right in - those places are typically pretty mediocre. I'm kind of a "gastropub" craving kind of guy - I love great beer and great food. What more could I ask. I'm thrilled that these type so places are popping up all over Chicago. This place didn't disappoint in any way and left me craving for more. We finally elbowed are way in to a couple of seats at the bat (good thing as the "triple" I was drinking was starting to get to me...). Started with some sweet potato cakes with a cumin sauce - fantastic! We then shared a burger (Gorgonzola, cremini shrooms, shallot) - perfectly grilled and a beautiful bun. Perhaps the best burger I've ever had (although I have not yet been to Kuma's Corner...that's next). We also shared the beet/goat cheese pizza - very good combo. And the beer....yum, yum! I can't wait to go back.
