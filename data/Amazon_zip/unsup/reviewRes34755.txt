I go to this place and I really like it, but it is kind of inconsistent. By the time I get there, at the end of the night, they are always out of something or at least scraping the bottom. I like the chicken shwarma but I feel that the quality has gone down recently. When I ordered in, they failed to give me pita and the type of rice I ordered. That being said, it is well priced and fast.
