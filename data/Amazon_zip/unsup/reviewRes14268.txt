I cannot wait to come back to this place!!! I had such a great experience and couldn't be happier that this place is so close to my place! Went with some girl friends last week to catch up. We were told it would be 1 1/2 hours for a table. No worries, there's beer to keep me company. We ordered our first round and went to find a spot by the fire place. I'm very much an IPA girl and this one did not disappoint! It was definitely very hoppy but delicious. I'm not sure how long it took until our table was ready b/c we had a waitress keeping us happy the entire time. For my second beer, I tried the Pale Ale. Much to my surprise, I almost liked this one better. It was very smooth and had great flavor. We, of course, ordered some bacon fat popcorn and yes, it's that good. We sat down and I got a good look at the menu. Everything looked great! Unfortunately, I had already had dinner so I was that girl that picked off of everyone's plates. The mushroom pizza was so good. The brushetta looked delicious. And then there was the salad with goat cheese. Wow! I can't wait until I come back to sample more of the menu! I brought home a growler of the IPA and an order of the popcorn to a very happy boyfriend. I didn't read the part about the mug club until it was too late but you can bet that we'll be joining and becoming regulars here! Selfishly, I hope the crowds die down so it's easier to get a table. :)
