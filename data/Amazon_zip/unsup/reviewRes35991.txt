This place is so popular! We came here at 1pm hoping the crowd would be less than the normal primetime brunch..but man still lots of people! This place was raved by many of my friends so I decided to come and see whats so good about it. We had a decent time. The food was good. I ordered the Down by the Farm skillet. This place gives a lot of meats over potatoes which is pretty good. Most brunch places I've been to, they normally load up on the potatoes but this place is the opposite. I liked it! My fiance ordered the panini. He said it's good but the bread is chewy. A pricey place for brunch, but it is good food.
