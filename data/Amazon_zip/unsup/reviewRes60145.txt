I am sure the fact that Tank Noodle is only a few steps away from my condo helps the rating......but besides that it is just THE place for delicious Pho and all sorts of other fantastic vietnamese food! I think I have tried almost every dish they offer in the last few years, and I have to say I was never disappointed. Everything is made with extremely fresh ingredients, the service is fast and nice, and it is one of the cleanest places I know.I also recommend take-out...for some reason I think the servings are even bigger then.5*****
