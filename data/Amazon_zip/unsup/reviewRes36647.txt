I have yet to order in for Sushi so I may rate higher at a later date. Here is what I have ordered twice for delivery... Tofu Pad Thai: $7.75 Miso Soup: $2.00 Each time the Pad Thai was flavorless and dry. A good amount of Tofu with minimal sprouts, scallions, carrots, cabbage. Dry, dry, dry... no flavor. The Miso Soup tasted good but had teeny-tiny pieces of Tofu. Teeny-tiny. One definite plus....FAST delivery! Overall... I have been a fan of Ben's Noodle & Rice on Bryn Mawr near the red line. To me... their Tofu Pad Thai is perfect/consistent EVERY time. It's been 5 years now and they haven't missed a beat with me.
