I love the pho here especially when there's plenty of tripe and tendon. Yum... I've also tried the other dishes and they were great as well. Price is very affordable.  So far I've only tried one thing I didn't like and that is the "fresh "coconut juice straight from the coconut. Blech. Being someone who grew up in southeast asia, i tend to get picky when it comes to so-called fresh coconuts. The coconut was mature not the kind of coconut juice you drink nor the coconut meat you eat. It's like drinking something disgusting from fear factor.
