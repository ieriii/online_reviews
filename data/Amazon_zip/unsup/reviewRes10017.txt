After so much hype about this place, my husband and I went for his birthday dinner on Tuesday. We were lucky to be able to sit on their gorgeous patio, as requested, enjoying every bit of one of the last best nights left in Chicago this season. Why do we live here again? But that's another story... The patio was definitely the highlight of the meal, but it was somewhat of a roller coaster after that. Our waiter was not very helpful and kept coming back every 30 seconds as we were trying to decide between the prixe fixe with the wine pairing and ordering off the regular menu. Finally, we went with ordering off the menu, because NO pasta dishes were on the prixe fixe and I was in the mood for some pasta. First of all, our apps arrived before our bottle wine. We ordered them at the same time and they both arrived quickly. Don't get me wrong, we were hungry, but we didn't want to have our nice romantic dinner be over in 35 minutes... Felt a little like a chop shop... Zucchini blossoms that we got were good, but only 3 little pieces on a plate. Panzanella salad was awfully soggy, especially since I just read in Cooks Illustrated about how NOT to make the bread soggy. Disappointing. Pasta was definitely an improvement. Their 4 cheese ravioli were pretty yummy, especially pine nuts adding a nice touch. A little too much butter... Their papperdelle with little veal meatballs, raisins and eggplant were pretty damn amazing though! Definitely the best part of the meal. Good coffee and good panna cotta. So, 3 stars is all it gets. 4 for the patio and 2-3 for the food. 2-3 for the service. There are much better Italian restaurants in Chicago!
