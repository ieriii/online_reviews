I've been screwed twice in the last two orders (for delivery). I guess this place is a victim of its own success. Most recently I ordered a thin crust 18 sauase, pepperoni pizza, and was told delivery would be 70 minutes. 120 minutes later the guy showed up, I paid him, and then a moment later found I'd received a deep dish veggie thing. I hate deep dish! I called them, and got this run around: "the guy is new...." and "we're really busy" and "we'll give you 50 pct off your next order." The order I placed several weeks ago was wrong also. It's decent pizza, but I'm not putting up with their incompetence. Screw them.
