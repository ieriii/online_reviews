Sultan's is amazing. The things they do to falafel should be illegal! They also offer it in varying degrees of spicy which is good for a wimp like myself. I also love their spinach pies. There are so many delicious foods here, I could go on and on but I'll spare you. I just love that when I come here, I'm able to choose from a list of vegetarian options rather than one or two items.
