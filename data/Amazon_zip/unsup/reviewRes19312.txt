My girlfriend and I stumbled in here on a Monday evening at 7 p.m. and were immediately seated. Though the space was a little dark (it was, after all, a beautifully sunny Chicago summer day!), the inside felt inviting. Our waitress was super nice and easy to talk to. We ordered three rolls and it was the perfect amount for us - a dragon roll, a cream roll and a fresh philly. Usually we go the veggie maki route and over-order but this time we were smart with the three (dragon was easily the largest). With BYOB as an option, our bill came out to $15/per person - one of the most affordable nights in Chicago I've had in quite some time! This review just made me hungry.
