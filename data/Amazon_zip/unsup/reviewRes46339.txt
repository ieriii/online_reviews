Liked it, didn't love it. I know it's a big tourist spot because it's right in the middle of Michigan Ave. shopping. Their menu is definitely huge, and they have all sorts of lunch combos (You can get 1/2 a pizza and a salad, or 1/2 a sandwich and soup, etc). They have all kinds of food and the portions are huge. I think the food is pretty good, but the place is far from cozy. Just another chain restaurant on Michigan Avenue, I guess. I just think there are so many more unique places to go to--but if you're right there, this place is worth stopping by.
