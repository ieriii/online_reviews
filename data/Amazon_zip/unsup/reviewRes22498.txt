Pretty cool place. You can order your hot dog and meal from a drive-through station.....a server will come out to your parked vehicle, after you've ordered at the drive through, and you pay them directly. This is the original hot dog......been around for years.....I come here for the hot dog, nothing else (their fries are just so-so). Be sure to come on a weekday during non-peak hours....because otherwise you'll be waiting forever to get your order placed.
