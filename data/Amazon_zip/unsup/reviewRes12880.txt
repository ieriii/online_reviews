I had a great experience at this Brazilian churrasco (grilled meats) restaurant. While the atmosphere is in some ways a little bit more Vegas than Chicago or Rio, and a good portion of the patrons perhaps a little bit more .. j'ne se qua than Chicago-proper or Rio, the meat is flavorful, the buffet portion extensive and the service quite friendly.  It would seem to me that there are more Brazilians working at Fogo de Cho, so I wouldn't necessarily suggest trying to practice your Portuguese with the staff here. They were very generous to support the great Portuguese language school here in Chicago (Brazil in Chicago--see other review) by offering us a fantastic happy hour and a promotional-priced dinner. This sets them apart from other characterless corporate restaurants. From a food perspective, while obviously it is about the beef, I would also definitely venture into the pork options. If they have anything encrusted with parmesan cheese, jump on it, because those are my favorites. It's never the same without pairing your meat with a little bit of the Molho a Campanha (aka Brazilian Vinaigrette), which is like a fantastic fresh salsa (if you will) made from tomato, onion, garlic, bell peppers, olive oil, vinegar and salt. You'll appreciate how the acid helps cut some of the fat from the meat. I think they should amp up their cachaa selection, but opt for the Cachaa Leblon over the 51 for your caipis.
