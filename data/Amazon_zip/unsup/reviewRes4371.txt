The Green Mill has been on the "list of things to do with the boyfriend" since we started seeing each other. Well, we finally made plans to go. It was really packed on Saturday evening; there was barely any standing room. One lady fainted and had to be carried out! The band was talented and played a number of famous pieces (from Davis, Coltrane, etc.) as well as a couple of their own. There were many solos; I think I was most impressed by the drummer, who could have been in his 80s... Other than a few "SHHH!!!"es, the Green Mill didn't enforce the "no talking" rule. It made it harder to enjoy the show, but it was still worth it. I thought this might be the type of place to get an old fashioned, so I did. I saw the bartender carefully muddle it. We brought only enough cash for cover since they accept credit cards - but only AMEX??? I've never seen that before. That was a little inconvenient. I've been here for poetry events in the past, but I think I like the music better. Perhaps I'll check out a band on a weeknight so I can get a seat.
