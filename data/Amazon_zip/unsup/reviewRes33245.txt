We checked it out on a Monday and sat in the little patio. Who can say no to Saganaki? I can't and it was great. Tried the short rib Goulash and loved it. The wife went with the Salmon(a choice I was unsure of) and it was great too. And the little one had the grilled Romanian sausages with polenta and she dug it. There's also a prix fixe Mon-Thursday.
