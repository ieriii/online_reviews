If it wasn't for Karen A. I wouldn't remember half the restaurants I love to love. Thirty years has taught me all I need to know about Greek Islands. Bakalao with extra Skordalia heaven hidden under a garlic veil. Taramosalata- this pink fish roe appetizer should be considered for the official appetizer of the Susan G. Komen foundation. It would certainly keep a smile on your face as the battle is waged. Any thing lamb, any thing lamb. Spanakorizo Jesus, I am hungry. The list, of course goes on and on. The recent closing for unsanitary coditions, Hooey!!! If you want real Greek food and like Greek beer, GO THERE!
