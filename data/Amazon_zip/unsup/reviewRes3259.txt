So full. I ate here a few hours ago and my stomach has not stopped expanding. We hadn't been here before so we (two of us) ordered 10 wings, 1 Seoul Bowl, and a side of fries. First of all, the wings are HUGE three-section monster chicken limbs deep fried to a crisp (der). You can pick two spices for a 10-piece so we got the buffalo (mild and spicy options) and some Asian flavor I don't remember.  Delicious and very filling - this probably would have been enough for both of us alone. They come with some spicy ranch sauce which was awesome. The Seoul bowl wasn't that exciting - some marinated meat on a huge bed of rice. I love veggies with Asian food so this was a bit disappointing. The fries were, well fries.  The place was super packed on a Friday night around 9 PM, I'm surprised we got a seat. The fire code sign said that it only occupied 23 people and we were probably at capacity. I've washed my hands 3-4 times and I still can't get the smell of the wing sauce out of my skin. It's sort of disgusting and sort of amazing.
