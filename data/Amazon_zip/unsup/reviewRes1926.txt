Waited in the freezing cold for 45 minutes for this -- worth the wait. I enjoyed the excitement of everyone in my group as we inched closer to the counter -- place has quite a following. I'm only a recent convert to eating any form of sausage -- so I was skeptical -- but I tried the rattlesnake dog and it was pretty delicious. Also, I couldn't believe our group of 7 could eat 5 baskets of duck fat fries, but I was looking for more. P.S. Hot Doug's sponsored my ultimate frisbee team -- so cool.
