While its not the most vegetarian friendly place, the fact that all of the brunch cocktails are strong and delicious made me not mind at all that my meal was going to be 10% food, 90% booze. The Bloody Marys (and all variations of) are incredible, as was the Logan Palmer (bourbon, tea, and lavender-infused simple syrup). The bartenders were amiable and the hostess was totally cool with us just hanging around drinking as we waited 45 minutes for the last member of our party. All in all, good Sunday brunch spot that's not too crowded. Though I can't speak much to the food, I'll definitely head back to work my way through that cocktail menu.
