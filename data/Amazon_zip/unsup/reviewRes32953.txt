If you like falafel, reasonable prices, BYOB, and an outdoor eating option, then you will probably like this place. I do like Mediterranean food (yep, spices and all), which is why I decided to come here. If you don't like Mediterranean food and want to order chicken nuggets for your kid, then maybe try McDonald's or Chuck E Cheese (note Jankin P.'s review).
