I'd heard two different types of opinions about this place....very good, and very bad. I figured I'd make my own decision when I went for my sister in laws' birthday dinner. I really wanted to love this place. But, not so much the case. We were seated at a big, round table, which initially looked like it would be great for talking. But between the music being cranked super loud, the distance across the table, and the echo-ing of voices throughout the place, I really couldn't hear a damn thing anyone was saying.... On to the food.... we ordered all kinds of apps (edamame, duck, rock shrimp, dumplings), plenty of entrees to share (braised beef, cod, sea bass, bbq beef) and I'll be honest, it was forgettable. I'm all for paying great money for great food, but when I walked out here I felt like I did indeed spend a ton of money, but got very little back in return.
