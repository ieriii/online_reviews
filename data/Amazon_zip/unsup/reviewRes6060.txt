4.5 stars Asking why you must come to Davanti Enoteca is like asking why you have to play that next level of Angry Birds....you just have to. Anyway the star of the night really was the marscapone polenta which had the best creamy texture and depth in flavor with the ragu of the night. (happened to be a mix of veal, beef, and sausage--slightly salty but forgiveable). The pizza with mushrooms/leeks/truffle oil was stellar and had real depth of flavor in the multiple cheeses! Yes of course I swoon at any mention of truffle oil.. but the combination of the braised leeks and mushrooms really was creative and well executed. The toast with egg/truffle oil/asparagus was a wonderful combination of texture crunchy toast, melty cheese, and runny egg.. but I'm not sure if I would order it again just b/c there are so many other things on the menu. Also the eggs come slightly undercooked/runny for those who are wary of such things. Also tried the cannoli sundae which was basically like a full sundae cup of the cannoli ricotta filling and chocolate chips with pieces of crushed fried cannoli shells. To be fair, I'm more of a marscapone cannoli type of girl. That said, I wasn't really very impressed with this dish at all and wouldn't order it again. Overall, the service was great.. Waiter was helpful and friendly. Although I hate when the service clears food before you are done and you are wistfully watching it gone gone gone away before you can stop them.  I find their wine list on that humongous wine bottle rather obnoxious...and heavy! Very reasonable priced paid about ~$25 per person without drinks. I think the pricing really adds to the rating of this place. Hate that they don't take reservations.. get there early! Haven't seen a creative menu like this in a long time!! love it!
