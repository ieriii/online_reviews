We came here on a Friday around lunch time. We were hoping to avoid the lunch rush, but things just worked out that way. Luckily, we were seated within 30 minutes so it wasn't too bad. This is what I got --- Ahogada, which is carnitas (pork), black beans torta in a spicy arbol chile sauce tomato broth (http://www.yelp.com/biz_). . After I ordered it, I was questioning myself because I am actually not a big fan of tomotatos, but the torta was amazing. The carnitas were tender and juicy, the bread was toasted just right, and the spicy broth added a delicious kick! I also ordered the churros with chocolate (http://www.yelp.com/biz_). Slightly sweet, crispy, and fluffy when you bite into them--- these were some of the best churros I've ever had. Since I have the biggest sweet tooth ever, I was not a big fan of the slightly bitter chocolate that came with them though. The Mexican Vanilla Soft Serve ice cream is also worth a try. http://www.yelp.com/biz_ . The ice cream itself is not that sweet, but the maple pecan bacon streusel adds the perfect amount of crunchiness and sweetness to it. Bottom line is... I would definitely go back to this place if I'm in Chicago again... but we need one of these in New York!
