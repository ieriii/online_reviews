We like this place! Good bread, good cocktails, decent wine. I've been there twice. The first time I had the mushroom risotto which was super yummy. The next time I had the gnocchi with shrimp and calamari which was also pretty good! The staff is really friendly and helpful. You usually leave with a few more meals for later! I had the chocolate panna cotta the 2nd visit and it was amazing. My boyfriend had the spicy seafood dish the first time. He loved it. The 2nd time he tried the meat lasagna. It was good but not as good as the other dish. I'm sure we'll be back.
