Big Jones= Big Disappointment So last night I hit up Yelp when presented with the option of going to Big Jones. The reviews looked good so I thought I'd give it a try. We arrived for a reservation and we sat at the bar waiting for the rest of the party to arrive. We sat at the bar for at least 10 minutes and were never greeted or told that it would be just a minute. The bar service was painfully slow at that point and when we ordered and paid for our drinks. That aside we sat down at the table and again the wait was significant before someone greeted us and got drinks for the later arriving members of our party. The menu itself underwhelmed, there isn't much to chose from in terms of full entrees. The special was presented later but to be honest I couldn't even hear what the waiter was saying. After another fairly long wait the waiter returned to take the order. I settled on the Chicken and Dumplings. The start of our meal was rather interesting as one friend discovered a worm in his salad. There is nothing like eating your meal, having to inspect every fork/spoonful to make sure there isn't anything there that isn't supposed to be there. I also must mention that the broth the Chicken and Dumplings were served in was extremely salty, and the dumplings flavorless and heavy.  Add to this that one of my friends ended up with a splinter of glass in his finger because the martini glass his drink was in was broken.  While the drink and food were removed from our bill, the whole experience was less than one would expect.  I am not at all thrilled to go back due to slow service and questionable food and drink preparation practices. While I heard that the brunch menu is much better, I am still going to have the idea I have to watch everything that I get here before I eat or drink it.
