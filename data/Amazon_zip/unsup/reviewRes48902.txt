This is one place to try without a doubt. Make a reservation. The train car type booths can be reserved by request. Their Loup De Mer is tasty yet each time it seems that the waitstaff is not versed in how to remove the bones properly. The best steamed mussels in the city (huge serving) are here. If you don't want to be adventurous try the half chicken. You won't be disappointed.
