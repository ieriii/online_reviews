We went to this place when we moved into the neighborhood a couple of years ago. We thought it would be fabulous because of the positive review on Check Please. Instead we found the food bland and boring. the atmosphere was awful and the food way overpriced. Better Italian food can be found at your neighborhood pizza joint or Olive Garden. In Chicago, you can find much better Italian food for this price. I really don't understand the fuss over this place!
