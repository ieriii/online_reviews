My sister-in-law and I stopped in here for a drink last night around 5:30, just to kill some time before our evening started. There are stand-up bar tables, where you can hang your things on a hook under the table and order drinks and appetizers. The tables are in the traffic pattern for the servers, but I didn't feel too much like I was being run over--but then again, it was early. Service was really excellent--friendly, charming and attentive--and the beer list is completely astonishing. This is one list I feel absolutely justifies its pricing (which was high, for sure, but worthwhile). So many unusual bottles, from both the US and overseas! A full selection of lambics and Flemish reds! I was in heaven. The room was already a bit noisy, even as early as it was, but it seemed pretty congenial. This isn't hush-hush fine dining. This is a place to roll up your sleeves and enjoy.
