I have walked past Le Colonial hundreds of times yet have never looked at a menu let alone eaten there. Sunday I decided to change that and made lunch reservations for Audrey and I. It was a beautiful afternoon and we sat outside on their uber cute patio.  We order their business prixe fix lunch which included an appetizer, entre, and coffee for $21.00 in addition to a few other items to round out our meal. For the appetizer we order the Pho which was absolutely delicious. Making it even better was that the kitchen without even asking split the soup into two bowls for us because the waiter knew that we were sharing. Pho ain't easy to share otherwise! We also order the Goi Ngo Sen which was a lotus root salad with fried tofu. The salad was a huge hit and the portion was ginormous. Our entre was the Bun Thit, which was a bed of rice noodles topped with barbecue pork. Once again Le Colonial delivered with a yummy well seasoned dish. In addition to the above we also added a side order of Mien Xao which was glass noodles with crab meat and mushrooms. I wasn't a fan, but Audrey seemed to like it. To finish off the lunch we had the Coconut & Mango Sorbets. Yummy, but $7.00 for two scoops of Ciao Bella I thought was a bit steep. The interior is great! Plenty of plants and tasteful color palette hammer home the French meets Vietnamese inspired motif. The service was attentive and knowledgeable. That's all that I ask. I can't believe it took me almost 14 years to finally eat here. My next visit will most definitely be much sooner. 1 Business Prixe Fix 1 Lotus Salad 1 Glass Noodle with Crab & Mushrooms 1 Sorbet 1 Mango Margarita ------------------------------------------------------- $70.00
