I'll admit I did try something new here for my first time--the sturgeon. I had no idea what to expect from the fish, but it was just ok. Sturgeon is a very light fish, and the sauce didn't have much flavor either. It was a light, summery meal, but I was in the mood for something a little more robust. Their beer selection was pretty good for a smaller-sized restaurant, and the seafood selections on their menu were interesting, I just happened to pick the wrong one for the day. My friend had the jerked marlin, which was excellent, and did not need the coconut-pineapple-rum sauce, which overpowered the jerk seasoning. Both seafood items were done to perfection and didn't need any sauces at all. My favorite part of the meal was probably the house potato pancake, which was excellently flavored and savory! Probably would go again in the future, but would probably ask a few more questions about the menu items.
