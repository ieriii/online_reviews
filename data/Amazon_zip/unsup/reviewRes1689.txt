For the past, oh, 5 years I have wanted to come to Hot Doug's, but those ridiculous lines have always scared me away. But not today!! It was 3PM on a Wednesday and we were in the area...on a whim we decided to hit up Hot Doug's - and there was no line...woo hoo! Best split decision ever. Since there was no line there wasn't much time to decide on anything fancy, so we stuck to the basics - we each got a Chicago dog, he also got a Polish, and we split a large cheese fries and Doug himself even convinced us to save some change and share a small drink instead of a large..."There's free refills! No line! Gotta take advantage!" Our entire lunch was $10. Whoa. The food was awesome, but next time I think I need to splurge on some fancy sausage. Now that I know the secret of avoiding the long lines, I'll definitely be back.
