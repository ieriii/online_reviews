I guess you have to go once and decide for yourself (and hope someone else is picking up the tab).  It is certainly an "experience" but IMHO, not worthy of all the praise. Call me crazy, but after spending about 9 bills on dinner and wine for 2, I expect to be satisfied. We stopped for pizza and wine on the way home.
