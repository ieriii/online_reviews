Okay, so the fried zucchini was amazing. One order of it was enough for the two of us for lunch. When the pizza arrived I was already stuffed. The pizza... clearly I'm not from Chicago. I could really do without 3" of cheese, and I like me some cheese. I was kind of squicked out by the sausage that was cooked- in the cheese. My main problem was the ladies restroom. Clearly it hadn't been cleaned in months. When I mentioned it, very politely, to our waiter, I got little more than a shrug. Ew.
