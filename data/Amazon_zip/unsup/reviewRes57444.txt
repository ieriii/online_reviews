It was hard to find a low key, chill Mexican place with good food and good margaritas. We stumbled upon Mayan Palace using Yelp and have been back several times since.It is your typical mexican fare, good priced food and drinks and as many chips as you can eat. The salsa is also pretty good, kind of has a kick to it. I always get a combo platter so I get a bit of three different items, which come with rice and beans. I haven't taken out from here but my friend has and said it was pretty good. I particularly liked the cheese enchiladas.Parking is street parking...and available most of the time.
