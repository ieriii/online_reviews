Simply perfect pizza. Now, I have a very high standard for pizza, given that I'm not only from a traditional italian family, but also was born and raised in Sao Paulo, Brazil, where they have the best pizza in the world (I promise). This one is a champion. Where else can you have buffalo mozzarella pizza around these parts? It's the kind of pizza that you just can't eat without silverware, because the ingredients just melt with the incredible sauce, all so light but so fulfilling. Conclusion: mangia, que te fa bene!!!
