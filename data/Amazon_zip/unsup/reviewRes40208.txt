So, I'm just about over "gastro-pub" Similar to my disdain for "small plates" of 5years ago. Every new restaurant is trying to have the new concept. And be better at it than the other guy. L&E manages to hold its own.  Started with the -House Marinated Olives. - Shaved Pear Salad, Endive, Cress, Green Beans, Stilton, and Sherry-walnut Vinaigrette. -Kobe Meatballs, Creamy Polenta, Parsley Pesto, Fonduta If I'm tired of "gastro-pub" you can only imagine what I think of Kobe. However, L & E does not make it seem like it's 2005. Mainly with the help of the polenta. It was lovely, and the pesto burst on it. AMAZING beer list: THREE FLOYDS ROBERT THE BRUCE. In all honesty, I really just like saying it. And the piece de resistance : Bacon. Ice. Cream. I don't think I need to say any more. Except this: Hotel rooms. They are opening hotel rooms on the 2nd level. Only 6 rooms. But still pretty cool. Will certainly be back for brunch. And may just crash upstairs. TBD......
