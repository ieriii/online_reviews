Came here with my girlfriend for their 47 year anniversary which they were giving 47% off your entire bill. We thought we'd give this place a try. First of all even with the 47% off it was still pricey. If you are claustrophobic, this is not the place for you. Now the food... first when you walk in this place you can smell a strong oil base from the fondue. Broth that this place uses is oil base., not a fan of that. I like my fondue cook on just regular broth. It's healthier and it doesn't leave a taste of oil in your mouth. Our meal was suppose to come with coffee at the end, but we had to ask for it., and the server was like " oh you want coffee?" Dude it doesn't matter if we want it or not...it suppose to come with the 50 bucks per person meal. I'm sorry, but we will not be coming back to this place nor we recommend it. Not worth the money. It's not romantic here, it's just dark. You need to use a flash light to eat here. I am not lying when I say I had to use my Iphone flash to see what I was picking up from the table.
