Solid food, cool vibe, byob + fun to watch the chefs.Gomae = nice with nice presentation, 3 tempura options all good (but the shrimp are coated in breadcrumbs, not tempura) and nice maki rolls (Sushi O Sushi on Armitage is better for the price)Steer clear of the specials, they can sometimes be suspect.
