I was finagled into going to this place for someone's birthday. Um. . . can we take a minute to discuss why this "nightclub" set up shop away from Lake St amongst a whole bunch of warehouses? I felt like a real-life horror film was taking place a block away. I think some guy got shot up by "organized crime" right over there a couple of weeks before the day I went. No, I'm being for serious. Ladies. . . . this is definitely not somewhere you want to be walking down the street to alone. Shoot, men too! Yea, it looks suspect outside but you get in and it looks like it used to be a pretty jukin joint at one time. But it really is too small for the amount of people they let in there. If you don't get there early when the crowd is still a little sparse, you will have a hard to getting a drink at the bar or even making your way to the bar at all. Once it gets crowded there really isn't any distinction between what's the dance floor and what isn't. You'll be at the bar trying to get your drink while one half of a dancing couple may be bouncing their butt against your hip. My face: Not Amused. The speakers are huge and it's hard to be close enough where you can really feel the music and far enough away that you don't that annoying ring in your ears after you leave. Don't you hate that sound? And seating? Forget about it. The few seats that are around are claimed by the early birds and conquered throughout the rest of the evening by their party.  Overall, the place wasn't my steez at all. I already have issues with paying $10 and up to get into some place to listen to non-live music without anything else included. So, if I'm going to do it I certainly need it to be worth my while. The Victor Hotel is not, but if you like big crowds, sub-par yet still expensive drinks, and that ring in your ears at the end of the night, this Vic's for you.
