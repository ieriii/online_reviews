My wife and I stay here often, in particular for anniversaries and birthday celebrations. A classy hotel, we've always had nice, clean rooms. We just stayed this past weekend and were upgraded (at no extra cost) to a room with an incredible view spanning from the Planetarium to the South to Navy Pier on the North. Kitty O'Shea's entertainment was good as always. Breakfast at the hotel was off the menu this time and much, much better than the buffet which is generally just OK. Stayed here 10+ times--highly recommend.
