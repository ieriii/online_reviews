Hot Doug's is one of those places that makes me really happy to live in Chicago. Everything about it is spectacular. Doug always has a smile on his face, the music is swell, and of course the food is terrific. Every time I come in, I feel the need to order much more than I would normally eat at any other time. The most recent standout was the game of the week - White Wine and Dijon Rabbit Sausage with Dijon-Garlic Goat's Milk Butter, Montboissi Cheese and Balsamic-Truffle Cream. Outstanding.  Also decided to finally try "The Dog" - Doug's version of the regular Chicago dog. Pretty freaking good I must say. Grilled onions instead of the usual raw. I can't see me waiting in line just for this, but it certainly is a nice way to round out a lunch of some of the more creative menu entries. Superb.
