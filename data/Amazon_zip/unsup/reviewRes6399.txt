I like Wildfire. A lot. Their bread is delicious, and always puts me in a good mood for the rest of my meal. I don't even know what the dark one is, but it has raisins in it, so I love it. I usually order the goat cheese appetizer. I'm a sucker for goat cheese, and the somewhat-but-not-too-sweet marinara sauce it's surrounded by is the perfect partner. Mmmmmm. I've never really had an issue with my entree, probably because I stick with my two main staples: Prime rib and the garlic chicken. The prime rib is solid, juicy, well-cooked, and flavorful. The garlic chicken, though, is even better. It tastes like the caramelized onions and garlic that it was cooked in. Oh man. So good. The garlic mashed potatoes aren't anything to sneeze at, either. The thing that I'm convinced keeps bringing me back is the key lime pie. Even if I am completely, explodably full, I still order it to split with a bunch of people. It's the perfect balance of tangy and sweet. This is what I end my meal remembering so I never fail to leave in a happy mood. Granted, it's overpriced. It's a Lettuce Entertain You restaurant. They always are too expensive. If you go in there looking for a bargain, you're stupid. I like this location a little bit less than the Glenview one, just because of the decor and size. It doesn't look as cool, and it's more cramped. Parking also sucks because it's downtown. If you can, head to the Glenview Wildfire.
