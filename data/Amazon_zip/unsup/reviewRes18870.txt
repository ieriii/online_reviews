Best empanadas ever. They had 2 types: ham & cheese, scrambled egg with poblano chile, $3.25 each. * Ham & cheese empanada with mushroom & chipotle: I was blown away by the scrumptious filling - cubes of quality ham, mushroom, and cheese, combine to make a slightly spicy, meaty, warm and cheesy masterpiece. The golden brown/flaky super thin shell dusted with cheese was perfect as well. The warm empanada was accompanied by a wonderful smoky red salsa for dipping.
