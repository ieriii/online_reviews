Folks this is as good as a steak place gets. The front door staff does a fantastic job of making you feel welcome and our waiter was excellent with wine and food suggestions. A friend and I started with the gigantic shrimp cocktail and seared tuna appetizers that were fantastic. I ordered the bone in filet medium and was really impressed. Our side of mac & cheese hit the spot and there is nothing that beats the butter cake with fresh fruit and whipped cream for dessert. Worth the price for those special occasions.
