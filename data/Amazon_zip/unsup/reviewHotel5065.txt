My first trip to Chicago and I wanted a boutique hotel. I wasn't disappointed what so ever. I stayed in the apt king suite and was impressed with the cleanliness and when I wanted a DVD to watch a movie they came and hooked it up. I booked on-line and had listed my preferences such as high room level, extra pillows and all those were taken care of upon my arrival. Friendly staff! The location is perfect as Trader Joe's and Starbucks are across the street. There is a steakhouse a block up, and magnificent mile is two blocks away. There is a grocery store a couple of clocks away as well. I tried two other hotels and nothing compares to the James which is why I am returning in two weeks...love this hotel!
