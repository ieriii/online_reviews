Okay, unique Irish Pub named after Oscar Wilde, how witty is that? Pretty awesome. This place has it all, the Sports bar atmosphere with the TVs, the romantic outdoor seating with a great view of Broadway in an amazing neighborhood (Lakeview East), the sexy Irish accent of the waitresses, the cool classic disco collection as if it were some sort of Hard Rock Cafe, and even books in case you feel like reading while having a good time. By far, the best bar restaurant I could have walked in to. It doesn't even fall within a single category! The food...yum, their mac and cheese recipe is worth the shot, with that savory tomato taste disguised in the master piece cheese monument. Their martinis are freaking superb! I never praise martinis (even if James Bond himself made one) but this makes the exception. I tried their Ginger Joy and boy it was joyous! Refreshing, with no spicy after taste like some other drinks with the same base liquor. My girlfriend tried the one with honey and jasmine and she absolutely loved it, quite a sweet catch... The service was wonderful, with our waitress checking on us very often and constantly attentive to make sure our drinks were alright. Seating was very fast and we were greeted with huge smiles, which is a rare commodity nowadays, and did I mention the lovely indoor area? Very elegant and it truly blew my mind as I was not expecting such an entrance. This place rocks. Come and see for yourself.
