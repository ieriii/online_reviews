A case of egregiously confused restaurateurs, the food is forgettable. I believe the owners intended for this place to be an upscale Greek eatery, but it's more like street cart food meets Greek diner. There's valet parking, and the waiters don matching vests and ties, but most of the food is prepped in advance, left on a steam table, and slopped out cafeteria style for each order. A perplexing faux fine dining experience. A starter of donner kebab, garlic dip and pita would more appropriately be served out of a street cart rather than a white table cloth restaurant. Saganiki is decent, but salty to a cringing level.  A chicken 'riganti' was so boring it hurt. It pains me that it's near the price point of really great Greek restaurants in New York, such as Pylos or Kefi. It was just a dried out, boring, completely forgettable bit of bird. An order of roast lamb loin was similarly disappointing. Just a hair above street meat.   Thankfully, the food is not outrageously expensive, but this is certainly a restaurant that can be missed.
