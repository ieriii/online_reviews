The delivery took over 2 hours so we canceled. Apparently it was the last night of the living social coupon, however this was not mentioned when we ordered - if we knew we would have ordered another night. Its no fun waiting for your dinner to arrive for 2 hours expecting it at 8pm, and its almost 10.
