I will preface this by saying the food is perfect AND the server was great. These two things, however, were not enough to carry the overall dining experience. I'm referring to the fat (presumably Italian) chef running the show in the back. We dined there Friday night at a small table next to the chef station. All we heard all night was this guy shouting at his staff treating them like sub-human species. You would think the servers and kitchen staff walked on 4 legs not 2. When I asked one of the servers about it, you could tell they were uncomfortable. This provided us with an intolerable dining experience that we never want to realize again. I have worked in the retail service industry for years and have had to lead and manage people and don't understand how for some reason this is acceptable.  It actually made for a miserable and sad experience.  I'll not go back, but if you go, ask for a table far away from the chef station. Not good Davanti. Not good at all. In all of my years of dining out, I have never experienced something like this, not only in this country but abroad.
