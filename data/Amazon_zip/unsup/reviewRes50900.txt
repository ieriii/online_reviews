This is a really nice looking place with some ambitious southern food that ultimately fails to deliver what the hype and price seem to promise. Service was painfully slow. We were in a tiny table right next to the door (they have a curtain up instead of a double door) in the dead of winter when there were tons of tables open further back. I felt like we were being punished for not making reservations - on a random weeknight. Food was mediocre and really over priced and left me wishing that I would have just gone to Dixie Kitchen and saved $80. Great wallpaper though!
