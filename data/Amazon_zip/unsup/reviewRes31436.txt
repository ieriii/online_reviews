I was really excited to try Mastro's after all of the hype but left a little disappointed. I thought the food was pretty good. My table started with the seafood tower. It is massive and looks great on display. We then got salads. I tried the chopped salad which was pretty average. For dinner, the entrees at our table varied from steak to salmon. Overall, we liked the entrees but didn't think they were worth the price. The side dishes were the best part of the meal. The au gratin potatoes were fantastic. Lastly, we got the butter cake and the chocolate pudding cake for dessert. The butter cake was amazingly good. You must try it! I don't think I'll go back to Mastro's for dinner because of the slow service and overpriced food. It was worth the experience to try it once though. I would go back for dessert and drinks in the bar area.
