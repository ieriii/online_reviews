Whenever I'm working in Wicker Park, I tend to stop by Alliance. It's a nice place with good treats. Their lemon strawberry cupcake was pretty awesome. Mostly, I love their sugar cookies. It's a basic sugar cookie, but well, they just look awesome. They re-purposed the easter bunny cookie to make owls (which were amazingly cute!), and then a week or so ago they had NES controllers! The geek in me squealed -- then tweeted a picture of it. I think my only complaint of them, ever, has been that they aren't necessarily the speediest, but it wasn't tragically slow. More like Sunday Morning slow. Which normally I wouldn't mind, I just had a shop of my own to open up.
