WOW!!! I was looking for some empanadas, and I found GREAT ones! I ordered delivery, so I wasn't able to get a feel for the environment that many reviews talk about, but I definitely will be paying a visit. Cheese empanada, black bean puree, sweet plantains, and the infamous OATMEAL SHAKE. I am stuffed! Every single bite was delicious. (All for $16, including $3 delivery) Delivery itself was quick, took about 40 minutes on a Friday night. Nom nom nommmmm!
