I've been here numerous times for dinner and always fantastic. Sunday we popped in for brunch and omgoodness from the host, to the chef and our fantastic server we had the best time. They had us laughing, made fantastic recommendations.... Can you say green eggs and prosuito... i.e. breaded fried soft eggs, prosciutto with pesto... yummie! Scrambled eggs, sea urchin linguine, bacon and tomatoes, fresh mozzarella not to mention the self serve bloody mary bar it was a Happy Easter! No reservations no wait (yet) on Sundays!
