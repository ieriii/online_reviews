This is the first time we've taken our 15-year old to Chicago and when he suggested Indian food for dinner, we were more than happy to oblige. We love Indian food and we also wanted to encourage him to venture out of his culinary comfort zone. After walking the street for a bit, we came upon India House. From the street level, you can't really get a sense of what the restaurant is like but once you entered...we were really won over w/the dcor and charm. The restaurant had a nice view of the city and the servers were very polite and attentive. It was a Sat night and the place was filled (but no wait) and we had high hopes. With our server's recommendation, we got the shrimp dish and although it had a great sauce w/tons of wonderful flavors, all the shrimps were mush and fell apart to the touch and tasted limp and not so fresh...eating the sauce by itself w/just plain rice or naan was actually better (which I did). We also got the chicken in almond milk - light and tasty unexpected flavor combo. Our third dish we got some sort of tomato sauce w/cheese (the description on the menu was much more appealing) and it tasted just like some runny canned pasta sauce mixed w/some cubes of cheese...very disappointing. Rice & naan were additional $4 per serving and we don't know why the server brought us 4 servings when we only had 3 people and 3 entrees...we had a lot left over which we didn't need to waste. Total bill (including tax & tip) was $80 for dinner (w/only one mango lassi)...so it was pretty pricey for an okay meal. Another thing that I found disturbing was apparently there was an issue w/the patron on the next table not receiving part of his meal and the lady (she either owned or ran the restaurant) was very upset and profusely apologized to him while also loudly & repeatedly reprimanding her staff. I thought it could have been handled a little more discretely and w/more tack so as not to disturb the other diners.
