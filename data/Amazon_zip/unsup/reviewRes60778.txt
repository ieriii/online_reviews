We went for brunch. I ordered the special, which was a sun choke scramble with a side of potatoes. The potatoes were undercooked, had a bizarre, artificial smoky flavor, and seemed as if they had been sitting around for a few hours before they were served. The sun chokes in the scramble were also way undercooked. For the price, the food here is ridiculously sub-par. None of the three other people I went with were happy with their food either, due to basic problems like flavor. I felt so bad for the waiter, who was really nice, but we really should have sent everything back. WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY!
