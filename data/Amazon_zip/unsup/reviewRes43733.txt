Cute space -- bright with lots of natural light, wood floors, comfortable table layouts. I ha a very good hot chocolate there, and a tasty breakfast sandwich. The orange brioche french toast (I stole a bite from a friend's plate) was good, and the huevos rancheros were great, too. Even though it's a great little joint, I probably won't make special trips here (I live in Lincoln Square) b/c M. Henry in Andersonville is much closer to me. The food here is good but not oh-my-god-I-must-wait-in-line.
