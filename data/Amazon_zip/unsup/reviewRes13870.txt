This is my FIRST review of a restaurant in Chicago as an incoming resident! WOOT! But yes, this is one of the first places I ended up yelping and trying out... and BOY, was I glad I did! Lucky for me, I had the privilege of having a friend with me, so we exchanged sandwich halves... a little bit of cubano and bistec on perfectly-toasted bread, sided with banana chips and my.. each was a taste of cuba, i swear. haven't been to cuba, but eating those delectable sandwiches in the small, cozy, cuban-culture-plastered-walls shack made the experience whole and REAL. i will definitely be back to try out some of the other sandwiches!
