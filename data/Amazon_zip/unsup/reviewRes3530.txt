Like most people, when I hear Rage Against The Machine, I think Korean chicken wings. Yeah, it's hipster-ish. It's not authentic (as if the alternative music and french fries don't give it away). But my god...the chicken wings: 1) The way they count it is actually the entire wing. That's the drumstick plus the part with the middle bone you have to rip out. Beware with their numbering...5 pieces might add up to your usual 10! 2) No pigeon sized wings here. These are mighty chickens they serve here, and while you might think that ruins the sauce-meat ratio, the meat itself is so tender and juicy that it only adds to the awesomeness. So yeah, with the size...5 pieces is more like 15! 3) Only four flavors, but that's all they need. Plain - why? Buffalo - you can get that elsewhere. Basically it boils down to a spicy Korean flavor, and a sweet Korean flavor...both of which are flavorful, unique, and addicting. And while I may complain about the music mismatch, it actually is a nice place, cool staff, and hey - I grew up on that music. Great stuff all around.
