This is the exact reason I do not go to Chicago bars!! Way to stuffy for me!! Not going to try and be someone I am not. Being made to feel comfortable and welcome in your surroundings is very important so this is not the place to be made to feel comfortable. I really do get what they are trying to do but it's to extreme. To snobbish for me.
