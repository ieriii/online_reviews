I visit my sister every Thanksgiving from San Francisco and was so delighted by our first experience at XOCO last week., we decided to take the kids after the circus this week - Day and Night. The hostess was quite rude.  XOCO is very popular but we decided that it would be a perfect treat after our annual Barnum and Bailey circus show. We patiently asked for a table and were willing to wait 35+ minutes, because of the superb torta, churros, chocolate experience the week before. We lived in La Jolla and Del Mar for several years and our palates were ready.First the hostess demanded to split our group of four in two separate counter areas, we asked to wait for table service - but she kept insisting that we split up? We pleasantly suggested that we were there to enjoy as a family. She was visibly agitated. 5 minutes later she again told us that our only option was counter, even though we had waited for 35+ minutes and had no problem waiting for a table. We could see that there was turn around and that a table would come up soon enough for us - other groups and families were seated together. She impatiently insisted that our only option for us was counter service. 40+ minutes into our visit and 3 minutes after we conceded to counter service - a table of 4 white customers were seated at table, while i got the generous seat buy the wait station garbage can. I forgot that in Chicago land it is not the color of your money, it is the race and class issue. The food was amazing but ruined by how we were treated by a hostess - not the kind of experience you want t o have on holiday with kids. We still love Rick Bayless, but I would never recommend XOCO as destination for women or children if you do not belong.
