We had been trying to get to this restuarant for months, however with me not being a huge meat eater I keep putting it off. However for New Years Eve 2010 we were determined to go. I made reservations and we went. From the valet to the wait staff it was a good time. I believe we paid $10.00 for the evening and I'm a non driver but all my friends drive and I think that was a steal. When you walk in you are greeted by the greeters and other staff in the waiting area. Speaking of which its a circular leather bench and a TV for you to watch and pass time. The restrooms are directly behind the waiting area and they were top notch. (Clean) When we were seated it took less than 10 minutes for our waiter to arrive. He explained the set up for our first time party of 8. Once he was finished we went to get salad I was BLOWN away there had from lettuce to Arugula, from pasta to Rosito, from cheese to grapes a plethora of food that I was familiar with and unfamiliar. We headed back to our table and turned our token up and was shocked at how quickly the meat skewer servers started coming to our table.... I was wondering how in the world would I eat all this meat, but I was pleasingly surprised that the meat portions were bites and NOT more than a few ounces. I don't need to tell you the meat types because they have an extensive website, but I will say the flavor was delicious, the temperature was acceptable and you could request rare, medium rare or whatever your fare is. Oh before I forget please try the Brazillian Soda, I don't normally drink soda but I tried my partners and I wanted to drink it the whole thing. It was refreshing and had a slight taste of apple. Yummy yummy
