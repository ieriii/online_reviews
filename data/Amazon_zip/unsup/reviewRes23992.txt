If what you are looking for is some real Chinese food rather than some Americanized so-called Chinese food, this is definitely not the place to go. I've been there twice. The first time I was so excited because of the good reviews on this website, so I ordered a very typical but hard to prepare dish-the hot sour noodle, as well as some other ordinary Sze Chuan food. However, it's a huge disappointment! The hot sour noodle is horrible, and other dishes are just so-so. Last month, I decided to give it a second chance, so I brought my parents there. The result turned out to be that I was wrong, again! Not to mention their unfriendly waiters who continuously chatting in groups beside your table, their food is still as horrible as it was. They are expensive, ridiculously spicy and not tasty at all. I would say that any roadside restaurant in Sze Chuan can do much better than that. Even in a small town like Ann Arbor, I can still find several Chinese restaurants better than it. So really, don't try their real Chinese dishes.
