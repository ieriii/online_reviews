Mayan Palace is possibly my most favorite place to eat in Chicago. The food is delicious and the margaritas will knock you on your ass (a quality I appreciate in a good margarita). I also absolutely love the servers here, they make you feel like you're family... you can really tell that they love what they do, and they go out of their way to make sure you have a great experience. Mayan Palace is definitely a small space, so I'd recommend making reservations if you have a big party. Usually 2 people can get seated right away or with a short wait... and a short wait at the bar means more time to drink margaritas, right? Go to Mayan Palace... you will NOT be disappointed!
