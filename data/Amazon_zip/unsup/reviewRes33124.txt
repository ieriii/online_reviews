Every time I visit Chitown this place is a must for me. I usually get the Tour de France... A sample of 3 of their breads, french toasted. Banana Nut topped with bananas, Sweet Orange topped with strawberries, and Lemon Poppy Seed topped with blueberries. I have also tried several of their benedict's and they are scrumptious! There can be a bit of a wait from time to time, so I would recommend calling ahead. Service is always great and the staff always seems to be in a great mood. You can bet I will be back next time I am in Chicago!
