VERY good! Went here for lunch and literally everyone enjoyed their meal. The Meditteranean Wrap was very tasty and the french fries were perfectly cripsy. The berry smoothie was sooo good and our table shared a nutella crepe, which was amazing. I will definitely be back here. Would like to try their breakfast, as everything looked fantastic. Service was quick too, which was a huge plus.
