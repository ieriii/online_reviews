I have now eaten here twice, once for business and once before a night out to see Spamalot. Both times I was still hungry after walking out the door. While the food is pretty and generally tastes good, spending $60 on a meal just to have my stomach growling during Richard Chamberlain's rendition of "Always Look At the Bright Side of Life" is just wrong...and that was without alcohol. I can hit up Cafe Iberico or Cafe Ba-Ba-Reba and walk out full and pleasantly buzzing for less than half. I give it two stars, one for interesting food and two for the awesome tomato bread stick things we got at the beginning of the meal!
