Used to come here a lot - they have some great specials, and the food is pretty good. The caprese salad is good, as it the pumpkin ravioli. However, last time I was disappointed in my lobster ravioli - 5 pieces for $20 -- kind of a rip off. They recently raised their prices across the board - around 2-3 bucks, so I don't think it's as good of a value anymore, even with the $13 coupons they constantly send out.
