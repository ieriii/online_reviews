I chose this place based on the great reviews. I walked in to a busy foyer and expected to wait a while for a table. The gentleman who greeted me at the door said it would be a 15-20 minute wait so I put my name down. An HOUR later I went up to the host stand and asked how much longer. Only after I waited such a long time then approached them did they bother to get me a table. I was so mad, but once seated the experience improved. The service was very fast (which is why I'm baffled as to why it took so long to get a table). I had so much time to look over the menu while I waited to be seated so I ordered immediately. The server went to put my order in and game back straight away lighting up the Saganaki and yelling OPAH! It certainly put a positive spin on my mood. The dish wasn't the best I'd had, I was expecting it be saltier. Next up was Moussaka. Delicious! Couldn't really taste the eggplant like the traditional dish but that's OK because I actually liked it better. I didn't finish the whole thing because I was getting full and I was saving room for Baklava. Yum! Out the front there was a long line of people waiting for the valet. I was staying downtown and immediately found a cab waiting. It was only a $6 ride... so easy for travelers to get to and from Greektown. A word of warning... your clothes will smell after eating at Greek Islands so if you're planning on impressing someone afterwards, you will need to change.
