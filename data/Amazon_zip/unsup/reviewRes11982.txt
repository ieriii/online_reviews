Mmmm my new love is new haven style pizza and it can only be found here. I've been here waaaay too many times to count. I can't help but to come back, not only for the pizza, but for the incredible karaoke singers as well. ;] The pizza here is superb. I usually come here during the busy hours in the evening so the wait is super long but it is most definitely well worth it. The pizza would be gone within ten minutes. Yah, they're THAT good. I always ordered the white pizza and add spinach, mushrooms, and MASHED POTATOES! I know how disgusting that may sound to some people but it is damn good! Very good beer selection to drink with the pizza. Another reviewer mentioned the beer tastings. A few of us did that and enjoyed it. This place is always fun and usually packed so get here before the rush. Service was excellent. The waiter was always there when we needed refills and stuff. He knew his beer very well. I will always refer this place to a friend if they have a craving for pizza. As for the crowd, the majority are sports fanatics, a good number of yuppies as well. Definitely a man's place. So, that being said, ladies... make your way to this place to meet some guys. :) Love it here and I will always come back.
