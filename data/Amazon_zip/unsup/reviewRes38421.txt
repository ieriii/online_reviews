We ordered the supposedly "thin-crust" pizza since we're from Boston and are used to such. We preordered the pizza at the front booth and were seated in the back, where we waited about fifteen minutes before we even saw a waiter. Once one appeared we ordered a salad and fried zucchini, both of which arrived WITH the pizza instead of before it.  The fried zucchini was absolutely delicious. It was a healthy serving and came with marinara sauce and some sort of Caesar dressing to dip in. As soon as the pizza was placed in front of us I knew I was going to be disappointed. It had that very white look to it that indicates too much cheese and too little time in the oven. The first few bites were very hot - a good sign - but my slice cooled rapidly, turning the cheese into a hard mass that quickly became hard to eat. I wound up pulling the cheese off of my slices - not a difficult task considering how it had solidified into thick sheets - and eating only the tasteless "crust" and sauce. As for the service, our waiter was nice but despite the abundance of staff they all seemed overworked. I would go back for the fried zucchini, but not for the pizza.
