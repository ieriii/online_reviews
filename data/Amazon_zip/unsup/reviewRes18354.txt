I initially went to bad apple because they sell 5 Rabbit beer, which I really wanted to try. i've been back almost every Thursday afternoon since. They do have a great beer selection, and the menu looks good, though i haven't tried any food yet. I basically go for the company because the staff and clientele is great.  Perfect for lunch!
