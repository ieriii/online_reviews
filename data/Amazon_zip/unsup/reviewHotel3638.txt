Stayed at this hotel for 3 days for the neocon event. It is right at Michigan ave and close by Lake Michigan. It is a really nice walk from the CTA station and close by the bus transit. I enjoy staying in the hotel because they upgrade our room to Family room with 2 bathroom ( really awesome) . The bed sheets are clean and there are 2 TVs. The front desk is really friendly and we even have a limo ride to the gangster tour for free. You just need to ask them. I didn't have a chance to try the high tea because it costs around $30 per perosn. it it too much for me. The lounge is really fancy and you actually need to dress nice to be able to fit in to the area.
