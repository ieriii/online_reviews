This was my first fondu exerience and I will do this again. The question is whether it will be at Gejas. The Good: Good quantity of meat and veggies. Nice fruits for dessert. Nice decor, even better if you are on a romantic date. The Bad: Ok service, though it seemed we may have just got the waiter on his bad night (Tom) as he had really bad attitude. Very smoky so you will need to dry clean whatever you wear. And a bit pricey for cooking your own food. You will be more full and have better service at Zed451 but of course, that's not Fondu! The cheese was ok, but I kept picturing a big bucket of processed cheese whiz in the kitchen being slopped into crockery and brought out to our tables. We would probably go back with another couple that wanted to try out Fondu. But, if they just want a nice restaurant for dinner, this would not be the choice. Thanks Yelpers for the tips for a Fondu virgin. VERY helpful.
