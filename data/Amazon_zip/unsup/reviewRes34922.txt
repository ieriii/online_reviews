Sushi X is definitely one of me favorite sushi spots! When you get here the exterior looks rather undelightful, but once you get inside it's dark and intimate with some urban accent. The place is very small, but I didn't mind it. The staff is very friendly and they are helpful when choosing what to order. The prices for sushi here are not too bad, the quality you get from the sushi is totally worth every buck you pay for. I can understand why people might choose a sushi buffet place and just spend $20-25 flat on all you can eat sushi, but I believe the quality in those sushi's are not as good as the ones where you would order individually. This place offers BYOB too, which is nice. MY PICKS: Honey Roll, Double-Stack Roll & Crab Rangoon Roll
