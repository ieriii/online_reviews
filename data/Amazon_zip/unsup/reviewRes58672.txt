reading all these good reviews makes me wonder..if i just went on a wrong day there!went there with my gf using a groupon, thanks GOD i had a groupon because if i had paid full price for this meal, i would shoot my self.I'm an appetizer freak, so had to try them all.the mussels were the most horrible i ever eaten in my life! go down to the Orbit Room and compare them to these garbage. you'll see what i mean.An other appetizer i ordered, don't recall the name, it was explained to me to be like a mashed potato with sour cream and Feta Cheece. What i received was a bowl of GRITS!!!!! yeah grits with a lil sour cream and some type of Cheece.... definitely NOT feta. I'm Greek damn it and i know my cheeses.. and most impotanly i know my foods... this placed sucked!the waitresses in the other hand were nice and friendly! so this review goes strictly to the food!I will never come back here....
