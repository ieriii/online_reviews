This is my favorite bar in the entire world. Sure, the Speakeasy theme is becoming somewhat mainstream and played out, but the Violet Hour delivers in every way.After entering through a non-descript door covered in graffiti you enter a dark, bar only lit by candlelight. The decor is very well put tother and the bar itself is beautiful. If my memory serves me correctly, it was a white marble, which was gorgoes, and lined with large comfortable seats. On the other side, a knowledgeable bartender with plenty of spirits to satisfy the most picky drinker.Usually, I sit at the bar and the staff has been exceptional. Order a drink from their list, or just tell the barman what flavors you are looking for and they will put together a well crafted cocktail that seems to not exist and most bars.If wish I could give my favorite bar more than 5 stars. The Violet Hour is exceptional.
