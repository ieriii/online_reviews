I went here with my cousin a couple week ago. The food was absolutely phenomenal. The food was beyond tender and fall off the bone. We tried to split one of the plates down the middle, put a fork into one of the pieces, and it just fell apart on the spot it was so tender. Their single-malt scotch menu goes on an on. I am a huge fan of the food, and will likely go back. The only thing I don't like, which is a growing trend, is the plate menu as opposed to the traditional course menu, but it seems like something we will have to get used to.
