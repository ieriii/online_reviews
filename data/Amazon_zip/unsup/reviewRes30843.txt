As stated before, super pricey, but as a special occasion, it's worth it. Ordered bone in rib-eye and split it with a friend...they split it into 2 plates for us which as a great surprise. Grill Asparagus was on par and what you would expect at a steakhouse. Order the Butter cake for dessert, it was recommended by Bill (our server) and was the best dessert on the menu. Service was top notch. Bill was knowledgeable and super friendly.
