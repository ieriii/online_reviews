This has to be a Chicago landmark!! Regardless how old u are?! When u drive up... u immediately feel like your 5 yrs old and all these flashbacks of ur childhood come back. My boys love coming here and we always get the Chicago Style dog and just sit in our car. Now the weird part is that u actually feel really cool!! LOl...yeah I know we're not, but for the 10 minutes that it takes us to scarf down those dog we are def. the coolest peeps in my CAR!!!!!!!
