I've always liked Bin 36 for the wine more than the food and actually hadn't been there for a while. Went for dinner and was completely blown away by the food. It was like Gordon Ramsey was in the kitchen --seriously! Everything was exquisitely flavored, beautifully cooked and presented. In the past I'd found some of the dishes overly ambitious and not quite delivering on flavor. But the asparagus soup, halibut entree (perfectly seasoned and cooked) and desert with luscious basil cream were divine. I used to remember the wine, and after that meal found myself thinking about the food.
