For the past few years, sushi x has been my fail-safe joint for when i had a craving of tasty rolls. Either delivery, pick up(they package up their to-go orders incredibly well), or even dine-in. Godzilla and rainbow rolls are always consistently delicious and filling:) Though not a lot of seating, on off nights, it makes for a nice quiet escape, BYOB without corkage fees(CVS liquor dept is down the street on Chicago), discounts for industry peeps and sometimes some interesting anime projected on the wall. The staff is friendly and very accommodating.
