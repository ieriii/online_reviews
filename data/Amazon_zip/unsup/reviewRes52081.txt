This is probably ONE OF the best pizza places I have been to in my life. The only downer was the wait. To get an authentic deep dish pizza that's loaded with uber fantastic sauce and toppings you'll need to sit around for 45 minutes to an hour while it gets baked. But once the pizza arrives you instantly forget the wait... the flavors are incredible.
