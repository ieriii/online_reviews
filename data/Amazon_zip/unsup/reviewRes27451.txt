Fois-ly pops of course are a fantastic way to start the meal, along with the best popcorn of my life. Who knew thymus glands could be so delicious? We started off with the Kung Pao Sweetbreads. AMAZING and definitely had a little kick to em'. And decided to do the White Tuna Sashimi which was so fresh it was practically swimming into my mouth. It had crispy plantains, cocoa nibs, whipped avocado and passion fruit.  After hot and cold apps we both had our main courses. My best friend got the Pan Roasted Boar with cherry mostarda sauce.  I had the Pinenut Crusted Skate which was the biggest piece of fish I've ever seen. Flakey and delish!  With brown butter and a raisin vinaigrette that was to die for. Afterwards, even though we had no room in our tummies,--we had to have dessert. The Molton chocolate cake was also incredibly and unlike some places I've had Moton Chocolate cake from,---this was hot and gooey and wonderful!  As it was my birthday and my darn friend told them that. (Ick, yuck.) They were nice enough to give me an autographed menu that said "Happy Birthday" on it.  I will treasure it always and am going to frame it and put it in my kitchen.  Graham Elliot Bowles does amazing things with amazing food and if you live in Chicago and haven't been...
