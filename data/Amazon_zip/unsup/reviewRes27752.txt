i don't get it. really, i don't. it's PILSEN. there are great mexican restaurants and sit-down joints everywhere, and people still seem to be fixated on nuevo leon. for why? the food is ok. the service is alright. the bathrooms are terrible...but the kicker? ... their floor is always slick, like a teenager's forehead. hold on to your loved ones, kids... broken bones ruin appetites.
