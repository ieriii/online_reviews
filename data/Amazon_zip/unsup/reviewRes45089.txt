I've been to Anteprima twice. Both times I've loved just walking in. There's a cozy hustle and bustle that coos "Hey, come in, really enjoy a meal." Service is great. The staff are warm and friendly. I sat at the bar once and it seemed like the bartender is also responsible for plating desserts and antipasi. Kudos for that! Both times, food has been A-OK. My main qualm is that dishes are too salty. I could tell that if it weren't for the saltiness, the food here would be good. The blueberry tart, however, is delicious! Sunday to Thursday, $29 3-course prix fixe meal is something to consider. I also appreciate that there are two size choices for pasta dishes.
