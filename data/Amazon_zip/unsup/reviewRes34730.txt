Totally unexpected sushi bliss. Scene: 7 girls with 6 bottles of wine and empty bellies on a mission for a rocking girls night out. I was in charge of picking the place. Requirements: BYOB and a reservation available for 7 lovely ladies at 8pm on a Friday night. Sushi preferred. Sushi X happily took our reservation and had a nice section for us ready to go even with our delayed arrival (extra hair primping and all). We started off the night some crunchy edamame and they were quick to open up our bottles of wine. The service and the food were equally impressive. They were attentive, but not overbearing, letting us ladies dish out the gossip between bites and slowly order a few rolls at a time. They even spit up the rolls on two plates for each side of the table so sharing was easy. Everything we ate was gold here. Crab rangoon roll what? Believe me, it's as good as it sounds. The spicy scallop roll converted a table of scallop roll sceptics into believers. As for the classics, the spider roll, spicy tuna and rainbow roll were big, stuffed to the gill (HA) rolls of sushi perfection. For dessert they split us up a couple of plates of smooth creamy mochi and strongly encouraged us to stay and finish up the rest of wine, even long after the food was gone. Now that above is an excellent combination for a perfect night out. Can't wait to go back!
