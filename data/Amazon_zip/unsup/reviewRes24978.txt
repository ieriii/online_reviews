I LOVE THIS PLACE! My fianc and I randomly came across this place when we had a craving for Greek food and wanted to sit outside. Well, we didn't get to sit outside, per se, but who cares when the place is that cool?!?! That was a long time ago, and I've been hooked ever since. The baked goods are to die for and the food is incredible. I love taking people here when the weather is great and watching them fall in love with the city. I think that this is one of the places that epitomizes what is great about Chicago. Great international food, well-developed recipes, and an incredible atmosphere. Go there for a meal or just to sit on the terrace-y area and enjoy a real Greek tea or coffee. I get the Mediterranean Salad, Spanakopita, Tiropita, or Manitaropita with any of their desserts. I highly recommend their lemon or seasonal tarts, they're awesome in the summer with strawberries! Also, you can never go wrong with my very favorite Greek delicacy, the ice cram with sour cherries. Talk about rock star.... Hmm... I think I need to go for a walk over to Greek Town now... Yelp, I'll be back.
