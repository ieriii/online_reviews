If you're planning on going over to Xoco for a friday night dinner... make haste as the line grows quickly! I love almost all things Rick Bayless, and the Ahogada was no exception. Make sure to order this dish extra spicy! The toasted torta sitting on a bed of steaming spicy soup was one to be reckoned with. Their beer selection is also muy delicioso!
