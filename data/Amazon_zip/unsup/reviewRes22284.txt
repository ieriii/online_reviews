Nostalgia lives in this 1950s hot dog drive in, built before most Yelpers were born. You cannot say you have seen Chicago until you try a hot dog, fries and a milk shake here. (The fries actually taste like potatoes) not the kind most people are now used to. The quality hot dog on a great steamed bun topped with relish, onion and mustard makes the old drive in a landmark worth checking out. It should not be missed.
