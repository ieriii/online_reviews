Amazing food. Some of the best cooking I have had. The Swordfish and Breaded Catfish were both excellent. The Asparagus was perfect. We showed up at 7pm and our table was waiting. They'll shut a table down 20 minutes to make sure those coming in with a reservation get their table on time. Can't wait to come back here!
