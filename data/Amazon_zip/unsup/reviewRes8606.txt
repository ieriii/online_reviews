If you have been to some of the traditional Brazilian steakhouses you know most of them are Buffett style and you can only get the meat well done. Well, this is a very upscale steakhouse. Very nice ambience and all the waiters are very attentive. Your glass will never get half empty. You start off with the salad bar, but don't eat too much! Make sure you save room for the main course. They have waiters walking around with 16 different meats to choose from. And best part is you can get the meat at whatever temp you want! Definite bonus. All meats were very well seasonsed and cooked to perfection. Then you follow it up with dessert if you have room. Will definitely return!
