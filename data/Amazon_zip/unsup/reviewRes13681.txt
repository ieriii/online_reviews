Went here last night with my boyfriend and we couldn't stop talking about how good everything was. Our waiter was super friendly and very knowledgeable. He helped me choose the Barramundi - a fish I have never heard of before - and it was AMAZING. It comes blackened with a lime butter and the fish tasted so fresh. My boyfriend got the pan-fried Catfish which he said was the best fish he has ever eaten. And the catfish came on top of a bed of shrimp cornbread pudding which was arguably the best thing on our table (I say arguably, but only in an argument where no one wins..because everything on our table was fantastic). I'm so glad we went here (thanks to seeing it on Diners, Drive Ins and Dives), and we will 100% be back.
