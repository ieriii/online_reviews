After about a month of commenting on how cute this place looks from the outside, I finally made it in this weekend for brunch. q receives a definite 5 stars for ambiance. The decor is absolutely adorable and they have a cozy front patio area that's separated from the sidewalk by a white picket fence and flower boxes. The chairs outdoors have comfy cushions and large umbrellas provide some shade on hot summer days. Also, it was surprisingly peaceful on the patio given that it's less than a block away from Division and Dearborn. The food was great. We both started off with Bloody Marys, which were solid, but nothing special. Next, we were pleasantly surprised by large bowls of bread and butter pickles and BBQ chips brought to us in lieu of a bread basket. For our main meal, I ordered the smoked chicken eggs Benedict and he had the brisket hash. Both were awesome. The eggs Benedict were served on honey cornbread with succulent, smoky chicken smothered with delicious Hollandaise (heavy on the lemon, but I didn't mind). The hash consisted of tender chunks of brisket and potatoes topped with two eggs, which he ordered over easy. The eggs Benedict were served with breakfast potatoes, which were meh, while the hash was served with tasty cheddar chive biscuits. The biscuits were good, but the cheddar flavor was almost nonexistent and their texture was a little firm and not as flaky as I would have liked. The people sitting by us ordered the stuffed french toast and the breakfast sandwich, both of which looked a-mazing, Service was prompt and friendly. Definitely want to come back for dinner to try the BBQ. Anyone who beats Bobby Flay in a throw down is okay in my book.
