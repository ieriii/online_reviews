I don't get it. Everyone raves about Piece, but I'm a little overwhelmed by the giant rectangle of relatively cheeseless, thin-crusted, wet pizza. Its heavy on the sauce and brick oven flavor, moderate on the toppings, and skimpy on the cheese. Its not a bad pizza, its just not on my favorite list. We ordered two medium red pizzas; one with chicken and broccoli, and one with mushrooms, tomatoes, and green peppers. I have been here before about a year ago and had pizzas with some of the meat toppings and mashed potatoes. Similarly, I had stared at my friends confused at their raving about the starchy sloppy masterpiece that they had created. I would appreciate the "build-your-own pizza" menu if Piece added a few more options and didn't charge so much for a rather skimpy portion of each topping. However, I imagine that any more than two toppings would cause the pizza to fall apart like the generic paper towel in the Bounty commercial. Popular toppings missing are pineapple, canadian bacon, green olives, and sun-dried tomatoes. Since I'm a fan of pizzas called "the works" or "veggie lover's," paying for each vegetable topping get a little pricey. Still, its a relatively cheap group outing. The atmosphere is typically hipster and the space is rather dark and cavernous. The wait can get pretty long, but they are more than accommodating with reservations. There is an echo from the barn-like ceiling, so just get used to nodding your head rather than hearing every word that the rest of your party is saying. All in all, I will go here again because someone else made the reservation. I will keep my mouth shut because nothing is really wrong with the pizza, but I will vehemently oppose adding mashed potatoes. Am I just a thin-crust hater? If you think so, ignore this review and enjoy folding your pizza.
