Oh gourmet burgers, the things you do to my thighs and ass...but I don't think I really mind until it comes to buying new clothes... They are ever so tasty. Most of the choices are basted/cooked whatever, in a featured beer...I highly recommend the Edmund-Fig-Gerald burger with Truffle fries...so tasty. Two words. Goat cheese. If you love goats and their cheese like I do, this place should be your new to go spot. They have great goat cheese burgers/sandwiches etc...and even a goat cheese fondue appetizer. Also, it cannot be stressed enough their beer selection is fantastic. Also, very economical...most beers I enjoy (I'm a scotch ale kind of lady) are 1-4 dollars under the average restaurant prices. When I order any beer of 10% abv or higher and the price is under 5...I could sit there all night, bu that'd make me a bigger lush than I already am. The 1 star off is for the sometimes aloof waitstaff. Also, do everyone a favor don't bring your children, my first time here it was a LP trixie and bro reunion in the side room...not sure what the hell was up with that, but they're champagne sipping, inattentive child rearing and awful matching sweaters from J Crew made me sort of cringe*... that all changed though with the taste of my food and of course fine beers on the cheap! *I'm being awfully stereotypical, but I don't like to spend my evenings with trophy wives and they're bratty kids who clearly don't know how to behave...** **I will also say, of the four times I've dined here only one time did I have to deal with the said annoying children. So basically, go there, eat burgers and drink cheap craft beer.
