I made a reservation here because my husband and I wanted to try pho for the first time. We made our reservation for Wednesday night becuase of the sweet Wednesday night date deal.  We were able to choose two appetizers ...the pho and chao tom I believe. I wasn't blown away by the pho...maybe it's just not my thing. And the chao tom had an overpowering mint flavor, which I don't love. So I could have just picked the wrong things. But the waitress was very friendly and answered all my questions about how to eat/say things...so yay, staff :)  My entree was stellar. I believe I had grilled mahi mahi that was oh so tasty. And then for dessert I have the homemade vanilla ice cream....it tasted just like the ice cream that came out of my papaw's ice cream machine wrapped in a rug when we were camping. MMMMMM MMMMM. And I picked the white wine...there was a choice of white, red...and a couple other things...I wasn't a huge fan of my white or my husband's red.  All in all...I would say our meal was definitely worth the $50 we spent on it. I got to sampled everything I wanted and if I go back, I know what I think I would and would not like.
