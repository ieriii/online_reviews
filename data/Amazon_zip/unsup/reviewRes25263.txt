I am obsessed with the broccoli cooked in the hot oil fondue. It's so good when it gets just a little bit crunchy. Just writing about it is making me hungry. Oil-drenched broccoli makes eating veggies fun again. Geja's is supposed to be uber romantic but honestly, I'd rather go here with girlfriends. The corner booths are perfect for gossiping on a cold winter night with a bottle of wine. I think getting one of the full dinners is the way to go - cheese fondue, salad, oil fondue (meat, veggies), chocolate fondue and coffee.
