We went with a group on a Saturday night because we had a $10 coupon and it was near the bar we were planning to hit after dinner. I can't tell you how many times I walked by here thinking it looked like a total hole. It's not that way at all when you walk in. It was one of the best service experiences EVER! All the servers were joking around and making recommendations. The mushroom quesadillas were something with a little more pizazz than the usual cheese or meat quesadilla. They were awesome. The margaritas were awesome. The entire restaurant was full of big parties being loud and having a great time. The only complaint is the noise, but it's totally the sound of people having a great experience. We are definitely going back!
