Yes, as good as it gets. Perfect gumbo, burger, cornbread (with honey butter) bread service, and crab cakes. The dessert, red velvet cake with frozen cream cheese and coconut brittle was also sublime. Great service. Chef uses 100% local produce - which you can definitely taste. Five-star food with four-star prices. Will come back to try more.
