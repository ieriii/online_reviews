Fabulous Cuban food, and fantastic service. We ordered an empanada and the Masa de Puerco, the evening's special, and both were delicious. The beans and rice are amazing, and both the owner and our waiter were fun, engaging, and extremely accommodating. We sat outside and loved the ambiance, and stayed and chatted for far longer than it took to eat our meals without being rushed out. I'll definitely be back soon.
