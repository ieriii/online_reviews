Still enjoy the ambiance of this busy hotel. Checked in on a holiday weekend. Was headed to a wedding and only had 1 hour when the desk clerk said there would be a wait to check in our room - apparently when you book with priceline the website automatically books for double occupancy, in a 2 bed room. I asked if a single bed was available and got checked into a King room immediately. Crisis averted. Manager was very friendly. Also really like the express check-in/check-out, just swipe your card you used to reserve, punch a few buttons and presto - room keys pop out or your bill is printed. No waiting in line. Considering how many people were here this past stay, the hotel remained clean and in stock of sundries and snacks. And you could still get a cab quickly, now that's amazing!
