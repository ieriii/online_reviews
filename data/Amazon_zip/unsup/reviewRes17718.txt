If I could give this place negative stars, I would give this place -10 stars. Here is my experience at Carnivale.... Me and my Fianc had made reservations for Carnivale for 9:30pm for a party of 2 for Friday January 18. I got there at 9:25 all excited because I have heard so many good things about Carnivale. On arrival me and my fianc checked in with the hostess. She looked on her screen for Smith. She said all that she had was Smith party for 7. The hostess handed us the pager anyway and asked us to wait by the bar. After 30 minutes my fianc went to the counter and asked the host if she was going to page us anytime soon. She said that she is just waiting for a couple of tables to clear. ANOTHER 15 MINUTES... STILL NOTHING. We patiently waited and waited AND WAITED FOR A TOTAL OF 45 MINUTES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! OUR RESERVATION WAS AT 9:30 NOT 10:15! After having enough, I returned the pager to the host. I told him that the wait time was RIDICULOUS. 45 MINUTES?!?! He took the pager and said, "What do you think that you are doing? I was just about to page you." Page me???? "My reservation was at 9:30!!!!" I said to him. He replies, "No I see here that your reservation is at 10PM for Smith." I can't believe that they changed my reservation without even telling me. They could have at least notified me that there was a mistake or apologize. I threated to leave and it didn't even phase the host. He just shrugged and turned the other way. If that's the host's attitude can you imagine what the upper management's attitude is like? F* that! Carivale's wait time and the snobby hosts and hostesses is absolutely ridiculous. If you like snobby hosts and having them screw up your reservations then Carnivale is the place to be!!!
