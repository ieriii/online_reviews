I love when I stumble across GREAT restaurants. First, for being up north they have a parking lot which is great. Had the Turkey Melt which was off the chain and my usual hard cider, and it had to be the best cider i've had in a long time. Maybe cause it was organic hard cider, but everything on the menu was organic, which I have never been to an all organic restaurant before. Oh, also their T-shirts are awesome, for some reason I love their T-shirt was even tring to buy one but not for sale, that sucks. But all in all Great place to eat wont be disapointed.
