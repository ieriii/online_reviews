My rating from this most recent visit would be a 3.5 star rating, but since it was a gracious offer from the hotel to stay there in light of our last experience, I will use 4 stars instead of 3. The check in this time was smooth as silk. The front desk team was polite and attentive, and patient as my kids were acting like asshats before my husband got there to meet us. We had 2 rooms that were joined by a door. I loved the layout of this. It added in a funky hallway. Unlike some other Yelpers, I actually liked that the room wasn't overly bright. It was very relaxing. Aveda products in the bathrooms, big plus for me. I love Aveda. We ordered a banana split and some wine that night. We ended up with a full tray of food. The only problem? While we got a great surprise with all this stuff, they forgot the banana split....and my husband didn't see the note (thanking us for returning, and letting us know that some of the items were as thanks for coming back) so he thought the whole order was wrong. A bit of a miscommunication there, but all was well. My only other comment would be the TV and its reception. While I don't expect every hotel to have some HD tvs in there, the reception could at least be clear. The reception there was all fuzzy, almost like we were watching tv with the old bunny ears. So, a HUGE improvement from the 1st visit....all in all, a good visit to the Hard Rock.
