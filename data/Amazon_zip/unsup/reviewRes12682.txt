Guys walking around with meat on swords and an amazing salad bar...I don't think I need to say anything else. This is a really fun place to come with friends and the interior looks great. The wine angel is a nice touch too. The staff and waiters are very friendly and will explain the concept to you if it's your first time. The salad bar has warm and cold items and some unique things as well like hearts of palm, quinoa salad, and delicious potatoes au gratin. The meat selection starts up as soon as you flip the card to green and doesn't stop until you flip to red. You'll be served sirloin, garlic sirloin, pork tenderloin and ribs, filet with and without bacon, lamb leg and lamb chops, flank steak (my favorite), and multiple types of chicken..also with bacon. You can't go wrong with any of it. The meat will be salty but that's traditional Brazilian so you really can't deck them stars on that. Then it's on to desserts and the coconut pie, flan, and chocolate mouse cake were all good but kinda dense so you might not actually have room to finish them. If you sign up on their website, you'll get a coupon for 25% off which will cover Chicago's taxes (zing). On your bday, you'll get a coupon for a free dinner and that's good for a month so it's definitely worthwhile to do it.
