I'm not sure which location this is but I went to the one which was near the museum of art. We did 2 medium pies for 5 adults - one was 1/2 plain and 1/2 spinach, then another was 1/2 veggie and 1/2 sausage. We also did 2 house salads. The salads were your normal pizzeria house salads but the pizza was interesting. It has a big old crust and sauce on the top layer, then the cheese is in the middle with all the stuffings (if you get any). I don't really like crust to begin with I like my pizza super thin and I found it very filling and heavy. I just don't think I'm into that type of pizza but if you are then it is probably amazing. Also note that the deep dish stuffed pizzas take 35 minutes to cook!
