Sunda was great from beginning to end. I went w/ a large group that I work with and I was extremely impressed. We just left our ordering up to the server who did an excellent job. All the sushi and rolls that we ordered were excellent and the Kobe appetizer over rice melted in your mouth. The brussel sprout salad was an extremely pleasant surprise-even the people at the table who don't like brussel sprouts were coming back for second and thirds. I would come back here again and again. Great place for a date night or business dinner.
