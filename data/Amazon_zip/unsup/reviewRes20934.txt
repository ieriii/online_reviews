Excellent place for sushi. I took my fiance here for his birthday on a Thursday night. We had reservations and were seated right away. The lighting was dark and intimate. Even though tables were near other eaters, it didn't bother me, like in other sushi places. I wasn't distracted by their conversations. I had vegetarian maki rolls, and there were plenty of options, which I find not the case at other places. My fiance had the crab leg appetizer which was probably his only qualm because there wasn't much meat on it and it was fried. The mango salsa with it was very tasty though. Miso soup was excellent, was too afraid to try the jalapeno miso soup, but wish I did. We were actually full after dinner, which rarely happens when we east sushi. Service was great, waitress was there when time we needed her, didn't have to wait. My only qualm was that there was only one bathroom and the line was long when we left. Since we split a whole bottle of wine throughout dinner that was a pain. That was another nice thing, I saved at least $20-30 on BYOB. Corkage fee if you don't spend enough, but if you're there for dinner you'll have no problem meeting the minimum.
