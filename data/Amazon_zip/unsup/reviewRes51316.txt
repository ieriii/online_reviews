Went to Garcia's last week after finding out Los Napoles was closed due to them being on vacation. It's been a couple years since we've carried out from Garcia's....don't know if we've gotten spoiled by Los Napoles, but Garcia's was just okay. I'd classify it as a good midnight-1 AM type place. They give you plenty of food for the money but it was a bit greasy compared to what we're used to. The salsa was pretty good, guacamole was thumbs down.
