Very, very good seafood. A friend and I ordered the crab cake slides (PERFECTION) and the lobster roll and shared. I found the lobster in the lobster roll to be a little too chunky for my taste--but it was still amazing. Only bad thing--it costs a fortune. We went at lunch time and the bill (without drinks) still came to $48 before tip. Wow! But for a special occasion--this is perfect!
