I'm not quite sure why this place gets 4 stars. I just spent 3 nights at the Allegro and will not be returning The Hotel: It's old. And dirty. Like something the cops would raid in Training Day 2 The room: It was the size of a large closet. The closet was the size of a large cardboard box. The blinds are old and fold down with a drawstring that takes about 2 minutes to fully open or close. Not ideal. The bathroom is great if you enjoy being able to brush your teeth while evacuating your bowels and washing your hair, because all are within an arm's length. The elevators: There are 3 elevators for a 19-story building. Be prepared for a long wait during peak times. I actually took the elevator down to go up at around 6pm since they were all full on the way up. The staff: The only reason I give this hotel 2 and not 1 star is the staff. Very polite, professional and reliable.
