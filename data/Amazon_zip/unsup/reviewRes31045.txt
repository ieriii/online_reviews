I went here with a vegan friend last weekend, and it was fine. It was a bit expensive and the blackened tofu was decent but nothing to write home about. My friends enjoyed their Reuben Sandwich and some kind of wrap sandwich though. Being a veggie-curious carnivore, I'm glad Chicago Diner is there. It demostrates there are possibly tasty options if/when I come out of the vegan closet.
