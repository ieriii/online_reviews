Why would you go here? Oh yeah, you're young (early 20s) and you get blown away by the beer selection and don't mind the noise, wall to wall people, and horrible, awful service. Or you're from out of town and going into the Big City is 'exciting' and you see this huge beer list and are blown away by it.  That is who the Hopleaf is for. The staff here isn't really good, at all. The best you can hope for is perfunctory service (which is totally fine for me, and not a problem) - but that is not par for the course for this place, your bartenders will let people know they are superior to their customers, and the wait staff isn't all there mentally, they seem very inexpierenced. This is your typical hipster elitist BS. Like I said, you probably wont even notice if your a young hipster-doofus or if you don't come into the city often. Do yourself a favor, walk a 1/2 block north to Andersonville Liquors and pick up some microbrew IPA's and go chill at home with friends. You'll have a much better time. If you want a bar with beers from around the world, then try Quenchers. Free popcorn and less attitude.
