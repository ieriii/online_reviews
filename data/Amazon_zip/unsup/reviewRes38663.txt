I was told that this was the place for original Chicago-style pizza. I didn't have anything to compare it to, but it was amazing! I think we got a medium (for 3 people) and we maybe ate 4 pieces between the 3 of us. LOTS of cheese and toppings. I am a definite believer in Chicago-style pizza. We have a restaurant in my home town that offers this, but it doesn't come close to Giordano's. The location of this one is great too (near the Magnificent Mile and the rest of downtown).
