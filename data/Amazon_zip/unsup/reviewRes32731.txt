I've eaten at Demera several times, a couple of visits onsite and twice by delivery. The food is always really good, just as spicy and warm as you would expect. It gets a bit crowded and disorganized on the weekends, but that's to be expected. The vegetarian sampler is to die for, even of you like meat. I love the honey wine too, it's like reisling, but has more character. Long live Demera!!
