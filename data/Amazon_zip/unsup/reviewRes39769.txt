I wandered in after a community meeting a couple of nights ago and it turned out this was their friends and family opening, with their official opening being last night. The vibe was so warm, the food so outstanding, that I can't wait to go back. I talked to one of the owners and he said they wanted the place to feel like a big hug. It's also going to be a B&B, modeled after those English country inns. Their motto is "sleep. eat. whiskey." It's owned by Empty Bottle Presents but will not have live music, but rather a DJ some nights. Needless to say, the music they had playing the other night set the perfect tone over a good sound system. Thank you for coming to Logan Square, Longman and Eagle!
