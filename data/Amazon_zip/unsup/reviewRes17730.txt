Although I was not crazy about my first meal at Carnivale, I hoped it was a fluke, and was lured back a second time by the festive and elegant ambiance, perfect for celebration. The service was attentive, friendly and professional, and the $5 valet parking is great. But for a second time, I was still underwhelmed by the food and an "a-ok" rating seems just right. The ceviche sampler was very "yum!" and served on an impressive bed of ice. The guac was also yummy, but if you're used to eating Mexican around the city, isn't that notable (apart from the $14).  But when my steak arrived, though cooked to order, four bites into it the terrible thought occurred to me: is this not similar or worse than a steak I had at Bennigan's? It was terrifically under-seasoned and very fatty, not too different from a steak someone might get at Jewel and slap into a pan for a while with no marinade. The reason this thought was so painful is that the steak was $38 and so it was especially important that it was delicious; "meh" is certainly not a thought I would have thunk of my own accord, without help from the food. Though it looked pretty, the chimichurri sauce was also without flavor, just like dipping the steak in oil. My son's chicken was miles better, it was so tender and cut like butter, but it, too, was markedly under-seasoned. It came with french fries that were completely pedestrian, and the plantains were also akin to cheaper Cuban joints. My husband, as usual, had no complaints. Glad I could compensate.  It was a fun evening with cheerful ambiance. Five stars for atmosphere! Five stars for nice people! Fun if you're looking for an evening of eye candy, but foodies on a budget, take note: for a pricey restaurant with a lot of flavor in so many respects, it still needs salt.
