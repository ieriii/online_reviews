This is where we ended up going for our friend's birthday when Amitabul was closed today (Sunday) even though the profile on Yelp said it was open. I am glad I made it here though since I've been meaning to try it for ages. I had an avocado maki and the vegetable tempura maki (asparagus and sweet potato). I know that tempura rolls tend to be a bit more pricey, but $12 for 6 rather small pieces always seems a bit steep for vegetables only. The vegetarian dragon roll at Sushi Wabi was at least 1/4 bigger for the same price. The presentation was gorgeous here. Everything looked super tasty on everyone else's place. They have a roll called Metallica which kind of cracks me up. The thing that really sealed the deal for me though was how nice the chefs and the wait staff was here. For Sei Jin's birthday, they brought out green tea ice cream with a candle stuck in it and started singing Happy Birthday. Just precious. I know I'm a bit stingy when it comes to paying that price for vegetables, but I will come back here again for sure because of the quality of the food and service.
