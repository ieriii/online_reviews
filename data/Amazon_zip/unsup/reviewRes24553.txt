Interesting how you cook your own food (in a fryer) and come out of the place smelling like a cook in a fast food joint and pay that much. In order to be safe with all the hot oil, the tables are bolted down. If you go, ask for a booth. Extra vegetables were offered but when accepted never showed up. I'll not return. For that price I will pay for someone else to cook and I will enjoy it more.
