This place is always packed even on weekdays. I have been here throughout the years....I thought this place was a solid 5 stars. I actually went to Nuevo Leon two times this past week. I have always claimed this is one of my favorite places, but I don't know....maybe not so much anymore. The food is good....but I remember it being much better years ago. The Good: BYOB, Cheap food (6.00 for many of their plate options), Authentic Mexican food,and great lemonade The Bad: Cash only, rushed and not attentive service, the bathrooms (ooohhh the horror!!!)...Beyond Gross...how can such a nice restaurant have such gross bathrooms....?? I still love this place but I don't think it is as great as it used to be.
