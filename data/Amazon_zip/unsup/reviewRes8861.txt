Great pizza! Amazing Italian style pizza that uses the best Italian ingredients. Since they are a VPN certified restaurant they use Caputo Pizza flour, a Forno Bravo Oven, and the best Mozz. you can find. Be excited and come ready to eat. Our server was great and the food was even better. Be prepared to spend a bit of money but great food comes a price these days. If I lived close by I would go every week!
