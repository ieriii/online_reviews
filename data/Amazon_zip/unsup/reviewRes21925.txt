We tried XOCO because of all of the hype and while the food was indeed delicious, the 50 minute wait was not cool. I am sorry but if I am going to wait for 50 minutes, I'm expecting a table with wait staff and meal that I can enjoy at my leisure. When we finally got our food, I felt pressured to leave seeing the line of people waiting anxiously for their meal.
