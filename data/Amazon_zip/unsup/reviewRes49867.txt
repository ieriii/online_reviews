The Fifty/50 is a better than average sports bar with better than average bar food. They are located on a busy bar strip on Division. They have large windows up front with lots of natural light and a large front sidewalk patio that sits along a strip of busy sidewalk patios. So, there is lots going on here. Great spot for socializing and people watching. The bar is choc full of flat panel TV's running all of the popular sports programs. The food is big and meaty.  A bit pricey, but you get a lot of it. I enjoyed the sliders, among other things. There are playful signs throughout that are custom for the Fifty/50 and crack me up. Check out the bathroom sign photo that I uploaded. Too funny.
