Love this place! Just went here with my husband, son, and son's friend. My son's friend was so happy when we told him we were going here. HE JUST LOVES IT. I think he ate more that my husband. Love that you can come casual. I like their salad bar. Don't eat too much though. Gotta save room for the meats and the yummy bananas that they bring to your table. We always leave very full and very happy!
