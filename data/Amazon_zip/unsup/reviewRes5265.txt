I went to the Purple Pig with a group of 9 other people so let me say that there probably isn't something on the menu that I did not try. Everything was very good, with some highlights being the pork shoulder, the Villa 2006 Reserve Chianti, and the eggplant spread. Though the service was slow to start, it was a good experience. I would wait longer to sit outside; the inside was too bright and chaotic for my preference.
