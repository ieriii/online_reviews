The sushi is a little hit and miss here, sometimes it's really good, other times it's a little mediocre, but it's never bad. The happy hour special is when it's worth it, otherwise I would say it's a little overpriced for what you get. The one time I ordered miso soup it was pretty cold. The edamame is pretty decent. The service is likewise a little spotty, but it's not terrible. The dining room is dark and somewhat uninviting, that's true, and they project weird anime and similar video on the wall. But like I mentioned, the happy hour special is a good deal, and I will definitely be back, at least as long as they keep running it.
