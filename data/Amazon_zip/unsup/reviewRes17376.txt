The drinks are pricey but the atmosphere is great. I don't need to shout in anyone's face, I don't need to box people out at a bar to get served a drink. I also don't feel like a pinball getting bumped into by rude jackasses who don't even attempt an, "excuse/pardon me." Worth experiencing for at least one drink. The stencil Banksy knock offs are a nice touch on the outside of the building...even though I don't think most passer bys even realize they're aimed at Roland Burris and Blago.
