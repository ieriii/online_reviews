super yum thin crust pizza! i'd recommend the white pizza. with thick pizza being the rage & trademark of Chicago, this is my favorite pizza place in America. easy place to get in and out for lunch! there are some 2 hour parking meters close by. separate entrance for dine in and take out. my office used to be within delivery range!!
