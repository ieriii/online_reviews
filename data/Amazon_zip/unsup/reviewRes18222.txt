I had to give this place 5 stars, if only because they were AWESOME for New Years. We had a table of 7, and a reservation around 9p. When making the reservation, we were told we could have the table as long as we wanted, and that it was a fixed menu for $65, and BYOB. Uh, OKAY! My experience with fixed menus is that there have been many courses, but small dishes. This was many courses, and HUGE portions. Can you tell I mean it by all the caps in my review??? The bread we got to wait was great, and then out came the bruschetta...this was like bruschetta on 'roids. Huge pieces of bread with mozzarella and tomatoes. Two huge slices per person. If I could see into the future and knew how much food was coming, I would have stopped at one. Oh well...it was New Years. Second dish was lobster ravioli. Now, as the waiter was bringing out the plates, we thought they would put a few down for the table to share. Nope, 4 huge raviolis for EACH of us. Honestly, this was one of the best raviolis I've ever had. So good. Seriously. There's more you ask? Yes...before we know out, out come steaks in some delicious sauce and a side of gnochi. Heaven. So full, can't breath. But alas...canolli. Who says no to cannolli? Not me.  I'm full, a little tipsy (lots of wine and champagne, yes please!)... and in heaven. What a way to start the new year. I'm looking forward to coming here again.
