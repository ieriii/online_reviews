This past Friday was my first trip to Sushi X and I have to say I was very impressed. We were seated immediately and the service was excellent during our entire stay. We tried a variety of rolls and they were each great- especially the shrimp tempura. My only reservation was about the spicy tuna roll - it seemed to have a bit too much "spicy". The miso was so-so and the mochi was above average. I would definitely make a return visit to Sushi X.
