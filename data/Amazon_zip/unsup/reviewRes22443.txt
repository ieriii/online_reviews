I came here for dinner with friends before a comedy sketch show. Chips and salsa were pretty average, but the Jamaican lime-tea and oatmeal milkshake were pretty superb. I ordered a burrito with chorizo and avocado, and I'm saddened to report the chorizo was a bit too salty for my taste. The spices from the chorizo and peppers were delicious, however, so it wasn't a complete loss. I'd be willing to come here again for the lime tea, and maybe trying something else. The menu is pretty affordable with many vegetarian options, but keep in mind it's cash only!
