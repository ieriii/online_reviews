Food pretty good, Although dont try and tell the Hipster behind the counter what you want in spanish he or she will jus go "uhh you want the wha???" and I have to refrain from slappin the glasses without lenses off his head and say once again... ahem.. "MEDIA NOCHE!!!!" kinda small too, over all good for a quick bite
