First impression, this place looks like all the large restaurants in Vietnam (the fans on the wall, the huge number of workers in the back, the smoke..)! The food is average and a little pricier then I expect. I had the combination vermicelli and the meat was a bit dry. Very large menu so plenty for you to choose from. Good place for a quick meal, they bring out the food really fast! Also try the Thai tea, It's the best I've had in a while, it's filled with ice though so you don't get as much tea.
