OK, I am a big fan of RIck Bayless, as I think he is a great chef. However, he needs to figure the service aspect of this place out and QUICK. The couple times I have been so far, the whole 'number' and cafeteria style 'line' thing just doesn't seem to be working very well? Especially given the amount of people waiting and how long they are waiting for! The 'authentic Mexican street food' is OK, but doesn't really remind me of any street food I have had on the streets of Mexico City. But, the Tortas from the griddle are really delicious and remind me of many of my Cuban favorites from Miami (where I moved here from). I don't think that is what he intended, but still very delicious! MUCH more expensive than the Cuban variety, but very delicious! I will go back, when I have several hours to wait in the ridiculous, convoluted, line.
