Let me start by saying that I love me some meat, and I was VERY resistant to trying this place...but I'm SO glad that I did. Ever since I moved to Chicago I heard people rave about this diner but in my head I kept thinking, "I don't want to eat at a place that puts any meat products in quotations".  After living here five years I finally gave it a shot and it was delicious. So delicious in fact that I've named it my newest "Ol' Trusty". My favorite is the Philly Cheeze "Steak", but the Gyros are also fabulous. I always order their sweet potato fries which are never greasy or overcooked.  I'm about to make a bold statement: The BEST carrot cake I've ever had in my entire life. It was hard to not purchase the entire thing and eat it as a midnight snack.  The reasons I'm not giving this a 5-star rating is I tried the Roast "Beef & Cheddar" and it was ridiculously salty, to the point where I could barely even eat half of it. Also, although the wait staff is super friendly and laid back, they definitely give the vibe of "eat quickly and get out so someone else can have your table" and I really hate that.
