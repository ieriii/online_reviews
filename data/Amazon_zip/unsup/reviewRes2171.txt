The rave reviews don't lie - Hot Doug's will always be a staple on our Chicago trip itinerary. The long lines are there for a reason, so no point in griping about that. I would agree to going there during the weekday for shorter lines, except that you'd be missing out on the Duck Fat Fries, which are served on Fridays and Saturdays only.
