My yum-o-meter has hit the roof! This place is soooo damn good - as soon as you walk in, the aroma hits you and I always find myself molesting other people's food with my eyes...even though I've been here multiple times...mmm. I can't get enough. I usually get the combo - steak and chicken, but the seafood is amazing too!!! I love this place and can't get enough!
