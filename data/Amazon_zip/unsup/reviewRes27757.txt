Amazing food, great service and that trendy atmosphere all the cool kids are looking for: Graham Elliot's got it all. My husband and I dined here with another couple over Valentine's Day weekend and have been jones-ing to go again ever since (saving our $$ - it's not cheap). The waitstaff have great recommendations on both food and drink, and were very friendly and unpretentious. You've got to love gastronomy served by a waiter wearing a t-shirt, jeans and boots. I also appreciated the attentiveness to detail: I am allergic to truffle oil, and therefore couldn't partake in the truffle-infused gourmet popcorn served to us upon being seated. Our server noticed I had none on my plate and was quick to respond when I said I was allergic, sending out a parmesan & thyme-sprinkled popcorn just for me.  Prepare to shell out some cash, but I think it's very worth it for the experience and the food. Oh, and try the beef carpaccio. It's to die for.
