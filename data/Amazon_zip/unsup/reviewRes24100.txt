Jennie T introduced this place to me and I LOVE IT! I kinda embarrassed her by not having enough cash since I didn't realize that they don't take cards. Bring cash! I'm going back for the second night in a row to sample more. I had the skirt steak, oatmeal shake and a chifrijo appetizer. The skirt steak was well seasoned and cooked to a medium rare perfection. It came with a really flavorful yellow rice, a pickled cabbage thing and yummy fried plantains. The oatmeal shake was incredible. It's very filling so I may share with somebody next time. Being lactose intolerant doesn't help much either. You need those healthy oats to soak up the triglycerides from the food. The chifrijo had deep fried pork belly. Freaking deep fried PORK BELLlllyyy! I warmed it up the next day for lunch and it was still good.
