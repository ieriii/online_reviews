Came here again with my monthly dinner club and had a wonderful meal. Service was a little lacking, but I come to expect that from ethnic places. We ordered the duck service (of course), but added a variety of other dishes that really made the meal an authentic Chinese meal experience. It helped that we had 12 people so we could try a lot of stuff Fish - filets with ginger and broccoli - tasty and fish cooked well. Blackbean clams - tasty and super traditional BBQ Pork - Very yummy crispy skin Beef Chow Fun - SO good and one of my fav dishes Peapod Shoots - Great compliment Sicne we ordered two ducks we got duck noodles and rice (I've only gotten the rice previously). I really liked the noodles, wonder if you can request them instead of the rice in the future. With all of us STUFFED we walked out spending $15 a person (that included TIP!!!!). Great delicious meal that is SO affordable. Only thing bad about the place is that it's "BYOB" but the corkage fees are high! $5 per bottle of wine and $2 per bottle of beer! But, I will definitely be there again.
