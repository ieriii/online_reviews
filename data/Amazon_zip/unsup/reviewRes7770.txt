Of the many great time's I've had in my life... BRAZILIAN MEAT FESTS are very high on the entertainment scale. Not only do the gaucho's dress all in their decorative garb - but they even are Brazilian with accents and everything!  When you go - tell them you are new and they'll be sure to explain tons to you.  When you go - try the house steak - no matter where you go to eat you should always give the house special a shot but in this case: Take a big piece. 3 or 4 slices, trust me. ORDER IT RARE! Even if you dont see rare on the skewer - they'll come back with it.  $29 lunch - all you can eat $50 dinner - all you can eat The most interesting salad bar I've ever had.
