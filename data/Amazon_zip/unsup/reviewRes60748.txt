Whats that other place kumas cor....... WHO CARES  Hands Down Best Burgers in city!!!!!!  Not really into heavy metal anymore but.... The 30 some flat screens is cool. Half owners I meet are Cocky jerks, but This guy asked us our opinions of the joint. Asked me what i wanted to hear on all tv screens I told him Guns N' Roses 5 mins later thats what was on all screens. I guess you just have to make him laugh a couple times for him to throw shot glasses and a bottle of Jameson on the table for a free shot. Tue. half price burgers & cheap drinks new Tue. spot. THE BAD I went to work the last 2 Wed. at noon instead of 7 A.M.
