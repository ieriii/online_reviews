I would give it five stars if they did something about the noise level. For a business lunch- which is when I go to Kinzie and they get the biggest rush of customers- it's incredibly noisy, so much so that you feel you have to yell to communicate. At a business lunch, the last thing I want is to strain to hear every word...or yell loudly about matters that could potentially be confidential. That said, the food is delicious. Just the other day I had the rock shrimp and asparagus risotto, and they didn't skimp on the goodness. Tons of shrimp and lots of flavor, and a perfect light meal for a winter day in Chicago. I've had the prime rib and a few cuts of steak there over the years, and those have been exceptional. The next time I go, I'm going to ask for a 'quiet' table and/or make a reservation, and I urge you to do the same;)
