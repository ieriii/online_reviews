This place was just OK. I'm seriously considering downgrading to two stars, just because of the huge letdown. All the yelp reviews hyped it up, but it was disappointing. The falafel sandwiches were very average. The falafel weren't crispy at all. I went there with family and almost everyone's sandwich fell apart half-way through. And don't even get me started on the hummus; some of the worst I've ever had. The containers you buy at the grocery store are better. In fact they serve the hummus in a plastic container, even if you're eating there. That's kind of strange... And it's served really cold. Even the pita bread that comes with the hummus was cold. Last of all, they don't accept credit cards. Get with the times. You know what, I am downgrading it to two stars. Those people that think this place has the "best falafel ever" and all these other great things to say about this place; well my friends you don't know what you're talking about. Go to Pita Inn and then talk. This place isn't even in the same universe as Pita Inn.
