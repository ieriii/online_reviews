We enjoyed our experience at Piccolo. The restaurant is quite charming, but the tables are very close together, but for our party, it resulted in 2 complementary pizzas for the table, as one of the people in our party kept getting bumped. After the pizzas, there was no need to order appetizers, and we ordered our main courses. Our party of 6 all ordered different pastas, and they were all very delicious. I tried most of them, and my favorite was definitely the tortelli, served with peas. Yummy! The portions are pretty decent, not big enough to share though. The balsamic and olive oil were also amazing, and I absolutely love foccacia!!! (If anyone knows of a bakery that sells foccacia - PM me!) The restaurant was really accommodating too - I ended up changing our reservations 3 times - our party grew from 3 to 6. It was half empty at about 6:30 on Saturday, but by the time we left, the entire dining room was full. There is plenty of metered parking nearby, but at $2/hour now, it's a much better bet to go with the $6 valet. We hope to be back to dine al fresco when the weather gets warmer!
