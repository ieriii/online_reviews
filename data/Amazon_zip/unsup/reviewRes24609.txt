How far can you really expect $35 to go at a place like this? I'm not really sure. But that's Mercat's weekly special for their Iron Chef Mondays, where they recreate all the dishes from an episode that Iron Chef Garces competed in. Well, after our dinner, I went home and pulled up the very episode our dinner was supposed to be based on - Battle Truffle. Now, I know truffle's expensive. I know that. But I noticed a few key differences between what we ate and what the judges ate: 1) Much less truffle. Ok, some of the dishes on the show had piles of shaved truffle, and there's no way $35 could cover that. But maybe a couple slices at least? 2) Straight-up substitutions. We got wild boar instead of veal, and there were places where the IC used some truffle variation of an ingredient that we didn't get. 3) Again, I know it was just $35...but the portions were really disappointing. With 4 of us, we had to split either one or two of the sizes that the judges got. Trying to split one egg and four small pieces of steak four ways is both simple and sad. It made me wonder what I would've received if I came by myself and ordered the same special. I think this could've been better if we were told ahead of time that it'd be wise to order something to accompany the special, or even if they had a more expensive option that let us have more. I wrote in my last review of this place that my dad joked about going to Wendy's after coming here. There being no Wendy's in the south loop, my friends and I hit up White Castle. No truffle there, but we were happy all the same.
