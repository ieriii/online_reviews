This place has a really fun, light-hearted atmosphere. Great for kids or just coming for a casual lunch or dinner. I love how the waitresses' pictures are lined up on the wall- it really adds to the charm of it. The salad bar is gigantic, though I didn't order it- a ton of people did. I had a chicken sandwich which was good and the fries are awesome. Stop in!!
