This place is great. I went here with friends and had spring rolls, noodles, and pho. All were delicious. The papaya salad was especially good. The service was very fast and we got our food in under 10 minutes. The atmosphere is lively and it's definitely a fun place to try if you're with a group. I would suggest making reservations. We went on a very busy night and were sat immediately because we had reservations.
