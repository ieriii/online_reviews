Indie is a great addition to the neighborhood. I don't eat sushi, but my husband does and says Indie's is excellent! I usually get the golden triangle (fried tofu with yummy sauce), and the broccoli chicken. Even such boring dishes are delish at Indie. The atmosphere is nice, too. They have comfy pillows in all the booths. Another great thing is that it's BYOB.
