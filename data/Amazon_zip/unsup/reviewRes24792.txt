This review is for dinner. It's very dark, romantic, trendy spanish tapas joint. We had the bacon wrapped dates, proscuitto wrapped arugala salad, shrimp (meh), and some type of rice w/ garganzo beans. We also had the flatbread, scallops. Everything was pretty tasty except the shrimp. They tasted frozen and could not even compare to Cafe Ibericos! Otherwise everything else was pretty good. I would come back and NOT order the shrimp! Btw, I came here for lunch one day and was NOT impressed. Only do the dinner..You'll thank me for it. Price was $50pp including tax/tip/and sangria! =)
