Just got back from a delicious meal at Sprout. I had the vegetarian tasting menu ($40) and my husband had the meat/seafood tasting menu ($65). I enjoyed mine as a 5 star and he enjoyed his as a 4. Very interesting flavors, however, not too crazy. It was a very "light" meal, not too heavy. The great part was that although we tasted several things, it didn't feel like they all blended together at the end where we didn't know what we had eaten. We could distinguish each course from one another.  I had the licorice salad, ricotta ravioli and the tropical fruit dessert. AMAZING!  LOVED my ravioli. Even my husband whose not a vegetarian said it was wonderful-perhaps even better than his "deer meat" Staff was VERY knowledgeable and friendly. As far as the space, it's okay, I was expecting something a bit larger and more dressed up. This felt to me more like a bar...perhaps because the main dining area was right when you walked in, next to the bar. Sort of felt casual but then not at the same time. Confusing? Sorry! Overall, great dining experience, food was delicious and well prepared using high quality ingredients (you could taste it). We're big foodies (if that means anything or not while you're viewing this review) and enjoyed our dinner today.
