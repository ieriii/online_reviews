Come for the experience, go elsewhere for anything else. Now don't get me wrong, I like me a good, hot, tasty superdawg every now and than and me and my family have been coming here for years and you can't imagine the glee my mother has over the 2nd location they're opening up in her town of Wheeling, wasteland that it is. But let's put it this way....IT'S A HOTDOG! For crying out loud, there's only so good you can make a hotdog and if its a fat all beef frank with traditional Chicago-style toppings I'm happy, but the thing is, I can get that same hot dog lots of places in the city and at a fraction of the price, heck I think they're slightly pricier than ballpark hotdogs and at least you go to the ballpark expecting to get ripped off on the food. Now unless your stuffing that dog with Kobi beef I can't see the reason for the cost when the gas station can somehow get away with chargin .50 per dog and still make a profit. On the plus-side, Superdawg IS an experience and a place to go to in order to get that throwback to the good 'ol days of drive-in dinners and the food is at least good, just not worthy of the prices they charge. Great place to bring out-of-towners though and give them a feel for the Chicago experience or to go to occasionally for your enjoyment because that's basically what your paying for, the experience.
