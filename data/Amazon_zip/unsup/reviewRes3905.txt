a total non believer i thought this was an imitation korean joint...OMG the food was so good (even slightly better than my Auntie Park) The budda bowls aka bim bim bop was really fresh and well seasoned I got mine with the beef, it is a meal in itself. the bbq chx wings were a bit spicy for my asian tongue but my bf wolfed them down......saves us a trip to H-Mart!! a bit pricy, $25 for two items but will be back when i'm in the hood!
