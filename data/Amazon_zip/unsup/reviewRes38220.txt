All my recon prior to coming to Chicago pointed to this spot as having some amazing pies...more like deep dishes!!!! I gotta say if you are Chicago...deep dish...pizza lover then this place is a Mecca. The "312" lager is smooth and light enough to let your taste buds appreciate the mounds of pepperoni in the "Pepperoni deep dish" I am talking layers of pepperoni, cheese, tomato sauce...i am salivating just at the thought of it again
