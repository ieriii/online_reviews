Oh, Purple Pig. See, I'd heard about you all around town and it was all such perfumed words of praise. I had to try you! I made plans several times, but things always fell through. And then it was my anniversary and it only seemed right to give that dinner to you. So off we went, me and my man. We nibbled on your pig ear with kale and an exquisitely fried egg. It was crisp and complex, and I enjoyed it far more than I expected. Smeared some roasted bone marrow on bread and swirled the familiar flavour all around my mouth. Luscious. My mother used to boil bones and feed me marrow with a sprinkle of salt; she said it would make me strong. Well, strong desire is definitely what I'm feeling for you, Pig. Oh, and then we ended the night with the sumptuous Sicilian Iris. It arrived plump and ready. We gently prodded the brioche together; such an act can only be shared! It oozed out a silken and sexy concoction of ricotta and chocolate. Pig! You are just too much. Cannot wait until our next encounter.
