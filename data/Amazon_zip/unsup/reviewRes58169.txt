I am in love with this restaurant! We had great service, and the food was outstanding! Not your typical tapas place... MUCH Better!! For $55 they will do a 3 course chef selection of tapas. I highly recommend going this route. It allowed us to try a lot of food that I would have never ordered on my own.  For $20 more, they will pair each course with wine :)
