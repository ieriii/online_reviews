This place is overrated. The "romantic atmosphere" consisted too close for comfort tables and dusty decoration. We had reservations, but were not seated until 30 minutes later, forcing us to sit at the bar. The bartender kept pushing drinks (even after we said that we weren't interested). We eventually gave in and ordered a bottle of wine...hope the bartender is making commission, because he sure knows how to act like a used car salesman. We were finally seated and the waiter proceeded to ask us what we wanted. This was our first time - we had no idea what was going on. We asked if he could give us a brief explanation on how everything works, which he did. Cheese: My only complain on the cheese fondue was that it tasted like melted cheeze whiz - very disappointing, especially after reading all the reviews on yelp. Entree: I've never had fondue where everything is basically supposed to be deep-fried. The oil squirted everywhere, stinging us. And the food constantly stuck to the bottom of the bowl. After asking the waiter if we could do anything to prevent this, he just laughed and said it happens. Really?! Desert: The chocolate was very good - no complaints. I especially liked the s'mores idea the waiter gave us. Overall, it wasn't a great experience, especially for a bill over $160. I will not be heading back to Geja's Cafe.
