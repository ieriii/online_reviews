Ok so I dragged my friends here when we were visiting Chicago and it was YUMMMY and it was a hit with my friends too. They don't call me Veggilicious for nothing! So I made The Greek (my nick name for her) come here to humor me, she is such a good sport and loves to tease me being that I am a veggie head but I know she loves the dishes. Sweet Potato quesedillas was her choice and they were yummy, (I kept eating off her plate). My other friend we call "finicky" who can be such a pain when we go out was even satisfied she ordered the most items! We ordered a few more things between the three of us my and had a wonderful veg fest so happy I ran into this place on my visit to Chicago.
