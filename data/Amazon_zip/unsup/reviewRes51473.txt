The one star is for the company I had with me. I ordered my usual Mexican restaurant fare. Chicken Burrito Suizo... This was the Driest, most flavorless burrito I have ever laid my taste buds on... BUT that was nowhere near the worst part of my visit to Garcia's. A full day and a half sitting on the pot more than i was sleeping or working... I would avoid this location at least if you care at all about your health!
