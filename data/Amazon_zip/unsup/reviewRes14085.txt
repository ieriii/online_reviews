Terrific food, served by friendly and professional staff. Oh and did I say the food was terrific? The seafood is always good, that's their specialty. Fresh tasting, never overcooked. But the surprises are the other menu items. Like a huge pork chop with the BEST DRESSING you will ever taste ... terrific ribs ... and wonderful steak. The egg dishes are always super. And the few salads are all good. My only caveat is that vegetarians find very limited choices here. The place is trendy enough, the food great enough, to include veggie items that aren't salads. Many vegetarians are not into salads, they're considered boring and not always very nutritious. But to the Yelp whiners who complained about some empty tables being reserved -- HEY, MAKE A RESERVATION. Great restaurants do this to avoid the scenes described here. For Glenn's, call ahead, always. Ravenswood is lucky to have such a great restaurant. I take my out-of-town guests here, and they are always satisfied.
