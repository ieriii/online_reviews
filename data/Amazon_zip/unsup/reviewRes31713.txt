Go see Marco overbydere. I work in the neighborhood and love going to here to eat. Friendly staff. Pleasant environment. Outstanding food. Nice philosophy. Also good coffee drinks. At breakfast or brunch, get nanadict or chilequiles or at least make someone else get them and eat theirs.  Northsiders, don't be afraid of the southside, we really do eat the same foods as you do.
