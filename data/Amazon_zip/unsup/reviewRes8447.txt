The husband took me here for my birthday after talking about it for MONTHS! It definitely living up to all of his rave reviews. From the salad bar to the cuts of meat - it was a unique and delicious experience. Make sure you turn your little card to red or the meat guys will literally attack you! I just wish my stomach was bigger so I could fill it with more yummy food.
