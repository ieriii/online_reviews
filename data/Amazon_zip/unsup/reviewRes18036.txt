I only yelp a place if it is really really good, really bad, or unethical. Welcome to the really really good category, Bad Apple. This place is so cool. Great atmosphere, great beer selection, great menu. I ordered the Chupacabra burger, which has goat chili and goat cheese on it. That's a very unusual combination and not something I would go with, but the heavily tattooed bartender that took my order perfectly described the unusual flavors of the burger the way only an expert NY Times Food critic could and I took the plunge. It was the most unusual and one of the best burgers I've ever had. Her description and recommendation was perfect. I can't wait to go back to this place. I hope they get a ton of business.
