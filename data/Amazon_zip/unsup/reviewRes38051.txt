As someone who likes beer from Belgium I was seriously impressed with the selection that Hopleaf has to offer. I haven't been to many places that have St. Bernadus on tap. I decided to go here on a Friday night which was a terrible idea since this place was PACKED. Expect to wait at least an hour to get a table, most likely more. I highly suggest to go here during non prime time hours. I was lucky enough to get a seat right by the entrance. The service was exceptional for being so busy.
