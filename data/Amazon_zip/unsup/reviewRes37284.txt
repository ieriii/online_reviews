Why so many haters on F & O cafe? I love this place, although it does get crowded in the mornings. When my parents were in town, they wanted to eat here for every meal. My favorites are: Breakfast/brunch: -Truffled eggs benedict, comes with delicious roasted potatoes. -Fruit plate with vanilla yogurt....seriously, really good fruit (and I usually won't order fruit dishes in Chicago...I'm a snob about it after growing up in the Central Valley of California) -Fresh squeezed OJ Lunch/Dinner: -Grilled cheese (DELICIOUS) -Spinach salad -BBQ chicken sandwich -Turkey, cranberry, brie sandwich -SWEET POTATO FRIES!!!!! I've found that the soups and pastries to be just ok. The coffee is pretty good
