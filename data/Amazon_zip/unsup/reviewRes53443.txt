From the first step to the last, Alinea is a must for educated foodies...The service was absolutely perfect and the food was mind bending! If you have the time and money, treat yourself to the 24 course wine pairing. This is the place you imagine taking people that you would love to impress...I went with three very solid chefs and we were blown away by the food, wine and service. We went to L20 the next night and were soooo disappointed I thought two of the three guys were going to walk out! Do not waste your time or money on L20. Go to Alinea and get a true memoriable experience!
