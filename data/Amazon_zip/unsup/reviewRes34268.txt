i thought this place was great! we were served real quick . we lucked out on our arrival because we just beat the crowd. literally 2-3 people walked in every 2 minutes. today was a nice day so we helped ourselves to outdoor seating. they have a pretty good falafel and their kefta kabobwas quite tasty. generous portions too! i think the guy mischarged me and both items rang up to about $6.50...score! i want to come back and try something else. other items looked and smelled quite good too! the only drawback is that it's cash only...boo!
