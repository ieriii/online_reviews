I've taken my fiance to Geja's twice and both experiences have been phenomenal. The food is very good. And if you go get the cheese and chocolate fondue, its the best thing on the menu. The other offerings are just OK in my opinion (the meats and seafood) as you cook them in oil, the flavor doesn't really shine through. We ordered the meat, seafood and veggies on our first visit. There are other fondue places where you cook the meats and veggies in a flavored broth which I think is more tasty. But all things considered if you order the cheese and chocolate fondue and a nice bottle of wine it is not only delicious but also a good value. We not only ate well on Valentines Day but escaped with a bill under $100 with gratuity! Our server was very nice and knowledgeable about the food and the wines although she did have a bit of trouble keeping the Sterno lit. The atmosphere is very intimate and romantic. The tables are very closely placed so it can be a bit uncomfortable navigating your way to the restroom. But other than that the music volume was spot on and the lighting was at a nice dusky level letting the candle light warmly illuminate the table. Would very highly recommend.
