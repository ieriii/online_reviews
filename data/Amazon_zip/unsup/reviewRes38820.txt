La Villa is great! Their traditional Italian dishes are expertly prepared, delicious and unpretentious. The majority of the pasta dishes are plated in such a way that they look exactly as you would expect them to, until your perspective kicks in. After comparing the dish to your now tiny little fingers and tiny little utensils, you realize the trick your mind has played on you. The portions are HUGE! The next sensory overload comes the moment you dig in. My most recent experience was with the Vegetable Lasagna, which was a cacophony of flavor and a symphony of silky textures. It was a vegetarian delight, even to a devout, card-carrying carnivore like me. And did I mention the steaks? The Filet Mignon at La Villa is as good as any I've had at twice the price. It's especially good after a half-dozen freshly shucked oysters on the half shell (maybe a dozen) or a tasty shrimp cocktail. And the pizza! Thin-crust (or extra thin if you're like me), Pan or Stuffed, you cannot go wrong. Try the Southwest (chicken, bacon and bbq sauce) or the Italian beef with giardiniera. Delicious! Since their recent, triumphant exposure on Check, Please on PBS, they have seen their business boom, especially on the weekends. I am somewhat of a regular and I have made a conscious effort to go more often during the week. It's then I rarely have to wait more than a few minutes for a table. We still go on the weekends, and we've been pleasantly surprised by just how much fun it is to be entertained by Jose, their resident "mixologist" at the bar while we wait for our table. His take on the "Long Island" is absolutely wicked, and when Tommy Moran and his accordion are there, it's a party! I have even had La Villa cater a few events for me, and from now on, I won't go anywhere else. Great food. Great Service. Unbelievable value. If you're in the neighborhood, you've probably already been here. If not, make the trip. It is SO worth it!
