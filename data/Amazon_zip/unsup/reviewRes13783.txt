This place gets a lot of "awesome"s in my book. Beer - awesome (Workingman Mild - fave) Food - awesome (Bacon Fat Popcorn - yumumumum) Interior - awesome (tin ceiling, big Fist wood pillars, wall "tables" and communal hanging/gathering spot in front) Service - awesome! * Don't be scared off when you may hear or read about the long wait. They don't take reservations, so you put your name down and go find a spot at the bar and chill. You can order appetizers there, and by the time your glass is empty, the hostess will probably find you. Seriously, I think we were quoted an hour and a half wait, it only took an hour, and it felt like nothing. The menu blends the traditional and the modern. There are plenty of options for both vegetarians and carnivores. I really loved the Bacon Fat Popcorn and Sweet Potato Cakes, and the Fish & Chips was a winner, especially with the jalapeno honey slaw on the side. We got some of the Blue Cheese Potato salad to try, and it was excellent. The Tempeh Reuben and corned beef and cabbage were mighty good, too. Beer is used in a lot of their recipes, and you can really taste it - mo beer, mo betta, I say! *At the end of our meal, we were informed by our server that the manager wanted to buy us dessert, as an apology for bumping into our table a couple of times (which we did not even notice!) It was such a nice and friendly gesture, and we thoroughly enjoyed our conversation with her, as well as the Cherry Bourbon Cake. I would definitely hang out here if I were a local, and I encourage you to go check it out if you are. Locally brewed beers, a hearty but not heavy meal, and friendly people are more than enough reasons to say "Cheers" on a regular basis.
