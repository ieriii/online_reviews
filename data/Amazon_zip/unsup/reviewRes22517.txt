I believe that a three-star rating is a bit unfair for this place. I was quite dissappointed. The night before, we went here and saw a long queue, and I built up my expectation, believing that the restaurant should be a real treat for me. The next day we came again, and sat. We ordered some fish, beef and broccoli. When the dishes were delivered, I was not so happy. I expected much better food. The food was betten than average, but didn't match my expectation. So a four-star was too generous from my side.
