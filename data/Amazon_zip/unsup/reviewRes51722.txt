The burritos are amazing. The quesadillas are just as good. The guacamole is TO DIE FOR. I heart the horchata. I always run to this restaurant whenever I have a Mexican food craving, and they always deliver. The service can be much better, but I think it's due to the imploding amount of patrons wanting excellent Mexican food.
