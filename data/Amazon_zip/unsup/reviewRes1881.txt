I had their Chicago Dog, which was great, but I wouldn't wait in line for more than 15 mins for it. Maybe I'm not a hot dog aficionado, but I don't think hot dogs are worth that long of a wait.  If you do wait the line (I waited 1.5 hrs on a Saturday afternoon), I would definitely try one of their glorified hot dog's which is worth the wait and hype, but maybe for just a one time deal. I had the "spicy jerk pork sausage" which had great flavors. Lastly, everyone talks about the duck fat fries. I got a side of those and wasn't really all that impressed. They were a little soggier than I would like and the flavor didn't really come out. Next time, I would just order regular fries. Be aware it is cash only!
