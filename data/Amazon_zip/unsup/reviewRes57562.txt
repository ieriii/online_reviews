I was a Greek food virgin when I arrived at this place. The food it's incredible, it's fresh and prepared with care. I recommed the zaganaki, and the stuffed peppers. Be careful with Greek coffee because it can be a challenge to drink. Works better if you go with a group of people and order a little of everything in the menu. The ambience goes for a meditterranean style that blends perfectly with the food and the crowd. Best of all FREE VALET!
