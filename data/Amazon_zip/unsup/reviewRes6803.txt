Did Chicago q's Thanksgiving dinner with a GrubWithUs group -- my first grub. Had an overpriced Balvenie at the bar after arriving early, while I browsed the web and played Angry Birds on my Kindle Fire via q's 3 WiFi zones. Ran into a gentleman at the bar with a Kindle 3G, which gave us a great conversation topic while I waited for my group and he waited for his meal. The smoked free-range turkey was nothing short of AWESOME. From the minute I walked in the door, the smell of BBQ had me tempted to skip the traditional turkey meal, but the turkey was totally worth it. Juicy, smokey, falling apart in the just the right places. The meal was served family-style, passing serving dishes, and I feel the amount of turkey was a bit lacking, but it made up for lack of quantity in volume of awesomeness. Somehow q was out of mashed potatoes -- how do you pull that on Thanksgiving? Fortunately one of our grubbers thought to ask for mac 'n' cheese as a replacement, and the mac 'n' cheese was definitely in my top 5 ever. The candied yams? sweet potatoes? were good, but almost TOO good -- too much candy, not enough veggie. Great complement to the smokey turkey however. Drink service during the meal was a bit slow -- I got my second beer just about as I finished my food. Will definitely be going back for traditional BBQ, and will review again.
