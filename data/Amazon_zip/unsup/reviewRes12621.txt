Almond Crusted Halibut served with a saffron cream, over jalapeo mashed potatoes & sauted seasonal vegetables. Need I say more? I took my husband here for his birthday and we were SO impressed we went back a week later. We ended up sitting at the same table and had the same waitress - all 3 of us including the server had da ja voo. The staff is so friendly and accommodating. What I love about this place is that it has great food and a great atmosphere, but without the pretentiousness. It's very casual and you feel like you fit in immediately. The menu is so unique - you want to order 1 of everything. The food looks and tastes like it came out of the Top Chef kitchen. The portions are great too - no doggy bags needed and you don't leave feeling sluggish. The prices are high, but they deserve to be. I'm not sure if they take reservations, but be prepared to wait at least 30-45 minutes for a table. It's always packed, but you end up finding a little nook in the bar to stand and wait with a drink in hand.
