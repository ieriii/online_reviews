ok...two more years...lots more iranian food at noon o kabob and at many other iranian restaurants...a trip to iran after about 32 years...and becoming a little easier in my ratings, now i rate noon o kabob a 5 star. this sure is one of my favorite iranian restaurants....the service by one iranian lady whose name i have forgotten and a couple of polish ladies, one russian, one belarus, and others are absolutely great...the bus boys too... the ASH is delicious...try as many dishes and as many different ones as you can....you'll love it... the one thing i miss there is i wish they had some kinda TANDOUR and made true iranian bread....
