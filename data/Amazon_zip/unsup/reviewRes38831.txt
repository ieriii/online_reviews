This may be a bit of an exaggeration (but not much of one) to state that the Hopleaf is one of the best things that has ever come out of Chicago food wise. With their ample portions and extensive beer selections, it's hard to leave this place either hungry or sober. The CB&J- cashew butter, fig jam, morbier cheese, on sourdough - with homemade Stilton mac and cheese and potato chips is one of the best things I have ever eaten. The mussels for two are also amazing. We usually split the two and leave floating on a little epicurean cloud back home. Now, despite the 5 stars I think this place more than deserves, there is one serious drawback that other Yelpers have picked up on.  It's the wait time. If you're lucky enough to get inside the door on a weekend, you'll inevitably spend 1-2 hours drinking upstairs in the cash only bar before getting a table. This makes it all the more important to pace oneself given the wide selection of beers. That said, this place is totally worth the wait.
