Did not have a reservation, so intended to sit at the bar and honestly had the best service from James. We enjoyed our cocktails and then ordered the burrata cheese appetizer with some crushed peas, pea shoots, and radishes. So good - my boyfriend was really wanting steak so wound up getting their amazing 20oz special Ribeye, which he loved and was very thankfully they partially cut it for you. I had the truffled pasta - very good (maybe a little to al dente), but awesome flavor. Was sad we had no room for dessert.
