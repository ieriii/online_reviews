My husband and I decided to brave the masses for a celebratory dinner last night. I ran a 10K yesterday and was ready to eat the hell out of some Bayless food. After a solid 2 hours at Hub 51 and a bit of time in the Frontera bar area, we were seated. The food was, as expected, outstanding. We shared the Ceviche Fronteriza and the pork carnitas gorditas. The only thing that could improve the gorditas was a healthy dollop of the green salsa our waiter placed on the table (so good). The ceviche was light, fresh and had the fresh, briny taste of the ocean. For entrees we had the duck breast with chayote and sweet potato mash and the flank steak. Both were very, very good. Unfortunately, my face (including my lips) was extremely windburned from the race yesterday, so I found the chayote to be way too spicy (I love spicy foods and had my lips not been so chapped I am sure it would have been just fine for me). The flank steak was delicious. My husband had a Michelada (beer, bloody mary mix and lime) which was great. I had a grapefruit margarita followed by a glass of zinfandel. I'd skip the margarita next time - definitely tasty, but not heavy enough on the booze and very small for the $14 price tag. We skipped dessert as we were way too full, but the white cornmeal poundcake with blueberry salsa and maple ice cream was calling my name! The service was good. The only reason Frontera is not 5 stars is because of the no reservations policy and the atmosphere. Seriously, we were handed a BUZZER and asked to wait near a rack of t-shirts, cookbooks and hot sauces. It was a little like waiting for a table at Chilis or some tourist trap. The only other restaurant I can think of that sells t-shirts and hot sauce is Hooters...
