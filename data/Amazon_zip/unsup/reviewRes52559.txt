This was the first time I have gone to a restaurant with a coupon. If you live in Chicago, you must have seen them. Typical Brazilian steakhouse; smaller, less glamorous salad bar than Fogo, and the guys with the meat are less present on the floor than Fogo. There were a couple of meats that never seemed to get around to us, though we certainly didn't feel ignored. The food itself was quite good, and I learned that I like pork an awful lot. My only real problem was this; you know those little tip guide charts that some restaurants provide at the bottom of your check? This one suggested I tip based on the amount post-coupon. I feel the staff deserves to be tipped on the amount of the check BEFORE my coupon savings kick in, and to suggest otherwise is not backing your staff the way a restaurant should. Just because you use a coupon doesn't mean you shouldn't use it with a little class.
