The food was skillful and thoughtful and just as everyone has posted, the grilled cheese was to die for. The only miss for us was the foie. We assumed we were getting a piece of foie, when instead it was a mousse. We also ate the scallops, short ribs and pork, which were all on point. The apple and pineapple desserts were also different, refreshing and inventive. Now comes the bad part for us. We had an 8 o'clock reservation. We got there at 7:40, and even though half the tables weren't occupied, they still told us to sit at the bar until 8. We said we preferred not to if possible, but they still wouldn't seat us. Now, I can understand if they were at capacity, but they weren't, so this put a sour note in my mouth from the beginning. The service was also only okay. They finally seated us at 8:05 and at 8:30, we still didn't have a drink in front of us. They also did not describe the meals when presenting them, so even though there were delicious meatballs in the pork dish, I wouldn't be be able to tell you about them. Another huge miss was the bathroom which was kind of dirty and I had to go searching for tp, unwrap it, etc. If we are paying 200 plus for dinner, I kind of expect those little details. I wanted to give feedback to the restaurant, but there is no way to do that. If they improve their service, then this restaurant could be great, but this is not a place I would go back to as it stands now, even though dale rocked the food.
