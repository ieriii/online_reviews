I enjoy eating out by myself. Why? Because I get to observe the strange behavior of humans. My interactions with the waitress here was so incredibly awkward and flirty, and with my social awkardness added to the mix I'm sure it would've been excruciating to watch. MMMMM ukranian borsch and salmon lox. I approve!
