Love this place for all my carnivorous cravings !!!!! The steaks are perfectly marinated and cooked to perfection, drinks are strong and just right, ( One carnberry Margarita and I was past tipsy) servers are knowledgeable and attentive, the room is beautiful, ( love the little room down stairs) & Live music Friday and Saturday. Best Colombian food in Chicago. I could eat here everyday !!!!!
