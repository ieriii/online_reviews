brazilian style steak buffet. do you need any more reason to go there? Ok how about the awesome salad bar? I've been there half a dozen times and every time I go I swear to myself I won't touch anything from the salad bar, and save my appetite for the meat. But I just can't resist. It's that good and appetizing. I've been to Texas de Brazil, Brazzaz, and Ipanema Grill, overall Fogo de Chao has the best quality meat and largest salad bar. Their half price lunch buffets are an awesome deal.
