To me, this place is unique amongst the Chicago style pizza places. The burnt ring around the edge of the pizza really adds something different, and somehow it actually works. I've only been here for lunch. They run a great deal at $5 for a personal size pizza and a drink. You can even get a beer if you wish for that price. The veggie toppings I've tried have always been fresh, and I've never had a bad pizza here.  I wish it was a little closer to the "el" but it's worth the walk or short cab ride from the North Clybourn stop.
