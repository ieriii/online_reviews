I thought this place was fantastic. For a person who doesn't yet extensively know about wine, I loved the wine flight option in which they choose 4 different wines under a certain category (earthy, spanish reds, etc.). The cheese selection is impressive and the entree (lobster salad) and dessert I chose was melt-in-your-mouth delicious. I don't know if the fact that one of my co-diners aunt is the co-owner of the restaurant did anything to ensure only the best dining experience however, this is a place I will tell people about and make sure I go back to when I'm back in Chicago. The server was attentive and our water was always filled. They sell all the wine they serve in thier store and the entire selection is under $20 a bottle. They plan "movie nights" in which they show a guilty pleasure movie, and they serve a 3 course dinner which is included in the price of the ticket (which sell out pretty fast). There is another more italian-style place below where you can see the entire kitchen at work (at least you know they're clean). I was really impressed.
