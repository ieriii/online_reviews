Went back with some friends and tried the "Lockdown Warden" and it was not good. The menu says, "Juicy burger infused with bacon, leeks, garlic and shallots and stuffed with Merkts Chedder (sic) and topped with fried leeks and shallots tossed in truffle oil = fucking awesome" Well folks, it SOUNDS awesome but it WASN'T awesome. I tasted no bacon, leeks, garlic or shallots so the meat wasn't really "infused" well enough. There was barely a sprinkling of crispy leeks/shallots on top and I completely missed any truffle oil flavor. What I did taste was their "chedder" and it was SERIOUSLY overpowering. But it did ooze out when cut as my server promised -- but not for my friend who ordered the same thing. In fact, his had like 1/5 the cheese mine did. Wasn't a good burger but I so wanted it to be. Such a letdown.  But the fries were awesome.
