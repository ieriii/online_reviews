Shaw's was an experience.. I went there around 5 pm, during half price oysters. My parents had warned me not to eat any funny looking oysters, but these were anything but funny. A dozen different kinds? Laid out in a lovely display? Friendly service? Check! It would be too pricey for me if not for the half price, so I'm so glad they offer that. And I'm glad I get to eat good oysters and feel swanky.
