Went here for the first time about six months after I kept hearing coworkers rave about their deep dish pizza. Since then, I have been back almost once a week for weekend outings with friends - I even went here to celebrate my birthday! Normally I get a medium deep dish pepperoni so that I have plenty to take home but last time I added sausage and it was great - they put on chunks of delicious and juicy meat. The only other thing I have had here (besides plenty of booze) is the garlic bread, which was very subpar. Nothing special. Stick with the pizza!
