Wow! Irazu packs the punch with flavor in every part of the entree! And all the savory flavors meld into perfect deliciousness. I came here last night to celebrate, and even though the place was small.. we were seated right away, although it was rather crowded for a weeknight when we left. Anyway, back to the food. I've never had Costa Rican food before but to me it seemed like somewhere a mix of mexican, carribean, and peruvian. In other words, aMAzING! I was really going back and forth b/t the award winning veggie burrito and the casado. And yes I went with the meat.. I can't help myself. The steak casado came with sweet plaintains (ah delicious), flavorful thin rib eye steak pieces topped with grilled onions, and a side chopped cabbage salad with beets, radishes, cucumber etc. We upgraded to the Costa Rican rice (TOTALLY WORTH IT! only a dollar or so) as opposed to plain white rice. The rice was kinda like a flavored "dirty rice" with spices, black beans, and loads of savory zing. And we got free oatmeal shakes (with soy~) for the table (apparently its like 1 free oatmeal shake per 25 dollar purchase if you are a yelper). So we just shared 2 among the group. And I was so curious when I read about this famous oatmeal shake on yelp. It has a slightly sweet cinnamon flavor, and basically tasted like a horchata smoothie/milkshake! It was around 12-15 dollars for an entree, and around like 5 bucks for a burrito. All the entrees are huge portions, so definitely will have leftovers for the next day :) Will have to go back to try the empanadas and veggie burrito! This is why I love yelp!
