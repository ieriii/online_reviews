I took my son and his friend to the Flaming Lips concert at the Aragon last night. I let my son pick out the restaurant we would eat at before the concert, and he chose Demera -- right down the block from the Aragon. The service and the food were both great. The wait staff assisted with explaining Ethiopian food and customs and recommended dishes, when asked. I was surprised at the amount of food that we were able to share and experience. Each dish had a unique flavor. Service was reasonably quick and very friendly. The cost was very reasonable. I would certainly recommend this restaurant to friends and consider coming again if in the area.
