Have you ever had high expectations for a place, because they have one special item that people just rave about? And then have you ever tried that one special item and wondered what the hype was about? Well, wifey and I stood in line for an hour at Hot Doug's because we heard the duck fat fries were phenomenal. When we sat down and got our fries, we were both underwhelmed.  There was nothing different about duck fat fries that we could taste. We also tried the Kiera Knightly dog, which was pretty good and spicy, and the normal hot dog, which was just okay. The highlight of our visit was Doug himself taking our order, and he was genuinely nice and funny man. I'm glad we got to experience the place once, but it's not a place I'd need to experience again.
