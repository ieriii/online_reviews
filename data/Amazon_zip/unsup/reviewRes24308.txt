I would give it 4 stars because the food was very good but I found a hair in my crepe halfway through. I still got charged for it even though I made the server aware of the incident. The server finally adjusted the bill when I mentioned it was not right to pay for something that they screwed up. May go back once the cooks get some decent hairnets!
