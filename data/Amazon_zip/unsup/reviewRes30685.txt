It seems that most of these reviews are for brunch, and since my friends and I went there for their Sunday dinner, I thought I'd add my two cents. I ordered the chicken dinner, and since it sounded like way more food than I could handle and my fiance wasn't terribly hungry, he ordered a salad and was going to have a piece of my chicken. When he ordered the salad, the waitress asked him if he wanted anything else, and he said no, he was going to have a piece of mine. She then got upset and said the chicken dinner was $22 per person and then passive aggressively said, "It's alright" and walked away. I felt like I'd been accused of stealing. It all became apparent what she meant when the food came out: my other two friends had ordered the chicken dinner as well, and all the food came out on large communal plates. Oh. I still felt like that could have been explained, since I had thought I would get my own plate. Add to this weird experience that other staff kept trying to take our plates even before we had finished and in sum it was a very off-putting service experience. The food was fine. Not great. The combination of biscuits, fried chicken, and mac and cheese made for a very dry dinner, and the cole slaw had way more jalapenos than anyone could possibly eat. Definitely won't be going back, and at $22 per person, glad we didn't waste money getting a fourth serving for my fiance.
