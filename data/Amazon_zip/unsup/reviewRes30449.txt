I've only eaten there once and was not impressed. the menu is full of meat substitutions which to me seems odd. If you don't eat meat why do you want a strange textured seitan substance to simulate meat? I had a hard time finding something I wanted on the menu. I had a big salad with slightly dirty greens and bad hummus. who has bad hummus?!? why not have some truely GOOD vegetable dishes instead of trying to be meatless meat dishes?!!? the one star mainly goes to the bakery. I had a vegan birthday cake from there that truely tasted like rubberbands! not that i eat rubberbands but you know that scent, well imagine that as a cake. disgusting.
