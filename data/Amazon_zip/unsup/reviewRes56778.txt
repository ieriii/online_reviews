Huge line on a Saturday Night. I'd heard a lot about it. Very, very friendly service, very knowledgeable staff. I must say though the pizza was a little overrated. I expected crispy crust, not floppy. And, a little more flavor. It was just so-so. But the mozzarella salad and the antipasto plate were really good.
