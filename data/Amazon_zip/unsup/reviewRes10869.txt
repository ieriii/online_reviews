This place is REALLY solid thinner crust which can be rare to find in Chicago. Not the most cheap but well worth the cost. Also they have hitchino beer which in the summer is a great match for pizza. Minus one star because the server we had was really friendly but dissepeared for a long while and didn't come back for a very long time. Myself and two other tables had to get up and talk to the host to get him back... then he got angry we didn't tip him. I'm sure this isn't piece's fault as everyone else I know seems to have a good expereince with waitstaff here. I'd LOVE to go back.
