This place is great. I'm wavering between 4 and 5 stars, but I'll go with 4. We came at 7:30 on a Wenesday, expecting to wait, and we did, but only for about a half hour (or one and a half rounds of margaritas!). I chose frontera as a special date. My mother bought be a nice dress and gave my boyfriend $100 to take me out. We could have gone above and beyond and gone somewhere more expensive, but I knew that if we went to frontera under other cirumstances I would try to get the least expensive thing on the menu. But we got to splurg at frontera...and it was fun! We started out with the Sopas Rancheras and OMFG. Best thing we got. In fact I would eat 2 servings as a meal everyday. soooooo gooooooood. Then we got the ceviche yucateco (shrimp and calamari), and this was the lowest point of the meal...I wish we would've gotten regular fish ceviche, or even just guac instead. The texture did not work.  For our entres we got the Carne Asada a la Oaxaquena and Pato al Ajillo, duck and steak. Both were geat. We had leftovers and they were great! Delish hot coco followed, and with one round our bill was $98...for so much food!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Good.
