More than a month after my meal, I've decided I really do need to dock some Yelp stars from Alinea to average it out to four stars. What is the purpose of fine dining? Food at its simplest is a means of sustenance but most chefs aspire to something greater than that - an experience, a revelation, a burst of emotion. In the moment, that experience is mostly pleasure and sensation. Later, long after the meal has been consumed, only memory remains. Herein lies the problem: my memory of Alinea will almost always be tainted. Without written or visual aids, I have only a vague recollection of the subtleties of flavor, smell and texture. I remember - in the abstract sense - the meal being technically and aesthetically brilliant, but the overwhelming emotion is one of disappointment. The initial adrenaline rush of meeting Chef Achatz is gone, elation over discovering new flavor combinations somewhat muted, and what was a merely frustrating 5-minute interaction has now evolved into a dark cloud hanging over the memory of an otherwise delicious meal. The human mind has a tendency to become more fixed over time; opinions are stronger, less subject to shades of gray. A few sentences of somewhat patronizing preamble to the meal can have outsized impact in the long run that not even the talents of Achatz's team can counteract. I'll return one day, still a lightweight but not quite so young. I wonder if I will be treated differently. I hope that, in the meantime, Alinea will learn not to judge a book by its cover.
