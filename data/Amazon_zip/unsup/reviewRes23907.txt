We asked waitress to split the bill between 2 credit cards. It was $86.00 so we expected it to come back $43 apiece. I said 50/50 so the waitress came back and had charged $50 each. I've never been to a restaurant that charged its customers more than the actual bill. So we just paid $50 each to include the tip. We would have tipped more had we been give the opportunity. I can't believe the waitress could be that dumb. It's all about getting the money.
