Good hotel, but for the price I was unimpressed. They claim to have "heavenly beds" but they really weren't much better than any other hotel. I had lunch at the restaurant downstairs and my $13 turkey wrap was pretty mediocre as well. The internet was easy to use and reliable, though thats really standard now so it really doesn't win much points in my book. The rooms were pretty large, but again, pretty standard for the price. If i'm back in town I'd probably try another place to stay next time.
