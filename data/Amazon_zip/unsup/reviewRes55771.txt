Man...everytime I eat here, I fall more in love with the place. My city friends love it, because you pay Carmine's prices and you get better food, more food, and pay a fraction of the cost. I regularly stuff my fat little face with veal parmigiana, but have also had the chicken. You get salad and soup with all entrees. It's a steal. If you want amazing food and enjoy feeling like you are about to explode from over-eating, go here. Also, the waiters are the nicest, most attentive people in the business. I can't say enough great things about this place.
