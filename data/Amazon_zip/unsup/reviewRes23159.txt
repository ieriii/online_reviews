They were out of the lamb chop special on the menu Wednesday night! But then the waiter quickly pointed out that the lamb chops on the regular menu are his favorite item, so I ordered those. My parents each got the Mediterranean Sea Bass, which is roasted whole. The sea bass was the same as last time and my parents enjoyed theirs. The lamb chops were pretty good, but could have used a better sear on the outside and less cooking in general, as the inside was medium-well. The veggies we ordered, a side of green beans and a side of mixed vegetables were too salty. The potato, with the tangy tomato sauce, was good. I'll probably be back again.
