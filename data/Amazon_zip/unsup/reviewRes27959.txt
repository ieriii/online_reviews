What a hidden gem. My friends told me about this place and we went on a Friday night. It was busy and there was a wait, but it was well worth it. The food is very authentic Mexican and maybe even too much for some people as you can't really understand the people working there and the menu can be difficult to translate. Just point at something on the menu and go with it, it will be great. It is BYOB and there is a small store next door that will sell you the booze and bring it in a black bag.
