Sure there are other great pizza places in the city, and I go the them from time to time. But hands down, The Art of Pizza has the best all around pizza. If you disagree you're wrong. It would be nice if they served alcohol and was nicer, but it's all about the pizza, man. Still Chicago's best kept secret.
