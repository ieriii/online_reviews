Went with my family on a weekday; it was easy to get a table. I had an omelet, which was light, but lacked flavor. The apple butter with the toast was awesome. The potatoes were plain and salty. Definitely lacked the sophistication I expected from the chef, and needs improvement. My husband had a few eggs and pancakes. The pancakes were ridiculously wonderful, and his eggs were better than my omelet. I will have what he had on our next visit. Also, we both had raspberry mochas, and agreed they were the best coffee drinks we've ever had. Now that I know what to order, I think it's worth the money. We will visit often!
