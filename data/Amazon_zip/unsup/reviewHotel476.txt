I stayed here for Lollapalooza weekend - it's close to the north location of the festival and just a block away from Michigan Ave so very convenient. The closest L stop is Grand-Red which is a few blocks away. Staff was pleasant but not overly friendly - I appreciated that the front desk staff found an available room before check in time and everyone was helpful when needed, they just didn't go out of their way to make nice if that makes any sense. Rooms are standard Embassy Suites with the separate bedroom and living room. The bathrooms were roomy and the towels were the nice big bath sheets which is always a plus. Complimentary breakfast was just okay - when the hotel is sold out like it was the weekend I was there, the lines are long and they run out of things fast. But if you're patient, you can pretty much get whatever you'd want for breakfast. They also have the complimentary evening reception with snacks. I'd stay here again but can't really give more stars since I wasn't wowed.
