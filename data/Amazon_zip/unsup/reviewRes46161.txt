I've been to the Grand Lux twice now and the second visit was great, we got window seat overlooking Michigan Avenue, it was FAB!  Great menu, good food, great er desserts!! Beautiful decor and everything about the Lux is just GRAND!!  Good time no matter if it's just a table for 2 or a large party.
