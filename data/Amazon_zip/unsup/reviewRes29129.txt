We ventured to Frontera Grill based on other Yelp recommendations, and we were not disappointed. The Agave Margueritas were spectacular and the service was great. We went at about 5pm since the recommendations indicated that getting a reservation could be dicey, and I think that's a great idea. Skip lunch and come hungry! The flank steak with plantains was really tasty - if you like plantains, these were the best I have ever eaten. My husband tried the sweet coffee and I had a hot chocolate for dessert.  We even got a brief glimpse of Rick, but he seemed to be headed on a mission.
