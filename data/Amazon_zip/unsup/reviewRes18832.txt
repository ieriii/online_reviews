We started out with Frontera Grill but were told there was a 2 hour wait, the hostess, recommended XOCO, since it was more casual... WAIT, was I under dressed, I thought not since it was my birthday and was dressed in a nice casual way, no sweats or sneakers. I TRIED not to take offense and since we already parked ($10) decided to go. When you first walk in, it is more of a 'fast-er food' type of atmosphere and you either place your to-go order or get in line to place your sit down order. Once you get to the counter, you give your order, which you cannot place until they have found you a place to sit, we opted to 'share' a table with others and was okay with it since we were hungry and didnt really want to wait.  You go down the 'line' and get your water or other 'drink' and are then led to your seating spot. This was okay and the ladies we sat next to, didnt seem to mind which was cool. It was a bit tight though. After all this, it was a bit inconvenient, the food arrived and was well worth the wait and process to get it. We ordered the Guac and chips, the guac wasnt too shabby but a small portion, comes with two sauces. Also, the Chicken Tinga, which wasnt bad, the Milenesa, which is chicken and the best of all that was ordered, the Al-Pastor Torta, which was also good and the Carnitas Caldo, again, very good. We ordered desserts which were O.K. (Fruit tart, Ice cream Pasilla and Churros) Not bad for a faster food joint if you asked me but what I REALLY love is that it supports organic and sustainable business, especially the meat. You are doing a fine job Rick! We will be back to try the other joints.......
