I was really excited to to try this Avant Garde-style restaurant/lounge during my trip to Chicago. I had heard that the decor and atmosphere was 1920s speakeasy-chic and that the food and drink menu were adventurous and delish. The bar was dark and tavern-ish and reminded me of a place I'd need a code-word to get into during Prohibition. Me likey. Reminded me of my favorite place in Austin: The East Side Showroom (review to come). I'm happy to say that the recommendations did not disappoint! I bellied-up to the bar alone, as I was here for a business trip, and found myself 1 of six women without an escort at the bar. 1st impression: lady-friendly. Nice! :) I immediately felt comfortable and ordered a Blood & Sand (not on the drink menu, but definitely well-made) and chatted up the Scottish mixologist, as well as two of the other girls I sat with from out of town. I had eaten a small snack not too long before arriving at Gilt, so I asked the bartender his rec's for a small bite and dessert. With that, I ordered their famous Fire-grilled bone marrow on toast. OMG. WHOA. AWESOME. I had never had a dish like this before in a restaurant (I had had marrow in homecooking before) and it blew my mind. Don't expect a lot out of the dish as far as mass, expect a lot out of the flavor. Incredible. It came with pickled onions and parsley which made the the finger-food finger-licking good. One more Blood & Sand. Then the Mint & Chip ice cream. Yum. Would I go back? Yes. Would I eat a full meal there next time. YES YES. Will I check out the rooftop when the weather gets nicer. YOU BETCHA.
