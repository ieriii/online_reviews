I was so excited to go to Crisp - I had heard about it from my friend who gave it rave reviews. As I continued to ask other friends, they had all heard good things. It's all true! Get the wings, burrito and Buddha bowl! i stuffed myself because the food was so good!!! And the service was great, too. Def would go again and try something different. Overall, fabulous experience !
