So, I came here for lunch last week. I read a lot of reviews since I first went during their opening week and they seemed really positive. Well.. the food was good, I had the J Burger (? a burger topped with thick slabs of bacon.) And, don't get me wrong, the burger was delicious, but it was nearly impossible to eat as a person would eat a burger i.e. grasp with hands, shove into face. The ratios of ingredients made the burger fall apart, the meat patty itself was perfectly shaped... suspiciously like the shape you would expect from a frozen patty. Usually when i've had tall grass burgers they've seemed hand formed. The bun was, really good but crumbly, strange. Anyway, the best part of the meal was my overpriced "pomegranate soda" which is better described as apple-pomegranate, and the wheatberry salad, which I have been dreaming about since I left. I'll come back again, eventually, but until then, you'll find me at the Ramova Grill down the street.
