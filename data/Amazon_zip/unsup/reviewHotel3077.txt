My hubby and I came to the windy city last year for a long weekend - to celebrate our 10 year wedding anniversary. We had heard a lot of good stuff about the W Lakeshore, so thought we'd give it a go! Overall, we were very satisfied with our stay. The staff was friendly and welcoming. Our room was modern and clean. The bed was so comfy. We had an amazing waterfront view overlooking the Navy Pier, which was lovely! For all the amenities, this place is very reasonable. It's also conveniently located within walking distance of many of Chicago's main attractions. We didn't take advantage of going to any of the bars / lounges within the W as we had a lot of other plans for the weekend already, but we did eat breakfast twice at the Wave restaurant downstairs. The food and service were both excellent! The reason I'm giving this place only 4 stars and not 5 is that the bar seems to attract a rather noisy, trashy "Vegas-y" element at night, which I could have done without. We did take advantage of the spa services at the Bliss Spa located in the hotel, which was heavenly! Thank you W Lakeshore - I'll definitely be back!
