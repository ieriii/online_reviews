After a 5 hour flight from the bay area, I just wanted to order something from my hotel room. This was my first ever deep dish pizza! Really great! Too much crust though I thought- but hey I'm from Cali, maybe it's a west coast thing. I loved it. I regret not getting the energy to go the actual restaurant.
