I created a Yelp account just to write a review for this restaurant. I went for lunch on a Sunday afternoon. The ambiance is that of a more up-scale restaurant, so I was surprised to see such reasonable prices on the menu. The food was absolutely incredible. It is a crime that they are not charging higher prices. I tipped 70%, even as a college student with relatively little expendable income, that's how impressed I was with the food and service.
