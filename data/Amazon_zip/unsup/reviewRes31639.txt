Saturday morning after a trip to Aldi, my former roommate and I were trying to decide where to go to brunch. I needed girl time...to see where things went wrong. Enter Nana. It was a date. The interior is absolutely gorgeous, and the sunlight streaming through the window is lovely and makes it seem like a very happy place. The service was very friendly, but I was with a lady who had connections. :) So here's a breakdown of our meal: --2 cups of coffee -- Great coffee but I kept messing mine up because I kept playing around with organic fake sugar. During my entire brunch, I just couldn't find the right balance!! --Nanadict -- The infamous Nanadict. Was it worth it? Yes! I adored the chorizo...tho I usually hate chorizo. I have to admit, I only tried the nanadict bc it was "the" thing to try. Was it worth it? Yes! Served on 2 potato like pancakes instead of english muffins, it was quite the change and a pleasant spin off of a benedict. I'd like another, please. $10. Wow. Bargain central. My companion did say that the chorizo should be spicier...but I'm not a fan of spicy. --Um...my roommate got some type of potato/chipotle/bacon type thing. It was tasty but I was too busy digging into my meal to notice. --So she got a huge piece of pistachio rum cake and some meal to go. --Lots of wondering "Why why why did she leave me?"...oops, that's not food. Never mind. Total? $50ish including tip and the to go stuff. Will I be back? For sure! Only if I can get a ride though!
