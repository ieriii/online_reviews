My friends/fellow super eaters discovered Crisp earlier this summer and wanted us to experience it. We checked it together to celebrate my brother-in-law's b-day. Wings are out of this world. They are huge and not greasy. Got the Seoul Sassy and the Plain. Seoul Sassy has an original Asian flavor, not sweet and sour, but not teriyaki. Their website has a good description. Plain wings were amazing, too. They taste almost double fried, but not oily. The hot dipping sauce proved a great paring for the plain wings. Our friends also had us try the Buddha, a mixed bowl of rice, veggies and Korean flavoring. Crisp's version of Bi Bim Bop. Pretty tasty. I favored the Seoul Steak Bowl, with Korean BBQ Beef (Bulgogi). Similar to the way they cook wings, Crisp's bowls do well with their flavorings, portions, and special ingredients that help differentiate them from other Asian eateries.  The food gets 5 stars, but I'd give it 4 if I took into consideration the restaurant. It's not a terrible thing, but it's small and gets rather crowded. I've read there's often a line and no places to sit. I do know it adds to the restaurant's character, so I'll give it a 5 overall. Staff is super friendly and moves the line really fast. And prices are certainly reasonable for what you get.
