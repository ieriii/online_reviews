I'm clearly reiterating the comments of my fellow yelpers - but this is one of my Go-To spots in the area. There's always a good crowd (particularly on Thursdays after work), the staff is always friendly and accommodating, a wonderful respite to eat outdoors on Michigan Avenue -- and, across every visit, the food was fantastic - for the carnivore and the vegetarian (Spring pea agnolotti...) - WOW. Go to the Gage.
