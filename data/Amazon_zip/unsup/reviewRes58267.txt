Ehh, met some friends out here the other night. In terms of a fun place to visit I would recommend going at least once just for the throwback feel of the old speakeasy. It has the hidden door which makes a fun first experience as well as the nice velvet curtains, however once inside the hostess was a little rude considering that the weather was horrific and I was coming during the week when business was going to be slower anyway. All considering though the drinks were very well done and this place offers a nice change of pace from the typical bar scene. The upscale atmosphere is fun and the low key entrance makes you feel like you are in on a little secret but otherwise was just not all that impressed. Fun but have other drink options to try before returning.
