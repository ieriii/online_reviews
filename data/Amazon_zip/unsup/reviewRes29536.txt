I love this place. Its so nice to pop in here on a cold winter day. Very cozy. Never had anything I didnt like. Their daily specials are great. Reasonable prices. Large portions. Fast. Delivery is good also but it tastes best fresh eaten in the restaurant. They have a full bar because they are connected to the bar "The Other Side". Highly recommend.
