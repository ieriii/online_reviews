Not sure what direction this restaurant is trying to go in terms of food, but its great! -Very good food for a "gastro pub"  -Seated promptly for a 730 reservation -Bone marrow was cooked perfectly -Tasty Kennebec fries -Good pastas (Mushroom and truffle, Bolognese) -Rapini and sausage side extremely salty Gets very busy so make a reservation and try to check out the speakeasy in the basement!
