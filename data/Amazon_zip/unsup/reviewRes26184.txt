Nice, definitely romantic restaurant. Though quite overpriced in my opinion, but then again, I like to go out to eat and be served, not have to cook my own dinner! ;) Be prepared to leave the restaurant smelling greasy, so don't wear anything that you can't machine wash. And yes, oil stains do come out, but usually you must dry clean for that! I think this place is best for its chocolate fondue dessert, and most wonderful of all, no cleanup necessary (unlike fondue-ing at home). Save your $ for a nice steakhouse and then come here for dessert, the chocolate fondue is for sure worth the trip out alone! Beware if you are claustrophobic, this restaurant is tiny & cramped, it can be relieving to leave once fully crowded.
