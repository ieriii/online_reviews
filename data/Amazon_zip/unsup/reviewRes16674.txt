Monday night, 7pm, not a seat in the house. Left our cell phone number, went up the street, and got a call back within ten minutes. Awesome. First time sitting anywhere but the bar - I prefer the bar. Waitress was friendly and gave some recommendations, but then disappeared for a half hour. We left without being served. Perhaps they were short-staffed, but I'll never sit anywhere but at the bar again.
