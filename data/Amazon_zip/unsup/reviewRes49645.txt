why does it seem like places in chicago like to put numbers after their name...bin 36...hotel 71.....i don't get it.... food was okay. funny little touch, giving a little descriptor card with each glass of wine...okay, i get it...a woodsy, aromatic wine, with undertones of dingleberries and parsley...oooh, so chic.... i'm not even gonna get started with those loudass sales rep people at the table next to us....here's a hint....maybe you don't need to have a conversation with a person sitting 3 people over to your left at the table...maybe wait until you're closer to them...jeeezus! food was passable. fries okay. spinach salad was probably the best thing of the evening. that braised lamb with crispy edges (or whatever)....reminded me of those good old days, when my mom made me eat spam. it was even shaped like a slice of spam. lamb spam! sweet! dessert...best thing was the three miniscule scoops of housemade ice cream (errrr, i can eat a pint of haagen daz in my sleep, thank you...)...okay, just the malted vanilla one, the other ice cream was just so-so. carrot cake and that custard over poopy (yes, that's right, poopy!) seed cake were just average at best. okay, it was nice of them to comp us some cheese, since the food was taking so freaking long.... okay, i'm grumpy, what...what????
