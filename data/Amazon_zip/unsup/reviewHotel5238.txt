DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME with this hotel. It may be an affordable price and a decent location, but what they gain in location/price, they lose in service and cleanliness. The specific area of concern is with the on-site restaurant on the first floor of the establishment. My family and I (two kids) were ignored for 20 minutes due to the server being exasperated (and we were the ONLY ONES in the restaurant). We were never given so much as a menu, a glass of water, or a smile throughout the entire ordeal. We are still, to this day, wondering why we deserved this cold treatment.My recommendation is to look up the street toward the Michigan/Wacker Drive area along the Chicago River for great restaurants and hotels. We've stayed and eaten many times at various establishments in this location (Club Quarter, Hyatt Regency, Emerald Loop, etc.) and have been VERY pleased. And for only $20-$40 more per night, it's definitely worth the cost to have excellent, efficient, and friendly service, not to mention a stellar view of the Magnificent Mile and Chicago River. Much better than seeing that dump-of-a-train-station on Roosevelt Road. THAT PLACE IS CREEPY! Avoid the Grant Park Best Western at all costs.
