Parking was not a problem at this nook of a place. I came here with my family recently after an eventful morning and afternoon spent at an engagement party. We were all fairly hungry and my cousins decided if we were in Chicago, we HAD to have the stuffed pizza the city is famous for. Firstly, the service was terrible. We asked to be seated in a shaded area and all she could offer was the corner booth. We started closing the blinds ourselves and than the hostess finally started helping. This still did no justice as the blinds did not close tightly and there was painstaking sun hitting my eye. We asked again to be seated elsewhere, and since the other booths were too small, we opted to sit at one of the tables in the middle. Now you have to be really patient at this place. The waters came without any straws; waiting for the pizza takes close to an hour and our drinks were never refilled. We had 3 more people joining our group, and it seemed as though they were very confused on how to accommodate us. They brought in a table from one of the booths. We ordered for the additional members right away. The waitress did not bring an napkins, silverware, or ask them for drinks. I don't know if the waitress was scared of us, but she was pretty much invisible the whole time and the place was NOT busy. The pizza finally came, I opted to get a spinach ravioli instead which was decent. The pizza did look appetizing and everyone did say they thoroughly enjoyed it. Overall, I give this place 2 stars because it was hyped up and it did not meet my expectations. Additionally, the service was miserable and the manager did nothing about it. For an italian place, the waitress did not bring us bread, olive oil, or anything of the sort while we waited. What a sham.
