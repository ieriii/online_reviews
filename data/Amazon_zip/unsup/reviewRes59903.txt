I have ordered my niece's birthday cake from here every year (going on 3 years now - she'll be 4) and they've been fabulous! For her 2nd birthday, the theme was a luau and they created standing palm trees, etc. It wowed everyone! Last year was the ballerina cake and this year...dinosaurs. (Can't wait to see what they'll do!) The cakes are as delicious as they are creative.
