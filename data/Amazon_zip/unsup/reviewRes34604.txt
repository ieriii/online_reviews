We had a fabulous breakfast at Yolk. The Eggs Benedict was fabulous, the potatoes that came with it were seasoned perfectly and the fresh fruit filled out the plate. The Crepes Suzette were also perfectly done--the sauce was the right combination of Grand Marnier and buttery flavor. Absolute heaven! We were fortunate to walk in and be seated right away, but as we were finishing, there was a substantial line waiting for tables. We had fairly good service, we did have to wait a while for someone to come take our order and get us some coffee, which is what killed an otherwise 5 star review. It is a bit loud, so if you are looking for a quiet, leisurely breakfast, this is not the place. However, it is not so loud as to be obnoxious. Overall, a good place, and one that we would frequent again if the opportunity presents itself.
