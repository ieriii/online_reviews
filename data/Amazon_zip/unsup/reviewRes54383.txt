This place has the best pizza in Chicago, well thats just my opinion. I love the deep dish pizza's and how the burnt cheese crust tastes. For two people you need nothing bigger than the 10 in.. deep dish which always fills me and a friend up. The place has a nice atomspher and is always clean. This is where i go before heading to the movies right across the street. The pricesd are resonable good, eats , good times... check it out..
