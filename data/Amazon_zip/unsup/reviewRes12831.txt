There's not much to say that is wrong with this place. Service was friendly and fast. Food was excellent. The one complaint might be that they are a *tad* overpriced but we went for the Restaurant Week deal so that made it much more reasonable. Having not read any of the previous reviews, sorry if I'm repeating. You need to have a plan of attack for the massive amounts of food you will consume when you come here. The salad bar is soooo good, but don't waste too much time there. After all, it is a steak house. I tried a little bit of stuff from the salad bar and resisted the urge to go back.  The meat is great - the only thing that I didn't enjoy was the beef ribs because they were too fatty. Just keep eating - don't slow down or you'll never be able to keep going! And make sure to have plenty of water on hand for the next day because they "encase" all of their meat in rock salt. Which makes for an extremely tasty dining experience but you will feel it afterwards. Random side note, this place is huge. It's 3 floors and the valet guy said they pay about $100,000 per month in rent. The valet guy was also possibly coked out, so I'm not sure how accurate any of his statements were. But there are some cool rooms upstairs if you are ever looking to plan an event for a large group of people.
