The food is primo (it's really hard to decide what to get) and the atmosphere is even better. It's like a cross between a dark old library and a pub but it's very clean, upscale and modern (I couldn't help admiring the bathrooms and just the overall setup of the place). Tons of yuppies everywhere. I had the chopped salad (chopped salads=bit of an ongoing obsession for me) which was a solid choice. The artichoke dip appetizer was tasty but the dip ran out way before the toast/bruschetta My beefs with this place are that it's a little expensive (not too bad though), the wine list is kind of janky and also expensive. The tables are super close together which creates a hazard when everyone is having to swing around massive winter coats. Also, the service was friendly but a little harried (I had to actively seek out every drink refill), which I guess it forgiveable since it was a Saturday night. Despite all this, I can only dock it by one star since it was such a good time I'll be back!
