After a week in Chicago I finally got to go to Frontera and boy was it worth the wait! We went on a Friday and were lucky enough to get seated after only a 10 minute wait. I am from San Diego and have access to copious amounts of Mexican food but it is usually not of this caliber. Rick Bayless has done well with this restaurant and he deserves his reputation. Also, I want to give a big shout out to David our waiter, he was spectacular and very helpful to me with the decision making process. We started off with the Enchiladas Potosinas and they were exploding with flavor. The masa was "chile spiked" and very tasty. After that we got down to business with my salad, the Shooting Star Little Gem Lettuce Salad, which came with wonderfully seasoned vegetables. I was actually surprised that this was so good. My main entree was the Smoky-Creamy-Spicy Mushrooms. So good. Beautifully smoky. The flavors of all of the dishes were magnificent and complex. Someone complained in another review that Mexican food is supposed to be simple and that is totally untrue. Bayless has captured the complexities of Mexican food to glorious fruition. If you think Mexican food can and should be fine dining please come here. It is by far some of the best food (Mexican or not) you will ever have.
