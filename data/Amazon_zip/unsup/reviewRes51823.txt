Legendary Ginos!!! Food was good. The Saturday I went, Gino's was offering free breadstick vouchers if you showed the hostess that you 'Liked' their Facebook page. Gino's is a major hub for tourist and likely to be crowded anytime during the day/night.The wait to be seated was 25-30mins. In addition, if your ordering deep dish- it takes 45 mins to be prepared.
