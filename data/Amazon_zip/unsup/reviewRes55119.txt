In a word: CARELESS. When done correctly the steaks are marvelous. I've been there twice in recent months. This time my medium rare came to the table well done. Last time one of my associate's med-rare came well done. Since I won't eat overcooked meat, I took most of my $38 steak with me because our table of nine was on desert when I was served. Arrived at 7:30 left at 11:00... you figure out how much we talked and twiddled while the steaks burned..
