I have no idea how, but we walked in on a Friday night and got a table for 4 right away, no wait. I think the key is to go when its snowing. :) We skipped appetizers and went straight for drinks/dinner. Way to go Frontera for having reasonably priced (dare I say "cheap"?) beers! Also had a sip of our friend's margarita which was delicious. The waiter said he "shortchanged" us on one of the margaritas and came back with some more - the glass was just about overflowing. No skimping there. i asked the waiter what to get. He said to skip the tacos, just because they're available all the time and most everything else rotates. So I went with the crispy chicken/sweet potato mash as per his recommendation. I have a special place in my heart for sweet potatoes and these were nothing short of awesome. They weren't heavily sweetened so you could actually taste the flavor of the potato. The chicken was good - huge portion, about 3 flattened out pieces of chicken, on top of a mixture of spicy goodness and some awesome sauce to go on top (tomatillo maybe?) We also ordered a side of the pickled jalapenos and veggies. Just enough kick, but not so much that you started crying. My husband did start sweating though. we went elsewhere for dessert, but they had some great looking coffees and hot chocolate on the menu which I'd like to try sometime. All in all, a great experience and if you're looking to spend a few bucks on a night out (our tab for 2 - beers + entrees - about $60 before tip)
