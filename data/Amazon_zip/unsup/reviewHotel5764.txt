Heart O Chicago is a funky, retro motel with clean and spacious rooms. No frills - scratchy, thin towels, bring our own shampoo and hair dryer, etc. The bed was comfy and the TV worked, but the heat did not. When we called the office to get assistance they told us they had turned it off for the season 10 days ago. The highs for the week we were there (last week) were in the 50's and low 60's so we weren't too thrilled that they couldn't be bothered re-starting it.  The location is great for some things, not so great for others. Andersonville is a short walk. Wrigley Field and the Lakeview area are a short and convenient bus (#22) ride. The Loop/downtown area is a 45+ minute bus/El ride, if your connections are good.
