Three Words: Strawberry Orange Juice!!!!! I've been to Yolk a few times, but I'm finally getting around to writing a review. I love the fact that you can can get healthy options to your breakfast. A side of fruit, egg whites and etc. Its a way to have a big breakfast, but feel less guilty about it. Lol! The best times to go are during the week! Weekends will be crowded. Decent prices, for lots of food and in a great location! Yolk is alright with me! Oh, try their cinnamon buns! They're delicious!
