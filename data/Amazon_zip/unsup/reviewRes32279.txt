Finally crawled out of bed to make it to their brunch on Sunday. I was surprised at the lack of a crowd (maybe because we got there at 2 pm), but it might be because Asian fusion isn't exactly what people crave on a Sunday morning. Either way, the food was amazing as always. As a semi-pro Bloody Mary aficionado, the best bloody mary used to belong to Joe's on Weed (pepperoni, jack pepper cheese and basically a side salad of veggies in your cup) and a touch of Guinness at the bottom really made the difference. The torch has been passed to Sunda though. Not even factoring in the literal buffet of exotic ingredients (red chili peppers, lemon grass, jicama, unagi, shrimp, seaweed, tofu, among the other dozen other ingredients I had to refer to the chart to figure out), the drink itself was unlike any bloody I've ever had. It was refreshing, flavorful and had such a unique flavor. The waitress insisted it was because of their house made mix, but I think substituting the vodka for Sochu (a Japanese liquor) was the real difference maker. Either way its a must try. My partner in crime on our sunday funday had the passion fruit Mimosa and we both agreed that they were hands down two of the top "breakfast" drinks we've ever had in our lives. Needless to say they are a must try.
