The good: The hotel was exceptionally clean and nicely appointed, linens were very soft and comfortable, the mattresses were excellent quality too. The room was very large and spacious for the price. There were bathrobes and quality bath products as well as fresh, thick white cotton towels. It was easy to get internet. The housekeeping staff was very nice and did a great job. The doorman and bellhops were very courteous and helpful. The bad: The room service was very slow (est 1 hour for bkfst) although they did accommodate us and speed it up when I switched to uncooked menu items and said we had to get the food within 30 minutes. My main complaint is the hotel's featured restaurant on the first floor - Aria. The service was terrible, although the many waiters were sweet and good-natured they rarely came to our table and took forever to remove finished dishes. The food was mediocre, more confusion than fusion, and very expensive. We had 2 appetizers and split a main dish, 2 glasses of wine and one dessert. the bill was about $100 without the tip. For this price I expect superb food and service.
