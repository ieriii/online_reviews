Not a lot to say that hasn't already been said. But here goes: Pluses - amazing food, very affordable, good for take-out or delivery too, and not overrun with DePaul kids despite being in the same neighborhood. I highly recommend the penne puttanesca with BV marinara if you are trying to be healthy, and the farfalle pollo if you are wearing your elastic waist pants. And the mac & cheese = legit. Minuses - sometimes crowded (you will often wait for a cramped seat), not a good candle-lit romantic Italian place if that is what you are looking for. Overall - go here, you will enjoy it. Do expect cheap, good food, don't expect to find peace and quiet or parking.
