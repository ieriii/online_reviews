We went to Italy for 2 weeks this past July, so hope to have a little different view on this place. No way in heck are my frat buddys in Chicago going to like this place since they eat Lou Malnati/Giordano type pizza.  This is as authentic as it comes. The wood fired pizzas are light, perfect tasting, and fresh. If I closed my eyes, I might have been sitting in Tuscany again. The salad and appetizers were very good. Reasonable pricing and truly authentic. I'm glad we went during the week since there was no wait. Also, its more of a "family friendly" spot, so I would not want to be there on a Saturday Night. I would call it a step higher than most pizza places in terms of ambience. Please go if you know what "real" pizza is. I'm born/raised in Chicago and 5 years ago I would not have understood this pizza. After Italy, I realize you are not supposed to feel like you ate a 15 lbs. pizza for dinner. Enjoy!
