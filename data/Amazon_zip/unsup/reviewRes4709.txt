I've been waiting forever to try this place out. Every time I want to, there's at least an hour wait, so I took the liberty of going at 10:30 PM on a Wednesday night, and sure enough, there was no wait. If you're as impatient as I am and hate waiting to get seated, I'd suggest trying to eat here at obscure hours of the day. The food was absolutely amazing, as well as the cheese and wine. Their motto afterall is cheese, swine and wine :) I asked a foodie friend of mine for some food recs beforehand, and he told me to get the bone marrow spread. Unfortunately, they were no longer serving it because the bone marrow of the pigs from the farm that they usually buy from wasn't fresh enough and so they were waiting to find some quality bone marrow before putting it back on the menu. If the chef cut out one of the most popular dishes because the bone marrow quality "wasn't cutting it", I think that has a lot to say about the quality food of this restaurant. My boyfriend and I ordered the pig's ear and a cheese/meat selection to start off the night. I don't know what kind of cheese/meat we got (we just asked the waiter for a recommendation) but it was fantastic! The bread and jam were also a great combo too. The pig's ear was alright - it was a little bit too oily for me, but still rather good. Later on, we ordered the pork shoulder and charred cauliflower. The pork shoulder was AMAZING! It literally just melts in your mouth!!!!!!! I would definitely definitely recommend that as a must-eat dish. The ambiance is really romantic and the outdoor seating is so nice. Definitely try the wine - the one that our waiter recommended for us was very smooth and complimented all of our dishes perfectly. After eating here, you could really tell how much care and effort was put into all the dishes, wine selections, and decor. There is absolutely no wonder that it's one of the most famous and top ranked restaurants in the country.
