Since they renovated I think I can now give this Four Seasons 5 stars.  The rooms are beautiful. Their recent, much needed renovation level set the product with the service. The lobby is modern and elegant with a gorgeous greenhouse bar and the Deca restaurant. The rooms aren't all as spacious as you'd expect for the price, but they quality is there and the bathrooms are beautiful.  Service is always exceptional. I've been staying at this hotel since I was a kid (shopping trips with mom) and the standard of service has never fallen. There are still some waiters in the restaurant (now Deca, was the Cafe) that were there when I was a kid. They are very good at making people feel welcome and at home. Every whim is catered to. As long as its legal ;) A great hotel with outstanding service and quality rooms.
