5 stars for the service (Ayana was our waitress) and ambiance, 3 stars for the food It's hard to talk smack about such a beautiful space but unfortunately... I was somewhat underwhelmed with the BBQ. The starter chips and pickles were excellent. We could have made a meal off of them alone. The mac 'n' cheese was okay, certainly not the highlight of the menu like others lead you to believe. I had the BBQ appetizer sampler which included individual ramekins of the kobe beef brisket, pulled pork and pulled chicken, along with cornbread.  I was not too crazy about having to share all the BBQ sauce with the whole table because that meant I had to reach across with my fork/spoon each time I wanted more but that's just my preference. I thought the sauce made up for the dryness of some of the meat so I would have like my own dish, that's all.  Out of all the BBQ that came with my dish, I thought the kobe beef brisket was the best. However, it was much different than the regular brisket dinner plate and dinner sandwich. Strangely, those were both much more dry and flavorless.  Despite the food aspect, we really enjoyed Q. All the servers were attentive and accomodating. We even got a tour of the kitchen and upstairs. Wow, was it very nicely done inside. They can definitely sell you on the atmosphere.
