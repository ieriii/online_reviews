OK - I admit. I have some quirks (in my defense: who doesn't??) I prefer my crepe to be sweet instead of savory (though I'll eat both kind), so I have only been coming here for brunch - on a lazy Saturday or Sunday morning - since I live just a couple blocks away. I always get the banana-choc one - and I LOVE it! Coupled with their coffee -- um um guuuuud ..... Oh yeah - this place also has very good coffee! I like the ambiance and the cute little tin cup they use to serve their cream in. If that matters.
