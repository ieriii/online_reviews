This place never ceases to amaze me, the food is unbelievable, the meat quality is superb, sides are top notch and service is 5/5. I did go with a friend for dinner on Friday and had the best time, the atmosphere is vibrant and while not exactly easy on the wallet it is worth every penny. I will try it for lunch at some point when I am back in one of their cities.
