I was incredibly skeptical when I went here for the first time last month. It's a very nondescript building and you have to wait in line to get in. I'm not particularly used to that and I'm not a huge fan. I have to say that the line was also pretty contrived as there was a fair amount of seating inside and more than a few spots at the bar itself. Also, they have a fairly ridiculous dress code: no sandals was the weirdest thing. Flip flops are one thing, nice sandals are another.  All that said, they make a good cocktail and they all have pretty original twists on classic favorites. Even though $12 a drink is fairly steep, the quality is worth it. The atmosphere is pretty good on the inside and they have done a great job of taking what is basically a warehouse and turning it into a fairly intimate setting. The highbacked seats, the curtains, and the dark lighting make it easy to feel like you can actually have a conversation without either having to scream at one another or feeling as though everyone is listening.  I'd go back and I'd recommend it to friends; just don't expect to get a beer since there's none on the menu.
