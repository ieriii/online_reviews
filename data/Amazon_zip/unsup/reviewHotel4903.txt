This is the second time I have stayed at Dana. Both times, everyone was friendly and outgoing. Answered any questions we had. From the moment we stepped out of the cab, till check out it's a nice place! The Shower in the room is the BEST. I am a fan of the floor to ceiling windows. Sheets and bed are sweet! Friendly service. We spent over 90 minutes at the breakfast table and not once did they try and rush us out. Room is large. TV is great. Free Internet, awesome. Huge fan, I will look to stay here every time I'm in Chicago.
