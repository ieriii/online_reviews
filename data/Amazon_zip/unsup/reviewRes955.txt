Had port elk sausage. It was outstanding! I will definitely go back and try some of their other exotic concoctions. I think there are Chicago style franks like red hots, Vienna Beef and Superdawgs. And then there's places like Hot Dougs and Franks N' Dawgs which take dining on a bun to a whole new level. I can see why this place has a great reputation.
