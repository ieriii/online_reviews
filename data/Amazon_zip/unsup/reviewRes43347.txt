sorry haters, but milk and honey wins for offering home made, natural, and locally produced products. I know I can't afford to eat here often, and god knows I'm not patient enough to handle the weekend crowds, but I say that the granola is fantastic and the portobello sammich is the best I've ever had. I think my favorite thing about the place is that you pay at the counter before you get the food...take a number and sit until it gets set in front of you....no waiting for the bill, calculating tip, etc...its over when you're done eating. And for christs sake, if you hate hipsters and faux hawks, move out of wicker park....certainly don't eat brunch there! p.s. take out *is* fast.
