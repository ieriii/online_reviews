This is a review of the cafe where I had lunch today. The grilled cheese, tomato soup, and black bean burger were all delicious. The Asian salad however, with chicken, sobu noodles, and vegetables was loaded with a thick peanut dressing. It was so saturated that the good quality chicken,noodles, pea pods, and cucumbers barely maintained their presence in the salad. Lesson learned: ask for the dressing on the side. Service is slow even though we beat the crowd with an early lunch. The place is understaffed. Fun to roam through the market and sample dessert offerings after a meal here.
