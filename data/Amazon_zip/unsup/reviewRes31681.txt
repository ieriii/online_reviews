Service was fast and friendly. The Food was good. The price was actually less than I expected, considering other reviews here that complained about the cost. The Food is completely organic, which means higher cost for the ingredients. Our bill was thirty bucks. We had two entrees, two coffees, one dessert. You will pay almost as much at a grease spoon for lower quality food. Be realistic! The dessert was really good (pistachio rum cake). We went at 2p.m. and got a table right away. I do wish they had a daily special. Hopefully that will come in the future. I'll be back there for sure.
