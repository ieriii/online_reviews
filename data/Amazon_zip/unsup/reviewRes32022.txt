So let's just say this was my first venture into Ethiopian food and it started off as quite a strange experience. I was hosting a book club and wanted to get everyone excited about the festivities by supplying authentic Ethiopian food (the book was about Ethiopia and talked about the food A TON). I ordered the 2 things on the menu that were most highlighted in the book: Injera & Wot along with a minced meat appetizer to try. 15 minutes they said for take-out! Me, not having a car in Chicago, thought I could take a nice leisurely bike ride up north. This place is FAR! But I guess that's the only option for Ethiopan food in Chicago. When I finally got there, I obviously looked like I had been run over- Helmet Hair, confused look. When I shyly mentioned this was my first time, the ladies behind the bar did not hesitate to run back to the kictchen and bring me out a sample to show me "how it's done". They threw in an extra few spices and a salad for my friends to try too. A soda and a chat at the bar definitely won these guys an extra star. Not to mention the food was AMAZING!! I would give this place 5 stars but Ive never had other Ethiopian food to compare. Ill update when I am more well-versed.
