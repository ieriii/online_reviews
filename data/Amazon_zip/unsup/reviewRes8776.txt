SO yum! What a great place, the food is amazing and SO plentiful- and seriously what a deal, spend $30 and get a bottle of wine?!! BONUS- had the steak and shrimp, with dill rice. Incredibly tasty. Mega food, super good food, good atmosphere, what an eclectic group of patrons. Super nice waitress. Definitely going back!
