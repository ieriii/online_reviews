#1 reason i love this place - i grew up right next to wear their pigs come from! small farmers feed the world, believe me. and if you don't, you can ask my dad for details... loved everything about publican. from how wine is served (a "glass" is really 3 servings YES PLEASE) to the adorable linens & plates to our very friendly server to the PORK to the incredible potatoes gratin. a fabulous meal, one i hope to enjoy again soon!!!
