As with other Ethiopian restaurants, it's a communal dining experience and best with groups. We had 6 people, which was great. I'm not a big fan of the honey wine, but the African beers go great with he food. The sampler plates are a great way to taste many dishes and you're guaranteed to leave very full. I loved the flavor of the food but wished there was a spicier hot sauce. The ones they have are good but not terribly spicy.
