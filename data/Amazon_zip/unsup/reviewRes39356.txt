Mmmmm, meaty. It was a bonanza of meat, the service sucked but the company was good. Yes everything you've heard was true. The beef was tender though not as flavorful as I was expecting. The octopus was too hot for me, and the bacon was gross and fatty, but the chicken was excellent and perfectly seasoned and the pork was divine. I didn't know what half the sides were, and you get no explanation, but the fried tofu, little omelets, and potatoes were all good, and I enjoyed the soft shell crab appetizer. From the other reviews I was expecting this place to be cheap - like $15-$20 a person, not the $30 each we ended up with. And for that, I can't say I'd rush back, though it was fun, tasty, and something new.
