A group of us went to Bin 36 for breakfast a recent Sunday morning. I got my usual breakfast of breakfast potatoes and bacon. Neither is something that is really that hard.  I liked the potatoes. They were cooked nicely with a bit of peppers and onions. I really don't like it when potatoes are too underdone and these definitely weren't.  The bacon was... bacon. I have definitely had better other places but I've had worse other places. It was cooked to the level of doneness I prefer. I do not like overly crispy bacon. What really dinged the place down for me were two things. One I felt like it wasn't that great a value for my money. There were 5 of us for breakfast and none of us had alcohol and yet our bill came to over $100?  They automatically added on the gratuity. There were 5 of us... that's not an excessive number of people to me. That's basically a family, yet we got hit with an automatic 18%. And finally they got a big ding because they charged us for refills on soda. We were not alerted to the fact that they charged per soda and for one of the members of our party she didn't even ask for a 2nd one, they just brought it to her. That was a little problematic. Update: I gave them 1 star back because the owner emailed me and said I was right and we should have been warned that the refills would be extra and that we should not have had the gratuity added on automatically. Since I only posted this last night, that tells me he cares a lot about his restaurant and making things right by the patrons and that kind of service I can get behind.
