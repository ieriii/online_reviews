I stopped in here on a Sunday night randomly to pick up a dinner. There were a few people here and I was greeted immediately by the owner at the door. Here's the list: The Good: The crepe! I ordered the Icosium Crepe with spinach, arugala, feta, pine nuts, sun-dried tomatoes and some other goodies. I ordered it to go and when I went home (*after* a quick stop at Jewel) I popped it in the microwave for 30 seconds to warm it up, and it was warm and tasty. The owner is a nice middle-eastern guy who really, really wants you to like his restaurant. The Bad: I'm a vegetarian and I didn't add any meat to the dish and there wasn't any, but they charged me for chicken. Ummmmm.... They don't accept CC yet, so I had to go across the street for cash from the ATM, I should have asked them for my $2.00 charge off my bill. The servers are new and learning. I shouldn't hold this against them but they are slloooooowwwww The vegetable soup. It was the most bland soup I've ever tasted in my life. Don't even know how to describe it. It's just really really pureed vegetables with some peas in it. It's very expensive for what it is. Also the decor is loud without really making any sense. Except for the laterns- they were really pretty. Overall I'm going to give this place another chance for breakfast. I love crepes and I'm glad to have one in the neighborhood.
