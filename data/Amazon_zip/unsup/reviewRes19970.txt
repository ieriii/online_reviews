Whenever I want to have a special night with friends or that special someone, I always come here. So grateful to the girl who suggested it to me 3 years ago. This place is THE spot to dine on a wonderful assortment of beautiful sushi creations and enjoy a sexy atmosphere. Great variety for vegetarians (the exotic tempura should be called erotic tempura), perfect music selections to set the tone and you can have it your way with this BYOB treasure. Sexy, trendy yet casual, it's a hot spot for starting your night out & even better for finishing the evening.
