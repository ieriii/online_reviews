My boyfriend is a pizza snob. But not just any pizza snob -- he's one of the people that thinks only deep dish or pan is the way to go. (I'm not like this.) So when we moved in together at the end of February and didn't feel like cooking, I suggested we order from Art of Pizza. I had to cajole (love that word) and convince him that while we weren't getting deep dish, it was still a damn good pizza. We ultimately compromised and got a pan pizza. Fast forward five months later... whenever I suggest pizza and it's his turn to pick a (ridiculously heavy) pizza, he usually chooses this place. The sauce isn't too sweet, the crust is always just crispy enough, there's always a mountain of ingredients and plenty of cheese to hold it all together. And it usually gets to our place well within the one hour time frame. Can't beat that.
