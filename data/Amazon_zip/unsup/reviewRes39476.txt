Fellow Reviewers: Were you guys trying to punk me by writing that SSGS is BYOB?? Seriously...I can't say much that hasn't already been said, except I like having my food cooked and it's NOT BYOB....I think. I dutifully (according to you guys) brought in my own $11.49 bottle of Sauvignon Blanc and was told to leave it in the car. Really?(insert flippin them the bird here) I just stashed it in my purse and gazed in amazement as the korean pros dealt their mystery plates onto our limited table space. So....who punked us?? Yelp folks or the suck butt servers? Aside from that, we ordered and charred the squid and octopus. Master the cooking times to avoid rubber meat and salmonella.
