I went here for the first time tonight and I was totally blown away. Having spent many months in Costa Rica, I knew authentic food - and this place hit it on the nail... AND it tasted even better than Costa Rica! :-) The must-try dish is the "Casado" - this is the true Costa Rican cuisine. Basiically it is a dish with rice, beans, egg, salad, platanos (sweet bananas), and your choice of meat. I had the chicken breast which was SO tender and juicy that it literally comes apart with just a fork! Plus the sauce is quite great too! And for the icing on the cake.... the "Casado" entre ONLY costs $11ish dollars! This is prolly one of the best deals unknown in the area. I will be coming back here for the great food, super friendly service, and keep a few bucks in my pocket.
