They had me at bacon fat popcorn + beer brewed on site. I think it's an amazing execution of an old, tried and true concept. Logan Square really needed something like this place. The beer is great. There's something so cool about drinking beer 25 feet away from where it was brewed. Chicago is kind of a city for that, and this is another place where you can do so. The Anti-Hero IPA really stands out, but all of them are good. The food is good. Slightly less than the beer though. They have a nice selection of salads, pizzas, burgers, and as I mentioned, bacon fat popcorn. Sometimes, you just want to drink beer and not eat a meal. Just a snack. I can't think of a better snack. It's so gluttonous, and it's so lovely to wash down with some beer. I also had the chicken sandwich was pretty tasty...particularly because of the caramelized onion + apple jam. Very yum. I'm sure that over time the food menu will evolve, that said, it's pretty good for a place that basically popped up out of nowhere. The restaurant itself is so bustling. I actually couldn't believe how quickly crowds started forming on a regular basis. They've not even been open three years. I am by no means a regular here, but every time I've gone there's been a wait. I also think it's more of a restaurant than a bar, personally. What would bring me back? The beer for sure, but I'd also like to try the brunch. I feel like beer with steak 'n eggs, the cherry porter pancakes, or pancetta biscuits and gravy is worth a trek for on a Sunday morning at 11am. That's worth not going out the night before.
