Felt the pizza was a tad overdone. I understand that chicago style pizza is the deep dish but does that mean the crust is meant to be hard and crumbly? the inner portions were better as the crust was not as hard. definitely an experience and I would be willing to give them another chance. Waiter was suuper nice and helpful. Gave us great recommendations for the beer and checked up on us often. Decor is interesting- a place to make your mark :)
