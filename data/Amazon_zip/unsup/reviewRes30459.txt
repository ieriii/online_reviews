I was disappointed in the amount of vegetarian options available; Between what I heard was a delicious stew (Pozole de Frijol) from the other vegetarians at the table and the tacos with marinated portabello mushrooms and guacamole, I chose the tacos based on my taste that evening. I had to have rice instead of beans because the pinto beans were cooked with bacon and apparently the black beans were cooked with lard. My meal was decent, but a bit over priced. My table also enjoyed their meals and drinks. A few of us devoured the two ice cream options available and a chocolate cappuccino.  Overall, if it wasn't for my boyfriend's parents treating us out (the restaurant chosen by my boyfriend's brother), I probably wouldn't have gone (based on the cost and vegetarian options). But, I might try out XOCO. Rick Bayless is still great, but I hope he will offer more vegetarian dishes at his restaurants in the future!
