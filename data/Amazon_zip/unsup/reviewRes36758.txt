We had a wonderful brunch at Meli's, and we got in at the PERFECT time on Sunday around 9:30. There were some great specials, so I got the orange and cranberry french toast - so good! My husband got an omelet, and that was also delicious. The hostess was nice and I had been forewarned that we might have to deal with the "brunch nazi" but he was actually very pleasant and sat us promptly. Even though it was very busy, we didn't have to wait long and everything came out great. I highly recommend it!
