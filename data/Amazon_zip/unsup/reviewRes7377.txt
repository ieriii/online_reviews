Love this restaurant!! OK so it may not be the BEST italian food in the city, but I am telling you it well worth a visit. They have wonderful appetizers and good all around entrees. The atmosphere is soo cute and everyone who works there are great. We really love this place whether its with the whole fam, a double date, or a romantic meal. Its a fantastic place for any outing!!
