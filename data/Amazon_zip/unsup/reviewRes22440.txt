This place is amazing! Okay. Here is what you need to know. 1) Bring your own tequila and get the frozen lime pitcher of goodness. 2) Get a bunch of empanadas 3) Don't forget to bring cash. But if you do, they have an ATM. It has a great outdoor patio, delicious and inexpensive food, and a great atmosphere.  I would go here every day if it was closer to my house!
