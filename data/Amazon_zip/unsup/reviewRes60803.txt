one of my friends has been telling me about the burgers in this place for a while now so i finally had one and it was possibly the best burger ever, clearly by all the other reviews I'm sure you already know that but let me tell you something else that they have that is amazing. we ordered the barbwire and it was amazing, fries covered with cheese, chorizo, onions and other things. i could not believe how good they were. if you go here you must try it. it is a very big portion so splitting it between 3 or 4 maybe even 5 people is a good idea. the only down fall to this place in my opinion is that the beer is a little over priced for me but if you are just into good food and don't need to get drunk this is definitely a great place. specially on a Tuesday when the burgers are half price.
