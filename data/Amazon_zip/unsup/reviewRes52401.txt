I came here on a Groupon I picked up for a weekday. Now I came here knowing the deal. It's an all you can eat meat buffet. But they claim to have a world class salad bar, so I gave it a go. They have pretty much everything from potato salads to portobello mushrooms to some weird things I didn't identify until I ate it. Not bad, then came the starters. Some fried bananas, mashed potatoes and this cheese bread that was good enough that I needed to remind myself it was meant to be shared with the table.  The meats were pretty good, not great though. They had plenty of variety but nothing that would make me say I need to come back. Also, they seemed to run out of shrimps. It was definitely a struggle to flag down a server that had some left. That's not to mention the price. I don't think I'm cheap by any means, but with 2 drinks the bill plus tip ended up being over $100 for a dinner for 2. That's with a groupon.  The cheesey bread was defiantly the highlight of my experience here, just can't justify coming back here for a 'meh' experience when there are so many other choices around the city.
