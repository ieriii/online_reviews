This place was perfect. We had a party of six and were accommodated well. We started out on a Saturday afternoon with a party of five. We waited at the bar for about 30 minutes until we got a table. The good news is that there was room at the bar. Bad news, well there wasn't any. And when we learned another person would join us the wait staff was very gracious and accommodated us well. Ok, enough about the seating. Now, to the beer. Our group had a diverse taste so we tried some darker beers and some lighter beers. Sodomy was tasty as was the Cross of Gold. The bacon fat popcorn lived up the type. It was flavorful but not overpowering and the chunks of bacon really added some heft to the popcorn. The sweet potato pancakes were also tasty and the sauce had a zip to it. All in all, good trip. I'd go back at least once a month.
