5 of us went to Simply It on Thursday night about 7:30pm. The restaurant was basically empty. Price - 5 entries and 3 appetizers with tip about $20.00 per person. Ambiance - The restaurant is small so the tables are close together, but I would have a nice dinner date here, or meet a group of friends. The ambiance allows for both. Service- The waiters could not have been nicer or more attentive. Yes, there were only 4 tables total to cater too, but still the service was great. Food- Appetizers - shrimp tempura, A chicken puffed pastry, and spring rolls. shrimp tempura and spring rolls were fine, but the puffed pastry came with two great sauces, and it was a large portion and very tasty. Entrees - Spicy shrimp and the coconut mango beef. The coconut mango beef was pretty good, but the spicy shrimp was amazing.... I could not get enough....Finally, the restaurant is BYOB with NO CORKAGE FEE....!! I am always irritated at restaurants charging a corkage fee, so this makes me truly happy...!!
