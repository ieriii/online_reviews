Found this place on my new iPhone app (lame, but so useful), and decided to give it a try. Loved it! Good food; I had the lox and bagel and a mimosa. Then I ordered a piece of their homemade key lime pie and let me tell you, it was a little slice of heaven. Would definitely go back to try more things. Prices weren't that bad and surprisingly not very busy for a Saturday morning in the Gold Coast. Will definitely be back to try their stuffed french toast. The table next to us ordered it and it looked delicious!
