I feel like I cannot give this place a full review since we were there for a private work party and only had drinks and appetizers. I think the food is creative and generally tasty. The bar has limited options - no light beer and limited red wine options. The place itself is beautiful. Beautiful exposed bricks and art work you can buy off the walls. I definitely want to go back and try a meal since I imagine it is quite tasty. Portions were small on the appetizers...
