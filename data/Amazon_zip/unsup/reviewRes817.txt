I wish I was able to have a full experience here so I can tell you exactly how this place went down. I came here on a weekday so I wasn't able to try their duck fried french fries. However; I skipped the long line and was able to enjoy my specialty hot dog in less then 15 minutes. Can't quite remember what I got anymore, but I do remember that Doug was not shy from telling me how I should have my hot dog. When you order, you get to pick your toppings and the way your "dog" is prepared (grilled, charboiled, etc). When I went up to order, Doug disagrees with my choices and told me how it is REALLY done! There's no way Doug, the man himself, would let me down so I told him to bring out the way just how he would like it. Sure enough, it was pretty good. Kind of wish I was able to try the fries, but it was not bad for my first time here.
