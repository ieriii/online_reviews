Let me start by noting that I'm only reviewing my experiences at the oyster bar. I've never eaten a standard sit down meal at Shaw's. The above mentioned experiences have been great. Half price oysters daily from 4-6 for happy hour. Nice touch and great oysters for the price. The place will get very crowded, but I'm usually able to score a seat at the bar or a high table just off it. Service does suffer slightly due to the congestion, but well worth it for a great price on fresh oysters. Usually a crowded and loud atmosphere, but no better place for fresh oysters in the city!
