Came here with my fellow pregame posse. Loved the old school atmosphere, and decor.  Food was really good. I had a nice, big fat ribeye. It was cooked right on, and had a nice crust to it. Probably in my top five all time. I can't recall all the appetizers we got that were floating around, but they were pretty damn good as well. Service was on top of things. Overall a really great dining experience, especially considering they're was twelve of us. Good time. And I'm really glad work picked up the tab.
