Yep. There are lines. Every time I've went, like at least an hour. We check in, go shopping then go eat. I despise lines and for some reason I never mind it here. Probably because I know I'm about to eat THE BEST FOOD OF MY LIFE. ooohhhhhh Bongo Room, how I love you. It's all so. good. I live back in Detroit now, but when I go back to visit Chicago, if I don't go to the Bongo Room I. am. pissed. It's practically a waste of a trip! (Not quite. almost.) So what's good? All of it. The orange juice? Delicious! The veggie breakfast sandwich? Beautiful! The pancakes? Divine!!! Each and every one. It's funny that some people are like "oh my god they're so sweet!" But uh.. yeah of course! They include words like "caramel covered' and 'white chocolate' and 'cheesecake' They are sweet as hell. And scrumptious. The eggs Benedict? I could write songs about it to pass down to my children. Oh, also; no loud kids. Not that I've noticed. I think I would have since I normally end up at Bongo Room after a night of drinking whiskey. Its by no means quiet, but no random shrill screeching. Everything here is good, I swear. I'm coming back at the end of the month and I'm not sure how to schedule in a visit. It's so far the most stressful part of my trip because I must go.
