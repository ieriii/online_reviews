Yummy pizza, better than most. I love the cheese & fresh garlic! My only problem is the customer service, the give free soda to one customer, but not the next (with similar order) and one time when I opened the box at home the pizza cheese was all pushed to one side, the other side was without cheese :( Overall, very yummy!
