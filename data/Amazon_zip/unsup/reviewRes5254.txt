I was recommended this place by a buddy while I was in Chicago visiting the family for the holidays. Came here around 12:45(pm).. the place was packed for sure; but we were seated within about 5 min. Interesting place for sure. Almost like a tapas style of Pork and things that go with wine. I would def. recommend this place if you like wine and if you like pork! I highly recommend the 'Milke Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes' Amazing. Coppa with Provolone Cheese, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Whole Grain Mustard Panini was also excellent!
