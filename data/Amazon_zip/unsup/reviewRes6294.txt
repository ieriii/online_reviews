Good...not amazing. We felt like they were trying to hard on the menu. The special was great. It was a mixed meat meatball with a great sauce and a creamy cheese spread on a wood cutting board. Other than that we had a sampling of meats and cheeses, rigatoni, and the Kobe beef dish. All of them were prepared well, and they were all presented well. The staff was friendly, and the atmosphere was comfortable and clean. The only troubling thing for us was the size of the portions for the price, and the fact that we may have had our expectations set too high. The menu titles imply really creative dishes that should wow, but they just didn't wow us. Perhaps we are a bit too in love with Italian food, and maybe we were just expecting something more hardy. It's worth a try, and you would not be wasting a night here. If you like the more creative style, then this place may be a 4 or 5 star for you. P.S. You can valet at Francesca's across the street if you go around lunch time.
