This place was delicious.   I went with a part of 7-- and we decided to order the CHEF CHOICE menu.  Basically, throughout the 2 hours we were there, delicious tapas plates kept coming out.   I liked:     - there was a vegetarian option that was more than just salads     - the decor  I didn't like:    - the price    - food runners throwing food down on the table and either not explaining what it was we were about to eat, or talking way too fast or quietly about what it was.    I recommend getting the chef's menu-- if you can dish out $58 per person.
