Best restaurant in Chinatown. Hands down. And I grew up in Chinatown! I usually go there for their hot pot but I've also been there for private party events and let me tell you, their food is just out of this world. If you're wondering where you to go in the enormous sea of restaurants in Chinatown, give Lao Sze Chuan a chance. You won't be disappointed!
