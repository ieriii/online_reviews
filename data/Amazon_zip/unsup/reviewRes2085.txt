With so many hot dog places in this city you have to ask yourself what is so great about Hot Doug's? Well for starters how about duck fat french fries, or frio gras on a cognac infused pheasant sausage with black truffle mustard? This place has it all, from more traditional Chicago style hot dogs to the more exotic. The first time I ate there was on a Tuesday and I ate there two more times that week because it was so good. I can't say enough about this place, the line my be out the door but it is worth the wait, this place is unbelievable.
