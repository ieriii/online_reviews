This is one of my favorite neighborhood spots. It is a small building comprised mostly of an open kitchen where the food is prepared. What this places lacks in ambiance, it makes up for in great food at a good price and that is served quickly. If you values the actually taste of the food rather than the presentation and "show" attached with the dining experience, and The Pasta Bowl is for you. Recommendation: The Rigatoni Bolognese.
