A fantastic north-side secret... or is it? I used to work a few blocks from this place and would pass it up for the Cuban sandwiches next door for lunch. I always wondered what the dark little Italian place was like for a dinner service. The answer - fantastic. It's a small place, so reservations are recommended. The food is hearty and authentic in taste (but not so much in portion size - they're HUGE). The menu is quite extensive, and doesn't seem to be seasonal but that didn't matter to me - it does feature a pretty fair range of all Italian regional styles and plenty of homemade pasta. A great bonus is that it's BYOB, so feel free to try out your own wine pairings. The server was attentive and knowledgeable, but admittedly slammed by the full house. Definitely worth another visit, if only for the kickass osso buco.
