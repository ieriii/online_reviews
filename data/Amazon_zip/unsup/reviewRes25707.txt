Good food solid service. A trifle loud. The only weak link was the dessert and cafe con leche. Monte Enebro cheese is very good and a nice sized portion. Flash fried padron peppers were salty and hot, but not too much of either. Pulpo con patatas is tender and sweet. Pork stuffed roasted rabbit leg was excellent. The crema Catalan was uninteresting. I had a glass of GineGine a very good choice.
