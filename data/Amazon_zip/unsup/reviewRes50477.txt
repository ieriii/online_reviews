Brunch here ended up being a mixed bag, but unfortunately the mix leaned toward the poorer end of the bag. Our dining experience began on a hopeful note when they brought out plates of warm powdered mini-begniets. But it took an eternity for the waitstaff to return between taking our drink & dinner orders, then another eternity until the food finally arrived. As for the food - most everything looked just great on paper, and some of the stuff we sampled, such as the Eggs New Orleans, cheese grits, and honey whole wheat toast, were definitely worth waiting for. But too may of the dishes came out cold - the coldness accentuated the dryness of the biscuits and popovers which were part of several dishes, which was especially unfortunate. There were also a few gripes over drinks - the Bloody Marys lacked spice and the Bellinis lacked sweetness. A few months ago I had participated in a cooking class led by one of the chefs here, and based on that experience I was really looking forward to trying Big Jones. Too bad it ended up being a bit of a let-down. I can imagine that I would have been a lot more forgiving of the pokey service had the food been a knockout.
