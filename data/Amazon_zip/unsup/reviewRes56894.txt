The pizza was phenomenal!I came in here on a Thursday night for a late dinner (dine in) and ordered a large, red pizza (crust, tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese) with fresh tomatoes, Italian sausage, and basil. I'm more of a traditionalist when it comes to pizza, so I don't care for mashed potatoes and broccoli. It came our relatively quick, which makes sense for a thin-crust pizza. The pizza had a very good balance of sauce, cheese, and crust; and the toppings were adequately distributed over the entire pizza (not clumped together, but also not overpowering the pizza experience). It was delicious to say the least.But the big winner here was the crust. It was plain amazing. Crust and sauce is really what makes a pizza since those ingredients are usually made in-house (I hope), while Italian sausage, fresh tomatoes, basil, etc. are purchased from restaurant supply distributors. Technically anyone can get great toppings if they know the right people. Therefore, in my mind, what sets one pizza place apart from another is the quality of the sauce and the crust. Piece had one of the, if not the, best I've ever tasted. I would be totally fine withjust getting a large tray or bread and sauce. Yeah, it was just that good.If you're into singing, Thursday night is Karaoke night, so the place will be really loud. Unfortunately, when I was there most people didn't sing very well and their song choices were questionable. But the pizza was delicious, and I'm definitely going back.Try to eat in if you can as I'm sure it's better hot out of the oven than after it spends 30 mins in a cardboard box.
