My boss booked two rooms here because the price was so attractive for Chicago. Big mistake! I'm not too much of a snob to stay somewhere that looks a little seedy but when the first thing you see is a hooker walk out with her "john" behind her putting his belt back on I have to wonder if this is the place I want to stay for two days. We walked into the lobby and the first thing that hits you is the sour moth ball taste. The second thing that hits you is the "concierge" who said without word from me or my boss "you know you have to pay even if you don't stay here." What topped it all off was the steel gate over the windows, the barb wire fence around the building, the view of the gravel lot, and the tethered remote on the side table. I just felt like I was going to raped, jacked, or knifed. I in fact did not get refunded so I definitely got ripped off.
