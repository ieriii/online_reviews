Pork. Seafood. Heaven. Another place that's going to be even better in the spring when they open up the front. Yet another in the (now) long line of rustic looking restaurants in Chicago with long communal tables. The seafood stew is fantastic. The broth is refreshing, the shellfish are fresh and the fish chunks are buttery. And the blood sausage, oh, the blood sausage. I hated it growing up, but my adult self will do crazy things for a bite of the nasty smelling stuff. The farm chicken is juicy and tasty if a bit lightly seasoned. All-in-all, another amazing dining experience from Paul Kahan and co. This is just delicious so-called peasant food expertly prepared with love and joy. The service is excellent as well. Our server broke down the menu for us, and helped us out with the choices. Also the beer list is fantastic, but it has a lot of turnover. Still haven't seen that amazing hefeweizzen I tried. I like my IPAs and porters, but I'm telling you folks: this Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier Dunkel is one of the 5 most delicious beers I've ever had. If you ever see it, you need to get it.
