I went Frontera while on a business trip to Chicago. I asked friends who had dined in the Chicago area for restaurant recommendations and there was a consensus pick; Frontera Grill was one of THE places to dine at. When I spoke with the concierge at my hotel, he was quick to say Frontera's reservation queue runs well in advance of a month. Undeterred my bosses and I decided to test our luck on a late Tuesday night and we were able to be seated at Frontera. 1) Service - our waiter was a true gentleman and class act. He was attentive and quick to help us refine our choices. Great services overall. 2) Drinks - we all had negra modelos which is never a bad choice. 3) Food - definitely the reason we came and definitely the reason why my group and I were disappointed. Nothing about the food stood out - yes it was "good" but hardly worthy of the warning of a "30 day waiting list for reservations" and the consensus amongst my friends. I had the tacos al carbon, while the others in my group had the carne asada and pescado a la veraniega. We all agreed that the food was fine, but we didn't understand the hype surrounding the place. Maybe it was the luck of the draw or maybe Frontera's reputation has more to do with Rick Bayless than the actual quality of the food. In either case, I was disappointed given how excited I was to dine here. I wouldn't discourage anyone from coming here because there are many other appealing dishes, but I would encourage everyone to avoid deluded expectations.
