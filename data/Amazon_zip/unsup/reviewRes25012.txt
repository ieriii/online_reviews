Perfect place if you want to impress your date. My husband brought me here for our one-year anniversary and I loved it. Very romantic and cozy. We were at a table but would have loved to be seating at the booths. Definitely need to call a couple weeks in advance to reserve a booth. We were sitting so close to the couple next to us that we could overhear their entire awkward conversation (I think they were on a first or second date). We got the beef and chicken fondue dinner, with cheese and chocolate dessert. We were definitely full with the three course meal. I loved the choices in dipping sauces. There was a guy playing flamenco music on a classical guitar throughout dinner which added to the ambiance.
