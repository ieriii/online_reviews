Pizza was pretty good although I did not like the crust ( too buttery). We had to wait an hour for a table and there was just 2 of us. We preordered our pizza which was cool cuz we were starving by the time we sat down. Atmosphere was crowded but nice. Lots of tourists with cameras at most tables (including me!) I dont know if Zachary's has ruined me for all other Chicago style pizza but I just found this place so-so.
