Get some asap! Every time I think of the food here my inner goddess does a happy dance (forgive the 50 shades reference but delicious food is like porn to me :)). I have tasted and love everything vegetarian here. But I can't emphasize enough on how amazing the churros are. One bite of the crispy cinnamony goodness can turn my day around and make it awesome.
