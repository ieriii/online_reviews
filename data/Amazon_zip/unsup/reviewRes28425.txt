First of all, let me start off by saying I have been going to this restaurant since about 1975. It was the cream of top, when it came to Mexican food. Service nowadays is horrible. The food is greasy and management is not prepared to deal with the new clientele coming in to this restaurant. The last time we went in about 2 years ago, I had some beef stew. It was overcooked and the waitress tasted it and agreed. She apologized and said, "Let me get you something else." Any other restaurant wouldn't' even blink an eye and remove the soup from the bill. I go to pay the bill and the uncle of the owner's son, whom I have known for over 2 decades, decides to still want to charge me for the soup. I explained the situation and he insisted on charging me for 3.00 soup! I will take the greasy food and the fact that this restaurant only take cash, but management treating a 30 year customer in this way is unacceptable. Nuevo Leon is now what it used to be.
