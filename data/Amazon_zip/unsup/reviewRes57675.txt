this place has been there for 40 plus years...i've been going since i was born, twentysomething of those years. it's not there because the food is no good, thats for sure...the food is delicious!!! i have an inside secret for you all...theres a dish thats not on the menu, but if you order you wont be disappointed...name of it...machito...huge piece of steak w/ an enchilada,and lots more food on that plate...all for bout 15 bucks...trust me on this one! anyone who says this food is inedible should probably stay at home reheating leftover chalupas or nachos grandes!!! you wont find better mexican food than this... well maybe in my mamas kitchen!
