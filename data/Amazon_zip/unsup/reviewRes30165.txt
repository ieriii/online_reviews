Appetizers: Trio, Trio, Trio-very fresh ceviche, liked the tuna the best though Entremes Surtido-above average platter with cheesy quesadillas, crispy chicken taquitos with sour cream, tangy ceviche tostadas, crunchy jicama salad and guacamole. all were good although I liked the cheesy quesadillas the best. The platter was confusing to order, at least to the waitress...I'll explain. Here it is as written on the menu: FOR TWO OR MORE ONLY. PRICE IS PER PERSON. 8.00 So I said, "I would like $16 worth of this appetizer." I thought this would avoid any potential miscommunication, but the clueless waitress proved me wrong. She said you need to order 2 of them since it says for 2 or more. So, again I said, "$16 worth of appetizers and you can write it up however you want to." She proceeds to bring a behemoth of a platter and I knew immediately she screwed up. "Since we have not touched the plate, please take it back. I only wanted appetizers for 2 people." "I can't since I placed it on your table." "Then don't charge us for it." "I'll only charge you for 3 people." "I would like to speak with your manager." "Why?" "Let me speak with your manager." "Okay. I will charge you for only 2." ?!?!?!  If it weren't for the super duper accommodating busboy who went across to another restaurant to snag some containers for sauces, I would have been stingy with my tip. I hope they share tips cuz the busboy deserved all 25%. Entrees: Mole! Mole! Mole! Pollo en Mole Verde Oaxaqueno-loved the refreshingly bright green mole with the moist, tender chicken-my favorite mole dish Carne Asada a la Oaxaquena- well-cooked beef, good mole with subtle chocolate taste; not overpowering like most. beef was generally tender with very few problematic areas. Very good food when we went there. Odd service. Bought a cookbook so we could try to make our own mole. Tried one recipe so far and I think Rick is not 100% forthcoming in the ingredients. Some of his secrets didn't make it to print. :)
