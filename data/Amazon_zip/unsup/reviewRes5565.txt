Mmmm Purple Pig! My boyfriend is absolutely obsessed...I think he's been here about 5 times since moving to Chicago in August, and I've been here twice while visiting him. Favorite dishes include the pork rillette, which some friends have fondly dubbed "meat nutella" due to its spreadable deliciousness (not because it tastes like chocolate), the milk-braised pork shoulder, the OCTOPUS (totally delicious and meaty-tasting since it's cooked over a wood grill), the beets with whipped goat cheese, the chicken skewers w/ tzatziki sauce, and the fried chorizo-stuffed olives. Really, there isn't a bad thing on the menu that I've tried. Just order 2 plates per person, and go to town!
