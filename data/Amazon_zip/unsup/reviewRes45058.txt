We came for an anniversary dinner and we were very impressed, especially for my boyfriend who is notoriously picky. Starters- Olive plate, buffalo mozzarella with pesto, grilled shrimp The olive plate was par for the course, but the buffalo mozzarella was incredibly fresh and the grilled shrimp were amazing. Main Course- crab linguini and asparagus risotto Both were amaaaazing. Risotto can be a little soupy if not prepared right, but this was the perfect balance of creamy. Dessert- strawberry rhubarb crisp and chocolate hazelnut tart My boyfriend LOVED the crisp. I'm not the biggest fan of rhubarb, but the chocolate hazelnut tart was just enough to satisfy my sweet tooth.
