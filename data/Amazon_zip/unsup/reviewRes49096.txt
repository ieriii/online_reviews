Delicious foods. Good beers. Other reviewers focused on the meat dishes. As someone who does not eat red meat or pork, I can attest that the fish dishes and vegetable dishes are also well-prepared and tasty. In particular, the restaurant serves a wonderful sort of spring bean mousse. The place is cavernous, loud and crowded. Good for a big crowd/casual dinner. Definitely not for a romantic evening. This place is not exactly economical - be prepared to pay a lot for a merry and enjoyable meal.
