My friend and I stopped in recently and had a great lunch. The patio was absolutely beautiful... I loved that it made me forget that I was in Chicago. I ordered the insalata spinaci, bread, and spaghetti neri con gamberi. Super yums. My friend's ravioli piccolo songo looked amazing. It was a bonus that we were able to order smaller portions of the pasta. Service was very attentive, although a little slow towards the end of our meal.
