I've never been to Naples, but this has got to be it. I've made pizza at home with fresh mozz before, and it's a tough gig, it's wet stuff, and these guys tought me to live with the wetness of the cheese. Yes, it puddles in the middle, but when I was a kid we used to soak cake in milk, and dip our bread in gravy. Same gig here. Service is never here nor there, always fine.
