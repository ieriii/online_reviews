Fantastic vegetarian food, and all items are available vegan as well. My wife and I really enjoyed the brunch menu. We plan to come back any time that we are in town. I loved the "steak & eggs" breakfast. They have the best tofu scramble I've ever tried, and it stands up as a good substitute for eggs. The real highlight, though, was the delicious breaded seitan steak. It's not health food or fancy dining - just satisfying down home comfort.
