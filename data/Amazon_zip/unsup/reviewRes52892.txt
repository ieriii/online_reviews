BYOB Mojitos and BYOB Sangria? Do I really have to say more??? Went here Thursday with a large group. A guy host went way out of his way to make us feel comfortable. Loved the back patio waiting area with fire pits and couches. Empanadas were solid. Enjoyed parts of 3. Chorizo, beef, and goat cheese. Did not really like the steak dinner, but loved the plantains and black beans. Want to go back to get the pork chops which were a rave of the table. Patio would have been amazing. It was 95 degrees when I made the reservation, but a cool 59 a few days later. Go figure.
