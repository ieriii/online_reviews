I can't really say that Graham Elliot is Michelin star worthy and here's why... Everyone in the table must get the same tasting menu because the kitchen can't accomodate the timing of different courses. Seriously? I've been to a few Michelin star restaurants and they more than gladly accomodated that request.  The dessert was not good. At all. It's pretty hard to make me dislike a dessert dish. Of the 5 courses I had, I was only wowed by 1 - the deconstructed caesar salad. Everything else was just whatever and not memorable. They tried to be creative with a lot of the dishes, but it ended up being too many flavors without cohesion or just poorly executed. This was a sentiment shared by the other 2 people I dined with. Sorry Graham Elliot, but given the plenty of dining options in Chicago, I would not recommend you to my friends.
