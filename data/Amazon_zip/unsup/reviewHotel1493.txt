Loved my four night stay in July. Excellent location. We had a king suite and it was clean and comfortable. Join their loyalty program for free drink delivery in the morning. I love this service! Room service & house keeping are friendly. What I didn't care for is that you must enter the building and take it to level 3 to then take another set of elevators to the hotel rooms. I thought the room rate was fair.
