We always came here for dinner. It was my first time to come here for lunch yesterday. We had the set lunch menu, with soup, a choice of the main Tacos al Carbon dish and dessert. The tortilla soup was excellent. The grilled meats (tried the duck and pastor style pork) were tender and flavorful - excellent. We did have 2 margaritas each, and that is where they get the big bucks at a steep almost $14 per glass. So we paid more for the alcohol. But the drinks were well worth it. :) We always keep coming back to this place for the consistently good food, great ambience and excellent service.
