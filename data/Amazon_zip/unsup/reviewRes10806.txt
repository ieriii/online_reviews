We ate at the Bongo Room for brunch during a recent trip to Chicago, and I've been hearing about this place from my brother-in-law, his girlfriend, and my husband (who ate there on a previous trip). The wait on Sunday at 9am was 40 minutes, but we made use of the Starbucks located down the street during our wait. The place is pretty small, so you can see why with any decent crowd that there'd be a wait. The staff ask that you order once only (no re-ordering or adding to your order) so that they can have as quick a turnover as possible. As soon as all your food comes out, they put the ticket down on your table so that you can take care of it as soon as you're done eating. It's also quite distracting that as soon as you finish any glass/plate that there's immediately someone to pull it away -- almost sometimes as soon as you put it down. Beware if you're someone who likes to take their leisurely time finishing every morsel on your plate. My husband and I both got the breakfast croissant sandwiches which were tasty, but not over-the-top. The gourmet pancakes are what we'd heard lots about, so the four of us split one red velvet pancake and one pretzel white chocolate pancake in addition to our own plates. The pancakes are tasty indeed, and a nice surprise from the usual buttermilk or plain pancakes. They're very rich though, and I would be surprised to meet someone who can eat a whole order themselves. Definitely a good idea to share!
