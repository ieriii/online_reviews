MMMMMMM Sapori! This is one of my favorite Italian trattorias in the city. How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.... the atmosphere: inside it's sort of packed but very cozy and it's even better when you can snag an outdoor table under the lights during summer. The food: Everything I've had here as been GREAT! Specifically, I love the rigatoni, gnocci and the lasagna is about as big as my head, but it's phenomenal. Their pasta is definitely homemade and the ingredients are so fresh! The service is nothing to remember, but I haven't had any bad experiences. Oh, and once you get on their mailing list (sign up at your table), they'll send you coupons for like $13 off your meal...regularly. Can't beat that! Even though I no longer live in the neighborhood, I still go there pretty regularly. YUM!
