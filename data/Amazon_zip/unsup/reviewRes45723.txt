based on a monday night. loved it. dark and cozy, like a proper english library tucked away somewhere. a really nice fireplace with comfy chairs & tables tucked in front of it, on a landing. it was really quiet at 6ish, but filled up to a decent capacity by around 730. i ordered the tomato soup, which was really good, and i tried a friend's seafood chowder which was great- and as a main dish, fish&chips, which were alright, they did the trick. I want to dive into the chicken pot pie next time.. there will be a next time, because everything i saw & smelled was delicious and i have to go back to try more.
