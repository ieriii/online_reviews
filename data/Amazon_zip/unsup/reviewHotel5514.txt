I highly recommend this hotel if you don't need to stay downtown. The rooms are very nice and we loved the neighborhood. It's close to the red line and you can walk to lots of restaurants right from the hotel. I was pleased & surprised to find that our room was very quiet at night. I only have one criticism -- there is breakfast but no designated breakfast room. If you don't want to eat in the lobby you have to take your food back to your room. However, this is a minor inconvenience -- plus, there are several good places for breakfast a block or two away. I would stay here again & I've already recommended it to friends.
