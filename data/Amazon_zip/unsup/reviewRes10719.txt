Here's the thing - Bongo Room was one of my first Chicago brunch experiences EVER, about 2 years ago. What I realized this past weekend was that while my initial dining experience here was *really* good... I had over-hyped it in my head. Here I am two years later and I've sampled plenty of other Chicago brunches to know that Bongo Room is in fact delicious, but not all that it's hyped up to be. I would have given it 3.5 stars if half stars were permitted in the ranking. Here's my assessment: FOOD - reall good. the first time i went, all i remember was the tower of french toast (it was new year's day morning, so we ordered that as an "appetizer" for the table). we were not disappointed. the hand-shaved chocolate flowers adorning the tower were pretty cool. - most recently my boyfriend and i split the vegetarian croissant sandwich (egg sandwich on a deliciously flaky croissant packed with yummy veggies and mayo pesto), and the pumpkin cheesecake pancakes. The pancakes were good, but super heavy. They come in an order of three large ones, and they are just so dense the two of us had trouble making it through more than one each. SERVICE - prompt and attentive, though it's clear they try and get people in and out of there as quickly as possible to turn over tables. i can't blame them for wanting to keep things rolling, but i always find it annoying whent he server walks by and drops the check on your table without asking if you wanted anything else. WAIT - the wait time just isn't worth it. I got here at 9:30am on a Sunday and still had to wait 35 minutes to be seated. By the time I sad down, the wait was up to an hour. Again, Bongo Room is good... but not THAT good. There are just so many other good options out there that you do not need to wait an hour here! All in all it's a great place to visit... just not worth a super long wait, and frankly i'm not sure when there's not a super long wait!
