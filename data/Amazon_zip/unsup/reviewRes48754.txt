This place is awesome! I stopped in late one night for drinks, and was very impressed by the beer list. I couldn't eat anything because they had closed the kitchen, but were happy to have us for drinks. The menu looks awesome. I love the concept and the decor. The place is beautiful. The staff was friendly and happy to talk to us about beer. Hopefully I'll get to eat there some day, but I'm from out of town.
