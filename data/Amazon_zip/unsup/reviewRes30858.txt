I have been to Sunda several times now and each experience is just as good as the last. They have impeccable food in a awesome atmosphere! Today was the first time I dined there for lunch and they have such a great lunch menu! We stared off with the specialty sushi and it was pretty good. Not as much flavor as I had hoped for. We also had the pot sticker type things and those were far better than the specialty sushi. Tons of flavor! For my main, I had one of their box lunch meals! What a great concept. For $18, you get either a salad or miso soup, a spicy tuna or California roll and a choice of a main. I had the miso and the spicy tuna and both were excellent. In fact, I think it was the best miso I have ever had!! I had the Chicken and Pork Adobo for my main and it was absolutely delicious. Very flavorful with onions and peppers. The portion was quite large and I had enough to take home! Definitely a great place for any occasion! Such a fun, trendy vibe and the food is well worth the hype!
