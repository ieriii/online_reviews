This is a quaint and quiet bakery/coffee shop. It's a great place to go buy a coffee and a cookie and browse the internet (wi-fi). The staff is friendly and hipster. The decor is slightly dull, but it's not the main draw of the place. It's along Division; you can sit outside and people watch all day long. It's open until 9 pm most nights. Oh, and the cakes they make are amazingly creative and fun.
