Sunda. What can I say, this was my third time eating there and I am finally ready to write a review. I don't understand the hype. The first time I ate there was for my brother's graduation and the Chilean Sea Bass was defiantly memorable. I think Sunda turned me on to Chilean Sea Bass for the first time (learning it was near endangered turned me off...) also; you can never go wrong with the sushi! However, the Filipino food there is definitely an acquired taste. But Filipino food tends to be that way... I applaud the effort to make higher end Filipino food, but honestly it's a hit or miss. I've gone there with two different dates and both dates were not so happy with the Crispy Pata and a little more tolerant of the Pancit. But of course, the Loompya is always a hit - maybe it's an American thing. My experience with Sunda is more tolerant and mildly amused, than anything else. The food is good, esp. if you're ordering sushi and fish, but the meat/main dishes have left me wanting. The drinks are pricy and the ambiance definitely hip and young. It's a nice place that seems to draw in a very fresh young crowd, and on the plus it's probably the only Filipino restaurant I semi like. End story, go if you haven't gone, but don't go with uber high expectations.
