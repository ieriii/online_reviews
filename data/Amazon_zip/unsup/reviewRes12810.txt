It was good if you eat pork or beef. The food was seasoned well but the idea that meat is cooked to medium rare is not true. I thought much of the beef tenderloin was always overdone. The lobster bisque was really good. Overall, I liked this place and may go back if I am in the mood for a meat frenzy.
