Your money would be better spent somewhere else. None of the dishes I had were excellent and I would say that 2 out of the 5 that I shared that night were borderline unpalatable. The potted rillette was the standout dish. But nothing else was working the night I went. Avoid the salads, the skirt steak and the sardine dish. All very, very bad. There must be better dishes (I would imagine their charcuterie and the seafood stew) but the recommendations from our waitress were pretty bad. The fries with egg was okay but they should leave the egg a lot runnier so it mixes in with the fries. I wouldn't recomment the publican but if you go try to scour review for the must have dishes as I can't say any were all that special.
