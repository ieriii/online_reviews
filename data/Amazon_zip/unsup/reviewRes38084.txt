Favorite pub in the Chicagoland area. Amazing tap list - a great mix of American and Belgian micros as well as a ridiculous bottle list. A great thing about Hopleaf is they have a great mix of local, seasonal, and little known brews to rock your palate. As a proponent of beer nerdery, a solid 2 thumbs and a big toe up. The food is also incredible. As detailed below, a great mix of pub food, American comfort food, and sometimes charcuterie. I recommend the mussels as well as anything they have on special - I've never been disappointed. I take visitors from out of town here frequently - everyone loves it and wants to go when they're back in Chicago. I can't really talk about specific entrees since I've had most of them, but the food is truly delicious, simple and unpretentious. The service is great, but the bar gets PACKED. The kitchen opens 5:30 pm most days, so if you show up around then with your party you'll probably be seated quickly. After 5:30, godspeed. Definitely the best mix of delicious food and awesome beer in Chicago with the personality and atmosphere to match. However, I don't recommend it, as I don't want the place more packed than it already is.
