As one other Yelper stated, if you are thinking Glenn's is a Jersey style diner, not so much. But, while it might be construed as a misnomer, this tiny place is a little piece of heaven on Montrose.  Specifically, the potato pancake. With all due respect to my husband's Jewish mother, these latkes are luscious. Out of this world. I can't emphasize that enough. All the food I have had at Glenn's has been awesome. It does get really crowded around brunch time but if you have the time, and it is not 20 degrees or below outside (bc that is where you will wait for a table), it is worth it. (Warning: even on the coldest days, the tables by the windows in the sun get REALLY hot!!! I recommend layering.) Oh, and if you order hot chocolate, they'll ask if you want a shot of peppermint schnapps in it. Say yes.  Trust me.
