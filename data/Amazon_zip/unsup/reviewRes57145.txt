I would give an A+ to the atmosphere and overall experience. The food was very good, but not good enough for the prices. I think presentation sometimes trumps flavor here. The quinotto tart with goat cheese and peanut sauce was interesting but lacked something. The ingredients were unexceptional, it seemed like something I could make at home. The potato pancake with quail egg appetizer was equally disappointing--it just tasted like mashed potatoes. And I've definitely had better churros. The highlight of the meal was actually a side of mac and cheese I ordered! It was creamy, more like fettucini alfredo, and coated with crispy breadcrumbs. Excellent sangria, too--not too sweet and with a hint of citrus. Probably the best sangria I've tasted. All in all, this place is worth a try, for certain menu items and the bright, cheery atmosphere--especially in the midst of a dreary Chicago winter. But I don't think I'd go back again, unless someone else was paying!
