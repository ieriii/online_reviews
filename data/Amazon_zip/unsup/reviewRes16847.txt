Love the huge menu here, lots to choose from even though I always order the same 2-3 dishes. The Paneer Bhurgi and clay oven cooked lamb is perfection. You must order the saffron rice with your dish, it's packed with amazing flavor and for a dollar more it is definitely worth it! Nice service and cozy ambiance.
