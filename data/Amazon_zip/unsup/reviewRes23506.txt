If you're looking for a pretty low-key date night this is the place. It's charming with plastic stemware and plates. But don't let that dissuade you. I haven't been here in forever and really don't have an excuse, though we tried before on a Saturday night at 7p and it was jam packed. This time we went on a Friday when it opened. As always, the service and food were exceptional. Because of our out-of-town guests, our server gifted a round of complimentary oatmeal smoothies. Remember they don't take cards, but there's an ATM at the front. Parking is limited in their lot but there's plenty on the meters on Milwaukee. If you forgot the wine, check out Red & White Wines across the street.
