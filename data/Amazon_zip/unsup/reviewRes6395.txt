This is a very cute place. They have a nice outdoor upstairs - not a ton of tables but last time I was here there was space for myself and my two guests. It isn't a traditional Italian restaurant - more like a tapas type of Italian.....I asked our server Andrew to help us pick some things - so he brought out a couple of appetizers - pork something on cheese and really good ceaser salad. He even recommeneded a really good bottle of wine. We will definately be back.
