Good food, Great service! This restaurant is housed in two buildings. The fist building includes the kitchen and eating area number one. In building two there is the main eating area (area 2) and the elevated area (area 3) so the place is fairly big, but there is even a greater demand for seats. People line up to get seated on weekends and all... why? you may ask. Upon being seated you immediately get served water, nachos & salsa(s) as well as the sample food of the day (least on Sundays for sure). Everything seems be good as well as the drinks. The horchata (rice water) is perfectly blended and the meat is so tender. I recommend the Carne a la Tampiquena (which i uploaded a picture of on here). People from all over town have driven to get to this family owned restaurant, so that def. says something! P.S. don't worry about ordering, there is bilingual staff and the description of the food is English- all you have to do is grab a menu and point!
