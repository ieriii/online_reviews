I wanted to like Nana's, it's a popular place so there is a wait to get in, the service is great so it was disappointing that the food was so mediocre, most of the dishes use salsa verde (a mexican green sauce) which I think is the problem as it has no flavor, now grant it I am a bit of a food snob and very particular but compare this to Flo's or Lula which have tantalizing Flavors, Nana's left you thinking "are my taste buds dormant?" More details on what we had, I had coffee while waiting it is good, strong and flavorful which is important for breakfast I had the huevos rancheros, my girlfriend had the breakfast burrito, they tasted the same, the dishes looked impressive but lacked flavor. On my previous visit I had the baked Chilaquiles, same green sauce and no flavor. I was going to give it three stars because the place is very nice and clean, the service is excellent, but I did not go to 3 because it was a tad pricey.
