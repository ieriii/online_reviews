Mediterranean food that will make you feel as though you stepped into another country. Everything from the food to the atmosphere is perfect. I've only experienced nothing but good things with the staff and family. If you have a problem with Sultan's Market, you probably have problems mentally. This is an establishment that provides a great service with affordable, healthy foods. The only thing close is Pita inn and both have their own good things...but Sultan's has a sound business that should become a franchise--however, then it would get fucked up with the wrong franchisees. VEGAN friendly too.
