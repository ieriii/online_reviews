Came here on a Saturday night and it was packed. We made our reservation through open table and requested a booth with a nice view. They accommodated to our request. We were sitting in booth in the corner with a window view and away from the bar and commotion. I was pleased that they were able to fulfill our request considering that our reservation was at 8:45pm and we made the on-line reservation at 7pm. We ordered: 1. House Salad- decent portion, fresh veggies. Typical salad. 2. gumbo- I'm not a gumbo person, but my brother and bf seemed to like theirs. 3. 12 oz rib eye- Mine had a bit more fat than I would have liked. It was nice and juicy. I ordered medium, my bf ordered medium rare, and brother ordered well done. All of the steaks came out juicy. We all enjoyed it. 4. Sauteed mushrooms- the waitress said that the portion was huge and more than enough for 2 people to share. Well, she was wrong. It was a decent size for 1 person, but if you're a mushroom lover, it's not enough for 2 people to share. 5. mashed potatoes- wayyyy to greasy. You could see the butter floating on the top. Don't get me wrong- I LOVE butter, but this was just too much. 6. Dessert- Fruit custard and chocolate mousse- HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!! The portion was small. When I say small, I mean one bite (maybe 2) and it's all gone. Even though I'm a chocolate person, I didn't care for the chocolate mouse. It tasted weird to me, like old or something. I can't put my finger on it. I wish they had more of a selection for the dessert. The service was OK. When I asked the waitress about dessert wines, she answered my question, but wasn't too helpful with a selection. She spoke very fast so I only caught 1/2 of what she was saying. She wasn't very friendly and seemed like she didn't really care to serve us since we were ordering from the 3 course menu. Would have given it a 4, but because of service, had to knock this down to a 3.
