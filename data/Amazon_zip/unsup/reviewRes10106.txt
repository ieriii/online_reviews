Dining at Piccolo Sogno is an exercise in the simple pleasures of life. Marble Bar, where you can have a strong cocktail and chat up the bartenders. Open Kitchen, where you can see the delightful flurry of food preparation and watch plate after plate of regional, rustic Italian food get whisked to their tables. Antipasto Station - where you can ogle platters of roasted tomatoes, grilled asparagus, jewel-toned beets and paper-thin prosciutto. Outdoor Patio - where you are transported to a private Italian garden, with brick walls and beautiful trees and no hint whatsoever of the city streets. Your Table - where you dip buttery foccacia into syrupy balsamic vinegar, enjoy a plate of pasta or a perfectly prepared entree, and relax into the comfort and delight of being well served. What we ate was wonderful - antipasto for three, Halibut with Farro (best dish), Black Spaghetti with Shellfish, Veal Ragu atop green and white ribbon noodles, and a perfect Panna Cotta. What we drank was lovely, Italian wine that complimented the food perfectly. What I will remember most is a beautiful night with dear friends, the enjoyment and sharing of delicious food, laughing and talking with the GM who stopped by our table for 20 minutes, and walking out with the glow of summer and the smiles from a perfect evening illuminating our faces.
