Everything you've heard about the oatmeal shake is true. Who would have thought adding cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger to a shake would taste this good?! Brilliant. We sat inside although the heated patio seemed plenty warm. Plenty of tables available at 5 on a Saturday. By the time we left every table was taken. The green salsa served with the chips was very good. Not too spicy but enough to give the chips a needed kick. We had the chifrijo appetizer and thought it was pretty good. When my gf mentioned that she doesn't like really spicy food, our waiter said he'd put the spicy salsa on the side. I loved it. The pork was a little dry making it hard to keep in the chip but we managed to finish the bowl so I'm guessing we can't complain too much. I had the empanadas and ordered one cheese, one chicken, and one beef and potato. I liked the cheese empanada best if I had to choose. My gf went with the Costa Rican sandwich and said it was great. Our waiter was great and answered all of our many first-timer questions.  No complaints about the food or service. I wish I had a restaurant like this in my neighborhood but we'll add it to our list of reasons to get into the city. Almost forgot to mention they are BYOB.
