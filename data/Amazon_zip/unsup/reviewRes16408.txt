Truly the best Indian restaurant in all of Chicago. Much more depth and subtle flavor profiles in all their dishes, especially compared to any generic Indian restaurant or even the ones on Devon. The lunch buffet is great and enjoyable, but nothing extraordinary to me; the REAL highlight is dinner / ordering directly from the menu.  Fritters - spiced to perfection. Breads - fantastic "roomali roti" (roomali means handkerchief, so a paper-thin bread), indicative of a great restaurant since this bread is challenging to make - it's made on the under-side of a large, hot wok. Naans were fresh from the tandoor brimming with flavor. The pistachio-stuffed naan was a little too cloying and rich for me, but I enjoyed the other naans much more. Main entrees - generous portions, and I always have enough to take home with me. Rich paneer sauces, textured baingan bharta, and a special "Hyderabadi" menu (hidden away on the back page of this long menu!). Great renditions of conventional Indian classics, and plenty of rarer delicacies not seen at other restaurants - a gourmand's Indian restaurant. I tend to experiment with my selections here, but also order something classic alongside.  Why 4 stars? Egregiously mediocre service. The busboys were excellent and my water was always full, but the main waitstaff leave more to be desired. However, truly fantastic food means I'll always be back!
