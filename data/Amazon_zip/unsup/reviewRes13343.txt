Skip the diner menu, and look at the wall...that's where the real menu is. Wait, not the cereal wall...the chalkboard walls...oh never mind. If you plan on visiting Glenn's, I would make it a point to come for the dinner menu - breakfast is decent, and the diner sandwiches are all right, but the seafood is where it's at. Favorites include:  - the mussels, piled high with texas toast to dip in the delicious white wine butter garlic broth  - the seafood bisque pasta, jam-packed with shrimp and scallops drowning in a rich creamy sauce  - any of the fish listed on the board (the most recent one I tried was the cobia, which has a firm but buttery texture and tasted fabulous) We try to avoid it on Tuesday nights because it gets super crowded for the all you can eat crab legs. If you're into that, get there super early.
