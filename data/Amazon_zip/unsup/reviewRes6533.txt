Me and my girl are fans. Not as romantic looking as you come to expect (brighter than usual) but still very nice. The markup on the wines are a bit cheaper but note that they don't really carry anything really cheap. Make sure to try the Roasted Corn and Roasted Beats. The Pizza dalla Terra's missing the truffle flavor so skip it and try the truffle egg toast instead (then tell me how it is).
