90 Miles has probably the best customer service I've experienced at a Chicago restaurant. They have created such a hospitable environment by entertaining their guests, and not treating them just as paying customers. By the end of dinner, I knew my waiter, the manager and the cook by name. They were willing to spend time going over the menu and gave their honest recommendations. While some customer service seems pushy and forced, I got the feeling that these people were genuine and authentic which I can appreciate. On top of that, this place has great food. I had the goat cheese and beef empanadas and a steak entree (can't remember the name). 90 Miles also isn't greasy and over-salted, which I've experienced in the past at other Cuban places. The outdoor patio and BYOB sealed the deal for me.
