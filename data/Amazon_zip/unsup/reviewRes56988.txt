I've heard about this place from several people and finally tried it out. Just as I heard, the house-brewed beer with amazing even though I'm not normally much of a beer drinker. The selection is broad and I loved the single something (lighter, sweeter) selection. For the pizza, I went with the plain style and LOVED it. I will definitely be back. They said they were closing early last night at 9:30 instead of 10:30 like usual-- not sure why, but I loved it anyway. The atmosphere is a little rough, but the food makes up for it.
