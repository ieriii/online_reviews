Great chicken burritos and plantains. Amazing oatmeal milkshakes (ask for it with soy instead of milk). Don't expect speedy service or the servers to pretend like they give a shit about you being there. The dining room is kind of small, so expect a wait in the evenings. Carry-out service is available.
