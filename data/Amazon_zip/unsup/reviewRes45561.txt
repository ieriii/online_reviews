Nice place to take out of town guests or if you're looking for something interesting. Ambiance is nice...you can cozy up by the bookcases and fireplace. It was really busy on a Friday night around 6:30p.m., and we were lucky to get one of the last tables available without waiting. Food was okay. My appetizer Ceasar Salad lacked flavor. Had to try the mac and cheese based on reviews, and it was good - cheesy with breadcrumbs and bacon. Husband had the risotto, which was pretty standard - he wished it had more mushrooms. Sweet potato fries with goat cheese fondue was tasty.   Wine was expensive - average was $12 for 5 oz. Will return because of the interesting atmosphere - the food was just okay - not spectacular.
