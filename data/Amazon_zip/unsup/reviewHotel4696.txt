My fiance and I have stayed here twice now. (although I have to admit we got it by chance twice on priceline, we were so happy when we got it a second time!) We just love it!  We used to live in Chicago we love to come home often, and Hotel Felix is quickly becoming our home away from home. The first time we stayed here we fell in love with the hotel. It was just what we were looking for, somewhere environmentally friendly, somewhere small and quiet but close to everything and a chic modern design.  My family also stayed here and loved it.
