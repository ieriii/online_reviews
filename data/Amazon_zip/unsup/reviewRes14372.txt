One of the greatest things about Chicago is the variety of restaurants to try. It's hard to keep going back to one place because there are always 10 others that I want to try. However, I frequent Revolution Brewing often and never feel guilty about it. I've tried 90% of the menu (fat kid at heart) and have never had a bad meal. The blue cheese mussels are some of the best mussels in the entire city. The pork belly sandwich with egg is incredible as is the Flemsih Beef Stew.  Their beers are delicious, especially the Eugene, and I love trying all of their seasonal and limited releases. The staff is knowledgeable about the brews and you can always get sampler sizes if you can't make up your mind. I love that the place isn't pretentious and I've never seen someone having a bad time. Well done Revolution!
