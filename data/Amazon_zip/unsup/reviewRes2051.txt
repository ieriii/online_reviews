It seems cliched to review a restaurant that is so widely adored in the Chicago-land area. I would come off as crazy if I mentioned how I once waited an hour and a half in 20 degree weather for a sausage and fries. Could I convince the masses that every potato aspires to become a buttery flavored french fry deep fried in succulent duck fat?  Or that Doug's rib-eye sausage decorated with fontina cheese and garlic aioli would make any steak lover stand up and salute him.  Even Doug himself, with his bright smile and his always changing rotation of trendy glasses is endearing. Hot Doug's will hopefully be around for many more years to come, one can only hope he'll take his little piece of heaven and make room for just a few more fans.
