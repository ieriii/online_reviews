Interesting gastropub find in Logan Square. Showed up for dinner on a Thursday night, the place was near full and upon seating were told the kitchen was already backed up. Lengthy menu had a variety of appetizers, salads, sandwhiches, small plates, and entrees. We ordered a smattering of dishes, including: - family farm meatballs: came out in a pool of marinara and cream sauce. tasty but very small in portion.  - spring pea angiolitti: the first day on the menu, and was a fresh pea puree in ravioli - seared scallops over braised oxtail - mixing surf & turf sometimes brings out a bad 'seafoody' taste, which happened here. - monkfish: mushy and spongey, I went out on a limb by ordering this one and regretted it - pork belly entree - catfish entree - poached apple & french toast with bacon ice cream: interesting and points for creativity, but the balance of sweet, salty, and tartness was a bit off.
