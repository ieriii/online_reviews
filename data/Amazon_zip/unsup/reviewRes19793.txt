As if this place needs another review but its just too delicious. Me and my friend always enjoy going to new places for food but this is the one place I wouldn't mind going back and waiting for. I've visited twice already and I think Its safe to say the food is amazing but I wasn't too fond of the hot chocolate. I tried the almond milk hot chocolate and it was just not good, I just didn't like it and my friend's chocolate cafe con leche was just plain nasty super bitter and just wasn't like any other cafe con leche I've tried having lived in Miami for 7 months. Torta, guacamole, and salads are just off the hook amazing. I have yet to try their soups but I bet its just as amazing, definitely can't wait for the next time to go back. oh their churro's are also very very good, but I think its sweet enough by itself, definitely do not need the chocolate shot for dipping, that makes it a little too heavy.
