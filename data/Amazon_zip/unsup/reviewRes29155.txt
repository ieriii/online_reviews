The Food gets four stars... the service and wait get 2 stars.... blah... Well have heard some rave reviews about this place, so we decided to have dinner there for a birthday for a party of nine... Calling the rest. you will find out they dont take reservations for large parties, only parties of 3 or less, so you have to go to the restaurant at 5pm to put your name on the waiting list... (thats why there is always a line outside before they open), so we did and they told us table would be ready by 7:30, so we came back then, but we were not seated till 8:30, the waiting is too much. We were seated outside on the patio, thankfully its semi covered, cause there was a huge thunderstorm that night, the wind was blowing rain all over the table, not the best, they didnt offer the guests sitting outdoors an indoor table... Service wise, not the best, just too busy, i guess. As for the food, it was really good... the guac was the best I ever had, yummmmm... make sure you get that. Had the carne asada platter with plantains, very good, the carne was more like a steak and cooked well, very flavorful.... The duck my friend order was ok... not a big recommendation on that... Tried several drinks, mango mojito and reg. mojito, which were average....Overall the food was good, but not worth that kind of wait to get in.... actually no restaurant is, esp. to sit outside in the rain :( Despite the rain, we still had a great time and the food was really good :)
