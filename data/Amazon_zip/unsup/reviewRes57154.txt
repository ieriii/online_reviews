Went here on my 25th birthday this past Fourth of July weekend (Thursday, the 3rd - while everyone else was looking at fireworks downtown) with friends from out of town and in town....loved it.The drinks at the bar are by far the strongest drinks I've had in Chicago so far, we were seated quickly once our entire party got there, and the food was SO GOOD. The atmosphere itself it by far the best thing about Carnivale....fun fun fun.
