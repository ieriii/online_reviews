LOVE. LOVE. LOVE.The atmosphere is amazing. Bright colors, sky high ceilings, fun artwork...this place has it all. The raspberry mojitos are to die for, and the sangria is excellent-a little on the stronger side, which is how I like it. The food makes my mouth water just thinking about it, and I always leave feeling way too full because I HAVE to end the night with the churros!Service is always prompt and knowledgable. They offer great suggestions if you need help deciding on a menu item. Word of advice-ask to sit in the main dining room. So much more fun!
