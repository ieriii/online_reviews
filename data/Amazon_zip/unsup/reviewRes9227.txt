Why have I never come here before? This is now one of my favorite restaurants in the city. I came for restaurant week and found that their regular menu was significantly less expensive than I thought it was, so I went ahead and ordered off their regular menu.  Their service was great; the ambiance was chic and cozy and they didn't rush you at all. The food was amazing; there is a lot to choose from and there is a lot to appeal to people who are finicky eaters.  I will definitely come back in the summer and try to get a table (or at least a drink) on the terrace upstairs.
