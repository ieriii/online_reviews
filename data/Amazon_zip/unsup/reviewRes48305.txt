Brunch was delicous! We did not have reservation so waited for one hour on Sunday at 11:45. While waiting we had coffee, mimosa, sticky bun, zombie dust beer -- which made our 1 hour wait fly by. I then had the wine poached eggs and my hubbie had the sirloin. We shared the waffle. We ate so much food - it was delicious!!! I look forward to going back with friends but will make sure to make reservation.
