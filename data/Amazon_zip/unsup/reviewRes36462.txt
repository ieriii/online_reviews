I have never eaten in at Indie Cafe, but when I'm home I order in from them a lot. Their sushi is awesome, even delivered. The spicy tuna rolls are always perfect and they include a ton of extras in the bag every time I get them delivered-- lots of extra soy sauce, wasabi, and chopsticks-- which is a huge plus since i usually order a ton of stuff and graze over it for a day or so.  As with many Chicago joints, I hope to make it over there to eat someday, but the delivery is always fast and good...
