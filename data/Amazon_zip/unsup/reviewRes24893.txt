The Winemaker dinner at Geja's is just wonderful! $50 for a four-course fondue dinner and wine pairings is a fair deal. But add in the reception wine before you dine (mmmm last night it was a delicious cava!) and the fact that they refill your glass as much as you want throughout the night ...imo it's a fantastic deal! The service was so pleasant all night long. The host and bartender made us feel really welcome. The bussers took care to help me find the restroom (it is a little dark and small in there, haha). I was able to get reservations for the Winemaker Dinner only a week before the date, so call them up and give it a shot!
