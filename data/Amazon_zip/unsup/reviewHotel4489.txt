A great downtown place to stay. The perfect location. It seemed like everything downtown was just steps away. So was the El, which made all of Chicago steps away. Great bed and shower, and I liked being surrounded by all the history.  I was put off by some of the extra charges, which seemed exorbitant. Parking is one, but that was not a problem for me. Why do people drive to Chicago anyway? Any other way to get there is better. Internet access was $15 a day, which is irritating when really cheap motels where I stay NEVER charge for wi-fi.   And I could have really used a late check-out, just an hour or so, but they charge FIFTY DOLLARS to check out even one hour late. Geez. So I hauled my small suitcase around for a couple of hours between hotel check-out time and Chicago-departure time.  No cheap motel has ever charged me anything for a late check-out, either.  So the Palmer House can be a great place to stay IF you don't need any extras.
