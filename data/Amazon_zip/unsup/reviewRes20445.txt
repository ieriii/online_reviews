I came to the Gage with a few folks for a recent workday lunch. Our table had a variety of dishes, and I can't say that anyone was disappointed. At the same time, no one raved, although that is hardly a detraction. We stayed mostly with the sandwiches and salads, although the tables nearby had a set of entrees, both of which looked good. I had a vegetarian, mushroom-based sandwich. It was tasty, although heavier than it needed to be. The rest of the table was satisfied with its food, and the burgers looked tasty.
