Oh yummy, yummy Crisp! Having lived in Flushing, Queens for a while, you would think that I'd be more familiar with Korean BBQ. Uh, no. Crisp has provided me with Korean BBQ 101, and I can't wait to advance. Crisp's chicken is exactly that, crisp AND very delicious. There are a multitude of flavors to choose from, and watch out! An order of wings is the most supremely succulent experience, heightened only by combining with football on Sunday afternoon. The order was taken quickly and efficiently, with yummy hot food arriving at my doorstep within 35 min.  Yes kids, Crisp delivers!
