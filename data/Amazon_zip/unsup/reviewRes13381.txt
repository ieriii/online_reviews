I love this place. It is definately a place you need to put on your to-do list. I have been here probably four times already and I have got the same waitress for three of those visits and she absolutely rocks. Everyone who works here is definately super duper friendly. They make good suggestions regarding your beer choices. And if you have not figured it out this place offers some really good beer choices. I personaly LOVE the banana beer one. It might not be everyones favorite, but I do not like beer so this may say a lot. Anyways, things you should try... -Bacon fat popcorn: shaved parm/bacon over popcorn : nothing too special and can definately be made at home -Pommes fries: they are like made out of some kind of corn starch or something- they are good and come with a tomatoe sauce and hot peppers. Yummy! Definately try if you feel adventourous. Sausage Pizza: OMG- so good you might not have left-overs =( Hombre Burger: So good they put that good Mexican Cheese on there- you know what Im talking about! UGH jizzz The workingman burger? : so good it comes with bacon, cheese, and carmelized onions. Its a must -try All the burgers are big and juicy! All the pizzas are fresh and all the beers are really good too. If you are ever unsure of what beer to get , try the beer flights! Or you can simply ask one of the lovely servers. This kitty is happy =) meow!
