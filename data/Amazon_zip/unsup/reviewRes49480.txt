This review is a little late as I dined here with my girlfriend on Valentines day. We had made reservations and were seated promptly. The setting was very comfortable, an intimate feel to it. We started off with an appetizer and went with the Empanada platter as it was suggested by a friend prior to us going. They arrived quickly and were very flavorful. I think the cheese ones were my favorite.  I ordered the churrasco (butterfly cut, N.Y strip steak) because I've had this at other latin restaurants. I have to say I really enjoyed it. Not the best I've ever had, but it was really enjoyable and very juicy. It was served with fried sweet plantain, yuca, and potato, and all were on point.  The only negative really was the salad I got which just wasn't good. However the salad was the last thing that I went there for anyways. This place is also a bit pricey, but that was to be expected. It was also a voyage to get to the bathroom which included going downstairs, and down halls and around corners.. felt like a six mile hike.  I went with 4 stars which seems to be the average. It isn't the best place ever.... but you surely wouldn't go wrong trying this place out... especially for a date.
