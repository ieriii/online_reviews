Four stars for the food, 2 for the service. Our waitress was either high or mentally challenged. I can deal with slow service (about 10-15 minutes between each drink order and receiving a drink), but her inability to remember anything was frightening. I placed an order and rather than write it down, she would start to repeat it, then say "wait I forgot, what did you want?" This process was repeated at least twice more as she headed toward the kitchen and needed to be reminded of our order. She was incredibly slow on the check and tried to have us order dessert and coffee before our entree arrived. I'm pretty sure she had forgotten to put our entree order in entirely. Had we ordered coffee, no meal. I'm usually pretty forgiving of mistakes- being a waitress is a largely thankless task, but her incompetence nearly ruined the meal.
