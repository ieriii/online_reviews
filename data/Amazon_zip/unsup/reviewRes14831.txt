Pure garbage!!! This in not authentic Cuban food at all, 90 Miles is a joke to what is real Cuban food. I am from Miami who moved to Chicago and lived minutes away from Little Havana, so I know what REAL Cuban food tastes like. First the people there are Mexican not Cuban, maybe the owner is but he's not the one making the food. Secondly I go and ask for "Masas de Puerco" a typical dish that you find in any Cuban cafe in Miami and the lady gave me a look like I was talking giberish. The black beans, and pork had absolutely no flavor what so ever, the rice was bland and the only thing that was decent were the sweet plantains which really how can anyone mess those up. Anyone giving this place 5 stars must have no taste buds or have never eaten real Cuban food in their lives. I'll keep searching for a good Cuban restaurant here in Chicago, but if you ever travel to Miami go to Versailles or El Guajiro on the outskirts of Miami and you'll taste real Cuban food that puts this place to shame. Update: 3/28/11 I don't know what they've done, but I decided to give this place another go after a really long time. What a turn around, the food actually has flavor now and I can no longer complain. I've been here more than a few times since giving it another shot, good tasting food that brings back fond memories of growing up and living in Miami.
