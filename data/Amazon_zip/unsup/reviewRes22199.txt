This was on my list of restaurants to eat at. I actually only ended up there, because my uncle had mistaken that place for the dim sum one next door, to which he made the excuse that I wanted to go there anyways (Yea, sure, whatever you say). Either way, I'm glad that we went. We had the intestines, rice cakes with vegetables, and Tony's 3 chili chicken. The intestines had the perfect amount of spiciness - it tasted marvelous with rice. However, Tony's 3 chili chicken was the star of the show. It had the perfect amount of sweetness, crunchiness, and spiciness. If I were to go there again, I would definitely reorder that dish. The fried sweet potatoes (dessert menu) were delicious as well. The reason why I took off a star is because the bathrooms are pretty dirty. Also, some of the dessert items weren't available, which lead me to wondering why they still included them in the menu.
