The place is pretty cool, maybe just a little too trendy for me, but worth visiting on a special occasion. The food is fine and the staff are very friendly and nice, but I want to mention the do-it-yourself fruit sodas. What happens is you get a big glass beaker of seltzer water and a small beaker of flavoring/syrup of the fruit of your choice. Then you mix the two in your glass, making the drink as sweet as you'd like. It makes you feel like a kid playing with a chemistry set. Clever, fun and delicious.
