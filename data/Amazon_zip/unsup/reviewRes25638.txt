To me, pizza should be a thin folded thing you eat in the street or a thin thing seared by the flames of brick ovens. What's this pan thing? Pequods is the one deep dish that argues its case well enough with me. I want everything to arrive in my life in a seasoned iron pan when I eat here. Yeah this location is chaotic, but I always wind up here, and the pizza has always outshone whatever dysfunction was going on with the service. I'm pretty mellow. What sells me is how I can chow down on this obviously insane pile of calories and yet never feel rock-in-stomach heavy or gross afterward. That's impressive. The "Chicago Style" I bother with consistently, and I've had all the major players.
