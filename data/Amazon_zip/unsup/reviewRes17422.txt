After being a loyal patron of Indian Garden for 4 years, my friend convinced me to try India House. The food was good. However, the Naan was better at the Garden, and the chicken masala at India House, while it was clearly chicken breast, which is a good thing, it was a bit tough and dry, and not moist and flavorful. With that said, its a nice spot to catch dinner, and the prices are comparable to most downtown joints.
