We came here after my best friend recommended it for my birthday. Everything was great while we were there. It wasn't until the next day that my husband started feeling very ill. I also had a stomachache but he had the whole nine yards if you know what i mean. My sister works for the FDA so we reported this incident to prevent other people from getting sick. Please do not be fooled by their "delicious" food/service/atmosphere, etc...
