Alright, well everyone knows this place and wants to go here for a Chicago Dawg. It was okay. My first complaint is why, oh why, do they need to stuff everything into that small box? It's so hard to get the dog out without spilling your fries everywhere. The fries were not good at all... BLECH. The dog was only okay ... Sure it's edible, but expensive and not THAT good. I like sitting in a drive thru and feelin' nostalgic, that was nice. The waitress was nice. However, I'd rather go somewhere else for a tastier dog, sorry !!
