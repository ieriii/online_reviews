I absolutely LOVE Indie Cafe! Sadly, I no longer live in Edgewater so I don't get to eat there as often as I used to. Everything on the menu is absolutely delicious! Here are my top 3 favorite menu items: 1. Crab Rangoon - The best I have ever tasted! I am tempted to get one tattooed on my bicep. 2. Basil Chicken or Basil fried rice - Both have similar flavor and must be tried to believe how great they are. 3. Indie Signature Curry - Potatoes, Cashews & Massaman Sauce need I say more. Don't think that just because these are the only three things mentioned that the entire menu isn't fantastic, it is! Great service, environment and amazing food!
