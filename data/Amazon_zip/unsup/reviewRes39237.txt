Lived up to its hype. We arrived around 9pm on a Saturday, which clearly was not a smart way to get a good table (we were told the wait would be at least 1.5 hours). But we decided to take our chances and hang out around the bar for awhile to see if two stools would open up, since they'll serve their full menu there. Lucky for us, 20 minutes later we were sitting down! (I would not recommend this strategy unless you are ok with just having a drink and then leaving to get food elsewhere - the entire time we were there I didn't see any more than a few other barstools turn over.) Onto the review: I love that their menu is so playful (cheeze whiz?!), and that they have a wide selection of whiskey cocktails. I had the Shrubbery - delicious. The cranberry shrub (a fruit reduction/vinegar) gave the drink a nice fruitiness without being overly sweet. It complemented the bourbon wonderfully. Food wise, we sampled several plates. My favorite was their chanterelle pasta entree with artichoke hearts. The mushrooms were buttery and divine. We also had the ricotta gnuddi with eggplant caponata. The caponata was the best part of that dish, so I was sad it only came with a garnish size amount. The open faced ravioli with scallops was pretty good, and my date seemed to enjoy the sweetbreads. I got a kick out of the fact it was a super fancy version of buffalo wings, veggies and ranch. All in all, definitely worth checking out. I may need to go back for brunch.
