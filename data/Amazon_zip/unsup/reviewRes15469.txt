Forest Burger - delicious - beef patty, gorgonzola cheese, crispy fried shallots and cremini mushrooms. Really, really good. I have 1/2 in the refrigerator and I'm already counting down the hours until lunch tomorrow! Blue cheese potato salad was good. Their fries are really good too. The potato salad is really rich so after after a few bites I was wanting the simple, but so delicious fries. Bacon and sage popcorn - a must have to pass the time during the wait. I would **definitely** go back!
