I really like this place, even though I've only been there for brunch. The first person you usually encounter when you walk in the door is the owner, I really like this and it show that someone really cares about you and the business. If you are coming in a group over two, you should really call ahead or you will most likely be waiting an hour or two for a table. I've never made a reservation for a couple yet and I've only had to wait once. The food is very good, kind of an odd combination of Low-Country South Carolina and New Orleans but it works. My wife usually orders the crab cake Benedict and I usually order something else and the crab cake is almost always the best thing on the table and everything is pretty good. The drinks are good, if you like a morning cocktail and the coffee is good too. The service is great, they are attentive without hovering and friendly to boot. If you have a choice, don't set in the way-back, it is lonely. Overall a great place for brunch, although crowded, good for a date or when you have out of town guest.
