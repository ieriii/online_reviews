WE LIVE HERE!!! If your ever feeling under the weather, skip the pho and order the "chicken broth soup/add white meat/add vegetables"...INCREDIBLE!!! For all the yelpers that say the menu is boring...maybe they don't know how to order...try the french style beef, lemongrass chicken, cashew chicken...I could go ON and ON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
