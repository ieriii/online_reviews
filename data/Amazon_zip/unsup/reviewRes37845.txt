When my Minnesota boy decided to go to college in Chicago, I knew I would be visiting Chicago frequently and I wanted to find the best "Chicago deep dish pizza". I little research finds that there are as many opinions as there are restaurants as to which is best. So I decided to my own study. I went to Malnati's, Gino's, Uno and Duex, etc. and the place I keep returning to is Giordano's. Can't beat it, never been disappointed. - Just one more opinion. BTW, my test pizza is a large deep dish sausage, mushroom and spinach.
