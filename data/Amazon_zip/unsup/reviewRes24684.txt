I've always loved Artopolis for a casual but good dinner or indulgent dessert - but had never considered them for breakfast until three weeks ago, and have dined on their fabulous brunch for three Sundays in a row now. Fist off - no wait. Yes, you read that correctly, you can actually get a fabulous brunch in Chicago with no crazy wait!! Unheard of, I know... The food - along with their regular menu they offer an a-la-carte brunch menu on the weekends till 2pm...indulgent crepes - just as perfect as Meli, French toast, and a fab artopita with egg, veggies, ham and cheese... Served with a ton of fresh fruit - a perfect breakfast. I just wish they had a breakfast artopita with no meat in it.  All of their artopitas are so amazing - flaky pastry crust filled with your choice of ingredients - my favorite thing here. The crostini app is amazing, I make it at home all the time now, and the traditional soup is perfect for a cold day. The deserts are wonderful, and the coffee is decent. If you're sick of the brunch wait (or hostess!) at Meli then check out Artopolis across the street and you'll be very happy you did. (only bummer is that greektown parking meters are now $3 per hour (as of 1/1/11)!!! You suck daley!)
