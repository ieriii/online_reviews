Great atmosphere, good service, and tasty food make this organic-style American restaurant a consistently pleasant experience. Most, if not all nights have live music with no cover charge. A little on the pricey side for what you get -- a small plate of average sweet potato fries with goat cheese fondue is not worth $7 anywhere -- but that is par for the course in the world of organic eats.
