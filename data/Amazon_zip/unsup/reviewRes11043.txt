The chocolate pizza. That is all I can remember after my dinner at Piece. The beers were award-winning and the pizzas were delicious, but the 'chocolate pizza' was the best thing there. I ate the half of it although I was very full. I would have eaten the whole thing but I didn't want to scare the people I was with.  I can wait for two hours just for the chocolate pizza.
