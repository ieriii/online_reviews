The food at Wishbone tends to be very good homestyle cooking. Nothing too complicated and nothing too amazing. The perfect comfort food, you could say. One note on the food -- you get what you pay for. The crab cakes are around $7 so there is absolutely no crab in them. Maybe they should change the name to patty cakes? The decor is cute with lots of bright colors popping out at your from all sides. They have a full bar and a great selection of drinks to go with your meal if it is not comforting you enough. :D BUT this place is always crawling with the worst parented children I have ever seen. I know my mother would never have allowed me to wander a restaurant unsupervised to bother other tables while she ate. Additionally, if I was screaming and crying like a little banshee she would have taken me out of the restaurant rather than disturb EVERYONE else for her comfort. Apparently none of the parents that frequent Wishbone have gotten this message. The management/waitstaff does nothing to curb this behavior either. It almost seems as if they encourage it, which ruins what could otherwise we a very good meal.
