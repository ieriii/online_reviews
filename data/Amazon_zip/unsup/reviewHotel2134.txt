Is it possible to give a zero star? After emailing Priority Club about the issues I had during my stay, I got a bunch of automated messages saying how they care. I asked them one simple question, but they kept repeating the same automated answer. It is frustrating that they don't care enough about their guests to even take the time to read their complaint email. Save yourself and stay some place else. I have NEVER said anything like this to ANY other businesses, but the experience I had was just god-awful. Worst Hotel Experience ever, and this is supposed to be a 4-star hotel. There are many world-class hotels in Chicago. Why would you settle for something this bad? Don't just read this review. Go do some research and read other reviews on tripadvisor. You will see comments about how god-awful the service is and how small the rooms are.
