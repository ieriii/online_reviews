After only a few tries of Ethiopian, I'm hardly an expert, but, I do like to eat and my dinner at Demera was one of the best meals in Chicago I have had. I'm still cursing myself for being so polite and offering the last chicken sambussa to my date. I kind of expected him to offer to share it, but then again, in his shoes, I sure wouldn't have. They are filled with the most savory, spicy chicken. The few bites you get only give you enough to make you kind of dizzy that food can be that good. For those of you who enjoy raw meat, theirs is delicious, cool and buttery. For those of you who don't, it's even worth a try; if you don't like it here, you really don't like it. All of the vegetable dishes were spot on as well. They were just spicy enough to keep you going without overwhelming your mouth. And, the waitress brought by more injera too. We left stuffed and satiated after two appetizers and splitting a combo. And, with a 30% tip, it was 28$.
