I knew when I was walking past all of the other empty-looking Vietnamese/Asian restaurants down the street from Tank that this bustling place would be nothing short of amazing. There's a reason this place is always packed full of people! If the line is wrapped around the smallish entrance, keep waiting. It is SOOOOO worth it. They typically seat you with other people, but that is what makes the place feel comfortable and somewhat cafeteria-like. Tank's menu is so extensive, it's intimidating at first, but don't be shy to ask the wait staff's opinions on the food. They know what's up. Get a smoothie. Mix the flavors. They serve these delicious drinks with nice chunks of fruit on the top and Tapioca Pearls if you like that kind of thing (AND I DO!). #142 was my choice. A mixture of chicken, shrimp, brilliant steamed vegetables, all atop egg noodles. Get the noodles crispy! Trust me! As you break through the crispy layers, a most delicious sauce is revealed on the bottom of the dish. Use it. Use it all. YUM.
