Easily my favorite Middle Eastern place. They've got the best falafel and this place is always on everyone's cheap eats list. My last visit was this weekend, where I made a special trip to get some of their ME goodness. I got a pile of veggies, olives, and salad then their veggie combo ($6), complete with falafel, hummus and baba ganoush. This all came for about $10. Awesome.
