xoco was my first rick bayless experience, and other than that darn long wait it was faaabulous! i love how you can see the cooks prepare everything so you know its freshly made. i cannot say enough how delicious the food is here! the tortas are the best i've ever had. i love the pepito (short rib) but wish they served the wednesday special pork belly torta every day. but the best by far that i've tried is the saturday special...goat! it sounded strange to me but the cashier couldn't recommend it more and he was soooo right. caldos are delicious and perfect for those cold chicago winter days! the carnitas caldo is on the salty side...but its carnitas so what do you expect, right? and the avocado chunk help balance the saltiness out quite nicely. the chicken pozole was good but not the greatest (maybe because i'm used to pozole being made with pork?). but on top of having great food, this faster-food version of rick bayless's restaurants have great options for dessert! the soft serve is sooooooo good and that salted caramel topping with maple bacon streusel is heaven in a cup. and if you think things couldn't get any more blissful, you can dip those freshly fried churros into the soft serve! it's also fun when you get to see rick bayless himself making sure things are running smoothly there. i was able to snag a picture with him!
