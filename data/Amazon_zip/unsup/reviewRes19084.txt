I have a love-hate relationship with the Bad Apple. I can't seem to get past the Halloween font on the sign and menus, or the clip-art evil apple logo. I also take issue with how loud and crowded it gets. The layout is pretty awkward, but if I get there early enough and find a comfy place to sit, I'm happy. But, the beer and food are great and well-priced. Everything I've had has been awesome. Burgers are great, and the veggie options (particularly the "Earthly" are good too.) I love the fries - especially when I upgrade to the truffle fries. There is a pinball machine in the back, too, which is always a selling point for me.
