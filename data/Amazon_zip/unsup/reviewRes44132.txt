The adorable cakes in the window display drew us in, and suddenly we're on the lower east side of Manhattan 30 years ago. Awesome well-maintained space that brings me back to childhood. The "authentic" macaron was clearly the wrong choice, and M's "beignet" was equally un-exceptional. And also not a beignet. The coffee was decent and the bagels looked pretty good. They also have a lounge space next door that I wish we'd had time to utilize. There has to be good stuff here... we just didn't happen to order it. I hope.
