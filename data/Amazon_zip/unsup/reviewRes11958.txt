This place is pretty cool. They do have good pizza and their in house beers are also good. It is always very lively and I am not the biggest fan of sitting on top of the table next to me, even if it is an Internet, first date....although, they were amusing to listen to. The service is good, not great but not bad. The pizzas are pretty big. If you have never been here and you like pizza and beer...you have to try this place.
