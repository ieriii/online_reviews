The location and view were amazing but make sure your room is far from the elevators. They were so incredibly loud that my husband got very little sleep. Also the internet was painfully slow... used a groupon and they charged an extra fee for using it. Seemed dishonest as I had asked if there were any other fees when I booked it originally and was told no.
