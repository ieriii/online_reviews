Whenver old friends come to visit, my wife and I like to take them here (except on the weekends nights!). It can get quite crowded on the weekends. Love their beer selection, as I'm a big Belgian Ale fan. Their appetizers are something out of the ordinary and good too! Ate twice in the dining room, it seemed that the service was a bit slow and the food itself was good, but nothing special. The bar is where it's at... during the week that is....
