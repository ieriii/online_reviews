It doesnt get better than this....or at least i dont imagine it does. For $50 per person you can NOT go wrong here. #1 Unlimited Salad bar, consistent rotation of meats ( steak and porks) AND side dishes ( mashed potatoes, carrot mousse etc) #2 Once again $50 for UNLIMITED eating vs. paying $50 for ONE plate #3 This is not a place to go for ambiance, this is a place to go and pig thee heck out with no regards or guilt because EVERYONE around you is doing the same thing. They give you a marker to turn down when you want the waiters to stop bringing the meat because when i say its non stop rotation, its NON stop. We had to BEG them to not bring anymore food. GO HUNGRY. Dont even eat breakfast! LOL Like i said, i wouldn't call this a romantic spot, but I'd recommend this for taking your husband, boyfriend, dad, uncle, boss. A man that loves meat, this is his heaven.
