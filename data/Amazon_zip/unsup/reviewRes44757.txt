Whoa. Now THAT's a pizza.  We went here on our first night in Chicago mostly because it was fast, easy, and near our hotel, but also because - as much as I hate to admit it - we were being cute and touristy. In any case, Giordano's didn't disappoint. We were seated promptly and got our pizza (and beers) quickly, given that we'd pre-ordered while we were waiting for a table. The server was great, friendly and quick, and the pizza was just....well, the ultimate artery clogger. I usually eat pretty healthy, so my stomach hated me for this one, but it was so worth it.
