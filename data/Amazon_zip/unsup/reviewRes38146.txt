We like steamed mussels and Duck breast prossciutto .We also like the red cabbage and endive salad, the Nueske ham sandwich on pumpernickel with Gruyere and apple coleslaw, steak frites, fried smelts, and a really hearty wild boar stew with root vegetables cooked in Leffe Brun. But one of the coolest things about Hopleaf is its commitment to the proper way of drinking--many drafts are poured in their own glasses, designed to accentuate the special qualities of each. Don't miss this bar in the Adisonville. :)
