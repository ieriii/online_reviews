Came here with one friend during the week. This is a very large restaurant with vibrant colors and live music in the bar/lounge area separate from the dining area. It has a great feel to it when you walk in. Our sever was very helpful and accomodating. Lights inside the dining area were a bit brighter than I thought they should be. Food was just ok. We ordered ceviche, chicken and meat. I've been to South America, I know the standard for Latin food and this is just not up to what it could be. I say go for drinks with friends and if you order food, don't expect to be blown away.
