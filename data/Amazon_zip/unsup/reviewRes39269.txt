I dream about the spicy squid from San Soo Gab San on a weekly basis. A trip to San Soo Gab San is always exciting for me because I get to spend the whole time grilling delicious marinated meats. Mmmmmmmm. You also get about 10-15 little plates of side dishes (banchan) with your meal with things such as kimchi, pickled daikon, glass noodle salad, broccoli. The bulgogi is also excellent. They also bring out rice, lettuce, bean paste, and a soup (miso with tofu and jalapenos I think?). For those who want an appetizer, I would recommend the pajun, a Korean seafood pancake with dipping sauce. The portion is enormous but they bring you to-go boxes and the pajun heats up nicely. You should definitely come here knowing what to expect. The wait can be long at times, and the staff is often hard to track down. If you're sticking with water for your meal, you might get a little thirsty. Bring friends who know what they're doing, wear stretchy pants and socks with no holes in them (you sit cross-legged and shoeless at some of the tables), and be prepared to leave smelling like grill smoke.
