Ahh, Noon O Kabab, where were you when I was living in Chicago?!?!  You are the greatest! What's not to love about this place?!? HUGE portions, great customer service and the overall restaurant appearance is not too shabby. Your dill rice is "spot on." Your lamb kabob meat is oh so tender and perfectly seasoned and what's not to love about your hummus platter?  My boyfriend and I were in town visitng friends and family and thoroughly enjoyed our lunch there as we were famished from our plane ride to the city a few hours prior. Keep it up and I hope you stay in business long enough so that when we return, we look forward to dining at your fine restaurant again! :)
