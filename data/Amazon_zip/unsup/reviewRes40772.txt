There's a few things you should know up front: two of us came via CTA bus with a groupon, a four-pack of beer, and a 40oz of Frambois. That's the kind of class you can expect out of this reviewer. The beer and frambois seriously confused our server as to which glasses to leave on the table. He jokingly asked for help in selecting. Haha, server, very funny... very funny. But the joke was on us when we spilled the frambois EVERYWHERE, drenching the couple next to our's romantic evening in alcohol. If you're not aware, frambois is thick like milk, and purple. Also, this place is fancy... it doesn't even have its name on the front of the building, you just have to know it exists (thanks groupon). As classy as I am, I've been to a number of upscale, buzzed, prix-fixe, $75+, modern restaurants in Chicago. This was underwhelming for the price point to say the least. The interior of the restaurant reminded me of every other cookie-cutter condo in bucktown, only with more tables and less personality. The food is ok. The quail lollipop was fine, subtle flavor, gone in one bite, and the highlight of the evening. The trout was good enough, though not exciting at all. Veal cheek and marrow risotto had good flavors, but the cheek had a wet under-cooked texture I didn't care for. Pork bao was good, but it tasted and looked exactly (emphasis on exactly) like what I've had on Argyle for a few bucks. Crab Rangoon type dish.... sure whatever you want to throw in there tonight, chef, but for four dollars I could have gotten a few more had I just gone down the road. Dessert of melon and some small pastries,oh great, reminded me I needed to bring in a dish to work tomorrow for a shower. After all was said and done, after we gulped beer and frambois out of wine glasses, after we broke their china, and after we paid our enormous bill ... I went home to eat left-overs. But not left-overs from Bonsoiree, because there weren't any.
