It simple to see that this place is a great restaurant, but I can't give it 5 stars without another visit. My first visit, last night, was as a member of a big party. In cases like that, I don't think you can an accurate read on service in a party of 12, although our service was great.  The food was quite good. I had the baked chicken. Huge portion on a bed of green beans and green onions with redskin potatoes and a jalapeno sauce. The Ropa Viaja was fantastic, as were the empenadas. We were seated upstairs, in the back. The complaints about the overly-bright main dinning room are well founded. The artificial skylight kills the ambiance, doesn't enhance it.
