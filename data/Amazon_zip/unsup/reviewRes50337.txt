The food here isn't bad. The place has fun vibe....but....the service is SO AWFUL! We went in one night for a drink at the bar. The bartender was at the other end talking to a the only other two people there (two ladies, of course) and we were ignored for 10 mins. We tried to flag the bartender down, were ignored, and left. Unfortunately, every other time we have gone here, the service is pretty bad. We live close and would frequent this place if it weren't for that. Also, ordering carry out from them is a nightmare. The order is often wrong, you wait around for it (they say a certain time, always add 10-15 mins before you go get it) the food is served in messy containers, and just isn't as good. I will say, though, that those sweet potato fries ARE really yummy!
