An excellent find!! Amazing food and pretty good service . The simply it beef is outstanding! Filet mignon cooked in wine, garlic, and butter - how can you go wrong? Byob with no corkage fee is incredible. We came with a large group and the staff was very accommodating and patient. As a surprise, the waitstaff brought out fresh watermelon as a dessert which was such a good idea. We stayed and finished our excessive amounts of beer until the restaurant closed but we never got any heat from the restaurant or felt the least bit rushed. The only downside of this place is that it is a bit small and cramped. From the look of things, they are doing well business-wise so hopefully this means they will be able to expand sooner than later.
