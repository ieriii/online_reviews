There aren't too many drive-ins around anymore, and that is what makes Superdawg so special and unique. I've never tried their hot dogs, but I have tried the fried vegetables - Superveggies! I was amazed and disgusted, but in a good way. I am a bit of a health nut, so imagine my shock when I bit into a fried nugget to find...corn? Zucchini?! Such a cute place chock-full of nostalgia. Check out all the signed photos of famous celebs that have dined there.
