This looked like a very romantic place and it is. There are two problems with the place. The prices are way too high for fondue and the tables don't have enough room for the fondue and yourselves. The tables are too close to the people next to you and the live music is kind of annoying when you sit too close. Seemed like they crammed as many tables in the place as they could without thought to the people who would be sitting there.
