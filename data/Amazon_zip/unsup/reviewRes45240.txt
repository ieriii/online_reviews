Outstanding delicate, innovative and freshly prepared Italian. Small portions just like Italy. The major negative is that the dining room is unpleasantly loud. It is not relaxing and you can hardly hear yourself, let alone, the others in your party. The saving grace is the intimate outdoor patio in the back. If you can't sit there, it's not worth it to me.
