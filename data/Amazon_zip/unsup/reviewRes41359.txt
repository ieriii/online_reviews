What can I say about this place. BYOB, a 5 course meal for under 60 dollars per person, and fantastic... no.. its just pure excellence.  The sad thing I have to say is that I never came here often anytime sooner.. I came here about a year ago and signed up for their email list. I always disregarded the emails sent to my junk mail since I figured it was going to be the same information about the same food. Boy was I wrong. I finally decided to reply and been invited to the prix fixe dinner on Friday.  The food is utterly amazing. The short rib was so insanely delicious. Also try the oyster and asparagus soup. The food preparation is gourmet given a personal touch by the chef.  The service is phenomenal, always attending to your needs. This place comes really close to my top restaurant to go to. I'm going to have to try their brunch sometime on sunday if I ever get a chance to wake up early after a debauchery of an evening.
