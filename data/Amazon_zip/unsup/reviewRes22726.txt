After eating here, I can comfortably say I am not a fan of spicy Szechuan cuisine. Although, I will let mapo tofu slide though the cracks of my judgement. I still prefer more of the canto style with light, subtle flavors and the smokiness of those magical woks. Anyway, my father, Anh, and I shared the Szechuan pig ears, Yu Shiang pork, pork intestine and kidney, and a dish that looked like sliced beef in a kim chee soup. The Yu Shiang pork and intestine were the only recommendable dishes out of the four.
