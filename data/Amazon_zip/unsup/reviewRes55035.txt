Had Gunthorp farm chicken with oregano & roasted garlic $19, beef pot roast with red wine glazed root vegetables $23. Food was very good but way overpriced for the small portion size. So dark that we had to use Iphones to read the menu, the acoustics were bad so the noise level was high for talking with friends and the bathroom was downstairs and very secluded at the far end of a long hallway. I seriously could not see what was on the plates when our main dishes arrived. So much great food in Chicago at restaurants with better atmosphere. Sadly, won't go for dinner again.
