I ordered chorizo and picadillo tacos, but was not impressed with either. The chorizo especially was very bland. Normally, I'm very forgiving of less-than-stellar service but the server never came back after bringing me my food. After 30 minutes, I had to walk up to the cashier and get my bill. It was busy, but still. . .  I did appreciate the free mini-appetizer (~ stew with potatoes and meatball), and pickled peppers on the table, but I've actually had better tacos in Ravenswood. Others seem to rave about the entrees, so I would try it again if I was in the neighborhood.
