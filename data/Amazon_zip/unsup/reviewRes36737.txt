after playing a late but posh gig in the south loop, my string trio and i raced up to Indie Cafe under the cellist's recommendation. as we hurriedly grabbed a bottle of pinot noir from the nearby Dominick's, i was looking forward to a leisurely meal. we got to Indie fifteen minutes before closing (1030p on a Saturday), and sheepishly asked for a table. the friendly and welcoming host still seated us but we definitely had to hasten up with the ordering.  the staff remained friendly through out our late meal, but i definitely want to come back to enjoy a more lingering meal. the presentation (decor and food) of this place impressed me. it's hip and trendy without pretentiousness. my friend's seaweed salad came in a martini glass sprinkled with some red roe and topped with a cocktail umbrella. we just wished there were more seaweed instead of the cucumbers that propped up the seaweed and took up most of the glass. the seaweed that we got was perfectly crunchy and delicious. my drunken noodles were slightly more sophisticated and delicately flavored than most i've had. my other friend enjoyed his green curry came in a square dish accompanied by a mound of rice piled in a triangle.  by the way, that was the first thai-japanese restaurant i've been to lately that did not subject their customers to sleepy and sappy 80's hits! i was also impressed by two more things: 1. reasonably priced entrees (my drunken noodles was under $8) 2. the fork with the semi-nautical knot. what is it with me meeting great silverware on my recent restaurant outings?! i really don't have a silverware fetish. i'm the one who never buys the silverware off people's wedding registries.
