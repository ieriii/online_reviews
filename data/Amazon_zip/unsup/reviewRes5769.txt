This place could easily get five stars but they don't because I think they are incredibly greedy. Their food is absolutely, completely, 100% delicious. The HUGE downside is that the dishes are expensive and small. It was like eat tapas that was pasta. The rigatoni I ordered literally had 10 noodles on the place and was $14. In order to get full here you would have to order 3-5 dishes and spend 50 or so dollars. If their prices ever drop or if their portion sizes increase you can expect me to be here at least once a week and changing my review to five stars.
