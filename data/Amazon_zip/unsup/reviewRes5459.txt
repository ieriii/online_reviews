A pig by the Tapas. Just a really fun place. Like any the wait sucks, and they have not totally figured out the best seating arrangements. However, once you see the menu the excitement sets in. You better be in for some different "parts" to eat because that is what there is. Pig ear, tail, marrow, and tar tar are many of the strange but delicious items that are a must order. I know, ear? You seriously have to forget what part you are eating and enjoy. The meat and cheese options are also a must get. Food a 5, Everything else a 4. But go, and you will not regret. Another great option is Bristol.
