Yes it's crowded. It's good and fun, what do you expect? We were quoted two hours for a table, but ended up sitting and eating at the bar after about an hour and a half. We entertained ourselves with awesome whiskey drinks--the bartenders were more than happy to make suggestions on drinks and flights and it all worked out great. I'm not sure what else to say that hasn't already been said. The food was adventurous and great, it's a little pricey but you get what you pay for. I'll be back and I'll be bringing friends. Probably one of my favorite's. Cool, not too formal but good dining and drinking experiences in the city.
