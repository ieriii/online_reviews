First time at Xoco and it surpassed my expectations. We ordered the barbacoa goat torta, pork belly caldo and hibiscus tea. The food was great. The pork belly soup was amazing with an insane depth of flavor. Most impressive was the customer service. Two minutes after sitting down, Alyssa, the chef came over to let us know that she was just starting a new batch of fideos for the soup and we could wait 10 minutes or she could bring it over without the fideos. We opted to just wait and relax. Five minutes later Alyssa was back with an order of chips, salsa and guacamole on the house to thank us for waiting. A few minutes later a waitress brought over two side salads on the house. Our food arrived a few minutes later and was amazing! Thanks for the great food and wonderful service.
