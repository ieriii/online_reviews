Went there a while ago cause a friend recommended it. I ordered the Seoul Steak Bowl and let me say it was pretty delicious. There was more than enough for me to save half and eat later as a separate meal. I liked the Atomic Sauce, it had a nice kick. I was hesitant to try the Atomic Sauce because it looked like it had a creamy texture, almost looked like Thousand Island dressing, though it was actually pretty tasty and complimented the bulgogi excellently. I really liked the place. The seating is communal, so if you have a big group, you may have to split up if seating is packed.
