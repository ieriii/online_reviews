Fabulous. Best brunch I've had in a long, while. The four of us came in right around 2 when they stop seating additional customers, so we only had to wait about 10 minutes. Most of our group hadn't eaten all day due to an early basketball game, so we were starving. Two of us got savory dishes, and the others got the sweetest dish: the chocolate tower french toast. I got the chorizo and avocado omelet, while my bud got the classic choice: eggs benedict. One of my friends and I decided to split our dishes to try both savory and sweet. My omelet was great, even though I'm pretty sure I'd fall in love with anything with loads of fresh avocado. The chocolate tower french toast, though. Jesus Christ that thing was delicious. The chocolate bread is dense and bitter enough to hold up against the sauce and the bananas, and it's the best example of dessert for breakfast that I've ever had. By the way, why aren't there breakfast small plates places? I feel like it makes perfect sense to have plates of eggs benedict, waffles, cinnamon rolls, ham, potatoes, etc. to pass around. This needs to happen. Anyways, splitting our dishes was the perfect choice. The portions are pretty large, and we all left satisfied, even though three of us didn't finish off our plates. I didn't have to eat the rest of the day. The interior is sparsely decorated - just a typical brunch diner with uncomfortable wood chairs and benches, but at least you get a lot of natural light in from the storefront. All-in-all, this place is totally worth the hype. Can't wait to come back.
