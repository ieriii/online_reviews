Very good beer list, both on draft and in the bottle. Service was good. Burger was good as well - I got the Edmund Fitzgerald and it didn't dissapoint, might have tasted better on a pretzle roll though (doesn't everything taste better on pretzle roll though). Can't go wrong with hand cut fries either. I got the fire ones and they were spicy, no complaints, waiter warned they were spicy when I ordered them.  If you are looking for a good burger and a good variety of beer this is your place.  Wait was about 20-30 min on Saturday night at 8:00 for a party of 4.
