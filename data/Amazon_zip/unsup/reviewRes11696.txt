I think the person who wrote the descriptions for the Bongo room menu also wrote the descriptions for the classes in my college course catalog because in both instances, the description sounded so much more appealing than the actual item/class. The sandwiches and lunch items are just average. You really only want to come here for the breakfast food. Sort of tune out the hype though because you'll enjoy yourself more if you don't come in with high expectations.
