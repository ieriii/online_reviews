I'm still full, three days later. I'm really surprised that this place totally lived up to all the good things that everyone said about it. What a gem.  The staff is friendly, it's BYOB, and the food is absolutely incredible! The Taco Ticos are so good, I've never had anything like them. I got the Milanesa dinner for $12.50, which the menu describes as "thinly breaded steak topped with white cheese & tomato sauce served with yellow rice, pinto beans, plantains & salad". Damn straight! Tons and tons of food, the plantains dipped in beans were out of this world. As everyone commented, the Oatmeal Shake is a must. I wonder if these count towards a nutritious breakfast. Having places like Irazu is what I like most about living in the city. The true uniqueness of the cuisine goes well the great execution. The restaurant runs smoothly, despite being ridiculously sought after and busy. I will definitely be back!
