Delightful food presentation. Quality bar. I guess this means Logan Square is coming of age. But unlike his older sister, Wicker Park, Logan is sporting some definite class at this young age of gentrification. I'd venture to compare the care of food and drink here at L&E to that of The Drawing Room in the Gold Coast. I mean, come on, you can get rabbit on the brunch menu! How absolutely posh. Yet young and cool enough to not be pretentious (try the hamburger for dinner!). Yes, I'll have more of that, please.
