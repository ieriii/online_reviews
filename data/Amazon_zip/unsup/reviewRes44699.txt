Being a deep dish virgin, this type of pizza is 100% the bomb . com and I don't think I'll ever be able to go back to thin pizza! After debating for a few minutes on Giordano's and Geno's East with the locals at Lizze McNeill's, we finally decided on Giordano's simply because they delivered. My friend from Chi-town informed me with deep dish, it's all about the crust and the sauce on the pizza. I learned there's savory crust and even sweet crust, that has the taste/consistency of cornbread (which just seems weird to me). I'm upset I never had a conversation with my friend's dad since he's supposedly a deep dish snob/conoisseur. We had Giordano's delivered to Lizze McNeill's in the loop for my last Chi-town dinner. It was simply too cold to leave the bar. I was aware this would take at least an hour after learning that deep dish is baked and takes at least 45 minutes to get after ordering it, so I was aware we wouldn't be getting our delivery for at least an hour.  The pizza, which shouldn't even be called a pizza in my opinion, arrives, we open up the box, and I admire it for a good 2 minutes before devouring two huge pieces in 10 minutes. The pie doesn't even look like a normal pizza, it reminds me of some sort of an Italian casserole with a pastry-like crust. Delicious. It didn't even need ranch and I'm typically a person who douces my pizza in ranch. The crust would've been good with some ranch though :) Only reason I can't give Giordano's a full five stars is because I didn't go into the restaurant, didn't experience the service, and have no other deep dish pies to compare it to. Next trip I'm trying Geno's!!!
