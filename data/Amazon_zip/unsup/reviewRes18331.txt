I'm a little torn about XOCO. So, 3 stars leaning towards 3.5. Here's the breakdown of my scoring system: Churros with ice cream: YUM. A little pricey (esp for the side of soft serve), but, seriously, yum. Hot chocolate: meh. We had it only once but it wasn't very well mixed (I'm remembering a chunky texture) and it didn't live up to the high standard set by Hot Chocolate. I've yet to meet a hot chocolate that can dare to compare with the Mexican at Hot Chocolate. Food: I liked the chips and guac. We had the vegetarian caldos as well as the woodland mushroom torta. I wanted to like them SO much. But they were both SO salty. Different occasions too, so it wasn't just one salt-happy sous-chef on a binge night. The caldos we got to-go and actually didn't even eat hardly any of it, it was that salty. Pucker your face and spit it out salty. Use it to gargle after you've had your wisdom teeth out salty. I keep coming back here, mostly for the churros. Not wowed by the food, although I suspect the part of me that really wants to like this place will keep trying it.
