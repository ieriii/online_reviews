I would totally come back here again. My friends and I made reservations for Topo, but wanted to eat at Frontera Grill since it was less expensive. We got there right when the place opened, and stood in line for a number. Chilled at the bar with some yummy mojitos, and got a table in about half an hour! Food and drinks were really good. I think the Summer Margarita, with infused cucumber, was delicious. We ordered the ceviche and oysters for appetizer - delicious. I ordered the black mole enchiladas...SO good. But what BLEW ME AWAY was my friend's steak. OMG. so tender and juicy. Service was awesome as well (and we got to see some guy vomit...food poisoning? health conditions? ambulance came and took him away. They cleaned up the place very very quickly). We also got to meet and take pictures with Rick Bayless!!! What a nice fella!
