I had dinner here with some friends last night and really enjoyed it. I had the ricotta gnocchi with sage and brown butter sauce and it was delicious - extremely rich, but delicious. The group also shared a side of the corn bread and it was phenomenal. I split the mint chocolate chip ice cream with someone and that was also wonderful. They have a good beer list and come cocktails that sounded intriguing, although I didn't partake. The atmosphere is cozy and classy (although maybe just a tad too dark), and I can understand how it might get pretty loud in there on a Friday or Saturday night, but it wasn't bad when I was there. The service was good, although the water guy drove me absolutely insane - their water classes are these tiny little things, and the water guy kept appearing at my elbow seriously every 5 minutes and it was just excessive. They leave a glass bottle of water at the table, so it's not necessary for him to intrude on the table every 2 seconds to refill our glasses. It got to be bothersome and annoying after a while. So, water guy - chill out. Aside from that, I loved this place and will definitely be back to try some more dishes.
