This is a historic, nice, and pricey hotel in the heart of Chicago. The good: helpful concierge, clean, complimentary drinking water near all entrances, central location right on the El Train line, rooms equipped with mini-fridges, and beautiful lobby, bar, and restaurant. Could be better: room size, price, and parking cost. Overall, if you are willing to pay around $170 a night minimum, don't need a lot of room, and prefer to be centrally located, this is a decent proposition.
