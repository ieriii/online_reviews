If I was smart I would've reviewed XOCO last week saying that I got a rampant case of food poisoning and that I saw a severed head in the kitchen.  If I was smart, this lie would've gone viral. If I was smart, this would've caused XOCO to be empty when I finally got around to paying a visit. But alas, I am not smart, so i stood in line and braved the chaos for over an hour. Worth it? Would I do it again? Yes and absolutely yes. Being from California, I have a belief that good Mexican food cannot possibly exist outside of our great (broke) state. Well, maybe Texas and New Mexico might be close but you get the picture.  XOCO basically looked me in the eye and said, "hey whitey, try this shit on for size." To which I responded, "I sir, have been living a lie." I can only describe it as "Mexican French dip," the Ahogada is insanely good. The sandwich is served in a super spicy broth that packs a mean punch. The broth mixed with the "soggy" bread and the meat inside are a legendary combination.  Seriously, go now. Oh, and get the churros and chocolate.  The crazy part, at 5 stars, this was, at the time, my new favorite sandwich of all time. XOCO held this honor for a whole 24 hours until I went to another Chicago place.... To be continued... Suspense.
