The mac and cheese is to die for, but be careful... it's not vegetarian friendly. I haven't been there except during off hours, so the service has always been great. The music selection could sometimes use a little tweeking, but the TVs are quiet or mute, the "library" is fantastic, and it's just a good place for good comfort food.
