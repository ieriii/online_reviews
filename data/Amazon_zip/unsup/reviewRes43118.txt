I work near this place and its $3 deep dish by the slice is *second to none*. (Usually spinach and mushroom for me). As said in so many previous reviews, their decor leaves something to be desired. Do not bring a date here unless you want it to be the last. But do bring a friend or colleague here for lunch to impress them with your knack for finding excellent pizza. 5 Stars for food, -1 star for the cafeteria style dining decor.
