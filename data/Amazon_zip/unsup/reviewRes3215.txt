What can I say about Crisp other than, OMG! Talk about some of the BEST fried chicken I've ever had. It only comes second to Raisin' Canes. The chicken is always moist and tender. It is breaded to perfection and never over done. The sauces are nothing but short of amazing. And they still manage to get the other Korean fair, like Bi Bim Bap, to taste absolutely delicious. I always try and bring people to here and they always love it. They give you a gargantuan amount of fries as well, which are also cooked to perfection. I always leave there full. This is definitely a MUST if you come and visit the Chicago Lakeview area!
