One of my favorite places to grab brunch in the city! I can only imagine how bad the wait can be on weekends. I came here with my sister on a Tuesday afternoon, so there was no excruciating wait for delicious brunch. Their portions are huge so I would suggest collaborating with your friends on orders so you can all share. Sister and I split the veggie breakfast croissant with potatoes, apple hotcakes with walnuts and some kind of cream sauce, and a big ol' french vanilla latte. The veggie breakfast croissant was huge, but did not have enough egg to really be breakfast-y. Thankfully, the veggies in it were very fresh so it was still tasty and light. Their potatoes were well seasoned, so I didn't have to add any salt or ketchup to enjoy them. The stand out at our breakfast was definitely the apple hotcakes. Holy crap, they were so fluffy and sweet and perfect. I can't wait to go back to Bongo Room and try all of their other hotcake combinations.
