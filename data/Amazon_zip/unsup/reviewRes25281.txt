My family stopped in for a late lunch on a Saturday--great service and the shorter lunch menu was fine for us. We ended up ordering a few plates off both the first and second course options, and were charged for the lunch special instead of a la carte--a great deal! The food was delicious and the service was great; there was no hovering while we hung out afterwards to talk--but they didn't ignore us completely either, refilling drinks and whatnot. The red wine flight was a great choice, highly recommended. We'll be returning sometime for dinner, the full menu looks excellent!
