I probably can't add anything that hasn't been said, but i simply love to come here grab a seat at the bar, have a couple beers, and devour some delicious mussels. I just have to get there before like 7 or there is no chance of a relaxing visit. I live in the building attached to hopleaf, so I see the masses waiting outside every night, and can't help but wish they would just go back to where they came from and leave the hopleaf to us hoodies. Ok that was mean, but I really do love this place and wish it was easier to just stroll in whenever I wish.
