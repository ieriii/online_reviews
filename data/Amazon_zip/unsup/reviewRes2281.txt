not as if this place even needs to be written about by one more person. but DAYAMN GINA. the hot dogs are incredible. (okay okay, i'm a veggie, but i still love this place.) I ordered my usual, the Chicago (veggie) dog, and added hot giardiniera and sauerkraut this time. the french fries are to DIE for.. they taste like the fresh cut potatoes tossed in hot oil and laid out on brown paper bags, that my grams would make when i was younger. one hot dog is plenty (especially if you order a lot of toppings) and a large fry is ample to share with a friend.
