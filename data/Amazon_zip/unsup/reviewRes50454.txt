I think our server needed a red bull or something, but what she lacked in energy the food made up for in flavor. New Orleans eggs with crab cakes, potatoes O'Brien, Delicious! I probably should have only eaten half but the poached egg was staring at me like a huge eye, taunting me! Had to show him who was in charge! Coffee is nice and strong though i'm not a huge fan of the simple sugar. I remember when simple sugar came in a white packet labeled "sugar", ah the good old days :) Classy looking joint (velvet curtains aren't just for stages you know), pricing was reasonable and the food was good, which translates to hell yeah i'm going back! I think I've got a Love Jones for Big Jones brunch. See what I did there?
