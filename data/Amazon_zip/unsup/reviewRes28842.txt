I can't give this review any more or any less stars than 3. It was just ok. Yes, we ate take out so that does change things - but I don't think this could have been any better if I had eaten it there. There was nothing special about my lunch that would make me think it would make that much of a difference. I had the Cappellini Pomodoro as the lunch special - which was a great price! $6 +tax for a giant portion of pasta and a drink! That might have been the best part of my meal. You definitely get more than you pay for, which is always a good thing in my book! I get at least 2 more meals out of what I didn't finish for lunch yesterday! The pasta was good, there could have been some more sauce on it, but I'm not sure that would have made that much of a difference overall.  The bread they gave us was not your normal bread that you get with a pasta dish. It was ok, but more suited to a bread bowl that you might get as an appetizer at a steak restaurant than an Italian restaurant. One of the girls got the Conchiglie Gorgonzola, which she inhaled! And the other girl got the Farfalle Pollo - smelled like a lot of garlic was used in this dish - she also had a lot of left overs just like me.  It saddens me to give this an ok review - I really wanted to like it since it was such a great deal! But I just can't compare it to anything amazing.
