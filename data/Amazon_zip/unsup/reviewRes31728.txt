The interior is very nice, then it is a steep downhill. It started when I complained about my dirty coffee cup, it was replaced silently, no apology.  I order oatmeal, it was so overladen with mixed in brown sugar it was uneatable. When I left the uneaten oatmeal and ask for the check, waiter did not even ask if something was the matter.  I payed my bill and left as soon as I could!
