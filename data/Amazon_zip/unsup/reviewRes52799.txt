Five minute walk from my house - what could be better. A great cuban place in an area with several cuban spots. I love their BYOB cocktail Mojito mixer! Again and again I had delish pork anything, great fried plantains and friendly staff - never a bad experience. Their outside area is only for small parties, but their is plenty of space inside or in their heated tent. Overall a perfect spot to bring visiting family or meet a friend for a long overdue dinner.
