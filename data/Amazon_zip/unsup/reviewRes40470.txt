I'm not sure how to review this restaurant because they have 3 on the same block. 2 are fast, counter service places, and the 3rd has table service. But the menus are different. The restaurant has way more stuff, including rice, beans, guacamole etc., get the super burrito with all the trimmings, its at least 2 meals. Recently, my BF got me a steak burrito from one of the smaller Pasadita's and guess what was in it? Steak. A giant tube of meat. To clarify, there was only steak in my cylindrically folded tortilla. I kept taking bites thinking that pretty soon I would hit upon the other treasures hidden below all that meat, but it never happened. Who would want to eat this?
