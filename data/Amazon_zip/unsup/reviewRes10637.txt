This place is one of those that you waffle on your review saying, "Do I want to call it 3 stars, or 4?" The portions were enormous, and by that I mean my shrimp salad could have fed a family for a week, and contained more avacodes than the Whole Foods produce section. But the prices? Way too high! I feel like they could cut the portions (especially on the omelettes and toast) and the price, and be a way fairer deal. People who have a sweet tooth really seem to rave about this place, but I'm not a fan of pancakes, and would be hard pressed to come back, unless of course, I could split that salad five ways.
