To be fair, my boyfriend adores this place. He would rate it a fivestar! Every couple weekends or so Garcia's becomes the holiday entertainment of champions as we get together with some other gringos to order the killer-strong Margarita pitchers, eat some greasy, gargantuan-portioned food and get so completely wasted we spend the rest of the night: atempting to speak Spanish to the waitresses who roll their eyes in disbelief, going to the German Brauhaus next door to request that the yodeler sing classic Michael Jackson tunes, trying to figure out who was the designated driver, getting a cab followed by more greasyness from Taco Bell or Golden Nugget THEN back to Lincoln Square where we patrol to find where the heck everyone's cars are located. Hence my rating, nothing personal. I actually like the mole sauce... and the limeade is the BEST Chicago has to offer... but geez this scene gets old...
