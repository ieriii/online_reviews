this is a great neighborhood place. the burgers are great, the beer selection is fantastic and constantly changing. it does get pretty busy on friday and saturday nights, but stop by during the week and you will find a great, relaxing place to hang out and enjoy good food and good beer. also, the staff is really friendly and great to hang out with. btw, they serve what is literally the best hamburger i have ever had in my entire life. i'm not exaggerating here. it's not their regular burger (although their regular burger is one of the best in chicago. get the slow burn. you won't be disappointed). rather it's a $26 dry aged prime rib something or another. it's only served on wednesdays and thursdays if they have any left over. i'm not usually one to go for fancy expensive burgers, but this one is worth every penny. i definitely won't hesitate to order it again. there really is no way to explain it other than to say it is burger perfection. other than the burgers, the salads, appetizers and sandwiches are good too. the poutine is fantastic. the only thing i wish they did have was desert. but i guess beer counts for that. if you're not a beer drinker, they keep a selction of great wine and great spirits as well. bad apple is one of my favorite places in chicago. check it out!
