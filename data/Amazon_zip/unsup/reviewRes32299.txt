I saw Demera on Check Please and since it was so close to my home, I had to try it. Admittedly, this was my first foray with Ethiopian food, and I had heard for several years how similar it was to Indian food.  We had reservations for 5:30pm on a weeknight, but it wasn't necessary since the place was nearly empty. One of the waitstaff seated us at a table (which was nicely marked 'Reserved', but totally unnecessary). Our waitress did mention that since the Check Please episode, they have been doing a LOT of business, and reservations are required for the weekend and some weeknights. (As we were leaving, the restaurant was a lot busier than when we came in) Since neither of us had tried Ethiopian food before, we told our very friendly waitress and she made some recommendations to us. (We mentioned some restrictions like no lamb and no seafood, but everything else was OK) She recommended the meal that had 6 sides and it was plenty of food. We picked through the menu and then we asked for some recommendations as well. The food was good - we ordered some of the spicier foods, and honestly, it wasn't all that spicy. I even mentioned that to my friend and he agreed.  All in, we each paid about $21 for our meal, and it was a little more than what I was expecting to pay. While the food was good, I don't think I would go back. There wasn't anything bad about it, but I think if I wanted spicier foods, I would just stick to Indian.
