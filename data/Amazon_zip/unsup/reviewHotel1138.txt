I love almost all fairmont's hotels, and this is no exception. We had a view of the buckingham fountain absolutely gorgeous at nighttime. If you get a gold room, the breakfast and evening cocktails and hors d'oeuvres are great. Service is great, amenities are great, decor is beautiful and elegant. I'm a fan of fairmonts.
