I've been wanting to eat there for a while, then I saw them on drive-ins, diners, and dives and went the next day. I guess my expectations were high because of all the great reviews. Sadly, I was disappointed. In a nutshell, it's latin food you can get almost anywhere. The steak sandwich Guy Fieri had on TV is just that - a steak sandwich, nothing out of the ordinary. The food was okay, kinda pricey for the kind of food they serve. There's a much better steak sandwich down the street (Marianao Cafe) and they are way cheaper. It's a bit confusing because it's supposed to be a Costa Rican restaurant and they serve Mexican tacos, tortas, and bring you mexican chips and salsa when you are seated. Maybe I just didn't think it was great because I am latin and I am accustomed to this food and theirs is nothing great. The food was definitely edible, but I wouldn't go back again.
