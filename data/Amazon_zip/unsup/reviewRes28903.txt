How very disappointing. Based on the reviews I was expecting delicious, amazing food. I came away from the meal saying 'eh'. The service was ok. I ordered tofu panang curry (had to pay extra for rice, boo) and tom kha soup. I got a fuck ton of soup. It came in this giant trough. It even came with it's own ladle! However, there was more quantity than quality in this dish. The broth was watered down and wasn't nearly as flavorful as other thai places (think Tac Quick and Phos). It was ok. The panang curry was sad. It was a buttload of panang sauce with NO vegetables and a few pieces of lonely tofu. It was truly disappointing. The flavor was ok, but come on! Give me some vegetables in my curry. Oh, Opart. I will not be back.
