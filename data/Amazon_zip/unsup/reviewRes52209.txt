My favorite Deep Dish. Why??? Everything about it! The pizza is as it's best! I love how you can really finish even the crust yes the crust. I was very tasty compare to other deep dish.. somehow it is buttery yes buttery and we chicagoan knows that deep dish is a sin for non carb diet but well you don't eat it everyday right so why not indulge yourself once in a while with a Gino's Deep dish pizza. There's a waiting here and they don't take reservation..
