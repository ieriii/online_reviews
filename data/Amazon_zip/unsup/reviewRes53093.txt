A week ago today, i had never been to 90 miles. i really didnt know anything about Cuban cuisine, and wasnt looking to either. Ive been there three times in the last 6 days, and i plan on going again tomorrow. What are friends for?? to bring you to 90 miles to stuff your face with some mouthwatering roast pork, rice & beans, fried plantains, mango smoothies, espresso (which is to die for), steak sandwiches, omg, the list goes on. Most recently i had the talapia sandwich. delicious. absolutely delicious!!! This place is BYOB, so grab a 6 of pbr and head on over. the patio in the back is a nice place to sit, and im guessing its open to the great outdoors when the weather is better. Oh, and if you bring your own rum, they will make mojitos for you. sounds like a plan to me!!! see ya there!
