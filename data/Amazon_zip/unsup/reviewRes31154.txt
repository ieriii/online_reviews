WARNING! Ask your wait-staff for the ketchup! Last night I took the 13 year old I mentor here. She is a major fan of black bean burgers so of course, this is what she ordered. After a few bites she suggested she toss some ketchup on the burger, and I thought I'd be nice and grab it as to not bug the busy waiters. So I reach over to where the condiments were and grabbed the large red squirty bottle that historically houses ketchup. She then doused her burger with the liquid in the bottle. A few seconds after the first bite she looked at me with tears in her eyes and anxiously stated "that was hot sauce!" It was tragic, made not so tragic by the smiley waiter who gave her a free cookie. My mentee then told me I should leave my number with the credit card receipt because she "approved" of him and thought we would look good together making veggie burgers. 13 year olds are crazy hilarious and Chicago Diner is hilariously awesome!
