Great place....very mediterranean feel to it. It's a restaurant, bar, coffee shop, bakery, gift shop all in one. I've never had bad food from here. The desserts are great, as is the bread. My only wish is that they had a better brunch menu because it's an ideal place for brunch. I also don't understand why they don't offer the frites during lunch time (only after 2pm?). The frites are my favorite served with dijon and feta. Mmmmm.
