Pretty good quality for the price we paid. That said, anything more than what we paid might have been pushing it (we paid $187/night). Great location, great service, great housekeeping!  I knocked off one star because the room wasn't as nice as I had anticipated. We decided to opt for the deluxe guestroom for some more square footage and I can't imagine how small the room would have felt if we had just booked the regular guest room. Our couch is located right UNDER the tv, which means you can't sit on the couch and watch tv at the same time and you can't watch tv if someone is sitting on the couch. The air conditioning was wonky - it would work fine sometimes and other times I felt like we were having humid air circulated through our super warm room. It was nice having a full size mirror in the room, but it was just a large mirror that was placed slanting against the wall. And there was this weird patent leather chair in our room that felt so misplaced; oh and random framed artwork placed above the headboard over ONE bed (and not the other) - it looked like $3 IKEA artwork. Maybe I'm hard to place when it comes to interior design. The positives of the hotel (and trust me, the positives outweigh the weird issues I had with the interior design and AC) include: the David Burke Primehouse (wonderful!), the housekeeping (prompt, attentive, fast like ninjas), friendliness of the staff, and LOCATION. We were all over Chicago and the James Hotel really felt like it was the perfect location if you wanted to walk to Millennium Park, grab a bite to eat at XOCO or any of the other Rick Bayless restaurants, and then grab a drink at the Hancock Tower (which was exactly what we did when we were in Chicago). If I could get another great deal for the hotel, I'd probably stay here again.
