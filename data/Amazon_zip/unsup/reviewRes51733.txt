I had the 3 taco dinner last night. My choices of meat were fish, steak and chicken. The fish tacos were fantastic given the fact that we're stuck in the Midwest. The steak was flavorful with just the right amount of tenderness. The chicken was seasoned well and moist. The restaurant was fairly empty and so seating was no problem. However, in a city full of Mexican restaurants, if asked I would go but probably never on my own accord.
