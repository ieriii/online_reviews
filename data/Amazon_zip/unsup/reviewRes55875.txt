This place has been here forever, a real Chicago treasure. But Calo has never been as good as it is now, from food to drinks to entertainment, everything is top-notch. I remember the old Calo, with its dark red booths and mediocre wedding bands. But this new, bright, happy Calo is what its all about. The food is better than ever, though its always been good, and the entertainment is now the best this place has ever seen. Where else can you see a great live band for free that can play pretty much any song you request - and play it DAMN well too? The band is called Higher Ground - I've seen them at least ten times over the past few months. Always a great time.
