Grand Lux is really in the perfect location. This is exactly the kind of place you want to go when you have a day of shopping or sightseeing planned with friends or family. When you walk in it is hard to realize how spectacular the decor is from the waiting area. It has that crowded beeper filled feel that makes you contemplate whether it is even worth the wait. Honestly though, it is definitely worth the wait if you have the time to spare. Once you get up into the seating area the decorating is a sight to be seen. Very colorful and interesting. You'll see people from all walks of life and all ages...as to be expected in this heavily touristy area. The wait staff seems to be trained extremely well and in my experience they are always knowledgeable and relatively timely with their service. (That's taking into account that this place is usually busting at the seems during the lunch/dinner hours and especially busy on the holidays.) What makes Grand Lux a stand out in my eyes is the menu...it's really inclusive! You have so many options....even the pickiest of eaters can find something they like on the menu. The price is comparable to similar restaurants in the area so you can plan on dropping around $20 per person. The last time I was there I ordered a sandwich and it was really delicious. All the ingredients were fresh and it had a nice presentation to boot. Overall, I think this is a great option if you will be spending a day in the Michigan Ave area with friends or family....or if you are just to get together for a nice meal in the loop area.
