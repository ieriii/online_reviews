The best deep dish pizza in Chicago. the slightly burnt butter crisp crust is phenomenal and accompanied ingredients of cheese, sauce, and topping are balanced perfectly. my favorite and recommended toppings are pepperoni, onions, fresh tomatoes, black olives, with garlic... it is just pizza heaven... check it out for yourself and Enjoy!
