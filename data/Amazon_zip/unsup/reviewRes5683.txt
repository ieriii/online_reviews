Shite. Service was good, though. The food was not awful, but utterly gimmicky - we ordered the bone marrow, thinking that 'if they offer this, they've got to do something good with it', but no, it's dog food. It even smells like dog food. I noticed that at least one review says mmm BACON - bacon is conspicuous by its absence from the menu. A strong plus point though is the music - while I was in there I heard Zep play the Lemon song, which is unusual. However, the overall experience was bad enough that we will never be going back. The promise of cheese, swine and wine is too heady compared to the actual offering.
