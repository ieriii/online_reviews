The price is right and the hotel is fairly convenient. It is within walking distance to restaurants and shopping. There is also a bus stop right around the corner which is convenient if you will be heading a bit outside of downtown. There is also an excellent view of the city from the hotel. However, if you are looking for a place that you'll be able to take advantage of the wireless Internet, this may not be right for you. I had plans to do some work while away on business, but unfortunately, the signal from my room was at one bar. It was very difficult to go on. If you do head down to the lobby area, you will find a Cyber Cafe with a much higher signal. For me, I wanted to be in the comforts and privacy of my room, so this did put a damper on my stay. Overall, it is a nice hotel for the price. The staff was friendly, the fitness center and pool areas were well maintained, and they were also open from 6am - 11pm, which is rather accommodating.
