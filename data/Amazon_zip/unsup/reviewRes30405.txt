I was here a minimum of once a week when I lived in Chicago. I don't think I ever had the same thing twice; the menu changed fairly often. Of course, some things were better than others, but as a general rule, everything was high-quality and delicious, and service was usually friendly. And the desserts usually rocked. 4 stars for putting a significant dent in my wallet.
