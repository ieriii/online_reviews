My boyfriend surprised me for my bday and took me here. Neither of us had been yet and we both loved it! (super that it's BYOB). We brought two bottles of wine and our savvy server recommended one bottle over the other, explaining that this one would pair better with our tasting menu. Awesome. Every dish was fantastic, the most interesting being the powder substance that when consumed, turns into french onion soup. The scallop dish and rabbit gnocchi were amazing. We have recommended this place to many many people since we dined. We'll be back. So good!
