Grand Lux most definitely a slightly more upscale Cheesecake Factory on Michigan Ave. The wait is always long, and the service is super slow! The food is exactly the same quality, taste and portioning as any Cheesecake Factory. Actually, the food at a Cheesecake Factory is much better than at Grand Lux. My fiance and I wanted to go do a little shopping at the Water Tower mall, but first wanted lunch. We decided to stop at the Grand Lux seeing how it's close to the mall, and that it would be quick....WRONG! We decided to valet the car right away to save time on finding a parking spot. They had a decent valet price for up to 4 hours. So we figured we can eat there, go to the mall, and come back in time to get the car out. We waited for around 20 minutes for a table, which wasn't that bad considering we had no reservations. Once our name was called, they took us to another waiting area, where we stood there for an additional 15 minutes. Once we were seated, we ordered our lunch. I went for the Fish and Chips, and my fiance had a salad. We weren't served for another 40-45 minutes. I didn't think it would take that long to fry some fish and toss a salad! Once we finished eating, our server just took forever to bring us the bill, to pick it up, and get our credit card back over to us. By this time 3 hours had already passed. There was no way we could've shopped at Water Tower and made it back within an hour. Our shopping day was completely shot, so we ended up going to a suburban mall.
