I haven't had Texas de Brazil yet, but I've tried both Brazzaz and Fogo de Chao and think Brazzaz is better. I've been to Brazzaz three times, and the selection of meat is better, as is the salad bar. Brazzaz also has shrimp, which Fogo de Chao doesn't, although if you're filling up on shrimp you're missing out. The fried plantains are excellent. They can be easy to overlook with all the meat going around, just make sure to try at least a bite (they come with the meal). Last time I was here, about a week ago, a few of the cuts were closer to well done than usual. The meats are all high quality, so there's no sense burning off the flavor. I might as well state the obvious. Don't bring vegetarians here. They will go into shock. In the spirit of "beverage may be hot" labels on coffee cups, there it is.
