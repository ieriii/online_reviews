Talk about hype. My husband and I waited for a special occasion to visit this fairly expensive new restaurant, but we finally broke down and had a date night here. I was expecting some magical for all the hype it's gotten and the prices. We started with the Indo corn fritters and garlic noodles. The Garlic noodles were good and a fair portion, but the indo corn fritters were nothing amazing. I would definitely get the corn cakes from the cheesecake factory over these fried things. I had the long ribs and my husband had some crispy pork thing that the waiter recommended. My long rib was tasty, but there was so much fat on it that I got about 5 bites. And though it was tasty, it was nothing special. The menu didn't state that the pork was deep fried and so it was un-appealingly greasy with little flavor. The waiter was nice, but had offered to buy our drinks if I could name my wine (which my husband had ordered as a surprise). I took one drink and told him exactly what it was. He just stood there dumbfounded and seemed worried about how to get us our drinks gratis the rest of the meal. Finally he said he would comp our dessert (just one to share)...it didn't quite equal the $20 we spent on our drinks. I also had to ask for ice in my water about 5 times because he kept forgetting. Not the service you would expect at such a "nice" restaurant. The decor was probably my favorite part. It was modern and laid back and you could tell there was a lot of thought put into it. Too bad I can't eat the decor. We'll save our money next time and splurge on a place we KNOW serves good food. Sorry Billy Dec.
