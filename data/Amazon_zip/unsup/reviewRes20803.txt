We recently got takeout from XOCO. kind of interesting ordering process, but was worth it in the end. You cannot place phone orders, you need to go to the restaurant and place your order in line. i would say the highlight was the carnitas soup which was delicious!! one other reviewer raved about this soup so we felt like it was worth a try. it was definitely spicey-but not overpowering and the flavors were delicious! we also got one of the sandwiches which were good but not out of this world which is i gave it 4 stars. I'm anxious to try the breakfast here.
