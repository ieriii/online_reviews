Amazing selection of goodies in the salad bar, delicious, refilled bread basket, along with constant re-plate of fried bananas, fried polenta, and mashed potatoes. Meats... so many beef, filet mignon, pork, chicken, lamb and sausage choices along with your choice of rarity (rare, medium, well-done) with beef and lamb. If by any chance you've had Churrascaria (Brazilian steakhouse) in other places/states, Fogo de Chao does not have "interesting choices" such as snake, venison, duck, ham, fish, etc. or grilled pineapples. If you've never had these before, then I guess you won't be missing much. Afterall, we are in the Midwest, aka beef country. The saltiness of the meat can be fought with the sweetness of the fried bananas since they pair very well. Fogo de Chao carries amazing array of wine, some in half-size bottles. I love you Fogo de Chao but get one less star for not having any grilled pineapples!
