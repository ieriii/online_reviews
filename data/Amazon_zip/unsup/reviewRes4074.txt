3.5 stars for the food, 5 stars for the staff. The chefs and wait staff here are all really cool - they make it a fun time for you and there is no stuffyness to the restaurant at all (even though it is near impossible to get reservations here). They play rap and loud music in the background, so this is not the most romantic place either.  The food was just okay. Perhaps I was expecting too much from all the great reviews, but again, my date and I found this place to be unimpressive. The dishes were very creative and plating was unique, but I felt that the creativity went too far at the expense of taste. We had at least 6 or 7 courses, and looking back, I think my favorite dish was the apple pie soup and the butterscotch scallops. I found everything else to just be okay. Dinner will run you $125/pp here for their full prix fixe. Considering how hard it is to get reservations here, you might as well go for it. I don't think I'll be back, and I can't say the food comes with my highest recommendation, but still a decent spot to try out for fun.
