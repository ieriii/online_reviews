All I can say is WHOA. In a nutshell, I was blown away. When I initially reserved my date and time, I made a very small notation that it was my man's birthday. The staff went above and beyond to not only pay attention to this and acknowledge it with him, they gave us a lovely, intimate table in a very busy dining room. The food was all timed really well, the fish and seafood dishes were fresh and well-seasoned, and the the surprise dessert with candle for "my man" just sent it over the top. THANKS AGAIN, Shaw's, for a wonderful dinner and for making my boyfriend's birthday very special for him.
