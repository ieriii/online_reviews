Recommended by one of my local friends as a cool place for cocktails -- I liked the name and the locale, so a perfect fit! Impossible to find if you don't know what you're looking for. But once you pull back the nearly hidden door you entire a quiet oasis of cool cocktails, great service and an overall quality vibe.The drinks were very good (not amazing, but solid), the music was quality (Replacements? Ok!) and the server was helpful and friendly. Not too stuffy like many similar establishments. Definitely a worthwhile stop for an intoxicating evening.
