I heart this place it's never let me down. I have been for breakfast and dinner on multiple occasions. So many great fresh organic things on the menu it's hard to choose.  For breakfast the homemade English Muffin Sandwich is amazing. I really like the pork sausage on the side as well. The service is always super friendly.  The bill I noticed some things I thought were high, but all in all reasonable. The sell paintings and the last time I was there I noticed jewelry for sale.  It's a great hidden gem.  I can't wait to go back.
