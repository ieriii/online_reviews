We heard so much about the deep dish Chicago pizza. So, we went there, waited in line for 45 minutes...The place was crowded with both locals and tourists. We listened to the hostess and ordered a small deep dish and a salad. We ended up having leftover pizza to take home. The dough was too thick for us. Plenty of cheese...The verdict is you should try it but we prefer the regular thin crust pizza.
