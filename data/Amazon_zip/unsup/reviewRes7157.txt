I went here for a girls night out a couple weeks ago and I am trying to fit in a time to go back- asap (for a date night). The lighting is low, staff is very friendly, and tables are spaced very nicely apart.--not too cramped however the space is teeny tiny giving it a really cozy feel. The girls and I ordered a bunch of different things - some of us had entrees, others had salads and everything looked delicious. I wanted to try 90% of the menu. Obviously that wasn't possible, hence the reason I want to go back (asap). I ordered the caprese pasta dish...not sure what it was actually called on the menu. The pasta is made in house and tastes ridiculously fresh. One friend ordered the seafood platter (again not called that on the menu). Seriously, it was like a casserole dish piled high with every form of seafood. It was laughable. I must say one downer was the bread- I wasn't a huge fan, but it was standard Italian bread. They have an extensive wine list low to high, and they will offer recommendations if you find it difficult to decide. All in all a good meal and I can't wait to try more.
