I went to Davanti Enoteca with a food lover friend of mine last night. Though we enjoyed our food( loved the arugula pizza) we will not return due to the inhospitable techo soundtrack that was the main experience of being there. We ate in the outdoor space and asked our waiter to lower the sound level , which he was able to do temporarily but within minutes we were leaning over to try to speak to one another. So sad.
