This is the best Vietnamese food in Chicago. I'm not saying it's the best in the world... the best in Chicago. Which is why I'm giving it five stars. The prices were recently raised a bit but still very reasonable. The Vientamese Crepe (#12 on the menu) is delicious and comes with huge pieces of shrip and the outside is very crispy. Their fish sauce is just like mom makes it and I could eat that over anything! Their pho is decent and warms your belly on a cold Chicago winter day. One of my favorites is their vegetarian curry. It's got a very smooth flavor to it and comes with plenty of lemongrass. The watermelon smoothies are so fresh when they're in season it's like someone hit me over the head with one. I bring my non-vietnamese friends here every chance I get so they can experience the food too and every one of them craves it afterwards. If you come on a Friday or Saturday they'll be playing hip hop music and the rest of the week it's tradition Vietnamese which is quite a mix. And be warned once you enter the restaurant you'll be guaranteed to leave smelling like the restaurant for the rest of the day.
