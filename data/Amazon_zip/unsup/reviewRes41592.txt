Just went last night for my wife's birthday and we will be coming back for our next special occasion. The atmosphere is very cozy. We did the 4 course meal and the stand outs for me were the wisconsin cheese soup (I could have had an entire bowl) and the chocolate cake for dessert (the most gooey, delicious thing I've had to eat all year). Our waiter was very friendly and descriptive regarding the creations on our plate. Overall, we had a wonderful night at Bonsoiree!
