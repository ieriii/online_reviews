This place is a nice find in Chicago. I love Starwood Brands and Sheraton in particular because they allow pets. The rooms are what you would expect. The best thing about the hotel is the location. You can get pretty much anywhere you want to go downtown by walking. Cabbing it is easy too. The hotel has a spacious lobby and a few restaurants if you feel lazy and dont want to leave the premises. The staff were very friendly and it was a breeze to check in and out.
