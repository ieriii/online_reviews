Everything that can be said has already been said about this place, but there are too many harsh critics on here. In my experience the staff is nice, the food is excellent, and the wait isn't too bad if you go at the right time. There are some negatives-- I'm not sure why people think this is a good place to bring a massive stroller, and you will be forced to listen to your neighbors conversation while you eat due to their proximity.  Also, on a few occasions the staff was playing bad dance music so loudly everyone was forced to raise their voice to hear each other. I bet they do it to get people in and out faster, but it seemed like most people didn't even notice it. I've had the pancakes, french toast, burrito, eggs benedict, and a couple other things, but the veggie croissant is the best thing on the menu. Just don't try to order it vegan.
