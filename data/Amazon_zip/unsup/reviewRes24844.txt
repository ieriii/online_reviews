I've been to the restaurant once and I'm not a big fan of Greek food so I'm going to comment on their bakery.... THEY HAVE AN AWESOME MANGO YOGURT MOUSSE CAKE!!! It is so light, just the right amount of sweet and mango-ness. I really do love it. One day when I have time... I will try to recreate this heavenly masterpiece.... Until then, I will buy them from here. I had it for the first time at my friend's birthday party. I loved it so much I told her to buy me one for my birthday!! She also got me a white chocolate mousse cake to try but it is sitting in my fridge right now so I'll get back to you on that one.
