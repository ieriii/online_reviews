Great food!!! Another winner from the creatives behind Mia Francesca's(and other fine eaterys). So great to come home to Chicago, and all it's great food. Also went to the Davanti Enoteca this weekend. Man - Chicago is the home of the food Gods. New York doesn't have anything on us! note: hazelnut sunchoke salad is a masterpiece! among others.
