Giordano's suffers from an incorrect C:C:S ratio (crust:cheese:sauce). Way too much crust. And it's not even real crust, it's like a loaf of bread that's been rolled into a circle and happens to have some toppings on it. If you're the sort of pizza eater who loves eating breadsticks and ripping off the back "wall" of pizza crust so you can dip it in marinara sauce or garlic butter, then you probably enjoy Giordano's a lot. Frankly, I don't understand the appeal. But they do have a good lunch special - $5 for a baby stuffed pizza.
