When you arrive here, you may pass it by (we almost did). The bouncer in front was very friendly, and he escorted us in while telling us about the bar and showing us around. He told us no smoking and no cell phones which was great. We sat at the bar and chatted up the bartenders and watched them mix the drinks. They take their drinks very seriously and both the bartenders and the drinks are excellent. The ice cubes themselves make the trip worth it. The food is very interesting as well. Try the fried peanut butter, banana and bacon sandwich w/ honey. Outstanding! The atmosphere and music was also great. I highly recommend checking this place out.
