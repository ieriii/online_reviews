I had brunch here today, enjoyed the decor, food and service. I wish I would have ordered something more unique though, just pancakes and a smoothie.  Seem to have lots of options as far as protein, crayfish cakes, salmon cakes, crab cakes, shrimp and grits, sausage, black beans, etc.  I enjoyed my pancake, it was pretty standard, I like that you have the option to order real maple syrup. It's far to expensive for any restaurant to offer, the choice for an upcharge is nice. My smoothie was excellent, choice of three fruits no sugar or dairy add. yum! They also have a juicer where you can order fresh juice. I want to come back and try the corncakes, salmon cakes . . .
