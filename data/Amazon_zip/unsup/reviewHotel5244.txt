I spent memorial day WE with some friends at this hotel. Room is great! Service awesome! These guys really work hard to make it feel as good and comfy as home. We ordered some food; room service was right on time and the Breakfast tasted awesome. Forgot a key, no problem got a new one a the front desk in less than a minute. Forgot a light and battery ran out NO Problem, Signed a disclaimer and got a jumpstart in less then 5 minutes. Also had Pizza at Forno!! Delicious!!
