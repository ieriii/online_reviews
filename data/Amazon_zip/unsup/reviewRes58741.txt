Truffle Popcorn, Follipops(?) Yes, sir! May I have some more. The 5 course tasting out of this world. Dishes described in every detail. Server super friendly , kind and wonderful. I left with a warm and fuzzy feeling. Only thing. Some guy, (Micheal?) with a bald head sorta mumbled something about wine to us, seemed really Intense ( read: coked out of his mind) didn't seem to vibe with whole GE thingy, sorta swarmy and car salesman like.
