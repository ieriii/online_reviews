I enjoy Wishbone, but I can't go there very often if I want to still fit into any pants besides sweatpants. Southern food is a 'sometimes' food, just like cookies are for Cookie Monster. I flipped my lid over the black bean corn cakes and their coleslaw. SO GOOD! I even ate everyone else's coleslaw at the table I loved it so much. I love that you can choose from a bunch of delicious sides, and I haven't been disappointed yet! Also the inside is quirky and fun with all of the egg lights and odd murals. I'm glad I have Wishbone so close when I feel like stuffing my face!
