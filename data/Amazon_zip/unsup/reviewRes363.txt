Alinea specializes in molecular gastronomy. If you don't know what that is think, food, performance art, and science. Confused... great keep it that way. I was planning on posting all the details about the meal, but honestly it's better to try it yourself. The price is not cheap but the experience is quite unlike anything you have ever tried (unless you've been to a molecular gastronomy place before). If your curiosity is piqued and money is no object then make that reservation right now. Now for those of you who insist upon a course-by-course review go to: http://tangmeister.com/a (complete with long-winded pretentious comments). The one saving grace is all the pretty pictures.
