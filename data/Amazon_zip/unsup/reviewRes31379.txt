I was glad when I came across the Chicago Diner on a recent trip to Chicago. I'm a fan of vegetarian restaurants that do their own takes on traditional American diner foods and that is exactly what this is. I the food was great the service and prices were good. Next time I'm in Chicago I'll be back.
