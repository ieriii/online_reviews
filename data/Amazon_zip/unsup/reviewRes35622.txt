You definitely don't get the dive restaurant vibe here. A brightly lit open space room makes you feel like you're fine dining on a beer budget. But thankfully the food is still that comfort Chinese food that you crave. Roasted half duck, ribs, beef stew, wonton noodle soup and chinese broccoli with oyster sauce are part of our usual suspects when we eat Chinese food and we didn't stray. Wonton noodle soup hit the spot, the wontons tastes different from any any wontons from Chinatown, i think it's the absence of bamboo shoot or lack of. The duck...my mouth is watering just saying DUCK. When ordering from other restaurants you get a side of the gravy, oily drippings from when they are cooking the duck. You don't get that here, disappointed at first (seeing that I won't be able to raise my cholesterol faster without it) but you don't need it. Every piece was moist and melted in your mouth, even held up well for lunch the next day.  We are bringing at least 2 other friends here soon, under the geist of "we just want to eat with you" but really, I'm using them to have the Peking Duck. hahha.
