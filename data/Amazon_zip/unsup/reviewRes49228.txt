Vino. Cheese. Lots of saucy girl talk. These are a few of my favorite things! Bin 36 provides the perfect setting for some wine therapy. So the room isn't date-night ideal, as the lighting alone eliminates any romantic inclinations. But I liked it. Well-priced flights, wine by the glass and palatable snacks abound. I especially enjoyed my walloping serving of hummus with pita bread-- a steal for $8. Could have easily served two, but then again, it satiated my wine-enhanced appetite nicely. Our server was a bit cheesy (sorry, bad pun not intended) and later became MIA. Or maybe he had grown tired of our shoes/boys/Sarah Palin's hair banter. Definitely more hit than miss. And that 'Sexy Reds' wine flight has my number written all over it. Yesss.
