I've been meaning to write a review about this place so here goes. We had our office christmas party here. They had a private room set up for us which was perfect, the service was awesome, the drinks were great, and the food was spectacular. I had, unknown to me of course, ordered one less vegetarian dish then was needed but Ricardo and his staff took care of that right away. They were very accommodating to those of us with our "special" diets. Everybody had a really good time and Ricardo I can't thank you enough for all your help!
