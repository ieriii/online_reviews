This is not a bad review regarding the food, it is however bad for the manager on duty this evening 8/29/12. I ordered food at 6:35 and at 7:44 called to see where my delivery was.... well the man on the phone said the food just left and it was only ordered 39 minutes ago. You can clearly see that 6:35 to 7:44 is not 39 minutes. When I called back to say that I do not appreciate being lied to the same man on the phone said that is what his Manager told him to tell me. Bad business practice. Will most likely not order from them again. Sad because they do have really good food.
