Got the medallion trio. It melted in my mouth. Some of the best steak I have ever had in my life. My only complaint is that it took awhile for him to take our orders and for the food to come. We sat down at 6:40 and the food didn't come until about 8. I would have given 5 stars if they were a little quicker!
