I really enjoyed my experience here. The ambiance is very playful, decor is eye catching, and the food was great. I had the skirt steak upon other yelp reviewers. It was good, however I think i've had better skirt steak at Mayan Palace or Wholly Frijoles. And the server didn't ask me how I would like it cooked. My friend got the lamb chops which were excellent. We also had ceviche and fresh guacamole as appetizers which were all delightful. I'm not much of a drinker but I had a sip of my friend's raspberry mojito and mango margarita which were both very sweet and tasty. My only gripe might be the service. We had a group of 13 which included the 18% gratuity in the bill. I think our server figured since it was already built in, he wouldn't have to try. However all the bus boys/runners were attentive enough to make up for the slacker server. We also noticed a large round table that would fit 12, if you are going in a group of that size, definitely request that table. Our reservations were for 7:00pm and they seated us promptly as soon as all our guests arrived. On a Sunday at 7pm, it wasn't very busy. The music was at the right level, I could actually hear the person sitting next to me. I definitely recommend this place and am hoping to have another excuse to come back!
