I'll keep it short and sweet - Schwa was 3 hours of mindblowingly amazing food, impeccable service and an eye-opening experience. I can't even tell you everything we ate, but I loved it all. Having the chefs bring the food to your table is an incredible experience. Being able to see the pride and enthusiasm they have for each dish only adds to one's enjoyment of the meal. I can't wait to go back, I feel so lucky to have been able to go hear. The atmosphere is approachable and casual, the food is some of the most complex stuff I've ever seen. To me, that's how it should be.
