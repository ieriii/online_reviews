This place is great. Had the budda bowl and coke along with an order of wings and a bite of friends burrito... Budda bowl was much better than any of the other Asian places around. Wings were great flavor and size but I hate the full wing set up. Eat here. Get a budda bowl. Don't write long reviews....tribune is not going to call you....
