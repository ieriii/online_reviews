If you've never been to Crisp yet you need to haul your asses there ASAP!! Some of the best tasting wings around. Get the Sassy Seoul and you'll be sucking your fingers well after you are done eating. They got big juicy wangs that will fill you up right. Get there early before the dinner rush otherwise you'll be waiting in a long line with no where to sit. That's why I only gave it 4 stars because of the lack of seats. Service is fast and very friendly as well. Giddy up!
