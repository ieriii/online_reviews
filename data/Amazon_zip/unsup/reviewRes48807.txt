Really? Came to Publican after hearing all the hype for brunch on a busy Saturday afternoon, the 5 of us were seated at a semi-awkward corner end of the communal tables, towards the entrance. We all shared and ordered several items off the menu (the omelet, whitefish salad, coffee cake, shrimp and grits...) and nothing worth remembering. Coffee is bottomless and the staff is attentive to refill, which was a nice plus. More of a beer hall cafeteria style place, I think more appropriate for happy hour and/or late night eats. I just don't get it!
