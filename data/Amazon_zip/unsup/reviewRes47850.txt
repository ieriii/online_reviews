It's all true what people are saying about this place. Everything about Zed 451 (including the fabulous rooftop) is absolutely absolutely gorgeous. The wood, the fire, the glass, the stones . . . it's succchhh a beautiful concept, and it all works to create a completely unique dining experience. The harvest table had some delicious items, and the chefs brought out some great complimentary dishes as well. The only thing I wasn't too impressed with were the meats. While they WERE good, I almost feel as if I've had more flavorful varieties at other Brazilian steakhouses. Still, the service was outstanding-- and my friends and I really enjoyed everything about this place. It's definitely pricey . . . but for a special occasion, it's worth it.
