Went here a few weeks back and had a great time. Yes it's small, yes it's cramped and yes the door man probably doesn't give a shit about you but it is a JAZZ CLUB not a roller rink. Who cares if the door guy is rude, you aren't paying cover to hang out with him. He wasn't rude to me or my pals, but that seems to be a common complaint. Beer and drink prices are cheap-fair and they have PBR on tap. Music is good and the cover price depends on the time you show up. After Midnight its usually only $5. Solid place, give it a shot.
