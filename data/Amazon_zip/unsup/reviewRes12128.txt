Pizza was great. Beer was even better...I never thought I would enjoy a good camel toe... Our server Amy was the best. Really cool, helpful, and definitely knows her beer. She gave us some suggestions on what to eat/where to go and made our weekend trip that much better. Ask to sit in her section. She rocks :)
