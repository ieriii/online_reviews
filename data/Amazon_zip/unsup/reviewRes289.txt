Went recently for my boyfriend's birthday. Second time there. First time I had the 25-course dinner. It was a five-hour affair -- I think I got deep-vein thrombosis from sitting there for so long. The problem with the 25-course is that it just gets overwhelming after a while, especially with the wine pairings. After two and half hours you are drunk and jaded and can't believe you are just halfway through. This time we got the 12-course, with wine pairings. It was just perfect.  We sat upstairs in the back room. Big room, but only three tables. The beautiful thing about paying $300/person for dinner is the amount of real estate you get. The food was always interesting, and often fantastic. Service was as polished as can be. And while there is always going to be a certain amount of pretense at a place like this, it seems rather good-natured here and often comes with a wink. This place deserves its high reputation. They do it right.
