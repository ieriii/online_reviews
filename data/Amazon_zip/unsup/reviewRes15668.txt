We came for the 5pm, toddler in tow seating on Cinco de Mayo. Valet was only $5, seating was immediate in a bright, colorful space. The staff was experienced and handy with the crayons and princess oullines for our daughter. Guacamole was very chunky, with a slow moving spiciness. Margarita and mojitos were kind of bland, but serviceable. The ceviche we had (mixto) was really off - which was hard to believe on a Saturday night. Our server replaced it with some braised beef and plantain, which was probably the best thing we tasted. Entrees weren't worth the price and were poorly cooked. I had a skirt steak that was ordered med-rare and arrived straight up rare and sinewy. My wife had the Peruvian chicken that sounded great on paper, but was overcooked and had a fish based sauce that was hard to place. This place is locked securely in the 1990s. Come here for the 1990s. Glad they haven't changed the valet fee since the 90s.
