Mixed feelings about this place. I've had two items here so far, a Cubano and a ropa vieja sandwich. First, the Cubano: one of the best in town, competes with those from the most vaunted Cuban sandwich shops in the city. The problem is, those "most vaunted Cuban sandwich shops" do it just as well for a lot less money. Second, the ropa vieja. It was so stringy and clumpy that it was way too close to its literal namesake. I could not finish it because the clumps of meat were impossible to chew down into swallowable bits.
