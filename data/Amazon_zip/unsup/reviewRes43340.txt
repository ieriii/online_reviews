We ordered the thin crust vegetarian pizza (18 inches - largest). It was completely finished by four people (3 gals and a guy). Since moving to New York, I am a big fan of New York style pizza and not too into the Chicago deep dish. The pizza here was pretty tasty and I liked the brocolli on the veggie pizza... much better than I thought it would be. I hear the deep dish here is really good. We picked up our order but they also deliver. Oh, and you get a free pop with your pizza.
