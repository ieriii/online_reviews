Last weekend I took my family (which included my 1 yr old neice) and sat outside on the patio. The weather was amazing, which added to the beautiful, comfortable atmosphere they've created out back. The service was terrific! attentive, but not overbearing...allowed us to relax and enjoy coursing out the evening. I started off with a delicious and STRONG signature cocktail with Gin, Campari, Vermouth, and a KICK! The Antipasti was delicious and the portions were perfect. I had the orecchiette with spicy sausage which I loved, but my dad's bucatini came away as the fam favorite for the evening. I can't wait to go back! Most italian restaurants leave you feeling full and heavy, but I loved the light and fresh flavors and look forward to going back for another great night on the patio with friends and family (if I can drag them down to the city again soon!) The food and wine prices were reasonable too, so it's not going to break the bank. **I'm back to write yet again a review saying how perfect my evening was there. Went on Friday. Sat at the bar and had a terrific meal with stellar service. Marty the owner was kind and generous and I'm already excited to go back and bring close friends. Terrific in every way.
