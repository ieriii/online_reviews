My best friend hates to fly...She even hates it more when the flight lasts more than two hours. A flight to Chicago for us was about 4. She decided to go around this by booking us on a red-eye out, hoping she could pass out and wake up refreshed in Chicago....Perfect plan, except..... Our plane touched down in Chicago at 5:45am...Most hotels don't let you check in until 3pm. This was going to be interesting. We arrived at Doubletree shortly after and were greeted by the front desk person...Or maybe "greeted" is too generous. I'm pretty sure he kinda just nodded. Hmmm. We asked if there was anyway to check in early but he explained that they were completely booked solid and he didn't have anything available. I asked if we could get a room once people started checking out and he told me, "I don't know, you're going to have to get with the first shift about that" Huh? I don't speak hotel lingo, but I'm no idiot. He basically said, "I don't care, it's not my problem but the next shift might care and want to fix your problem" Whatever. We checked our bags and hit the pavement. Great location....comfy beds....and cookies....Einstein Bagels downstairs with my favorite coffee.....Pluses! I couldn't 4 star this joint because of the busted elevator, or maybe it wasn't busted but there was only one that worked at any given time....took forever.....sardine can style every ride no matter what time of day or night... And of course the douchey night audit guy we met our first morning there...what a miserable little person. If you can avoid this d-bag and get lucky with the elevator, I would recommend this property.
