Nothing stupendous here, folks. Don't buy into the atmosphere. Just because they have glowing wood table tops doesn't mean they have glowingly delicious food. The Sushi is not good enough to make me come back, simply because the environment is awful enough to make the Sushi pale in comparison to---well, almost anything. The place is always super cold (as in brrr) and cold (as in vibes). I don't ever want to dress up to eat Sushi, because frankly, Sushi cravings are probably the most desperate food cravings there are, and that means pajamas.
