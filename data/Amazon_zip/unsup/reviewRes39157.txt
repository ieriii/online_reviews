I came here with a group of 18 after club/bar hopping and our main reason to go there was to get their alcohol. Lol. But of course we ordered and spent over $400 but the food was well worth it. The service was iffy but the food made up for their loss. I couldn't get enough of their little side dishes. I devoured it all. But I did hate how we had to cook the kalbi ourselves, due to the fact that we've been partying all night from 9pm-4am. I think the service was on it's downside because of the time. But I am glad that we had Koreans with us to do the talking because I'm sure it made our service a lot better than it would of been if they weren't there. Lol. But I will be back and I'm sure the food will be as great as it was the first time.
