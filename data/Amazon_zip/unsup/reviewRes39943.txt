I went several times to this place. It's a great ! The food is very delicate. Just to let you know, they receive a one star reward by the "Guide Michelin". But it very casual. The food is great and creative. They have a great wine and beer list. If you don't want to wait a long time, I recommend to go during the week days for the lunch. The Potted Duck Rillettes is gorgeous.
