My 91 year old Aunt loves hot dogs, so when I came to the City to visit her only one place came to mind for lunch, Superdawg! I hadn't been there in 20 years as I don't live close by. But it was awesome! In high school we use to eat and hang out there every weekend, circa 1968. It was great to be back, and our food certainly surpassed my high expectations. So great to have this old landmark which is good as new. Thanks SB!
