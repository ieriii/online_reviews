Gilt bar I used to be a big fan because time after time I could count on you for consistently yummy dishes. Until...my last visit. To the waitress I know have a busy job but just acknowledge my presence & let me know you will be there as soon as you are able. Or when you do show up 20 minutes after we've been seated "sorry to have kept you waiting" and all is cool. Getting a drink in my hand during those 20 min. would have helped too. After that you were great.  I'm not butter phobic but when that's all I can taste in a dish (that I know is tasty b/c I've had it about three times already) my heart begins to break. Then the gnocchi or at least that's what the menu called it. I would call it more of a mashed potatoes formed into small rectangles served in a bowl of oil with some cheese and herbs(too few to tell or taste) on top. Even when something is gross when I'm hungry enough( and I was after the long wait) I will eat it, I could not. Even if executed well (i.e. actual gnocchi and easy on the oil) I don't know how this made it onto the menu. I have sent maybe 2 dishes back in my life and why I didn't send this back is beyond me. Seriously the worst dish I've ever been served. At least you had the lemon meringue on the menu (I don't think this made in house) my all time favorite desert served at Gilt. I know I will come back for desert and maybe dinner too and hope my last experience was due to an off night.
