I have been wanting to try this latest edition to West Rogers Park since they have opened several months ago. Last night, I finally decided to go and give it a try.  From the outside, it looks like another ordinary Asian restaurant. However, once you step inside it looks anything but ordinary. From the contemporary decor to the trendy LED bar to the extremely comfortable furnitures...this place is a classy, ultramodern, hot spot. The food, needless to say, is amazingly delicious. I can only count on one hand of the places I'd like to go to for good Vietnamese cuisine and I can honestly say Saigon Bistro is now on the top of that list. I started off my dinner with an order of the shredded pork spring rolls appetizer and my husband, being a huge chicken wing fan, ordered the Saigon Bistro chicken wings. One word: SCRUMPTIOUS! The spring rolls paired well with the homemade sauce it came with and the chicken wings were fresh and crispy in a bed of their signature sweet and spicy sauce. Judging by how delicious the appetizers were, I knew our main entree would be off the scale - and I was right! We ordered the hot and spicy hot pot. It was large enough to feed a family of 4!  Saigon Bistro - I think I found my new favorite Vietnamese restaurant! Thank you for being so good to my belly! :)
