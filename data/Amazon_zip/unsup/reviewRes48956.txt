A definite downtown "foodie" hot spot. Really enjoyed dinner here last night.  Our waiter was fantastic, very friendley and explained the menu well. The menu is a bit overwhelming and has many things I had never heard of before. But the waiter suggested many things and helped us understand everything. We were not disappointed in the food; the pork rinds were seasoned perfectly, ahi tuna was so fresh and the skirt steak and seasonal vegetables were amazing. I wasn't the biggest fan of the half chicken, because it was hard to eat, but glad I tried it anyway In general, really cool, unique spot -- haven't seen anything like it in Chicago. The decor is simple, yet chic, and the bathrooms are really cool! Food is tasty and encourages you to venture out and try new things. I am excited to go back in the summer for their outdoor seating and try some more of the beers on their extensive list!
