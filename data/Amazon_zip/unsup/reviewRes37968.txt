No one at this staff knows how to smile except the bartenders. I have a long hard job too but i find time to smile. It's possible.  I was dining with a large group who the majority of them loved their meals. My husband had the ham sandwich with the fries. I had the macaroni and french fries. I wasn't feeling to adventurous. Thank goodness for that. This place can't even get fries right. They were HORRIBLE! The spices that they used were disgusting and I LOVE all fries so I was super disappointed. The waitress also forgot to write down our pregnant friend of the groups order. So the super pregnant friend had to watch everyone eat while she waited 1o minutes for her order. I would never go back here unless it was to have a few drinks.
