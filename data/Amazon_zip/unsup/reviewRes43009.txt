I ordered a few pizzas for delivery, they were fast, friendly and the pizzas were awesome. I love their thin crust and it definately brings me back to Brasil. I will definately be ordering from them in the future. I wish they would be open until later, after all...pizza is great late night food...maybe once they become a more solid neighborhood success they'll expand their hours.
