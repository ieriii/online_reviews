Whenever I eat Indian food, I am reminded of one of my dearest friends. She's a picky eater, to say the least. Nevertheless, while in London, she stuck with the crowd when we insisted on Indian food for dinner. When we were served our respective dishes, she turns to me with a horrified look on her face and tells me, "I am going to go home and scream about this into my pillow later." Me? Well, I happen to love Indian food. We did eat it a lot in London, despite any pillow screaming, and I always enjoyed it. So when my coworker suggested we hit up this Indian buffet for lunch one day, I was all about it. I hadn't had it in a long time, so I figured that buffet-style would be a safe bet. India House has a fantastic array of dishes for veggies and for meat-lovers. I tried nearly everything and paired it with the warm naan bread provided at the table. I especially loved the fish and the dish with the cubes of cottage cheese. YUM. And the mango ice cream and milk pastries (they looked like little hot and wet donuts) for dessert? Phenomenal. Even the Diet Coke was extra tasty from the fountain. You know, despite the ensuing food coma and little Indian food baby I had for three subsequent days, I would love to eat this every day for lunch. $15.95 is a terrific deal for the variety provided. The service is just outstanding as well. We had plenty of water, our discarded plates were removed freakishly fast, and we were able to get our check and pay timely (always important for those who have a lunch hour.) And somewhere in a location further south of the loop, I heard someone screaming into her pillow. (Bless her picky little heart.)
