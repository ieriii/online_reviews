I frequent this place fairly often for Sunday brunch. The beignets they start every table off with are delicious and fluffy. They are occasionally permeated with that well known old oil taste but usually they're great.  I generally get the eggs benedict which I love because it comes with thick cuts of tasso ham. They have a few other versions as well for you non-traditional benedict lovers. I think a fried green tomato version is one of them. They have a nice cocktail list as well, featuring liquors like St. Germaine and Pernod and the drinks are good. Not sure that I would venture here for dinner but it will remain a go to for my favorite meal of the week, brunch!
