First of all, my hubby has Never stood in line for something as simple as a hot dog, I on the other hand have spent time keeping the sidewalk warm at Pinks. lol. Hot Dougs was closed the week of July 4th, but opened on Friday. Carlos and I had explored the city while on vacation with a vengeance by the time we were ready to hit O'Hare on Saturday afternoon. The last thing were had time to do was Stand in line for the Greatest encased Meat I have Ever eat ten! Our plane left @ 5 pm, we held up the brick wall for 1 hour before we were face to face with the Jackalope. Too cute! While we were waiting, one of the guys took pity on us and let the kids play in the hose and the adults fill up water bottles, it was a bit toasty outside. Doug, the Boss, could not have been nicer or funnier. He was a bit flustered I believe, b/c there was a local food critic and his family in house. We ordered our lunch, Carlos had the Selma Hayac and I had the foie gras duck dog. I am 44 yo and had never had foie gras before. oooohhhhh yummo! I might have been nervous about the flight but my tummy was a Very happy camper:) We had an order of duck fries, they were good, I Really wanted and did try to taste a difference with regular fries, sadly, I tasted no difference.:( Glad I gave them a shot anyway. Carlos and I always share our meals, his sausage had Actual meat in it! AMAZING!, and HOT just like the name of the dog. The place is small and cozy. Love the paint job too! They even have lawn art, 2 lil old pink piggy's that show map parts of the hog. Wish I had had time to eat other dogs, like Rattlesnake. Swear! LOL Great way to end a Fabulous vacation!! Thanks Doug for the Best line in town!
