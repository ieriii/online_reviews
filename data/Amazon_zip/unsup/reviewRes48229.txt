Was able to go out last min, went to Publican last night because I felt like some small plates and a few brew. The blood sausage was great, eat it while it is still warm, it's soft and melt in your mouth, this is the first time I had a blood sausage that "fresh" I saw matsutake mushroom on the menu, and it is from Washington area, I didn't know they grow them there also, I had always bought them from Canada. Matsutake mushroom has a distinct flavor and it's a Japanese favorite. This is the season for it. It was sauteed with some kind of squash, personally I think the ingredients used and the way it was cook was too overpowering to this delicate mushroom, so it did not quite bring out the true unique flavor of the mushroom. The Japanese usually use the mushroom in a light broth, or cooked with rice. The more simple the better.  The usual mussel and some daily pickle, a few glasses of English Cyder and i was a happy man.
