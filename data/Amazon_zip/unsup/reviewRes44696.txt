First time in Chicago and I wanted the full experience so I figured my first meal would be a deep dish pizza. I head over to Giordano's because it is just around the corner from my hotel. It was a little after 4pm and the place was pretty empty, which is fine with me since I was on my own. From the start the service was subpar. Pretty much didn't care about my presence. I went to order, and one thing I didn't like is that they didn't like is that after 3pm they no longer served individual sized deep dish pizzas. Um great so I had to order a small pizza which could have fed 3 of me. I also ordered a caesar salad since the pizza takes about half an hour to bake. The salad comes out. The dressing is very very watered down. I have never had a caesar taste like that. There really was no flavor whatsoever. As I was waiting I was on my phone looking at facebook and what not since I was by myself, and the waitress walks by, gives me my soda, then goes back to her coworker and talks about me being on facebook. Oh hey yea I'm right here and I can hear you. So I didn't appreciate that. If you are going to talk about me, please do it out of my range of hearing and not less than ten feet away. Pizza comes out, it is a good size for what you are paying. I bite into it, but there really isn't that much flavor. I got sausage and mushroom and it really was just okay. I was barely into my second slice when the check was brought around. I was told to pay whenever so I just put down my credit card and kept eating. Well...she took the credit card and bagged my pizza then came back and took away my plate without asking if I was done. I guess they didn't want me around anymore? That will be the last time I eat there, that is for sure.
