One of my all-time favorites. The beer list is constantly fantastic, I usually find at least 4 or 5 beers on the draft list that I love or want to sample without having to even look at the bottle list. I've tried probably 2/3 of the burgers and haven't had a clunker among them. The Frenchie, El Chupacabra, The Hangover and The Peppered Kraut are probably on the top-tier, while I'd put the Elvis, Big Texan and Black and Blue a level just below. But that's splitting hairs. In terms of appetizers, the cheese curds and poutine are both huge crowd-pleasers. I've heard dining companions praise some of the salads, as well as the porketta and brisket sandwiches, but haven't been able to resist the siren call of their burgers. The fries are also nice, and give a few seasoning options. I'm partial to garlic or truffle. I'm here probably once a month and the service has been excellent every time. Bartenders are happy to beer-geek with you and the servers are all friendly and knowledgeable. One of the best places in the city for a burger and a beer.
