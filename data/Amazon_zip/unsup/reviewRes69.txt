Ate at Alinea the same night at David L. and had the same food with three friends. I agree with most of his review. It is technically on point. I break it down like this for those who don't like reading or know much about $700 a person restaurants... If you eat a lot of truffles, Asian street food, animal hearts, sea urchins, and not-so-everyday fruits and vegetables mixed in a juicer, you may find Alinea enjoyable, but not as inspired as advertised. If you don't, you may be in for a bit of a palate shock. For an extremely expensive restaurant, Alinea delivers. By the end of the meal, I found the $150 basic wine pairing (the reserve pairing was $250) along with its accompanying service to be the bargain and maybe highlight of the meal. For me, things broke down into thirds. About a third of the courses were simply inegnious for creativity in presentation. Winter in New Hampshire, the final dessert, and the Ice dish as the centerpiece were brilliant. Another third were straightforward, but delicious. The mushrooms led this category for me. Finally, all the rest were a mix of lacking in creativity or simply good, but not great. Since each night is different, I am curious if others sense the same kind of breakdown when they eat here. The service at Alinea is excellent, though some of our servers seemed happier to be there than others.
