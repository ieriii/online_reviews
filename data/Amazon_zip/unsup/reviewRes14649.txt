I've been here twice and tried maybe 4 or 5 of their beers. A couple are great, and a couple are sadface. Overall I find them to be weak, some to the point of being downright watery (not in terms of alcohol content per se, but in terms of flavor).  The Bottom Up Wit is really disappointing. It's supposed to be a Belgian-style wheat, but it tastes like watered down lemonade and looks like piss. Way too much citrus, not enough BEER. Everybody's trying to be Blue Moon, and say what you will about popular mass-produced conglomerate beers, but at least Coors actually makes an enjoyable product in Blue Moon.  The Working Woman Brown Ale is utter crap. It tastes like weak funky water. As a working woman, I'm insulted. And shame on you, waitress, for recommending this abomination! HOWEVER, the Anti-Hero IPA and the Eugene Porter are both really good. The IPA doesn't actually taste like an IPA, more like a regular pale ale, but whatever's clever, it's good. The Porter is nice and smooth and has great chocolate/coffee tones.  It's a fun space, although they need to turn down the lighting earlier. I went for a first date at 9pm and it was still bright as shit in there. Hello, do a girl a solid and bathe me in flaw-minimizing glow, not raw honesty! They finally dimmed the lights at like 9:45. Just be aware, this place is lousy with hipsters and young families (!). Doesn't really bother me, but if you're looking for a gritty post-Soviet working man's bar, this isn't it (despite the theme of the bar and and the names of their beers). I haven't had much food here, but I did try a bit of the polenta fries, and they were pretty good (don't know why they're calling them fries, since they're like the shape of fish sticks, but still, good). The tomato aioli is great.  I suppose I really feel more like a 2.5 about this place, but I would come back, so I guess 3 for now.
