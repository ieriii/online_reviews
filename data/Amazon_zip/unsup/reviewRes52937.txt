I was there recently for dinner with my friend for a business event - party and the music was so loud I could not hear my friend talk - from across the table , . as far as food - it was awful - the so called beef was way overcooked , no flavor - it was not suitable for human consumption , also there was some plastic, or bones on which I chocked and nearly died terrible cocky attitude , also the bathroom close to kitchen very hot temp !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! will not go there again
