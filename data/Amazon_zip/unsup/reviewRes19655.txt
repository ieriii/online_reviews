OMG!!! The food is to die for. Ok, maybe not, but I've never tasted anything so phenomenal than Rick Bayless' tortas and caldos. We ordered the Ahodaga and Pibil Tortas and Seafood Caldos. The Ahodaga torta was delicious! The meat was tender and flavorful. On the other hand, the Pibil was tasty, but it was too salty (suckling pig). Ahodaga was even recommended by the cashier... The seafood caldos was very flavorful and tasty. It's good if you love seafood because there was A LOT of mussels, shrimp, chunks of catfish. The churros are tasty, but over-priced for what you get. They taste the best when they're warm (so get it after the meal...pre-pay and get a ticket for pick-up).  The restaurant itself is small because you're ordering "street food." So if you go during peak times, expect to wait 45 minutes in line so you can place an order and ensure seats for yourself in the dining room area. The wait was worthwhile.
