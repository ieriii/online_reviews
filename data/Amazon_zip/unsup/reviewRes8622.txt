Best pizza I've ever had in life! We had the Bufalina pizza with fresh tomatoes, basil, mozzarella di bufala, and olive oil. I've never tasted cheese on a pizza that was THIS special, and pizza dough baked to perfection. It was pure amazingness. We also had the zuppa fritte that was on special as the appetizer (zucchini fritters) and it was served over the most delicious chunky marinara. They have a good, inexpensive wine selection so you can have a nice table wine with your pizza. This place is divine...I wish it weren't so far from downtown.
