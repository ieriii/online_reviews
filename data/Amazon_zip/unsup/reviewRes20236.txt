I tried Coast as I was in the neighborhood and had been to their South Loop location (which is much better than the original!). I have to say I was pretty disappointed with Coast. My wife and I sat at the sushi bar which, and I just moved here from LA but doesn't that imply that I want to order from and speak to the sushi chef in front of me versus ordering everything from a waiter or waitress? Anyway, the food was ok, the hamachi sashimi with ponzu and jalapeno (I call it the Nobu knockoff which every restaurant seems to be serving now!) was pretty solid but the fish was just ok, if not a little dry. I don't think I'd go back but would definitely try South Coast again.
