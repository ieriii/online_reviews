Ignore the negative scores, those "people" can't write a sentence with any logical conclusion.I stayed there via Hotwire for $80/night on the 11th floor and had a very modern, comfrotable/spacious room with two beds. Yeah, there's noise. you're in Chicago, not Ames Iowa.I'm not sure about charging $250/night...not worth that much, but Hotwire really pulls through with the best deals.Conclusion: If you like older hotels with some character/charm, then this Hotel on Michigan Avenue will satisfy that indulgence.
