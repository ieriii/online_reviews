Hmmmm, OK. There isn't too much in White Sox Land so Cobblestones gets props for BEING there. Nothing too special. The menu has this odd Italian theme that doesn't mix well with a smoky, "you should only order beer here or you'll get laughed at" bar. I want nachos NOT bruschetta with my Millers. My grilled chicken and mozzarella sandwich was about as exciting as the Sox v Sox game that night (The Red Sox won 10 to 1).  Another thing to note: Worst. Juke Box. Ever. The song selection was sour and when you finally DID make some selections, you couldn't hear them. Not at all. At least the waitress, who recommended almost everything on the menu, encouragingly showed a true allegiance to her bar.  As others have noted, it is pretty cool that you can park at Cobblestones for White Sox games but for the love of Skippy, why would you drive to "The Cell" (or whatever you kids are calling it these days)? If you JUST want beers, not a bad place to gas a few before the game. Just remember to EAT in Wrigleyville and then jump on the Red Line - you're much better off.
