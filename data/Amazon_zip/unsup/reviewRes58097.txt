This is the best and most authentic chinese restaurant in chicago and maybe the best in the midwest. I've had sze chuan food from hundreds of different places all over the country and this food is phenomenal. I recomend the lunch special and anything with a pepper next to it. The dishes I had most recently were **TONY'S SPECIAL CHICKEN W/THREE CHILI** and **LAMB W/PURE CUMIN POWDER XING JANG STYLE** (They are all good though.) Don't be a typical american and order orange chicken (but even if you do it will be fantastic.) I try to eat at this place at LEAST once a month and this month I've already been twice.
