For those of you that think Bongo Room is worth waiting 3 hours to be seated, this review is not for you. I used to go to Bongo Room but it's just not worth the wait. Instead, try Milk and Honey. The food is just as good and the menu is more extensive and changes almost daily. Everything here tastes like it is local and fresh and you never have a long wait to get in. This is hands down my favorite brunch spot in wicker park.
