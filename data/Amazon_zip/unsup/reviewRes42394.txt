Amazing. The most perfect slice of deep dish I've ever had. And I've tried hundreds of pizza places. There is something about the way the crust is flaky but still kind of melts in your mouth. And serving it on a plate within the restaurant is a nice touch. And it was cheap. In some ways it was a slightly gooier version of Lou's butter crust pizza for those looking for a comparison point. The Lou's may taste "butterier." My only beef is that they didn't have a way to give me a receipt without handwriting it. But a place that hits on pizza this well can have whatever quirks it wants.
