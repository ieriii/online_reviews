I hated this joint at first smell. To be honest I thought that it would be awful when I first heard the idea behind the place, a Kuma knock-off with a prison twist. I only came here because a friend of mind told me that we were going and I do what she tells me to do, it is also within stumbling distance home. When you come here (it has happened both times now) you are greeted by a godawful smell, a dirty old mop and backed up sewer smell. Once you get past that and can focus on your surrounds again, they look kinda cool, kinda. Seating is easy and servers welcomes you quickly. The menu is a puzzle, hard to tell if it is a joke or not. It might be written by an esl student or someone not as clever as they think, I couldn't tell. Food is hit or miss, on my first visit 100% misses, second visit, fifty fifty or maybe a little better. The low prices almost make up for the poor food. Drinks are ok, average selections but good prices on the specials. Nice enough servers, and they are attentive, at least the couple that I met were. The vibe? I dunno, lots of inked up kids, but also lots of clean Ukie kids trying hard to fit in, kindof a nice mix really. Loud music, but lots of it is good. Dark, but not cave dark. There is a fog machine, so it's as cool as the eighties when they turn it on. I think that this place is still growing into it's skin, so I will try it one more time.
