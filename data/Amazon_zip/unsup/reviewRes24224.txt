I give it five stars simply for their vegetarian salad. It's a simple, yet delicious mix of cabbage slaw, beets, avocado, cilantro, tomato, radishes and topped with lime juice, vinegar and olive oil. It is SOOOOO good! Also, they have great shakes. My favorite is their oatmeal shake, which is earthy and filling. A final compliment goes out to their stock of Lizano sauce. Lizano is a great sauce that is kind of like a Costa Rican A1. I've had a hard time finding it in the states and they are very generous with their Lizano at Irazu. The place itself isn't much, it's actually kind of dumpy. A great place, however, for a casual BYOB meal or take out.
