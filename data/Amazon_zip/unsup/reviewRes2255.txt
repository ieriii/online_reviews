This place is one of the gem's in Chicago. Don't let the long line outside intimidate you....it's worth the wait and Doug is always up front ready to take your order. If you're visiting Chicago you definitely want to make a stop at this place. If you're from Chicago then I'm sure you already know what I'm talking about.
