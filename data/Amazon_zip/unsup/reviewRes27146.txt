Awesome restaurant! Delicious! I always get the enchiladas suizas with mole sauce. It is to die for. The atmosphere is comical but comforting and the salsa and chips they give you give the experience a nice flair. Also, the soup they give you once you sit down...very good touch. With all of these little flairs, it makes my experience very worthwhile. The steak tacos are pretty great too! I am not a fan of refried beans..but I can eat their refried beans all day. Seriously. Downside: no credit cards. So, stop by the ATM before you come by. Also, do not sit in the back dining room...it smells like the bathroom...and I definitely do not like smelling a toilet as I eat.
