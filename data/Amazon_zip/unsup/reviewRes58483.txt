I lost respect for the Travel Channels 101 Tastiest. I drove 8 miles out of my way to try this dawg and wasted gas. It's not worth the time or effort. Pull into any hot dog stand and get the same thing or better with more options and better service. Service sucked. Black lady at walk up window did not say hi, bye or kma. I thanked her for taking my money! Don't waste your time on this one.
