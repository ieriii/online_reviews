I made it to this place for the first time last night and really loved it. Not a ton to add to what others said, but the food was all really great, if not perfect, somehwat experimental. Amazing price for what you get. I have heard some buzz on people who said it wasn't enough food, but they must be crazy. I wasn't stuff as I have been after doing other tasting menus but was not the least bit hungry! We did the five course for two of us, and had a duck wonton, then scallop sashimi in ponzu, then braised oxtail, then a daikon and cucumber salad, then quail, then a dessert sampler. the salad was the only part that was pretty ho-hum. I can't wait to go back and see what they do for me next time.
