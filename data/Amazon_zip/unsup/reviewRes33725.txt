This Mia Francesca is one of my favorite restaurants because of the great food and service. Pros: Excellent food (my favorites are the bruschetta with goat cheese and argula and pasta with vegetables in herb broth). Good prices and attentive wait staff. In the summer, try out the back patio. Cons: This location packs you in like sardines. Definitely an authentic urban restaurant experience but for more privacy try the one on Bryn Mawr. Equally good food and service.
