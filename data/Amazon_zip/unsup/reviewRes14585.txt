I've been a Sabatino's customer since I was really young, like 6 or 7 years old, young. I'm now 34 & still think going there to have dinner is a treat. And still love watching the waiter debone the Dover Sole, which is DELICIOUS, by the way. I'm not going to list all of the tasty dishes, like do in most of my restaurant reviews, because there's too many & I'd be here all day. I will say that the Dover Sole is a must try, if it's your first time visiting & you like fish. Otherwise, try anything & you won't be disappointed. They really have wonderful menu.
