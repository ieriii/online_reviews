salted roasted beets w/goat cheese = a little heavier than i would've likedoctopus with fingerlings and green beens = super good and delishscallop spiedini = seared to perfection.... def recommendopen face blt= unique and full of flavor, loved thisbraised shoulder = great concept and flavor, but a little on the salty side.pork neck bone gravy w/ricotta = tastes good, but nothing special. just seemed like a heavy tomato sauce with a kick.all in all, i liked it - it was good service, good atmosphere, unique in it's own way, and the food was overall tasty and hearty. I will say that it was a little bit on the heavy and saltier side... but it's kinda expected if you're going that specialized in pork! My only complaint was that it was a bit difficult to find from Michigan Avenue.
