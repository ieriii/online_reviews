indie used to be a reliable favorite---though delivery times were always inconsistent, ranging from super short to super long, the green curry, edamame and gom-e were excellent. not sure if they've gotten too busy of late, or maybe our honeymoon phase is just over, but lately the food has been kind of hit or miss (especially the gom-e). come on indie, why can't it be like it was when we first met?
