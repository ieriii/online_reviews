We went here for a late breakfast and will want to come back and try the seafood. It's a small place with a few tables and space at a counter. We sat at the counter and avoided waiting for a table.  An extensive lunch/dinner menu includes sandwiches and breakfast "stuff" such as omelets and other egg items, cereals, pancakes, etc. Blackboards on each wall announce the seafood and dinner selections. We were promptly served by a friendly, efficient wait staff. As indicated above, we want to go back and try the seafood.
