You can't beat Wishbone on Lincoln for great comfort food at reasonable prices. My wife and I are always searching for new and interesting restaurants, but we always come back to Wishbone. We love the Tilapia with a glass or two of white wine. The blackened chicken is great. Also the Hoppin' John and Hoppin' Jack (rice and bean dishes). Their omelets are the best for lunch, dinner, or brunch. The service is usually good, but sit in the back room if you don't want to be in the midst of a lot of kids. Or should I say that the front room is kid-friendly? Wishbone is a Lakeview standby!
