Mmmm, Pequod's. Probably my third favorite Chicago pizza, behind Due's and Malnati's (back off you Giordano's weirdos!). I think I actually like the location in Morton Grove better, for the divey ambiance, but the pizza is killer at either location. As many, many others have said, the crust is amazingly caramelized and crispy. They don't dump a ton of cheese on the pizza, so you can actually taste the sauce and crust. A must try!
