I'm completely in love with this restaurant. If you look for the definition of "authentic" in a dictionary (or in this era, on http://dictionary.com), "Spacca Napoli" will be it.  When I walked in, I was hit with the smell of my grandmother's house. No, the smell does not consist of mothballs, vagina, or other old people smells. I'm talking about my Sicilian grandma here, people! That's right, the grandma who cooks homemade pasta, meatballs, and tomato sauce 24/7. Basically, I smelled homemade sauce, herbs, and other yummy Italian ingredients when I opened the door. The place was moderately crowded, but I still had to wait in the front until my friends arrived. Because I was waiting on a very hot day, the host (the owner, perhaps?) gave me a tall cold glass of water. He was unbelievably nice (and strongly resembled one of my cousins in Italy.) My friends and I were impressed with how knowledgeable the waitress was. The whole menu was in Italian, but the waitress didn't seem annoyed at all when my friend asked her to translate everything.  The pizza was DELICIOUS! Just like the pizza in Italy! I second everyone else's comments on how moist and fresh the mozzarella is. I strongly recommend the Tiramisu, because it's the best I've ever had.
