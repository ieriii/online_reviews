This was my second time at gilt. I hadn't been since close to when they first opened. Unfortunately I remember it being better. Maybe we just had an off night, but it definitely didn't have me excited to come back. First thing that was weird and a tiny bit off-putting was that when I asked about the $4 table wine highlighted (in very large letters, mind you) on the menu, our server disgustedly said, "eghh, it's just some cheap wine. Like two-buck chuck. I wouldn't order it." while I appreciate the honesty, I was just interested in what it was. And also, why is it on your menu if you're so disgusted by it? Needless to say I didn't order it. Next out to our table was the steak tartare. When it arrived, we went to break the slow poached egg and realized that there was no breaking to do. The egg was cooked through to a gummy-ish state. When we asked our server if that was how they intended it, she said "ya, it's slow poached". ??? But she agreed to take it back to the kitchen. When our new one came out, the egg was already broken and actually looked like they had whipped it for a bit. Really odd. At this point, we just ate it. The pot roast, I will say, was really great. Perfectly tender and delicious. The bolognese pappardelle was also really good. Nice flavors and delish. Overall, I think we just maybe had a weird, off night. So even though I wouldn't necessarily recommend gilt bar to someone, I'm sure most people will have an enjoyable time. PS: love the interior design. So nice.
