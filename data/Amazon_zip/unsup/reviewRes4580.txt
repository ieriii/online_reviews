As nearly all the other reviews indicate, the food is amazing. I especially enjoyed the pork shoulder, the salt roasted beets and the scallop dish. The only negative part of my experience was the service. One of the servers knocked a full glass of water in the lap of someone eating with me. It was an accident that could happen to anyone. That was not the negative part. I was shocked by our waiter's response of "bummer". He didn't offer to get extra napkins or help in any way. He was happy to watch us clean up. Despite the poor service, it was still a great meal. I will definitely go back when I am in Chicago.
