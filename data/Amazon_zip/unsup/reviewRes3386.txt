I've been looking for Korean style fried chicken so I checked this place out and guess what? they got it down. Its counter-service with orange lunch trays and rolls of paper towels on communal picnic table seating to match. The food is made to order and fresh. I had the seoul sassy fried chicken and it took my back to korean diner days post karaoke in k-town down in ATL. The sauce was spicy and a little sweet and the chicken crispy and moist. Korean comfort food in Americanized packaging for everyone/anyone-consumption. Well done, although I find the renaming them into clever english phrases is a little too cheesy for my tastes. If you're looking for authenticity and traditional korean food this isn't the place. There are plenty of great korean restaurants further north on Lincoln or Lawrence. This is strictly Korean diner food for the American palette. I'd stick with the chicken.
