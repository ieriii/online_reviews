Rick Bayless is the man who has introduced Mexican food which isn't a taco to the US. I've seen him on the American TV show Top Chef myself and my 3 amigos are very much looking forward to trying his food. We head for brunch on a Saturday morning. Chicago is certainly my kind of town. We're there a little early, it doesn't open til half ten and have a quick coffee in Starbucks. When we get back a healthy que has already formed. Once we get into the restaurant we are hit with a lively, happy and warm atmosphere. The colours on the wall are all sandy light browns with Mexican paraphernalia dotted around. Our waiter is wonderful and friendly and we are brought to our table at the corner of the restaurant. The menu has lots of options; snacks, guacamole, soups, salads, tacos, enchiladas and specials. We order the Tostaditas to share for starters, tasty home made warm tortilla chips which come with beautiful dips. I eye one of the specials for my main: Sapitos, a trio of Xalapa-style gorditas (corn masa cakes) in chipotle-black bean sauce each with its own topping: scrambled eggs, grilled chicken, chorizo, plantains; homemade crema & queso fresco. My girlfriend coozes over the sound of the Hot Cakes; corn pancakes with whipped goats cheese that comes with bacon and eggs. She also orders the home made lemonade which is spikey! My dish is beautiful; each component of the food melds together and isn't too heavy. Reagan's hot cakes are also delicious with ample slices of bacon. I wash this down with a surprisingly unspectacular coffee. Brunch for four comes to $90, for such a well known prestigious chef with such excellent food I find this excellent value. And there is nothing pretentious about Frontera, it's atmosphere is of an enjoyable, happy restaurant and is in no way stiff or formal, the food is the star, pure quality. I will certainly think differently about Mexican food. All in all a great experience.
