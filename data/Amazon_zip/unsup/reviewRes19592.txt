I originally tracked this place down for their Volcano - some of the staff from what used to be Sushido went to Coast. The food is good but for the price, there's not much differentiating them from other sushi restaurants. If you're new to this place, their Volcano and toro is highly recommended. This is a nice place to bring a group of friends since it's a BYOB. Make sure you make reservations (high traffic) and also bring a flash light - you'll need it to read the menu and navigate to the washrooms since this place is PITCH BLACK.
