LOVE this restaurant! It's my favorite Brazilian Steakhouse, and I've recommended it to my Californian friends in case they ever come out to Chicago. Service and food are excellent! Don't fill up on the salad bar because the best part of the meal happens at your table. Make sure you eat something small or don't eat at all before dining here. You could easily gain 5 lbs. after your meal. You can stay for as long as you want, and they'll keep the sides and meat coming to your table. The only bummer is you can't take home your leftovers. We had plenty of sides left on our table and the servers cleared them out without hesitation. I wonder if untouched leftover food ever get donated to the hungry. It's about $50/person, but it's worth every buck you spend.
