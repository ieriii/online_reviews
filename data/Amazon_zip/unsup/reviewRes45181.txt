I honestly don't know why anyone wouldn't give this restaurant 5 stars - well, I guess I could imagine... but I'll say that not only have I never had a bad experience eating here, everyone with whom I'm dining almost always starts lavishing praise once the food arrives. I think this is partly due to the fact that the food is described on the menu pretty plainly, but arrives with such delicacy and such abundance of flavor. Here's my personal catch - I'm a vegetarian and although they don't have too many vegi options, I just don't care, because whatever they're serving has always been just delicious. As usual, I can't testify to the quality of the meat dishes, but if my usual company is any consideration, I'd say its probably equally delicious. I'll let y'all know if this restaurant ever surprises me with a bad meal.
