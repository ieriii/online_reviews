This was an awesome experience. I enjoy the small plate concept, and it's really fun with Italian food, especially with such creative Italian dishes. We started with the roasted corn salad and the truffle egg toast. After those two plates we had the Pizza della Fattoria (egg, pork belly, potatio, scallion, asiago, and bechamel) and the risotto carbonara. With all that, we drank a bottle of the Aglianico, and we finished it all off with the chocolate-hazelnut creation. All this, before tip, set us back $78, and it was certainly plenty of food. I can't say that I've had an Italian meal quite like this one, and I've eaten a lot of Italian food in my lifetime. We went on Wednesday night at around 6 PM, and we had no wait at all.
