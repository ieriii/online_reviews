While I try to love this restaurant, I think they have far too many rules and expectations of their diners. Who the hell goes to a restaurant's website to check the "RULES". I had the most ridiculous interaction with Mark a while back based on one of their rules...I am somewhat over it. I do think it was in poor taste to bring in your own cake without calling first, and I also think their rather bitchy commentary on yelp over the scenario was a bit over the top. Everyone's a critic and most feel so entitled to let their mindless drool spill out of their mouths, especially a bunch of twits. WhatEV's!!! The girls look like they might be better suited to have their parties at "I've Been to a Marvelous Party" over in the "village". I think you can bring your own everything there.Peacep.s. the fried chicken is awfully tasty
