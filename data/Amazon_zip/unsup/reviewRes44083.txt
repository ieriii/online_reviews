A great steak deserves a great baked potato. In fact, a merely good steak deserves a great baked potato. It's far, far easier to produce a perfect baked potato every time than it is to produce a great steak. So why the lousy bakers at Kinzie, and so many other steakhouses? In fact, all the sides at Kinzie need a re-boot. The creamed spinach was watery, the bread was bland and doughy, and the tater was lumpy, undercooked, underbuttered, and flavorless. My bone-in ribeye had good flavor, was a cooked a little under spec, and had a few gristly zones that were hard to work around. So it matched its home--Kinzie is a mixed bag on nearly every count. Atmosphere was pleasant and tries for clubbiness but achieves bland artificiality. Service was extra-friendly but not so attentive. They have a decent by-the-glass winelist with very generous mini-carafe pours that really yield two glasses, but the wines themselves are a little uninspired. So, in the end, for me, there's nothing to bring me back to Kinzie, but it's not bad enough to wave you frantically away.
