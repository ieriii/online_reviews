My first experience with Irazu matched the hype. Service seems great. I ordered from them and my food arrived 40 minutes before it was supposed to.  I will certainly be returning to eat in house, and can only imagine the Pepito sandwich tasting even better "fresh." It was one of the best sandwiches I have had in a while - sweet with a hint of spiciness. The meet was tender and well seasoned. As most reviewers have said, the oatmeal shake is really tasty. For those who enjoy horchata and/or oatmeal cookies, I would highly recommend it.  The chips were standard, but I'm sure they come free if you dine in. I am very pleased with my meal, and look forward to returning with friends for the supposedly great vibe. The food will be worth the wait.
