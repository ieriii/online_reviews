I may not be fit to review this place as I have been pronoucing the name incorrectly for a year now. To make things worse, I go around either correcting or teaching people the "correct" pronunciation. So feel free to dismiss this review and move on. As of now, I've tried the Xoco salad, which is one of my favorites and several of the caldo. I'm a sucker for soup, so I'm determined to try all the caldo before trying the tortas. The pork belly vermicelle was excellent; good mix of texture in the bowl. The Wood-Roasted Chicken Pozole was good, but a bit too salty. The Carnitas was flavorful, but again salty. Their bean-to-cup hot chocolate was disgusting. Some people loved it, but I hated it. It's not your typical hot chocolate.  I'm giving it a 3 stars for the long waits and congested space. The only reason I endure it is for the love of good food, which Xoco offers. Perhaps after trying the tortas, I will increase the rating to 4 stars...maybe.
