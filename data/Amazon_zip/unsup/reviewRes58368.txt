I was disturbed by the rather large piece of art in the back dining area that said I hate girls I was disappointed first because it was lame. It had no compelling aesthetic merit. The artistic statement did not point to wanting to engage in any conversation that would maybe, maybe redeem the statement. It just left me sad and was a reminder of how women and girls can continue to be maligned even in unexpected places. Enter in other groups of people oppressed in the phrase I hate_____ and it would be far more unacceptable. It made looking at the hipster waiters walking around in their levis and expensive plaid shirts all the more unbearable. so cliche and disappointing.
