I think I was expecting a lot more from this place. Service was fine but I was not too impressed with the food. Although I did like the beets with goat cheese, the pig ears were nothing to rave about. They were pretty much very thin slices with an egg on top. I must not have read that in the description otherwise I wouldn't have ordered it, I really was expecting to see larger pieces. We had a few other plates but nothing that stood out.
