Amazing. This place doesn't need a long review. I've only tried a few of the brunch items because every time I go back I crave them again - the breakfast burrito, breakfast sandwich, and some sort of egg thing I can't remember off the top of my head....super helpful I'm sure.However, my best advice is to go with a group of three of four and put good judgment aside for the 5 minutes it takes to order a ridiculous dessert pancake at the end of your meal. We ordered some white chocolate, peanut butter insanity. I still salivate a little when I think about it...
