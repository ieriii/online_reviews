My husband and I went to dinner here last week on a weeknight. I was impressed with the business which means word is getting out about this neighborhood gem. The miso soup is tasty. We shared the egg rolls- delish. I had the sweet potato maki roll. I love it and continue to get it every time we dine here. I wish Indie Cafe was closer as we live in the West Loop/River West neighborhood. The service is always good, the food is consistent and the price point is perfect for budgeters.
