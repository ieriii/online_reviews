If I could rate the fries alone it would be 5 stars for sure. They were delicious. Hand-cut fries in a variety of styles. We ordered the truffle fries and garlic fries, both were fantastic. Our burgers got mixed up in terms of how we wanted them cooked. Hopefully just a glitch considering they've only been open a few days. The bacon on my burger was quite overcooked though, to the point it no longer had any flavor resembling bacon. And I like pretty crispy bacon, and it was way too overdone for me, so that was a little disappointing. Otherwise a pretty tasty burger. I'd go back for the fries alone, and to try the Poutine next time, which sounds amazing. I went back and forth between 3 and 4 stars so hopefully I'll get a chance to go back and update with a better review.
