With an extensive whiskey list and a menu full of delicious calorie laden meaty treats....this is no place for pussies. Seriously....do not bring your salad...dressing on the side please...glass of water with lemon date here.....you will be sad....she will be mad....and you will not get laid. Came here last Saturday with bf......smaller than I had imagined....not a ton of room for chillin' at the bar slingin' back bourbon and the front dining area is a little cramped but I loved the dark woody-ness and warm pub vibe....AND can I just say how incredibly friendly every single person that I dealt with was?? I know some of the other Yelpers have griped about the service and lack of niceness but we got the warmest reception from the host, the server in the bar, the bartender and our waiter....I don't know....maybe they had a whiskey tasting before the shift that night....or maybe we just inspire friendliness.....but everyone was super cool, engaging and nice nice nice....makes me smile just thinking about it :) So we had to wait about 30 min for a table...no biggie we pony-ed up to the bar and had a beer or two from their equally extensive beer list....me, matilda....he, piraat....both yum! On to the food....so silly me had eaten a late lunch and I wasn't super hungry (so pissed at myself).....bf was nice enough (even though he was totally drooling over everything meaty thing on the menu) to spilt with me. We got: The Pretzel Roll : really good...dipping sauce was phenom....buttery, cheesy delicious....I actually thought about it today and how good it would be on just about everything. White Asparagus & Rhubarb salad with Egg: Good....nice play with the tartness of the rhubarb with the creamy joozy-ness of the egg.....but I wanted more from this dish.....maybe bigger or more asparagus....it just needed something else Beef Tenderloin: God this was damn good and it was at this point I wished I hadn't decided to split with bf....meat was tender and juicy, cooked to a perfect medium....served with morels (my f-ing fav!!) and some other things I don't remember but that were delicious.....we cleaned that plate up!! I am dying to come back for another round and this time I plan on bringing my Man-appatite with me.....
