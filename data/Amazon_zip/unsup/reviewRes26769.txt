I loved some aspects and liked others, but overall I was impressed the this place! In comparing Graham Elliot to other fine dining restaurants I have been to, I thought it rated high. The loves: -The fancy yet relaxed feel of the restaurant. The decor is clean and modern, the servers wear jackets and ties with jeans(nice, yet approachable) and the music provides a great vibe. I really dug the overall feel of this place! -The flavor combinations were excellent. Everything was unique, well thought out and tasted great! There were definitely stand outs (my personal favorite was the cheese course - it was a cheese ice cream with peanuts and some sort of sweet sauce reminiscent of PB&J that was the perfect combination of sweet and savory) The likes: -I liked leaving feeling not overly stuffed. I didn't leave hungry, but I definitely would have had we went with less courses. I honestly don't know how someone could be full with only 5 of their courses because each dish has TINY portions (like 1-2 bites each). This was perfect for a 15 course meal like we had, but I would most definitely have left disappointed with less. -The cocktails were unique, strong and there were many to choose from. I loved the apples and oranges cocktail, but liked the other 2 I got. We didn't do the wine pairing (the server explained that we probably should get cocktails in addition the wine pairing if we wanted to do the wine pairing, because we you only get one glass of wine every few courses which made us decide to save the money and stick with just the cocktails). -While the price is high, the food was very good - I felt it was worth the money.
