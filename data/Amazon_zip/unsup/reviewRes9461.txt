French Vietnamese fine dining? What?! I was intrigued, so I was thrilled to find out the in-laws wanted to take me here for my birthday a few weeks ago. The decor is nice. Great for a romantic dinner if you're trying to impress a lady friend. All of the appetizers we had were really, really good. For dinner, I had the bouillabaisse. It. was. gooooooooood. Mouthwatering good. There were huge shrimp, lots of fish, lobster, scallops, mussels ... all in a coconut saffron broth. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. I can see why Le Colonial is always hanging on in OpenTable's best lists. I was impressed and would love to go back sometime.
