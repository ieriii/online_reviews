3.5 stars -- This is a nicely renovated hotel located in a pretty accessible part of downtown Chicago. Good business hotel, and perfect for our Lollapalooza weekend due to its proximity to Grant Park. The service staff are all professional and friendly. Two points to note: 1. I partied all night on my last night there and went to sleep at 730am - asked for a 1030 wake up call. They called twice, and of course I didn't hear the phone.. and because I didn't pick up, they sent someone to knock on the door and wake us up. That's service. 2. My friend B dropped his wallet at the entrance when he left for the airport before us, and they immediately tracked back to which room he stayed in.. called us, and told us to let him know asap. Good thinking guys! The reason I'm only giving it 3.5 stars is because I noticed that the bathroom wasn't cleaned that impeccably for a place that costs $300 a night. The towels were replaced and all, but the floor wasn't swept and the T.P. was almost not replaced in time. So that was the only bad thing. OH.. and they don't have a swimming pool. That's kind of a bummer. Internet also costs $15 but that's generally how it is with fancier hotels. AND.. they forgot to replace the tea bags that we used. Oh well!
