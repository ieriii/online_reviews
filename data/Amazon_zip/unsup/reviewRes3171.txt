I had to see what all the hype was about at this place. We ordered the half chicken special with the sassy sauce, with the sides of kimchee and fries. The chicken was fried to a nice golden brown color, but the meat was still moist and tender on the inside. The sauce was okay, the taste and flavors was very ordinary in my opinion. I grew up eating these spices and flavors so it was no shocker. Overall it was a decent meal, but I would not make any special trips just to come here.
