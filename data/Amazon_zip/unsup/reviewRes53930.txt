Was just in Chicago on business and pleasure. My cuz drove up from Indy on Friday so we could spend time together in the big city and have a little girl time. We had no plan - just wanted a great meal, great wine, a great experience for a great price. The Purple Pig offered all that. When we arrived, the host staff told us they were on a two hour wait, but let us know that the bar was first come first serve. We staked out a place to wait and the hostess (with the long blond hair) alerted us when she noticed a couple was leaving. That's way more that most hosts would do - especially considering how busy they were! We swopped in, grabbed the two bar stools and spent the next four hours being wined and dined by one of the most charming servers ever - Ryan. Basically, he ordered our meal (we had a total of 5 dishes - all amazing) and told us what wine to drink with what and all was outstanding. Truly, one of the most memorable meals of my life! Thanks Purple Pig and crew!
