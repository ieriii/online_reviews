FABULOUS!!! We had the Premium tasting menu and it was phenomenal! We had a good 18 course (as evident by my copious amounts of pictures... I may have missed one as my phone died half way through and I had borrow a co-workers to take the rest). It was quite an experience as food just kept coming out.  The wait staff was great. They told us if we come back, we can just tell them when we came if we wanted to get a similar menu or taste items different from what we tried that time. I also don't eat meat and they had no issue with making some comparable vegetable and seafood dishes... and accommodating for another coworker's lactose intolerance. Some highlights include: PATATAS BRAVAS -http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/o4NcUfco7JxOcyfKFWyAhg?select=x4AMKOjwlke6nj3aiCI7RA Spicy Potatoes with Spicy Paprika Ailoi... ok, this in very akin to tator tots and not a super stunning dish, but for some reason, I can't get the Spicy Paprika out of my mind. It's been months and I can almost still taste it. LLENTIES I CIGORONS - http://www.yelp.com/biz_ This lentil salad was quite good. Very creamy and went well with the crisp endivine. SEARED TUNA - http://www.yelp.com/biz_ Seared Just on the bottom and topped with a light oil, this was VERY good. I've eaten my share of tuna and this we well prepared. STRUBE RANCH WAGYU - http://www.yelp.com/biz_ I didn't have this but I understand it was a table favorite. Overall a great experience... as to be expected of the winner of Food Network's The Next Iron Chef. The location shares an entrance with the Blackstone Hotel. Just take the stairs to the right into the restaurant. Would definitely love to come back.
