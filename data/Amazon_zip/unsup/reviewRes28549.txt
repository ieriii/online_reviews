Great prices for big portions. I had a shrimp, clams and mussels pasta which for the price had a lot of fresh ingredients. The sauce base however was too salty for my taste and it didn't have that many flavors in it. I added black pepper and it was still a bit too plain. My friend loved his pasta though saying it was very good so hopefully my bowl was an exception. Since I live extremely close to this place and there isn't a better comfort food option than creamy pasta in the upcoming winter times, I am definitely gonna revisit this place and hopefully I can upgrade my review :)
