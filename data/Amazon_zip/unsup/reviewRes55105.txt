I've been to Gilt several times and honestly I have never had a sub par experience. I have had the toast with bone marrow, & the toast with sweet balsamic (both incredible... the bone marrow is INSANELY good--foodies unite!), and I've had the roast chicken, the cornbread dish, the roasted cauliflower, etc. I have loved them all. The roast chicken is unbelievable--roasted garlic, espelette pepper, perfectly juicy and seasoned, it was great. The cornbread was to die for too. Plus the drinks are strong, like GOOD strong, yet well-balanced in flavor. They actually taste good, woo! If you want to ask for a specific bartender, ask for Zach to make your drinks. His service is wonderful and he has the mixology skills to match. I've never felt so special sitting at a bar before. And that is something that should be highly appreciated in my opinion because it doesn't happen often! Anyway, maybe I'm the luckiest person alive... Or maybe Gilt's just got some good sh*t! Cause I have yet to have a bad experience after visiting four or so times. Definitely recommend and will be back.
