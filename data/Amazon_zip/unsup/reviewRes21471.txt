Half-priced margarita nights aren't the only reason to come here. The food is wonderful. My personal favorites are the fish tacos and the carne asada - yum! This place is cheap, unpretentious, and always delicious. I also love that they don't skimp on extras like sour cream and guacamole (ahemm...Tarascas...$4 side of sour cream). Don't be swayed by the shady looking exterior. Mayan Palace is a gem!
