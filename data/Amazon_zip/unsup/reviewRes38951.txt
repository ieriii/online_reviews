This was just a sensational meal. Having been to Longman & Eagle around a year ago, I have to admit to underestimating this place. It's not that I thought it was bad, but the fact that I've failed to come here for a year was a misjudgment. This is as good a meal as I've had in some time. We started with a bang - foie gras (yes, foie gras is one of my absolute favourite things to eat in life), and this was perfectly prepared, rich buttery goodness, perfect temperature, on top of peach infused doughnut, macerated raspberries, and a gelee was just outstanding. It was a great play on a peanut butter and jelly sandwich taken to the next next level Ricotta gnuddi, light and crunchy, soft in the middle, fennel, fresh cucumber sauce. Duck breast, well seasoned, and although it looks a little overdone, it cut and tasted like a medium temperature duck, the duck leg was well cooked, fall off the bone, rich in flavor with offal (first try, quite tasty) and well prepared cabbage slaw. It was also a huge dish, literally half a duck! Corn churos (amazing texture and flavor, super light and moist on the inside), dulce de leche (rich, sweet goodness), vanilla creme and saffron (which added a little unexpected spice).
