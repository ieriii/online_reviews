Trying to find somewhere to eat breakfast/brunch in Chicago today, my wife and I and my stepdaughter were hungry after successfully locating HARPO Studios. The Wishbone near HARPO was packed with everybody and their in-laws there, so we headed towards the lakefront to see if there was any good seafood along Lake Erie. Actually didn't find much seafood (finding good seafood for a price less than two arms and a leg has been difficult here in Chicago...came close to something halfway decent at Rivers Casino, and even that could have been a little bit better in some ways). So we started walking and ran upon another Wishbone in this area. They were about to close to prepare for dinner, as it was nearly 3 PM when we got there, but they did go out of their way to prepare us our breakfast we wanted. My wife had french toast with scrambled eggs with cheese and bacon, along with a side order of shrimp and grits. I had the crunchy french toast with those same eggs and shared the shrimp and grits with my wife. My stepdaughter had some kind of shrimp omelette. We were pleased with their service and the food was great. I had never had crunchy french toast before, but it was very tasty and not overly crunchy either (they dipped it in corn flakes or something.) We really liked the shrimp and grits. This place did a pretty good breakfast and were able to accomodate us even though they were starting to prepare for dinner. Way to go, Wishbone.
