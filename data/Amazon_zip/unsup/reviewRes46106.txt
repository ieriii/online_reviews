Great place to go if you all want something different. Large menu it was almost too hard to choose. Started out with delicious cocktails a limoncello lemonade and Grand lux margarita. Potato spring rolls OMG, chicken flautas also good then had one of their giant red velvet cakes mmm. Coming from Canada I have never had this cake before it was decadant but the icing did seem alittle waxy I expected more a creamy texture. We were impressed by the wine list I tried both of the malbecs and my co diner tried both of the reislings also nice. Over all atmosphere was grand and the food was delicious. Id say the reason for only a three as a score is because our server was terrible every time we ordered a drink another server brought it out probably seeing it sit at the bar too long. She seemed bored and unentusiastic that was a drag. I would go back and just hope for a better server.
