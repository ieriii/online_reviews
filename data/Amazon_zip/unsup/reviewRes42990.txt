I need to start by saying I like the pizza...it is the service (specifically delivery) that is horrific.  The first time I ordered from them via their website it was over an hour and I still hadn't received my delivery. I called to check up on it and the man told me that the online system was new and they were having issues. He apologized and said it was already out the door and would be there soon. I live maybe 8 blocks away from there and it was another 30 minutes before the pizza finally arrived. I really thought maybe they would have taken a little money (at least the delivery fee) off the bill or given me a gift certificate or something...but no.  Never the less, I tried them again this past weekend. I again (I guess stupidly) tried to order via their website. Again it was over an hour and still no pizza. I called to follow up and the man said that their online ordering service wasn't working at all and that he was confused as to why it was still even on their website! Umm...maybe they should take down the flashing link saying "order online"??? So, he said he'd put the order in right away and he was so sorry and he'd take something off the bill for my trouble. 30 minutes later the pizza shows up...with a bill for full price! Even better, I'm pretty sure they are going to be charging me twice as I tried to pay with my credit card online but then had to pay the delivery person with cash. I really wanted to love this place, but I just don't think they are worth another try. Perhaps if I was in the area and wanted to pick up my order on my own...but likely not.
