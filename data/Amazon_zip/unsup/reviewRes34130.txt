This place was cool back in the day but now they sort of suck. My last 2 times ordering from Sultan's have been nightmares. From cold food to mixed up orders. The food tasted good 5 years ago but now they must have new cooks or management or something. They've gone from Hero to Zero in the years. I hope they change their act or they will lose a lot of business...especially from original fans.
