**CAUTION! Hipster review below** Ok, I'll say it - I used to like this place when it first opened years ago. I used to live right around the corner and so I've been coming here for years - the order guy knew us by name. Initially, this was always an excellent spot to go to for really reasonably priced Thai and sushi. The servers were always nice, very attentive, and the food was excellent. Indie has seemed to decline in quality since they started expanding. When they moved into the adjacent storefront, their prices went up a little bit and the waitstaff seemed much more rushed and less attentive to diners. I still didn't have any issues with carry out or delivery though, so I didn't think much of it. Since they've gotten their liquor license, the food has just been terrible. The last 3 times we ordered food (once dining in, two deliveries) it didn't really taste right and, even when we order our usual dishes, the flavor and ingredients can vary immensely from day to day. The death knell finally came the last time we ordered last month. My wife ordered beef and broccoli and got really sick after eating it. She said it smelled fine and tasted fine but it was obvious something she ate from Indie made her sick. Sorry Indie, we won't be ordering again. You used to be cool....
