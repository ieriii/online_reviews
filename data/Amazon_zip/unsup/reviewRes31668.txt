One of the things that I liked about Sunda is the decor. The Southeast Asia region is very beautiful. However, I go to a restaurant for the food, and the food here was just okay. I love authentic Southeast Asian food and this was more Southeast Asian fusion. The price was about $90 for an appetizer, 2 entrees and 2 drinks which is average for being in downtown but not really worth the price for what you get.  Our server was actually pretty rude but pehaps she was just a bad apple. Worth a try.
