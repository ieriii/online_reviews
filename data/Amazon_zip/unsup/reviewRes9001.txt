Noon O Kebab was my first experience with Persian food. For your humor, I'll say that I expected many different goat dishes and maybe a cut of camel meat here and there. My expectations were blown out of the water. They have BEEF in those parts of the world?! Who'da thunk it? I ordered Chenjeh. The beef was tender, juicy, lightly seasoned; served with roasted tomatoes and buttery dill rice. They also serve complimentary hot pita's with feta cheese, onions, and herbs. Get as many of these as you possibly can, they are delishhhhhhh.  With these I also had their Pomegranate juice, which is a welcome addition to the bland juice selection of most restaurants. For dessert we had bamieh and tea. Bamieh is a sweet tender yellow pastry that is slightly crispy on the outside. I was good, and it paired nicely with their tea. Assuming that Noon is good quality Persian, I'd say that Persian food is something that will be visiting my stomach again, the sooner the better. EAT HERE!
