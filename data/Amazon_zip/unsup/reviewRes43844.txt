I've been here twice and both times were for their $25 3-course prix fixe menu. They change up the menu a little every season but it has always been $25. What a deal! And it's not one of those prix fixe gimmicks where you don't get steak on the prix fixe menu and you are forced to order from the ala carte menu if you want to have steak. So, yes, with a choice of appetizer, entree, and dessert, what's not to like? Good steaks, good taste, and good portions. Oh yeah, I usually don't like cheesecakes but I love their hot buttered rum cheesecake. Be sure to ask your server for the prix fixe menu though. You will always be given their regular menu when you are seated, and if you don't ask to see their prix fixe menu, they won't bring it to you. Also, over dinner tonight, one of my friends made the observation that we were the youngest there (we are in our late 20s and early 30s). We looked up and around and yup, my friend's observation was right. Strange. I suspect it's because Kinzie Chophouse's atmosphere and interior is very much like a traditional chophouse.
