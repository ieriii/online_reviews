So if you'd like to get in for dinner at a decent hour on a Saturday, you'd better get there at like 4:00 and put your name on the list because they dont take reservations. We got there at 6:30 and didnt get our table until after 8pm! I cant fault the place, it only means it's just THAT GOOD! And it was... The bar upstairs is cash only. it's really the best place to wait for a table because it's warmer in the winter and there is less moving around so you dont spill your beer. Try one of the million beers they offer including the Guiness Pub Can. I was so excited to find the pub can at a bar. Most places only have draft Guinness but once you've had the real thing in Ireland, all draft Guiness in the USA is really gross...except for the can. I never thought I'd be drinking canned beer outside of WI...sorry folks. For dinner I had the Brisket sandwich on sourdough bread. It came with fries which I was able to substitute a salad. YAY! I love love loved my sandwich but I think if I ordered the brisket platter of stictly meat (it comes with mac and cheese) I would have been disappointed. The bread, brisket, and horseradish work well together but the meat doesnt stand well on it's own. It was also very fatty. If you dont want a mouthful of bread and fat, cut it off before you take a bite.
