So my wife and I have eaten 3 times now and we both agree that there are some hits but quite a few misses. The past two times we went for brunch and my wife had the crab cakes Benedict and I had the French toast with caramelized pecans, peach compote and maple syrup. The flavors were spot on but the chef seems to have a problem with textures. The crab cakes were wet and the poached egg was runny. Combine that with hollandaise sauce the whole thing had such a bad texture, like saucy mush, but the flavors were great and the large lumps of crab were very nice.My French toast had a texture issue. They use a homemade bread that either was stale or not soaked in the egg mixture. I love fluffy French toast that has a pan fired exterior and a soft, fluffy interior. The bread they used crumbled in my mouth and was dry or stale. The peach compote tasted like canned peaches fresh from the can, complete with the tinny taste, and the caramelized pecans were really hard. Like they make them way in advance and keep them in a container. We love their coffee, and they have some truly fantastic items like a pulled pork served on a really delicious pan fried grit cake. We will wait a while before we go back because Cheryl and I both moved from Birmingham 8 years ago and miss coastal food. We want this place to be great because it's obvious the chef has a good palette, just needs to work through the recipes a bit more.
