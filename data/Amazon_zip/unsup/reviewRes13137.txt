Wonderful! I could stop there. This place has it all, from great decor, attentive waitstaff, a plethora of meats swirling around frequently, awesome fried bananas/plantains, and a good array of items on the salad bar (well, minus a traditional salad). If you can stomach the price point (expect to spend $1-200 for a couple) you can surely stomach the delicious food!
