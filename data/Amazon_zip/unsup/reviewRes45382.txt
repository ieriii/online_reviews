I really like WIlde a lot more since my first visit. We've been back several times and have really come to appreciate it more. The best thing i've ordered: Rosemary Garlic Chicken. It is delicious. Best thing on the menu (in my opinion). The Artichoke Cheddar Dip is also excellent. Sometimes we just go for that and some drinks. Huge selection of draft beers, which I love. It is, in my opinion, overpriced though. I like this place a lot, but it's pretty pricey for what it is. Either way, good food, good atmosphere. And my boyfriend is gluten-free so we really like Wilde because they have gluten-free bread and he can actually get a bun with his hamburger. They have a pretty decent gluten-free menu. I took my parents here yesterday for the first time, and they were both very impressed with it. My dad loved the decor (framed pictures of the Beatles, Johnny Cash, etc) and gorgeous crown moulding on the ceiling. They were impressed, and I realized that I needed to update my review. :)
