If you're attending a conference at the convention center, the Hyatt Regency is tough to beat. It's connected to the center by a hallway and has big screen TVs in the lobby which list convention locations (as well as weather and metro routes into the city). While a very busy lobby, the staff moved people through at a reasonable pace with a concierge and valets who kept taxis in a respectful line back from the door before whistling them to advance. The rooms are also nice with comfortable beds, ready access cords for computers, flat screen TV as well as smaller touches (not only did they have the complimentary shampoo and conditioner, but they had toothpaste in the room). There's two drawbacks to the Hyatt. The first is the location. It can't be entirely helped since it's part of the convention center complex, but it's a decent distance from the downtown and tourist sites. It's a walkable distance, but plan on a brisk 30 minute walk before you start to get to areas that are interesting. The second drawback is that apparently the walls are thin. Noises in the hallway seem magnified and you can even hear the squeak of doorhandles turning in the hallway. Conversations in the adjacent rooms are easy to hear (sadly, the conversations in the rooms next to me were fairly mundane); don't discuss something that you don't want to see on a blog 15 minutes later here.
