From the time, I had made the reservation until I left the hotel, I had an excellent stay! Checked in on Saturday at noon. Check in was very easy - no long lines. Manager on Duty had explained about the Manager's Reception and about the morning breakfast.  I knew the hotel is going through a renovation. When I got out of the elevator, I was blown away.  The carpeting (shades of red, orange, brown and black design) is really sharp - very contemporary, the walls are standard white. I opened the door and was blown awhile. The room is done in browns and tans, modern furniture. You can tell everything was new. The bedding is very comfortable. Had a very good night sleep. I did make it to the Manager's Reception. I was great that they had both hot and cold snacks.  I had ordered the BLT sandwich through room service. I was told it would be delivered within 25 minutes. I believe it was less than 25 minutes. Great Job!!  The breakfast was very easy to maneuver around. The cooked-to-order breakfast list was not long even though there was a gymnastics group staying at the hotel.  I did not use the pool or the complimentary business center but both very clean. Check out was also very painless.
