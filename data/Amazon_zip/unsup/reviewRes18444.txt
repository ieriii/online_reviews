LOVE this place. The veggie burger is my favorite in the city. It's not a typical patty. It is homemade and oozing with deliciousness. I dream about the french fries - which have skins, and are perfectly salty, with or without truffle. The carnivore burgers are just as tasty, but the veggie is, for me, a huge standout. There are a few hang-ups though. The service can be hit or miss. I have had better luck eating at the bar than in the restaurant, mainly because one male server has been WAY off his game on more than one occasion (and for some reason, I keep being unfortunate enough to be seated in his section). I also think their fries-portion is a tiny bit stingy. Maybe that's better for my waistline, at least that is what I keep telling myself when I complain they didn't give me enough. But the food you are given is sooo good. AND the beer selection - it's extensive and quite cost-effective (e.g. how much alcohol content you can get for your money). It's way easier to get great beer and have a huge selection than, say, Hopleaf, and you can carry on a conversation to boot. I went here three times in one week and was a little embarrassed that I started to get recognized. Not enough to keep me away though.
