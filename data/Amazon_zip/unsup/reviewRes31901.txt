World-famous vegetarian food. The food is 5 stars by far, but the service is sub-par. No fault to the waitstaff, but the place is really small. I don't suggest dining here with more than one other person because the wait can be brutal, especially in the winter. Great food, all around. The vegetarian "bacon" cheeseburger tasted so much like a real cheeseburger to me that i almost was scared to eat it (though I haven't eaten meat in some time. Carnivores would be able to tell right away). My favorite is the seitan ruben! Great tofu scrambles, all-day breakfast and the best vegan desserts ever concocted. Good micro brew selection to cleanse the pallet. Would like to be able to go everyday, if I could!
