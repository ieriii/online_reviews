Cute place, very private. I like that they have a dress code and I like that you can avoid the loser riff-raff wastoid crowds of Debonair Social Club while being in a cool neighborhood. I would yelp more about my experiences there, but I often end up so drunk at the Violet Hour that my memory becomes faded.  Going there on weekdays is WAY better than weekends as well, because you avoid the "wanna-be" posh crowd that comes from Lincoln Park.
