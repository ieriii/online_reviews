I was in the mood for Mediterranean food and decided to grab some falafel from Sultan's Market. We got a baked spinach pie and a baked meat pie (I preferred the spinach, J preferred the meat). I ordered the vegetarian combo plate with an extra piece of falafel, feta and with curry rice. J got the chicken shawerma dinner with lentils & rice. I forgot that they cut up the falafel....next time I'll have to ask them to leave them whole. I love their curry rice so much! Their chicken shawerma is spicier and has more onions that I remembered. Everything was good though. Our dinner was about $20. CASH ONLY
