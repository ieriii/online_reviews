I tried to go here with my fiance and a friend on a Thursday night, but it was so loud and crowded that we had to bail. As it was right down the street from our hotel, though, we decided to give it another try for a late-afternoon lunch on Friday. Despite being almost off-putting in its trendiness, the food was tasty and sitting outside at the communal tables on the patio on a beautiful spring afternoon made for a very pleasant experience. I didn't try any of the wine, but their list was interesting and my fiance enjoyed his glass. We shared: - pork friend almonds with rosemary -- so good and so rich, I almost made myself sick eating them - peas, bacon, spearmint, pecorino salad -- one of my favorites because of its relative lightness -- house-cured meat: this was the only one that was sort of a let-down. just kind of boring. -- milk-braised pork shoulder -- this was really the star of the meal, absolutely delicious, aromatic and wonderful -- mussells with pancetta -- surprisingly good mussels (who knew you could get these in Chicago?)
