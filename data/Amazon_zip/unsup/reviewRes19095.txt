I can't even begin to describe how awful my experience was. My friend had a party event set up and I was looking forward to going because I love trying new places. We were there for maybe 20 minutes max and realized that my friend had been cut off from receiving drinks. I was so confused because I knew he only had 2 beers and was completely fine and watching whatever was on the television. He tried to order again and the bartender flat out NO. I was astounded as to how rude she was. Not only was she absolutely out of line but, she started whispering to all the staff telling them not to serve my friend. I had no idea where that came from because all of us were fine and kept to ourselves. Then throughout the night she kept starring and glaring at us as if we were from some out of space nut jobs. I have been to many bars in Chicago, classier than this place, and we have never been treated with such disrespect. Later that evening my other friend knocked down his drink accidentally, he was playing some board game and got excited, shit happens and she came over and glared at him and said, "watch it or you're done". Seriously, it's a bar get over it, if you didn't want to deal with messes, wrong place to work. We were the only people in the bar too and so considering we were their only customers, you would think they would be at least friendlier. Regardless, worst bar experience by far. Never going there again. Waste of time, wasted energy, wasted staff, especially the snarly, pixie black haired, emo chick bartender who needs proper etiquette training.
