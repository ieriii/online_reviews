You like fried chicken? You like sauce? You like other fried things? If you say no to any of those questions, I will punch you in the mouth. This is America God dammit, eat your fried things!  This fried chicken is excellent, and the combination with the Sassy Seoul sauce was top notch. They have a great deal of a whole fried chicken, 2 sides, and 2 drinks for $20, which is even more awesome. The sides were standard fried fare, like fried mushrooms, french fries, onion rings, ect.... The focus here is on the chicken fool. FOCUS ON THE CHICKEN! The place has been overrun by a infestation of hipsters, so just keep your head up and eyes forward. DO NOT MAKE EYE CONTACT! Hipsters hate eye contact....too mainstream. Just crawl through the web of fixed gear bikes, find yourself an open seat, and get down on some chicken.
