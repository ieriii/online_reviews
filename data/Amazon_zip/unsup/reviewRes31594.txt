Stumbled on this place whilst roaming the streets of Chicago and SO glad I did. The food is fantastic - great, FRESH rolls - loved the Summer of Sunda Roll (tuna, escolar, basil, mango, avocado, asparagus, soy paper, ponzu sauce). The Lemongrass Beef Lollipops (skewered on the lemongrass) were also delish! Good sushi is good sushi... however, paired with a great, after work young and sexy atmosphere AND killer cocktails = recipe for a sick day. I will absolutely go here again.
