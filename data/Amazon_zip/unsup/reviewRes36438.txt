I should probably start by saying that I've never dined in here. I initially found this place because it's one of the highest rated delivery places on GrubHub in the Edgewater/Rogers Park area. I understand why. The service has always been speedy, accurate, and delicious. I've tried a variety of their noodle and chicken dishes as well as soup. Everything has always been delicious. If you're looking for great take out or delivery, go for Indie Cafe. It's my go-to delivery place.
