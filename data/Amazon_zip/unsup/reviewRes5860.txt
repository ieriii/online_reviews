One of my favorite italian restaurants in Chicago, hands down. TO ALL NON-FOODIES: When you eat here, you have to understand that you are going for the experience, not just the food. Make the dinner an event and you will have a blast. They don't take reservations so you either need to get there early, try to get a place at the bar (which I am a huge fan of) or put your name in and go across the street while you wait for a couple glasses of wine from a less than stellar selection. The last couple times I have eaten here, we were lucky enough to grab seats at the bar and the bartenders were great. They had some wonderful wine and food suggestions; I highly recommend chatting them up to see what they like. Wherever you sit and whatever you do, you MUST...and i mean MUST...get the Focaccia de Recco. It's just so good!!!! Everytime I've been there we've just shared everything that comes out because it's designed to work best that way. Nothing is a huge portion and the more you can try the better.
