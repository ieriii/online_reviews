Champagne, sprouts with brie, mushrooms... so tasty. Pretty much everything, with the exception of the Buffalo tartar, has been delicious each time I've been. They had a holiday drink with ginger, craisins, a local cider, and gin that was so good that my husband got the recipe and made gallons of it for my family's Christmas party. The whole bar/restaurant has a great vibe - really cute and warm.
