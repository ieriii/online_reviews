Made sure to stop by Hot Doug's during my first visit to Chicago! It was Thursday morning at 10:30am and guess who was at Hot Doug's...? Everyone! I waited for about an hour but it was delicious! I made the mistake of going by myself -- so I couldn't finish everything (duck fat fries, duck sausage w/ fois gras and chicago dog). The Dog (Chicago style hot dog) was my favorite. And for only $3?! What a deal! Cash only! Friendly service but expect to wait.
