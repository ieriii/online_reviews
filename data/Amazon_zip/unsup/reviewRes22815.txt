This is far and away one of my top 10 restaurants in Chicago. Once you make it past the upfront bar and walk inside the main restaurant, it looks like something directly from Greece. There is a 4-5 level terrace seating area built on stones, almost makes you think you're eating by the ruins. You can see the kitchen and the massive roasting meats from almost any seat in the house. Wait staff is very friendly and actually started teaching us how to speak Greek. They had some amazing recommendations for food. The group of us four decided to order a bunch of food and split it. The lamb was delicious (certainly a staple of Greek food, make sure you order this). But for the rest of the menu I would advise you take the waiter's recommendations. We had two appetizers, octopus and zucchini, both recommended by the waiter and both were amazing. Then ordered a wide variety of main dishes and went through a few bottles of wine. And of course, make sure you finish your night off with a shot or two of Ouzo (greek hard liquor). I HIGHLY recommend this restaurant to anyone, no matter if you are a big fan of Greek food or not. I wasn't a big Greek food fan before I came here, and now I can't stay away--I'm going back tonight in fact. See you there!
