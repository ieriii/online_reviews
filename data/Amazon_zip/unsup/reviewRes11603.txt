Best breakfast in the city by far! They have a unique and delicious menu. Any of the Eggs Benedict is delicious and the awesome variety of pancakes and french toast. The atmosphere is chill and hip and the wait staff is so on top of things. My coffee and water cup were never half full it was always full! The coffee is awesome. The overall Bongo Room experience is a must...I will definitely become a regular here.
