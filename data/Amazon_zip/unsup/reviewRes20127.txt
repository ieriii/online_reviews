This has to be my favorite sushi bar in chicago (lawrence fish market is the best sushi, but it's just pickup), and is the only one (of the 15-20 so I've been to in the city) that I've come back to. The quality of the fish has been top notch every time that I've been back, and it's BYOB so you can save on the drink costs. This makes it the perfect place to come when you're looking to take the next step up from the all you can eat or bargain sushi to the true sushi experience!  I've had a bunch of the maki rolls, and from the simple tekka to the gigantic po' boy, every one has been amazing. I'm a huge fan of unagi, and Coast served up the best unagi nigiri that I've had in Chicago.
