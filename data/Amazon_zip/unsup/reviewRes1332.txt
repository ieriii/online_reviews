Been coming here since 2006. I always get the Jenny Garner. Yummy ass food in general. Great Fries. I mean, DUCK FAT?? Heaven..... Creative fun names for their dogs. Good greasy choice meats n cheeses for your alcohol soaked belly. Friendly service. Long lines that seem to fly by. Ostrich meat, check. Alligator, check. Monkey balls, check. Monkey balls, i mean why not. I bet if these guys charred and spiced that stuff up and threw it on a bun you'll annihilate it in seconds. YES YOU WILL. I bring all my outta town friends to this place by default. And even when they get lucky and get laid in chicago, they don't ask about the girl, or her name, or any of that. Noooooo........ They ask me to fedex em something off the menu of Hot Dougs. I mean really. This has happened at least 4 times, man. Very much worth it. Will definitely make a vegan repent back to good meaty murder.
