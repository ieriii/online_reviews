As a Vegan finding decent pizza in Chicago can be a difficult task. Luckily, I found Piece the first month I moved here. Piece is hands down the best pizza place in Chicago (I say that having tried the other big pizza places here before I went fully vegan 3 years ago). When I go here I typically order the plain sauce without the parmesan and add whatever vegetables I want at the time - the crust is vegan. Be mindful when you're ordering this sauce though, it's very garlicky (but oh so good!) so you may want to bring some gum if you're going out afterwards to avoid having garlic breath all night. Generally Piece is always busy (everyday), so expect to wait a minimum of 30 minutes to be seated. The service isn't very fast either, so add another 15-30 minutes before you get your food. (These reasons alone kept me from giving it a 5 star rating)
