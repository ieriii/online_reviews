It's always hard to find a place that does, Thai and Sushi well. But by george, I think I've found it, throw im a BYOB to boot, and it's pretty much the greatest thing since sliced bread. Been there about 4 times now, and carried out a few more than that. Pretty much your order should start with some Crab Rangoon, and then the Habanero Sushi, and you should finish off with some Steak Panang Curry. Let me tell you about the Steak Panang Curry, the curry is so good, I would mainline it into my veins if I could. Seriously. Do it. Don't forget your wine.
