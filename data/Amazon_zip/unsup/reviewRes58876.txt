By far the best quality of fish I have ever tasted. I have been to plenty of sushi restaurants both in Chicago and in other cities and the quality of fish was amazing. We were with a big group and order additional plates like the black cod and sea bass. Both were like butter. I highly recommend going to Sunda.
