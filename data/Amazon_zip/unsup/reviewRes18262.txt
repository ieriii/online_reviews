Wonderful, entoxicating, yummy Milanesa...where have you been all my life? I finally was able to get into XOCO before the line formed out the door and around the corner. I went on a Saturday mid-morning (11:30ish) and ordered the Milanesa torta. It's a shame when you take your first bite, realize how amazing and happy your mouth and stomach are, and get sad immediately because you know at some point the meal will end! Every ingredient was fresh (Crispy Gunthorp chicken, black beans, cheese, pickled jalapenos) and blended beautifully together. The tomatillo-avocado salsa should be bottled up and sold; however, because they prepare it fresh daily, it isn't...and that sucks because it is so, so tasty! The music is quite loud and seating is cramped and limited, so if you don't like semi-loud and small seating areas, you may want to opt for take out (or dine outside if the weather is nice). Note about the churros: I have had authentic churros in Spain, so I was hoping for something similar to what I know, and not those pre-filled ones you get from places such as street fairs. The churros are very good and piping hot, crunchy (but not too hard) with the right amount of sweetness. I can agree with other Yelpers that the charge for the chocolate dipping sauce is quite a rip-off if you are doing take out (especially due to its small size), but it is a nice compliment to the churros.
