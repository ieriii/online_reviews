This place is great. I always get the food carry-out becuase of the tiny seating area on the interior. They do have a very small patio in the front of the restaurant...but there isn't much scenery on that portion of Milwaukee. Much of the food is deep fried...so keep that in mind. For some reason, I always have the need to take a nap after I eat this food...yet, I keep coming back!
