More like Publicant! My fiance and I went in for dinner and after all the hype were super excited! We enjoyed the bar selection and the ambiance. However, the food lacked flavor and was not anything spectacular. We got the fries with eggs (I'm a huge egg fan and these were delicious but not runny enough to use the yolk for the fries). Then we had the sirloin, which tasted similar to the meat at Roti and the sweetbreads which had great grilled peaches on the side but sort of had a nauseating taste to them. Overall, we were very disappointed. We were so underwhelmed we opted to have dessert at home.
