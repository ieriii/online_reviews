I have never walked out of a restaurant before this one......we sat at our table (in the rotunda overlooking Michigan Ave, not hidden in some corner) for over 20 MINUTES and no one brought us water, said hello, acknowledged that we were there. Nothing. We left. I would never go back.....it's a tourist trap.
