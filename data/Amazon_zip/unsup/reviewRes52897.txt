The food was pretty good, though not consistent. Portions were consistently large - almost ridiculously so.  I had churrasco, which was flavorful and cooked as I requested. My friend had a fried pork dish at the suggestion of our server. It was too dry and not all that flavorful. My other friend had ropa viejo, which was tasty but was difficult to cut with the butter knife provided. A woman - manager? owner? - stopped by our table to ask how everything was. The first time, it was nice. The second time, it seemed a bit much. The third time, I thought enough was enough! Stop harassing us! The same woman came by the table to ask if she could take our payment even though we had just received the bill and hadn't even had time to get our money out. In retrospect, I should have gotten the hint that they were rushing us out.  I was appalled and dismayed when the waiter came to our table and told us that they wanted us to leave because they had someone else they wanted to give the table to. We didn't leave immediately upon settling the bill but we didn't sit for hours, either. I won't go back. As we exited, we noticed a few people waiting but there wasn't a huge line.  To the woman who repeatedly asked us how things were: It turns out everything wasn't fine. Asking us to leave was not cool. In my opinion, part of the dining experience is the "experience". Being forced to rush is not a good experience. To the people who were waiting for a table: I'm sorry you had to wait. We weren't trying to take up a table unnecessarily and I don't believe we were there for an excessive amount of time.
