If your intention is eating 30-40 oz of meat in 1 sitting Fogo is the place to go....Otherwise steer clear. While I've not been to many other Brazilian steakhouses I am quite sure Fogo de Chao is among the best. However, I feel this concept is nothing but a worn out gimmick.I was totally unimpressed with the over salted and bitterly smokey meat. It is nonsense to take what is undoubtedly prime meat and smother it in sea salt and then cook it over smoke. If I wanted cured and then smoked taste I would buy some Ekrich smoked sausage for $2.99 at Jewel.The other major flaw I see in this operation is the piercing and subsequent carving of hot meat. If the intention is to create shoe leather consistency then mission accomplished.  The service was outstanding and the atmosphere was pleasant. With 1 drink a piece, 1 desert, and tip the total was $160 for 2. For that type of scratch a much better steak and meal overall is available at numerous Chicago steakhouses. . Post Script:The gimmick of all you can eat meat served by gauchos is interesting but fairly lame. Moreover I suspect in Southern Brazil Gauchos sell the type of cuts Fogo serves in the market and they eat the garbage cuts. The meat at Fogo is not deserving of the salt and smoke treatment.
