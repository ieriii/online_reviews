Graham Elliot, you disappointed me. I was so excited to go to your restaurant, had heard about the rissotto with cheez-its...and I left with an emptiness it my heart, stomach and wallet. I know it's fine dining, but your portions are SMALL. Here is what we ordered: - Hushpuppies appetizer (2 hushpuppies) - Scallops appetizer (2 scallops) - Pork Entre (3-4 thin, small slices of pork) - Chicken and Gnocchi Entre (4 of the smallest pieces of chicken I have ever eaten with 6...I counted...6 pieces of rice gnocchi strategically placed on the plate, with foams) - 2 cheap beers Total Cost = $130 (and the rissotto wasn't on the menu) Graham, you are a large man, and you clearly did not get that way eating your own portions. I wanted to love it so bad, as I love my personal vision of Graham Elliot, and this stop was to be the highlight of my trip. And it was the lowlight of the trip. It was so pretentious from the complete misrepresentation on your website about "the rules" to the waitress asking 5 times "how are the flavors?" And anyone who says this place is "casual" is a liar. Guys, put on a collared shirt or be embarrassed. Thank you to Rick Bayless for saving my foodie vacation.
