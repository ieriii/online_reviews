Such good food here. So good i ate here twice in one day. No joke, I can't think of a better place to have multiple meals in the same day. Maybe they'll create an award for me for eating breakfast, lunch, and dinner there (just putting that out there, Rick). The Cubana - smoked Maple Creek pork loin and bacon with chipotle mustard and artisan jack cheese among other things. My friend ordered this and it was my favorite dish. Just bursting with flavor. Also ate the Choriqueso, which is homemade chorizo sausage with roasted poblano, artisan jack cheese and tomatillo salsa. It wasn't as good as the Cubana, but still tasty. The chorizo was just ok, I wanted it to be overwhelming. Yeah, i just said that. I don't know how many places in the U.S. make their chocolate in house, but Rick does. They take cocoa beans from whole and do all the processing inside! Don't miss out on any of the chocolate drinks, they are righteous. I tried their flan and demolished a mexican hazelnut chocolate cookie, the desserts here will demoralize any man. The chips and guac are addictive, you won't realize you killed the basket of chips.  Bayless has called this his interpretation of mexican street food. Now, it's not like buying 6 tamales from the lady that sets up shop on the corner of Clark and Touhy (very good tamales, btw), but you can taste the quality in the food and recognize the appreciation of the mexican culture that he has. Many return visits.
