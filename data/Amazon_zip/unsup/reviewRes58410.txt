Let me be clear, this is a 4 star place, but my experience I had a ZERO star waitress.From the second we arrived she literally argued with us on everything. In a society in which we tip based on cost of food, not effort, who does that?We requested a seat away from the sun. The waitress sits us right by one of the huge windows saying its not even sunny out. Lady, if your room is lit by the sun and you can read, the sun is out. As we asked her about the items we were interested in her answers turned out to be incorrect in both quantity and contents of what was in the order.When asked how many eggs were in each item she gave a RANGE!. What recipe doesnt use a specific amount?The food, while not what we asked for was very good, however not worth coming back for for someone who acts like this. I dont mind people being bad at their job or new. It makes those that try look better, but when you are bad at your job and obnoxious, thats just too far.
