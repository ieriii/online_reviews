Came here for Sunday brunch as I was in the neighborhood, and it was a treat! I'm not much of a bloody mary person, but they look fantastic here, and feedback from my friend confirmed that. We had to wait a little while by the bar where they started our drinks (I only had coffee). After we were seated, I took a better look at the place, which had a very odd set-up for its booths and almost a mess-hall set up with a long table carrying through the place. Very unique and trendy. I ended up ordering the red wine poached eggs, which were served with side greens and prosciutto ham. The eggs were to die for. A perfect blend of flavors, and the bread they served them on (benedict style) soaked up the egg and sauce so wonderfully. What a treat. If only our waitress was a bit more attentive. It took a while for us to get our food, and my coffee was left empty for too long despite being right next to the station that holds the coffee pots. I should have just refilled it myself. Ha.
