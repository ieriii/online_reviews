I stayed here for several days when in Chicago for work a couple years ago. I was on a high floor and had fabulous views of the river which made for amazing sunrises. The staff were great, very accommodating, and the rate was reasonable. The location was also perfect, as we were very close to lots of shopping, restaurants, and Grant Park. I'd definitely stay here again and would highly recommend it.
