Publican. More like PublicAWESOME. On paper this place seemed as if it would be a complete miss for the veg obsessed, but I quickly found comfort in the atmosphere and bountiful beer list. And let's face it, after a good beer you loosen up. This normally oyster shy gal found the selection to be straightforward and delightful. I then drooled over the octopus while my meat eating counterparts dabbled in the Publican specialty-- pork. Everything was delicious. Our waiter recommended great beers, however he did loose steam on service, leaving us unattended for a good 45 min. But the atmosphere was engaging and we had plenty to catch up on.
