The family style fried chicken lunch is delicious! $16 per person. You won't leave hungry. Huge platter of white and dark meat fried to order (takes about 30 minutes to cook). There were three other tables who ordered the fried chicken lunch when I was there, and all of us had leftover chicken because they give you so much. This lunch includes several excellent sides worth saving room for: corn bread, biscuits, mashed potatoes, collard greens, beans and rice, and dessert (changes but ours was sweet potato pie). The fried chicken has a wonderful "crunch" when you bite in, and it's not greasy like it oftentimes is at chain restaurants. Service at Big Jones is always notable- friendly, attentive, professional. Highly recommend trying the fried chicken lunch!
