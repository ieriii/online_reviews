I can't say the Mexican food here is fantastic, however, it is pretty good. Where this place scores high marks from me is the margaritas, the service, and the feel of the place. It can get a bit crowded, and there isn't much extra space to loiter around the bar, but it's worth the wait if you're in the mood for a decent meal in a boisterous environment.
