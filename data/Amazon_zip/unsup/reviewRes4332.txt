Everyone comments on how it's a historical and culturally rad place. The decor dates back from the mobster and prohibition era. Ok... True enough. I do care about those facts but what the hell! Seating for maybe like fourty tourist and five locals. I witnessed many ladies wearing heels and I can only assume they were in pain by standing on an old uneven rock hard floors. The no talking rule is cool but over used and the bouncer reminded me of a bounty hunter. The only reason I will be back is because I love jazz but only after it's free after 1:30 am. Then its a totally a different vibe and the night birds have flown. The drinks are over priced and seating sucks but I and I assume any local persons who grew up around Chicago have to love a place that hosted Al Capone. Ok this being his place and knowing under the place are tunnels zigzagging around the hood I am inclined to give it a higher rating. Historical factor a ten everything else no comment. Figure a way to seat people on the ceiling!
