I've eaten here twice. The service has been great both times, the atmosphere is... good, if you're into that sort of dimly track-lit, black and red theme. Every roll I've had here as been soggy, mushy, gross; absolutely no texture whatsoever. The "Crunchy Spicy" roll was soft and pasty. The rolls aren't cheap either, expect to pay $13 for one "specialty" roll. My girlfriend's entrees have always been tasty, though. This place gets 1 star for sushi, 3.5 for everything else.
