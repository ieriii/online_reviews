Last Thursday a group of us came here for a show. I was surprised how nice it was inside! I am very skeptical of that area, but I think this is a nice addition to the neighborhood.  I definitely recommend the millman burger- it's a $15 dollar burger-but totally worth it. I had it with delicious Sweet Potato Fries. I tasted my sister's dish that was scallops/mussels/fish in a tomato broth and that was also very tasty. I think it would be hard to find something on the menu that wasn't up to par. I really liked the show and they didn't make us pay up front- they leave an envelope on the table where you put in a "donation". The whole amount goes to the artist. It was a very cozy setting and I like the idea of dining/drinking while listening to live music. I'm keeping an eye out for cool, upcoming shows.
