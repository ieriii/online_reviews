Add me to the long list of Wakamono converts!  I've walked past this place forever and never bothered to stop in since I'm not a huge fan of Ping Pong. However, I needed my sushi fix and on recommendations of a friend, my guy and I headed over around 9pm on saturday night, chilled wine in hand.  No wait (yay!) with tables outside and inside, we chose an inside 2-top with swively bar stools.  The service was excellent the entire night, attentive without being oppressive. The food! We were in the mood for sushi so we didn't try the small plates, though I did order the wasabi soba noodles (orgasmic).  The special maki are very creative though a bit heavy with the mayo; we went with the Wakamono roll (delicious) and the Peter Parker Roll (also delicious). In addition, we ordered several pieces of nigiri and I had sashimi as well. The fish was so fresh and so tasty, on par with other more expensive places I've been too. Good variety beyond your regular yellowtail and salmon, the fish is well cut and artfully arranged, a joy to eat! My advice, order just one special roll and go with the wide variety of nigiri and sashimi, eaten with just a tab of wasabi and soy, it's perfect during the sweltering summer. It's not the cheapest place ever but the quality was there. Cute decor too and thankfully, the music was toned down so I could actually hear my guy.
