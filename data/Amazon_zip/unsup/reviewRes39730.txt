I've been here a few times and it just seems to get better every time. My last visit was for brunch because Bongo Room turned us away at 2.30p. No worries because L&E serves brunch until 3p and they are servin' it up RIGHT! We were seated right away. I had the duck hash and an Irish coffee. The Irish coffee was stout and hash was deeee-lish. Next time I visit I'll have to try the PBR breakfast, which is available sans PBR for $1 less (HA!).
