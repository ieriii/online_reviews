I ate here for the first time with the bf on Friday and loved it! We split three apps and an entree...I was stuffed! We started with the chips & guac; the chips were pretty greasy but the guac was great. We also got the Arepa and Ropa Vieja; both were great but we preferred the Arepa. By the time our entree (the short ribs) I was stuffed, so I only had a couple bites. Those bites were amazing, though! The polenta is rich and creamy, so it complements the beef perfectly. We were to full for dessert, so maybe next time. The only negative was the raspberry mojito; I wasn't a fan. Well definitely be back!
