My brother and I decided to buckle down and bear the wait for Hot Doug's... no matter what that wait was. I'm definitely glad we decided to do it. It ended up being an hour and a half, but I didn't think that was too bad for a Saturday at noon. The ordering process was extremely friendly and very efficient. I believe Doug himself took our order, and he was super nice. My brother ordered some sort of elk sausage, and I ordered an encased meat (I forget what type of meat now) with spicy pepper jack cheese and a jalapeno mayo. Of course, we ordered the duck fat fries. My brother loved his elk sausage, and I loved my spicy encased meat. We both thought the duck fat fries were good but nothing special. I'd definitely go back to order another unique encased meat, but I don't think I'd bother with the duck fat fries again.
