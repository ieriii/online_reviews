If I lived in a world where someone was always picking up my tab or I was moderately wealthy, this is where I'd want to start my night off. Sure, the velvet curtain and man in the suit telling you not to use your phone seems a bit much, but hey, that's their thing. The space is lovely with it's low lights and random seating. I didn't feel out of place in a dress and heels. The menu is extensive and it's hard to choose. I settled on a champagne drink which was delicious. We came towards the end of the night, but I was surprised the cocktail server never came back to see if we wanted another. Sure, it was nice not to spend the extra money, but I would have given the option. This is the perfect place for an intimate date or a small girls' night out. One day, I will return...
