This is no ordinary hot dog place. I'm just in love with what they are doing here. It's like raising the lowly hot dog to an art form. It's such a fun little joint. The people who work here really seem like they are having a great time, too. The duck fat fries are crispy on the outside and chewy in the middle. The hot dogs are all incredible -- you really can't go wrong no matter what you order. Even the music is a little unexpected (Sammy Davis Jr.s The Candy Man!). I didn't mind the line at all. It's worth it once you step inside. Look around and all you see are expressions of joy and hot dog delirium on people's faces.
