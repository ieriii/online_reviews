Went for the lunch buffet yesterday. It made me soooooooo happy. If you ever get a craving for Indian food, hit this lunch buffet. Loved the fish curry (mahi mahi!) best, but there were many great tastes on the line. The salad bar is fantastic too. Of course, I paired all the flavors and spices with a great Indian ale...and still left feeling nice and light! (With plenty of energy to hit Nordy's just down the street.) Tip: Ask for whole wheat and/or Garlic Naan!! Enjoy!
