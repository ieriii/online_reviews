of course the food and and service is great, but the staff needs to maybe take it down a notch.... a bit over the top to the point of annoying, very pretentious. the atmosphere is very very dry and everyone whispers as if im at a funeral? I get the whole experience and chicago scene and whatnot, but guys, it's ok, friendly conversation with the patrons is ok. i hate to say it but when i left i laughed a little.. haha
