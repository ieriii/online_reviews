I really have no complaints. It was overall a really great experience. We had a reservation and they seated us and took our coats upon arrival. Our reservation was early so it seemed like as we were leaving it was starting to get more lively and full. The atmosphere is totally cool. As the host pointed out to us, its an old fish market rehabed into a colorful rendezvous in the city. (You can see the neon lights calling to you from the dan ryan-90/94 north for some fabulous drinks!)  We did enjoy some varietal drinks and want to go back for more! I had a margarita and caihparihna and they both went down as I'm goin' back for it:) My boyfriend tried the sangria and was totally satisfied. We had the chips and guacamole and I was in heaven. My fave kind of chips and the guacamole was fresh and flavorful. Both of our meals were incredibly flavorful and unique. My boyfriend kept thinking he had pork even though he had beef, because it was braised and so flavorful and it literally melted and fell apart. I did actually have a pork dish which was also incredibly juicy and perfectly cooked. Its always a good sign when the foods you order don't require any salt and pepper and they just have their own flavors. We were so stuffed from drinks and chips we did not get dessert. Although NEXT TIME its callin' to me:) I reccomend this for a fun date or groups! I also think the bar area was lively and fun and totally worth stopping by for killer latin mixology:)
