Dear World, Don't worry, we know we just rocked your body. Your Welcome! Respectfully, -Alinea- Now, let's begin this review. 5 stars across the board. This is a dining experience...a whimsical adventure using the best of your senses for food. Smell, Sight, Taste. The haute cuisine is like no other in America. They have been heralded the closest successor we may see of "El Bulli" recently, speaking to the immense impact they have had on the culinary world. The beauty of Alinea is the focus on one ingredient in each dish and bringing it to life. Surprisingly it is usually NOT the ingredient you would suspect, making it so much more interesting. Example: dishes based off Hay, Chestnut and Rhubarb to name a few. Don't worry, Duck, Waygu, Truffle and many others are there as well but those are luxuries you would expect! Course after course you are drawn into the dish with strong scents while you are instructed to close your eyes....or Sight, while you marvel at the presentation of a dish. It's something you should never miss. The service is unlike any I have ever seen, your "team" of wait staff help bring the dishes, share insight on the construction of the dish, explain the wine pairings and quickly get you set for the next course. Warning - This is an expensive meal and is not meant to fill you. This is about the passion of food being on display like the art it truly can be when a chef isn't afraid to break out of the mold and turn it into something exquisite. Alinea will tantalize your senses and leave you wishing for more. Quite possibly the most artful mix of food and culinary vision in America.
