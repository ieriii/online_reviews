This was the first place in Chicago that I tried for Mexican Food and overall it was a great experience. The service was exceptional, friendly and quick. The prices were great (compared to NYC), $25 for the equivalent of 8 margaritas. The chips and salsa were awesome and refilled promptly, but the main course was not impressive for the most part. The rice and beans were good. Taco was just a bunch of under flavored meat placed on top of a tortilla and the enchilada was not sauced enough. The tamale was great though. If you are in the neighborhood and you want to have some margaritas and decent grub with friends then by all means, but if you want to experience mind blowing Mexican, look elsewhere.
