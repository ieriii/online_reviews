I can't believe that I haven't reviewed Sultan's yet! Reasons to come: 1) BYOB 2) Food is delicious. 3) They've expanded the dining area since I moved to Wicker Park, so you're always bound to find a seat. What I got for $22 on my last visit: 1) Four falafel balls 2) Lamb dinner - Lamb, curry rice (little bit flavorless...needed some salt...first time I've ever had flavorless rice there), cucumber salad, pita, and hummus (best hummus I've had in Wicker Park!). 3) A fish dinner my pescatarian friend enjoyed. The sides were pretty much the same as mine. 4) A piece of Middle Eastern fudge....absolutely spectacular. It's cash only...so that's something to keep in mind. Great place for a nice, low key dinner in Wicker Park before an unexpected night out.
