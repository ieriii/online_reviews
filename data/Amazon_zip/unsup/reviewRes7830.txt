This pizza is cooked in a wood-fired oven and has very thin dough and a thick crust and is meant to be eaten with a fork and knife. Spacca Napoli Pizzeria takes its pizza seriously by staying true to authentic preparation and fresh ingredients. The restaurant itself has a nice outside patio and the dining rooms (4 separate areas) are airy and bright thanks to the huge windows. Black and white photos and old world portraits decorate the walls with pretty tile throughout. The staff and space are warm and inviting. The pizza is divided into Pizze Rosse and Pizze Bianche. We went with the special for the day Tre Pomodori and Bufalina, which is on the regular menu. The server let us know that the Tre Pomodori was the way to go as it had fresh yellow and red cherry tomatoes that are season. Along with sundried tomatoes and olives. The olives provided a nice salty balance to the sweetness of the tomatoes. The crust was charred just the right amount from the wood fired oven. The Bufalina has basil, mozzarella di bufala, olive oil with red sauce. Very simple yet I have a feeling it is not easy to make such a good pizza despite the basic ingredients. The beauty with this style of pizza is that you can eat several slices as they are not overloaded with toppings and feel satisfied and not go directly into a food coma. This also means.... dessert. The Zabaglio which was new to all of us at the table. The menu describes it as a creamy custard made with Marsala wine. I did taste a hint of alcohol but could not distinguish it as Marsala wine but it didn't matter, I will be having this dessert again. It was surprisingly light for custard and nice and sweet. Last but not least Spumoni. I remember having this as a child and wanted to see if I remembered the taste. Not sure what took me so long to get this again but I am glad I did. How can you go wrong with pistachio, rum, strawberry and chocolate ice cream with whipped cream and candied fruit center?
