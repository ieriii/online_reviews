So I read the reviews about the rude staff - I went here on a Sunday, our waiter was nice (even funny), and the sushi was very good. Not the best I've ever had, but very good. I'll admit it's a little intimidating at first (everyone's in black, and there were about 8 servers in the front when you first walk in) - but coming from a former server, if you are nice to them, they'll be nice back. I would definitely recommend Coast to people looking for good sushi in that area.
