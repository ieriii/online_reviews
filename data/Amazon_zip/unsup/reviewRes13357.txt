Beer selections were good and our waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu items and brew options. The Brisket was on special.... oh. my. god. I cannot possibly put into words how incredible this was! it came with some cous cous and the whole plate was covered in the sauces from the slow cooked amazingness. I cut the entire meal with the fork, no knife required! this needs to leave the specials menu and become a full time entree!
