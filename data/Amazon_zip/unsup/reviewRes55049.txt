One of the lamest restaurants in Chicago! Horrible service. CASH ONLY in the downstairs lounge. No Exceptions! Even when you have a group of 15 people! Will tell you to go to the ATM! Definitely not a place to bring a big group. They will not accommodate you! Unhelpful hostesses and staff. Food is fine...but not worth waiting for. This is one to avoid!
