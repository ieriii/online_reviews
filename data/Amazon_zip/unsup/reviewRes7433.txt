Once I got over the idea of an upscale BBQ joint..or should I say restaurant I settled in. The place has a comfy feel to it..and the wait staff was great. The floor manager or "Pit Boss" ( no pun intended) was very attentive as well. The complimentary chips were pretty good. But the sweet pickles stole the show. Delicious. Now to the meal. I had the St Louis Half Slab. The meat was really tender but the sauce a little thin. Rounded off with a tasty cornbread and greens side. Very filling meal...not sure if it was worth the price though. Maybe if I had to impress some clients from Kansas City then yeah??!
