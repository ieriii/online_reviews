Everything is good here from the salsa to the margaritas! Especially the Coconut Margarita, they have a few flavors to choose from and it tastes like they use real fruit instead of a flavored syrup. Everytime I go it seems like I have to order a steak tostada, even if its on the side of my main dish because its got to be one of the best I have had so far!!!! YUM! Go here, you will not be dissapointed and you can always walk off your full belly in the square afterwards!
