The staff: extremely pretentious.  The food and the beer selection are both amazing. But, the service is horrible and ruined this place for me. I used to love this place.. and suggested it tonight... but ... alas... everyone in my party felt that the service was horrible.... It wasn't just our server, but the whole staff. It shouldn't take 20 minutes to get a beer.  Moreover, while, we may not know all the beers on the menu, we shouldn't be treated like we don't belong at your bar. Snobbiness and pretentiousness doesn't fare well with me... Bottom line: I wouldn't suggest this place unless you want to spend $7 a beer for bad service.
