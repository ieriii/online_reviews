Leap Day Miracle! My office closed early so I found myself with a weekday afternoon to myself, so boyfriend and I drove over and happily found NO LINE at Hot Doug's. I've been wanting to try this place for a while for but one reason or another, hadn't gotten to yet, so this was pretty great. I had the Irish banger (4-cheese mustard sauce with crispy fried onions) and some fries, he had a corn dog and Polish sausage. Mine was amazing, and he said his were "hands down best in the city." I want to go back on the weekend for the much-talked-about duck fat fries (and obviously more of the actual food because there were at least 3-4 other ones that looked good), but for a first try this place was A+ and the staff was really nice.
