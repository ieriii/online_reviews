After eating at Schwa, I felt compelled to write my first yelp review. We did the 9 course tasting menu, and nearly every course was superb. The veal heart tagliatelle, the sweet bread biscuits and gravy, and the short rib smores were out of this world. The staff was wonderful and made us feel right at home. Absolutely one of the greatest meals I've ever had. If you want to eat amazing food in a cool environment, then go to Schwa. While getting a reservation can be somewhat difficult, it is more than worth the effort.
