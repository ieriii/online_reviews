Went here with 2 of my gf's and I can't even remember what we ordered but it was very good. I wish I wrote my friends dish because I would order it weekly. It's BYOB, can't beat that. Maybe it was because we had a bottle at home prior to coming here that made the place 4 stars, I don't know but all I can remember is this place was awesome. Waiters were very attentive, friendly and offered great suggestions. Will def be back.
