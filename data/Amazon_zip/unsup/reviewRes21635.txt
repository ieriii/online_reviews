This place is overhyped, nostalgia is nice but what I really care about is the food.  Negatives: 1) Hot dog is highly overrated, large, bland, very meh - Portillos, Hot Doug, lots of folks run rings around this dog. 2) The fries are awful, consistently overcooked, dark brown, greasy, cold and nasty, plus 3) You have to pay for them, they come with everything which annoys me since I don't like paying for something I won't eat. I think this is a ploy restaurants use to justify 4) Highish prices, nearly $6 with tax for a single hot dog or $8 for a double cheeseburger is a lot if you don't want the fries. On the plus side, the cheeseburger is really good, whatever cheese they use is more flavorful than standard American, and the shakes and malts are delicious ($4-4.50 for a very small, but satisfying, size).
