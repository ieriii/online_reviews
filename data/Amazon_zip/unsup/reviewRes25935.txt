YES Pequods is the place for DEEP DISH. for out-of-towners in search of the "famous" chicago style pizza, GO HERE. forget giordano's or uno or where-ever. those places make some nasty pie-like pizza, all disproportional with so much cheese you'll be blocked up the rest of your time in chi. trust me, i'm giving you the wisdom i acquired via trial and tribulation. THIS IS THE PLACE
