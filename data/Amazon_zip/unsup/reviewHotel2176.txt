What can I say about this hotel? First of all, it is in the perfect location and I mean absolutely perfect. It is very beautiful, but for $500 a night can a sista get some heat? I woke up at 3am freezing my butt off because our heat would not work properly. Also, there was a huge spider on the ceiling that sent me into the restroom crying. For the expense, you would also think internet might be free - wrong. Overall, the experience was OK, but I've stayed in better places.
