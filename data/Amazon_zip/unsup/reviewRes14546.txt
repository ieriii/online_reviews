Don't get me wrong, I like the fact that Revolution Brewing is 1 block from my house and that I now have a new alternative for decent gastropub-type food and good beers (without TVs everywhere). But I have to be honest, I've been here twice now - once for just drinks, and once for dinner last night - and the beer is just... meh... The Workingman's mild is too mild, the belgian style is decent, the Anti-Hero IPA is very bitter but not necessarily in the good way I like, the coffee punch to the mouth they call the Stout is pretty good, but the Willie (their highest proof concoction) literally tastes like a Curad alcohol-soaked band-aid. Seriously give it a sniff and a slug and you'll see what I'm talkin' about. Now that I've got that off my chest, the place is actually really cool, well laid out, and the food I've had was really good - Cheddar burger with beer onions, and Margarita Pizza. I'd steer clear of the anchovie piled caesar salad. Does anyone drizzle salad dressings anymore in this town instead of dunking the whole bowl of salad in a vat of dressing? The "guest" beer selections are really solid and not terribly priced, so overall this place is a 4 for me, without these guest beers and the close proximity to my house, this place is easily a 3.  $50 was a lot to pay for a burger, a small pizza, and 2 beers. The Logan is very comparable and less $$$.
