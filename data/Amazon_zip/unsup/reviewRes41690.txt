Awesome dinner! Went this past week after a friend purchased the groupon that was recently offered. The location isn't the "best" as far as the area of town, but once you step inside there are no worries. Atmosphere is intimate; service was great. Love the BYOB aspect. But the food was absolutely amazing!!! We opted for the 4 course dinner, all which were fantastic, and not tiny portions as you might expect either. I can't say enough good things about this place...you will not be disappointed! I love trying new restaurants in Chi town, but would definitely go here again!
