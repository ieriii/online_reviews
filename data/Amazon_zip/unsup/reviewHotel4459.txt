Stayed here for three nights. Luckily, I got this room bundled with my flight through United Vacations, so I didn't have to pay the four star prices. The lobby is really nice, with comfy seats perfect for grabbing a drink from the bar.  The room itself, well, it is obvious this used to be an old hotel. Extremely small. With only one bed in the room, one would expect it to be a king, but no, it is just a double. The bathroom was tiny. If you have the bathmat down, you can't open/close the door, since it will catch the bathmat. The sink is horrible. One of those modern giant bowls protruding from the counter and the water sprays everything on the precious little counter space.  The bed is comfortable, though, with the down comforter and duvet. The curtains completely block out the light, which explains us sleeping until noon and one pm. This was not uninterrupted sleep, though, as the sound from the hallway really carries through the door. I could hear the clanging of room service trays and housekeeping staff.  The gym is adequate, but was a hunt to find. There were treadmills, bike, ellipticals, steppers, free weights, cables, a ball and mat. Unfortunately there are no TVs. Signs indicated that there will be some wonderful new gym/spa. But for now, it is located in one of the salons next to conference rooms.  Overall, the location is great. Next to the red line, couple blocks from the blue line connecting to O'hare. If I were to get a decent rate again, I'd stay here, but I wouldn't preferentially chose it.
