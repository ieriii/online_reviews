If, like me, you like to eat and drink a variety of foods when you are hungover in an attempt to make yourself feel like a human being again, the salad bar at Sultan's Market is a god send. It has been emprically proven that at any given moment during their hours of operation, 20 somethings in various states of drug/alcohol influence and/or withdrawal will be seeking sweet, cheap sustenance at the Wicker Park location. Of course, I could be projecting...Bottom line is I moved out of the neighborhood a year ago and still drive down there from Lincoln Square when I need my Sultan's fix!
