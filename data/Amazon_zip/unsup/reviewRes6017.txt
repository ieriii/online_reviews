This is one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago [right now]. I recently went with my girlfriend for a nice night out, and everything was as perfect as always (I highly recommend making a reservation, because the wait can be quite long on busy nights). Our server was very friendly and was always easy to find. I had the filet mignon and she had the roasted chicken; both were cooked to perfection. Our side dishes of baked potato and mixed veggies were also perfect. The drinks also did not disappoint... she had the 'martini flight' (which consists of 4 of their signature martini's) and I had about 3 Stormy Nights (available within the 'flight'). If you have never had one of these, I can assure you that you will not be disappointed. I (we) never have room for dessert, but the 'visual' dessert menu looks as though I would never be able to finish it anyway, because the portions are huge. None-the-less, I am sure they are delicious. I have only been to the downtown location, so I can only hope that the location in Oakbrook is just as pleasant. Either way, I can't wait to go again...
