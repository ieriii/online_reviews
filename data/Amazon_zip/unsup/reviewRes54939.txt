This local gastropub is right on. It has the early 1900's roadhouse feel with it's pushbutton jukebox and its cloth-on-a-roll bathroom towels. I don't know why but all the waiters have moustache, which I imagine is an amalgamation of the logan square hip kids and the turn of the last century stylings which is exemplified by the old-timey photo-wallpaper in the bathroom. This place is an obvious improvement to the long defunct Winds Cafe... and not just vis-a-vis their inclusion of a bed and breakfast (due up in the spring).Food. I had the creamy scallop bisque and my friend had the wild boar sloppy joe. Not a lot of bisque, but plenty of joe to the point that I had about 1/2 of hers. Definitely tasty. Random trivia, the goal of all the dishes are to be comfort food that you would readily savor after a multitude of their wall of whiskey. Speaking of which, I had a winner of a Manhattan and Queen's Ice Tea that I didn't even realize that I downed. (Oh my, am I a lush?)Being that the L&E is 2 blocks away from my residence I'll be surely coming back. I may have overstayed my welcome by hanging around for 3+ hrs so they had to politely boot me to make way for all the other salivating patrons. Those folk had good reason to drool.
