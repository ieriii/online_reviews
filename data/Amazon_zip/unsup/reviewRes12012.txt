this is probably one of the best brunch places i've ever been to. i had the breakfast burrito - which was to die for. i added sausage to it but i'm thinking chorizo would have been excellent. i don't' know if they have it though. i can't wait to go back. this place is super crowded so make sure you want to wait for a table - it's worth it.
