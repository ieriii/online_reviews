I was impressed with Gino's immensely, and not just because it's touristy, which it is, or the fact that I had to wait outside in a line, which I did, but because the service was on point and the pizza was just right. Gino's is a bit dingy and crowded inside, but it's got charm, and it's also the subject of relentless graffiti, encouraged by the owners, who allow patrons to write their names on the walls. I wrote in Zulu, so if you're feeling really sleuthy, you can try and find my Zulu words. :) Our server, Jewels, was a trainee, but she was friendly, efficient, and on point. The deep dish pizza, covered with meats and mushrooms, was great--and worth the 45 minute wait. It's a great spot for an out of towner (like me), but I just might come again if I were to live in Chicago full time :)
