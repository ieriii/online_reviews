We called ahead for our table of 9 and were told to just come on in (instead of making a reservation on the phone) because there was another party of the same size a couple hours before us, and we could just stake out their table. Our whole party waited for more than two hours and, long after the previous party of 9 had left, the hostess said they lost that table and they could seat us at two tables that weren't close to each other. After standing around at the bar for TWO HOURS already, we said thanks but no thanks. Disappointed and starving, we ended up going to El Cid a couple doors down instead. Did I mention this was for my boyfriend's birthday? Edit: The FOH manager at Longman & Eagle reached out to me to talk about the situation and apologized profusely for the issues we had that night. Sometimes, shit just happens, and apparently that's what happened when we tried to go. No hard feelings anymore, and I'm definitely willing to try going there again. Upgrading my star rating for now to a mostly-neutral three stars until I get a chance to really try it.
