I don't live in Chicago, but visit at least once a year. Our first stop after checking into our hotel is almost always Giordano's. You just can't get this pizza where we live (Southern California) so maybe it's just a novelty to us, but it's fantastic pizza. The small deep dish easily feeds 2-3 so don't get tricked by the menu that says it feeds 1-2. We've never been able to finish a small between my girlfriend and myself and i like to eat. Any of the reviews that say this pizza is bad are from people who do not understand what chicago-style deep dish pizza is all about.
