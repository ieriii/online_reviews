Here's the deal. This place is exactly what I have been in search of since my move to Chicago. Great beer, phenomenal pizza- all at a reasonable price. This place gets packed! On a Saturday expect about an hour or so wait. But not to worry, just cram in- find a nook and enjoy a pitcher of good brew while you wait. Once you are seated they make up for the long delay by bringing the food out fast. I'm definitely going to be a regular here. You've just been yelped in!
