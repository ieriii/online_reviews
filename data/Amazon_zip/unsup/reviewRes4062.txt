Amazing! Simply amazing! We arrived a bit before our 6pm reservation and were the only people in the place....for nearly and hour. Quite nice actually as we got to see the playful side of the chefs. As the feel for the night set in I have to say that this is exactly what I had expected and could not have been more please about. Small and dimly lit, the music selection varied between old-school hip-hop, 80's-90's rock and early electronic, totally hitting a sentimental place. Things proceeded quickly after the chefs complimented our choice of wines (thank you In Fine Spirits!!) In total 11 courses were served to each of us after we decided on the 9 course menu...total bonus. However, a larger number or dishes and variations were experienced after one of our dinner companions told of her seafood aversion. All were amazing and I could give the menu description for each but this would not do any of them justice.  Highlights of the night were the savory apple pie soup (which one of our companions remarked was better than Thanksgiving all in one bite), truffle ravioli (their signature, which they said were not numerous enough to last the night....glad we got the early reservation), biscuits and gravy (WOOHOO!!! sweetbreads!!), pork collar (the only time I have used tender and collar in the same description) and pretzel Chimay cheese ball (a bowl of them would have been quite nice.) I know this is nearly half of the dished I was served, but I can't in good faith whittle this down. Sorry. If you are up in the air, go here. You can't be disappointed. (Just be willing to spend a few months waiting for reservations.) I can't wait to return.
