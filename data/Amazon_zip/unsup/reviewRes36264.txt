In my opinion, consistently the best place for breakfast-specific items that I have come across in the loop (OK- so it is more like Greektown, but you get the idea!). It is true that the lines can be long if you stroll in anytime after, let's say- 9:30 AM or so, but the wait in my opinion is actually well worth it. They do both savories and sweets really well, and for the quality- they keep prices reasonable. Besides, long lines are a testament to this places reputation, and also of course ensures that their items are most likely fresh (more turnover, more frequent the food!). While I tend to prefer Intelligentsia as a coffee choice at a morning meal (or Dunkin' Donuts when coffee alone is all I want)- the Lavazza they have is a great change of pace. While I also almost always side for savory, this is one place where I know the sweet breakfast items are so good- they should never be passed up. Always multiple French Toast options, Crepes, Pancakes, and their juices are great too! If along or near Halsted- step in (or wait outside for a while) and enjoy this place any day of the week. There is an Orange nearby (I believe on Congress around Clark), but I really think Meli is much better.
