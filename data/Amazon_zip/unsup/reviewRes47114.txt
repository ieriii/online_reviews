Ugh. I mean, it is a nice place and all, but come on! It is SO pretentious and uppity...I can hardly breathe through the thick air of arrogance when I hear our waitress tell us that they are conservationists and that is why they do not bring bread to the table (upon my professor's request for some bread for the table). I don't think they bring water either unless you ask. I mean I get the concept and all, valiant effort to save the planet, Uncommon Ground, but please spare us the condescending lecture! She ended up reluctantly bringing us some bread to the table. Ok so no big deal. Now, I do have to say the macaroni and cheese is very good, but I don't really think anything on the menu is worth the price you pay except for the sweet potato fries and the smores tart (I would just get that if I ever went back). What really ticked me off is when I went to see a band play. I mean it was such a to-do about getting a table and the room was not the slightest bit over-crowded at all. We ordered food and bottles of wine and I was kind of mad when I saw a $7 cover charge per person of our 8 person party being added on to the bill. Seriously, have I not paid through the nose enough for the overpriced fare here anyway?
