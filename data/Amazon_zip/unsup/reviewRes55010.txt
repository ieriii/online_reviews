I have eaten at L&E several times, and I have been blown away each time. The desserts are to die for, the library of whiskeys is incredible, the service is helpful, evenly paced, informative and professional ... the ambiance is enjoyable, though it can get loud late at night. I love that the menu is frequently updated, and they impress time and time again. You're missing out if you haven't been!!
