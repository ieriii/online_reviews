I've read all the hype about Big Jones and couldn't wait to try it...hmmmmm. I LOVE southern cooking and I know good food and Big Jones has neither. First, I should have been cautious when I walked in to find that the premise of the place is upscale-soul food. Typically if the food is any good, then the words "upscale" and "soul food" don't belong in the same sentence. I started with the gumbo ya-ya, the waitress cautioned me that it was a unique gumbo since it was made with a "dark roux". When it came to the table, she was right, it was very dark, but what she failed to inform me of was the dirt-like taste! Yuck! I forced down two bites and couldn't finish it. When the waitress returned to check on me she asked if I wanted it to go, to which I replied a very quick "No". We then discussed how it was not my idea of gumbo and she obliged by taking it off the bill (appreciated that). For my entree I had the savannah catfish and grits, it looked amazing until I bit into the fish only to find that there was absolutely no seasoning on it - not even salt! Finally, I thought let me end this meal on a good note with some dessert, so I got the peanut gooey butter cake that is served with coffee crunch. The cake was o-k, but the accompanying coffee crunch was a house made toffee that wasn't coffee flavored - it had actual coffee grinds in it! After eating a piece of the toffee I was left with bitter coffee grounds stuck in my teeth for the next 30 minutes - YUCK! This was one of the worst examples of southern cooking I've had. The only thing they did superbly was the little cornbread muffins they put on the table. I won't be back.
