Visited this past Sunday. Used OpenTable to book a reservation. Was promptly seated at a table of our choosing on the outside patio. Very comfortable. Waitress service was prompt and kindly. Brother Thelonious Beer - nice and cold!  Ordered the 3rd Quarter. 1 qtr pnd of pulled pork, 1 qtr pnd of baby back ribs, and 1 qtr pound of pulled chicken. Pulled pork was good. Baby back ribs were pretty dry BUT, they were nice and soft and meaty. Pulled chicken was a big disappointment. It wasn't pulled. It was literally a sliced chicken breast and super dry (understanding that white meat is dry typically - this was even dryer). Their hush puppies and cornbread were simply amazing though. Mac and cheese was delicious. Greens were pretty horrid. My take on greens - if you can't make them - don't make them.  They offer 4 sauces. If you've been to Lilly Q's, you've had some amazing sauce. The sauces here were very disappointing actually. This was really the weakest part of the experience.  Overall, good experience, despite a couple of overpoured beers. Great portions for the cost, but if you're a true BBQ fan, not the most flavorful place. It just lacked BIG flavor which is what ppl want with BBQ. Yes, I will visit again - but don't see myself frequenting this place as a top tier BBQ joint.
