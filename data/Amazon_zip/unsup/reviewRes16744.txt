This place is sexy. Hands down. A co-worker suggested we go here for drinks with a client, and I have to admit I was skeptical at first, since I hadn't heard much about this place and I am not really that into cocktails. I'm more of a beer girl. Luckily they do have beer here. That said, this place is gorgeous inside. No detail has been left unaddressed, from the chairs, to the candles, to the water on the table, to the bathrooms which are simply stunning, if you can believe that. It's quiet inside, and meant for conversation, not mingling and meeting people, which works for shy people like me. The music was awesome, too, lots of Zeppelin, Dylan and Television the night I was there. I cannot wait to go back here and bring lots of friends. There is a bit of a wait here, but to me, it was not that long (On a Thursday) and totally worth it. I would wait to get into this place. It's just that good.
