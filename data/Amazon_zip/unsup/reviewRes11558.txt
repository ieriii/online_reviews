bongo room is always crowded, but it was a wed i went, so it wasn't too bad. the thing that i gripe about is the table size. they are trying to maximize the space, I understand. but before even the food gets there, the table is already crowded with the decorative sugar holder thingies and etc. then i ordered tea, which was super cool because they give you the entire selection of awesome mighty tea. but that means you have a cup, a hot water thingie, and a set of teas. i got us moved to the window where i could move some of the things onto the ledge. the food is also served on big plates so i couldn't imagine how to fit that on one tiny table. but, enough about the table. the food comes in big portions, and tasted like it's made with very fresh ingredients. we had the crab salad sandwich and beef tenderloin salad. both were delish.  it's a good spot, but i can see the wait gets annoying. all good breakfast spots have a long wait tho. probably cuz the word gets out, and it's not like you could make a reservation. ugh.
