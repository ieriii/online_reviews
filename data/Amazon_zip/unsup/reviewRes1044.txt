If you're wondering if the loooong line is worth the wait - DEFINITELY! Does anyone know what kind of veggie dogs they use here? They are huge! They actually fill up the whole (delicious) bun! Loved it. I got mine with the works (tomatoes, pickle spear, celery salt, carmelized onions, neon relish, mustard), plus sport peppers and some fries. Man, the fries are great! Skin on, crisp and salty, just the way I love them. Yes, I'm a vegetarian, and yes, I loved Hot Doug's so much that I bought a t-shirt that says "there are no two finer words in the english language than 'encased meats', my friend." And, the staff is SO NICE, even though the line is a million years long and they are non-stop busy! Hot Doug's is reason enough for me to visit Chicago again.
