Oh. Em. Gee. I'm not a hot dog person, but these gourmet hot dogs are to die for! Right after breakfast, on our last day in Chicago, we took a 20 minute cab ride to Hot Doug's, got our dogs, took a 20 minute cab ride back to the hotel, 45 min ride to the airport... and then we finally got to take a bite. Was it worth all that trouble and wait? YES. Was it still good cold? YES. 1) Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with truffle aioli, foie gras mousse, and fleur de sel: hands down the best one and worth $10! 2) Chardonnay and jalapeno rattlesnake sausage with fig cream and dutch meadowkaas cheese: sweeter than expected but good 3) Regular chicago dog: I hate to admit that I like it better than NY dogs. I love the poppu seed bun and all the extra toppings that come on it 4) Spicy Thai Chicken sausage with sriracha mustards, seasame-seaweed salad and duck cracklins 5) Wild rice and asiago cheese bison sausage with bacon-garlic mayonnaise, and mustard seed gouda cheese - didn't get to try the last two but I was told they were delicious Cash only. Duck fat fries only on Friday and Saturday. Do yourself a favor and try Hot Doug's.
