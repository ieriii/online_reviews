I wish there were vegan meals that didn't feel the need to emulate meat. Not that the meals themselves are trying to be meat.Anyway, I just feel slightly less than satisfied whenever I leave. I paid too much. The food was kinda bland. I must admit I've never had dessert or their shakes. Why do I keep coming back?Probably the lack of other vegan options in this city. eh...
