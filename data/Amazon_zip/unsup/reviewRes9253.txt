The restaurant is decorated just like the colonial buildings during the british/french empire days. The servers and waiters are dressed in vietnamese clothing. I haven't decided if I find the subtle reminder of those good old days to be offensive, but I will say, something about white people dressed in oriental clothing serving a table of asians brought me exquisite joy. I wasn't clear on where the fusion actually happened in the food. The portions are pretty crappy compared to what I'm used to getting at argyle. It's like they took a viet dish, dumped out half, sprayed some lemons on it and pointed at the dish and said, "it's le french now." Stick a toothpick with a white flag on it for a complete french experience. I didn't see a single one of those whiteboy/asian gf couples I usually see at asian restaurants. Those yellow fever inflicted whiteboys know asian food better than I do, and that in itself tells you, this ain't where the good stuff is. Can't complain about taste - it was all good, but nothing that made me think, "Yeah, that half o' chicken breast was certainly worth $20." I was shamelessly scraping grains of rice off the plate. Service was pretty awesome. Whatever they lost in portion they will make up in kissing ass.
