We went to Q for lunch early on a weekday and sat on the patio. The patio is nice, enough room between the tables and plenty of shade. The bus boys were on top of filling the water and the waitress was friendly, knowledgeable and attentive.  My friend ordered the $15 Prix Fixe and subbed a salad for dessert (no problem) she had hush puppies, salad and a brisket sandwich. The portions were more than enough and everything was delicious. (I had a bite of everything of course) I had the pulled chicken Cobb Salad and the BBQ Flight. This is way more food than one person needs but I like to try a bit of everything. The salad was HUGE and tasty, I took half home for supper and each of the meats on the flight was tender, moist and flavorful. The cornbread was AMAZING and a big enough piece to feed a small family. My favorite sauces were the spicy and the mustard.  Overall everything was great and I will be going back. My favorite part was seeing how carefully and neatly they had packed up my 100 to go containers. Not jammed all together into a styrofoam box but each and every meat, sauce etc had its own container with snap on lids!
