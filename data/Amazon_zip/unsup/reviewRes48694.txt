Pork grinds and oysters were the highlights of the night. The other stuff was good, but in reality that's all they are..."other stuff". Also the beer selection is a tremendous and tasty. Ask for recommendations because from my experience, the waiters will know what compliments what and are extremely nice. Atmosphere is SUPERB. If you would like a date here, make sure you reserve a table because you do not want to get stuck on the community tables. For two people, paying exactly $100 including tip for a couple of beers, oysters, pork grinds, and a couple of side dishes is not ridiculous for a great restaurant like this but certainly was expensive. I would say it is more of a group place than a date place. Get a bunch of oysters and beers!
