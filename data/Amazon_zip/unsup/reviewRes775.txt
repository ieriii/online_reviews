Chicago has a phenomenon that centers around the public TV show "Check Please": Whenever an eatery appears on it, and gets a rave review, the lemmings flock there and turn an enjoyable gourmet slum into a two-hour wait. Let's cut through the hype: Hot Doug's is good but not great. Doug creates the illusion of artificial scarcity but refusing to let anyone else man his cash register, and having long conversations with customers that keep the line moving at a snail's pace. Let's face it: After waiting an hour in line, even a tofu and boiled cabbage hot dog would taste wonderful. On at least three different occasions I've brought curious out-of-towners here, and every time the response was "Meh" and "We waited one hour in a line around the block for this?" (Plus, maybe I'm the only reviewer who feels this way, but Doug's resemblance to the Verizon Wireless Guy is a bit disturbing. But I digress.) Yes, I know: blueberry-bison-antelope-cilantro-truffle hot dogs and duck fat fries, blah blah blah. It's better than adequate, but not worth the wait. The thick-as-frosting cheddar spread on the cheese fries at Weiner's Circle is a much better bet.
