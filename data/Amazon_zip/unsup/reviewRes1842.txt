Hot Doug's is the only place that I will get a hot dog in Chicago! Nothing else compares! I will only stop by on Friday afternoons too, because it's not THAT long of a wait (45 min) and the duck fat fries are definitely my top favorite fries of all time. Anytime someone comes to visit me, I make sure I bring them here!
