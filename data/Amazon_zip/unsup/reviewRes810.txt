What can I say that hasn't been said already? Yes, there's a line. Yes, you can't wait to get in the door to see what the specials are. Yes, Doug is a nice man at the register who seems to make up the prices in his head (often in the customer's favor). The line is so long in fact that we figured out our entire wedding guest list by typing it into an iPhone - all 220 names. Ya gotta do something to make the hour go by, right? We had the chicken mole sausage (spicy) and some alligator. We've had the regular hot dog a few times. All really good. Not fans of the andiuolle sausage. The prices are reasonable considering what you get (think about Doug's prices next time you order food at a Chicago festival). Finally had the duck fat fries. They were good fries, but I guess my taste buds aren't sophisticated enough to differentiate what makes them so special. I like to cover my fries in ketchup anyways. We'll of course be back for the whole experience - again and again. This might be the only restaurant we eat at over the next several months, seeing how much a wedding costs :)
