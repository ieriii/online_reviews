I am definitely a fan of Sunda. Although you do need to know that the menu is pricey. The Crab Hand roll is a must! Most things can be shared for two people so that helps with the cost. It is definitely worth checking out as it is a hot spot right now and will probably continue to be that way for quite some time.
