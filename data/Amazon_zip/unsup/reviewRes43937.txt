We went to Kinzie Chop House for my mom's birthday. My dad doesn't hear well so I requested a quiet table, which was handled ahead of time with no problem.  When we arrived we were greeted warmly and were given the best care -- probably one of my best restaurant service experiences! The waitstaff were excellent. We mentioned my mom's birthday, but didn't make a big production of it. We ordered three desserts to split between five of us and they comped all three. Beyond generous and definitely unexpected. Also worth noting is this is a Chicago steakhouse with excellent fish options too -- for the non-meat eaters in your party. Something for everyone, a great atmosphere and excellent service. Thank you!
