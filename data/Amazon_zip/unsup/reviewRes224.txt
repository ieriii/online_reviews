Almost a year after my meal here, I'm ready to take the plunge and write this darn review. Likes - Service. Our waiters were these really cool, hipsterish guys who were SO knowledgeable about everything. It made me wonder if they found people who looked good on paper, then made them adjust their style to appear kind of quirky. - Decor. Beautiful, as expected. - Presentation. I won't go into detail here... Look at pictures or read other people's reviews. Dislikes - Food. Despite the zillions of courses (err, 24 to be exact), there was not a single dish that I considered delicious. A lot of things were interesting, or surprising, or quite good, but nothing was "OMG I WANT ANOTHER ONE NOW." Actually, a couple of the course actually made me want to throw up, like the strip of clarified butter. Ew. A certain Porkchop LOVED our meal here, and he was kind enough to treat (as a bribe for me to go to Chicago with him, perhaps), but in no way do I think this was worth the money. You know, looking back, maybe I just don't fare well with these exhaustive meals. I didn't like Per Se either. I'd much rather prefer a simple 4-5 courser from Chez Panisse...
