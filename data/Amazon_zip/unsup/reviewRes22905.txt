Hey it's nothing fancy, so if you're a yuppie/lincoln park trixie whiner stay the f!ck away, and go eat at some trendy hellhole. The black bean burrito rocks the planet, the fried plantains are fabulous, and the oatmeal shakes are dee-lish. Again, not fancy, but just good food. Not open on Sundays.
