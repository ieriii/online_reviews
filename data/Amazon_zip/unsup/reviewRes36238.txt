Ambiance: Bright and sunny. A bit cramped but it actually works for this restaurant. Staff: We had the sweetest waitress. She was funny, and kind and really made us feel welcome. We just adored her. Food: Where to start? They have a HUGE menu where everything sounds amazing. We found it close to impossible to choose. Meli Caf Honey Cakes - Cornmeal pancakes drizzled with honey and topped with sweet butter. They had a heavenly dosing of cinnamon flavor to them. Indescribably delicious! Hearty and filling. Meli's Omlette - Pancetta, Boursin cheese, chives, shallots and parsley. The omelette was creamy and flavorful. The pancetta was a nice change from typical bacon. Served with choice of toast. Opted for whole grain which was hearty and had lots of sunflower seeds on top. Additionally our waitress brought to our table a platter with their sweet butter (sinful) and their homemade marmalades (heaven) for our toast and pancakes. Beverages: Their beverage menu is as expansive as their breakfast! Cinnamon Cappucino - Tasted great, had a nice foam on top and came with a small almond biscotti which was a nice touch. Mango Orange Kiwi with Honey Juice - They make their own juices fresh here and can you taste the difference! Be sure to mix yours up to get the honey throughout. This was tart and refreshing. Orange Banana Strawberry with Honey Juice - Ditto above. Parking: Street Pointers: Come here hungry! Come here often and work your way through the menu. DO NOT leave with out taking home some of their homemade marmalades. I could eat the raspberry right out of the jar with a spoon. I am going to put this stuff on everything, toast, pound cake, ice cream, the palm of my hand, gum wrappers... We've decided this is our go to place for breakfast when we come to Chicago.
