Have come here for brunch and dinner and really enjoyed both experiences. communal tables at brunch and private table for dinner; we had the French toast, duck, and hash browns at brunch and everything was amazing. Would try to come a little earlier bc they ran out of the coffee cake and one of the plates. For dinner we had oysters to start and cured meats which made for a surprisingly light meal. Would def come back, especially because they take reservations.
