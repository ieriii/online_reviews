After our disasterous pizza experience at Pizano's, I had to take my pizza loving Canadian to Giordano's to make up for it. Giordano's never disappoints, the pizza is loaded with cheese, sauce, ingredients. Stuffed pizza is extremely weighty and not all people like stuffed pizza because it is so heavy. But I love the stuff and kept my consumption to a slice and 1/2 so as not to go into a pizza coma. Pizzas take 30-40 minutes so if you go at peak time and there's a wait, pre order the pizza and it will be that much closer to being done when you are seated.
