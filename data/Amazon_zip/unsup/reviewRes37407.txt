What? I haven't reviewed my favorite gourmet grocer of all time? Poppycock! This place is gourmet. It is fancy. You will spend your entire paycheck here without even realizing it. You're not just paying for the name, though. Their food is quality. They have the most amazing cheese section ever. The cheesemongers (so fun to say!) are very knowledgeable and have given me some of the most amazing cheese recommendations ever. They also have a cafe with a very nice menu. Delicious food. They also have regular classes. I took a beer/cheese pairing class back in March and had a lot of fun. As I mentioned, those cheesemongers know their cheese. ...where can I get a degree in Cheese? Additionally, the bakery section, the produce section, the meat section, the deli section, the OLIVE OIL (yes, its own section) section, and every other section are all amazing. Just trust me. Bring a fat wad of cash (I am not recommending a credit card, given these dire economic times) and have a blast! Oh, also. If you plan on driving here, I believe you can get validated parking for 2 hours if you spend about $20 there. I forget if that's the exact amount or not. Don't quote me on that. I don't drive.
