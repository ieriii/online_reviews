The problem I face is that every time certain friends visit they MUST go to San Luis. I blame myself because I introduced them to the Tapatio Alambre, the finest dish to be served on a searing hot skillet platter blanketed with perfectly caramelized cheese. Also the LARGE horchata is quite LARGE. That's why I capitalized it twice. Quite tasty too. Chips have always been fresh and ample. No red salsa but that's just fine because the green and brown are top notch. A slight danger: a Diversey bus stop sits directly in front of San Luis. So if you're weak willed you WILL stop in for some deliciousness again and again.
