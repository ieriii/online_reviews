Turn up the temp on the oil so your fried cheese curds aren't a mass of melted goo. Do the same for your fries so they don't soak up as much oil. And don't make a medium-well burger way well-done (we're talking charcoal here). Other than that, huge potential at this place. Cool interior, nice not-to-loud noise level for talking, outstanding beer taps, etc. Most of our meal was very good. Just a touch of room for improvement.
