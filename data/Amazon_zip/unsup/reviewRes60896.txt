I love their brunch and now that it's down from $50 to $25, I really can't complain about the price. Their are a ton of choices including the standing buffet. I love their duck hash and I think the food is unique but the standing buffet offers a lot of the standard stuff like their delicious oatmeal and you can add just about anything to it.
