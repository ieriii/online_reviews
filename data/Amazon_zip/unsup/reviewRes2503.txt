2 Words - Ahhh mazing Although the wait is ridiculous (around an hour at lunchtime on a Friday), it is well worth it. I tried 3 dogs today: The Sonoran - Jalapeno bacon with a jalapeno sausage Foie Gras - Duck Liver Marty Allen - Beef, Sausage and Garlic Although it cost me a little over 20 bucks (after adding the duck-fat fries), I do not regret spending any of it. The dogs are juicy, toppings fresh and you get to have a nice chat with Doug before getting your food. The duck-fat fries are not bad, but nothing extremely special. Also, the foie gras was great, but not worth 9 dollars. Personal Recommendation: The Sonoran as is and Marty Allen with everything. Side of duck-fat fries don't hurt.
