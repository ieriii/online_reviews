The food is sort of between a diner and a fancy breakfast specialist (like maybe Orange).  Does a large volume, but quickly. This place is big and great for large parties. Our server was a nice gal and very good. The menu features some interesting stuff in the categories of frittata, eggs benedict type stuff, and others. I had a steak skillet, which was tasty and much less greasy than an average dinner's skillet, while still being loaded with all the right stuff.
