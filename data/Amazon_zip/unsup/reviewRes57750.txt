For several years I lived a block away from the 3rd Coast, and this place was my hangout! The atmosphere is warm and inviting, with great local art hanging on the walls. The service is relaxed but intuitive and attentive, so if you need constant refills of your coffee, or maybe want to be left alone to read your paper, they're cool with either. While evrything on the menu is delicious (and the portions are large enough so that you will definitely have some to take home) -and I've had everything on the menu- one of my favorites here were the Chocolate Chip Buttermilk Pancakes. They're the ultimate comfort food, and the best I've had out of any breakfast place I've ever eaten at! I'm also a fan of the Baked Chevre, Smoked Turkey and Brie, Veggie Sandwich, 3rd Burger, and House Omlette. In addition, their soups are always homemade and delicious (especially on a cold and windy late Autumn afternoon)...
