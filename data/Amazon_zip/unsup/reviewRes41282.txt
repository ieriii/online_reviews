When it comes to evaluating Vietnamese restaurants, I pretty much only use one criteria: How's their pho? Sure, I'm aware that Vietnamese cuisine entails much more than pho. And while I'll happily gobble down a spring roll every so often, I usually will make the trek out to Argyle for one thing and one thing only: good pho. Seriously -- why go to a Vietnamese restaurant if you're not going to eat pho. That'd be like going to Hooters and not ordering their wings -- what's the point? As far as pho's go, Tank's is decent. Broth is tasty and it comes with the standard bean sprouts, basil leaves and peppers. They skimp on the meat a bit, which isn't a huge deal when you're only paying $6 for a big bowl of pho. But it's still something to keep in mind when you know that just down the block at Pho 777, you can get an equally big bowl of pho with lots more meat for roughly the same price. That said, it's still worth a trip if you haven't been.
