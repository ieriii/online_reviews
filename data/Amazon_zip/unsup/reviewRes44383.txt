If you're like Caroline M, and you're walking around wicker park with the stroller this might not be the place for you. Sure its small, but there is a bunch of outdoor seating and next door. And I'm sorry but a 9pm closing is late for a bakery. Great friendly service, and very tasty treats! My fianc thought the cupcakes were awesome. I just moved right around the corner so this is going to have to be my new weekend coffee spot, sorry Milk n' Honey. The vibe reminded of bleeding heart on Chicago Ave.
