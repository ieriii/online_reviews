Lots and lots of meat! Service was amazing, ask them to show you their trick with the dessert plate. The "meat waiters" who passed out the meat options were very nice and good-natured about taking pictures with them. We asked them to go easy on the birthday song which they respected. The establishment is very sleek and Vegas style, and the buffet is pretty good and stacked with lots of options for those who opt to not get the meat.
