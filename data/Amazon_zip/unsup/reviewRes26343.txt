I wasn't impressed at all, overpriced and tables too close together, tables were a cluster, had one customer arguing with another and threatening him. The bus boy was a ten times better and more attentive than the server!!! wouldn't recommend and will not go again. The music was great though!!! The food tasted great but for 50 dollars I expected more than just half a scallop!!!! I left smelling like I cooked in a kitchen!!!
