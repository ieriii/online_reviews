This place has started serving their own house-made "ketchup" on burgers and in the bottles on the tables. They've done away with the good stuff because, to quote the paint-huffer vibing/dead-eyed staring waiter, "it's made with, like, high-fruit-toast corn syrup and that's like, unhealthy or something." You don't get rid of ketchup in a burger joint, period. That's like running a coffee shop and only having goat's milk available. It's SUCH a staple and SUCH a necessity when your menu is burgers and fries. The stuff that we were served literally tasted like Franco American spaghetti sauce or something - so terrible that we thought they had accidentally filled the bottle when it still ad some dish water or something in it. The entire "healthy" line of reasoning is specious at best. If these guys are so worried about HFCS and its health implications, why wasn't I served Coke made with sugar? How about a stone-ground sprouted grain organic bun? How about free range grass-red wagyu beef? How about ensuring the healthfulness of about FORTY EIGHT other things before even THINKING about screwing with the ketchup in a BURGER joint!? In fact, there are multiple varieties of ketchup, including Heinz's Organic line, which are made with sugar instead of HFCS. The whole thing sounds more like an idea cooked up between bong rips after someone read "The Omnivore's Dilemma" between shifts. Or maybe it's a lame attempt to save a couple bucks, in which case we can all expect to see another "For Lease" sign in those location any day now.
