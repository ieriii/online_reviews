The Good: Extemely friendly and knowledgeable staff, eco-friendly hotel, very modern comfortable design, flat screen TV's, walking distance to Navy pier and Michigan avenue, 3 small blocks from the subway and Whole Foods, free WiFi. The Bad: Rooms are not well insulated (we could easily hear every conversation in the hallways), bathroom sinks are only 3 inches deep and splash water on you, rooms are small (but comfortable), small number of cable channels (local and very basic channels only). Tip: Don't use valet ($42 per use), park directly accross the street and let them know how long you will be in town. I paid $30 per day and could come and go as much as I wanted. The lot attendent was very nice and responsible.
