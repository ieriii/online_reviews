I'd never been to Zed before, and to be honest, it'd be on my radar as a rooftop spot that I missed during the balmy Chicago months. So why was I there at 10 am on a Sunday? For brunch. Also known as one of the best meals of 2012. After reading reviews and getting a few recommendations, we officially booked our brunch reso with much anticipation. Everything they say is true--I honestly didn't have a thing that wasn't outstanding. I can tell you a few things that I can say, hands down, were the best I've had to date in this lil' gal's life (read: these were the dishes for which borderline inappropriate sounds were made): - brussel sprouts - sauteed mushrooms w/ feta dressing - duck confit potatoes - cheddar biscuit w/ tangerine butter - the bacon (not just bacon, "the" bacon) - buttermilk ranch sirloin (who knew ranch could do that) - chocolate chip cookies (best. I've. eaten. in. years. True story.) Plus, $5 bloodies and $3 mimosas to wash it all down. Simply stellar. Our service was impeccable; attentive and precise while giving great recommendations! Now, this isn't the place you'll frequent each Sunday after Saturday night debauchery. You'll actually have to comb your hair to come here, as it is quite trendy. But if you want a meal that will keep you full for the next day and dreaming of the food parade you just participated in, Zed's your winner. I will be back, especially to check out the rooftop.
