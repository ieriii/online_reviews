This place is phenomenal! The outside patio is amazing. I try to sit out there whenever possible. Last summer it was a warmer night and had just started to rain when me and a friend arrived for dinner. No one was seated outside because of the rain. I asked if it was possible to sit out under one of there huge umbrellas. Amazing, sitting in the center of the courtyard protected from the rain, amazing drinks and even better eats. Piccolo Sogno 5 stars!
