I came here with a small group for a birthday dinner. From what I understand, we had to make the reservation far in advance. I don't think I would attempt to go here without a reservation. We were seated at a semi-private table in the corner on a platform, which was nice, because we could actually hear each other.  Everything I tasted -- and I definitely wasn't shy asking the rest of my party to share-- was delicious! We started with guacamole and a ceviche with fresh tuna-- very fresh and nicely complemented with different flavors and textures like crunchy jicama and almond. I ordered the swordfish, which was just seared on the outside. I have never had such quality seafood at a Mexican restaurant. I was really impressed. It was sushi grade. and it was huge. I had half a pound of sushi grade swordfish on my plate! Someone else got braised lamb which was good, and carne asada which was amazing. It is expensive, but definitely worth it.
