The sandwiches here are seriously good. LIKE SERIOUSLY! THEY ARE AMAZING. Rick Bayless has done it again in some fronts. The Ahogada (Is that how you spell it?) with the tomato broth is to die for. I do however have some cravats.... the entire line process is fairly mundane but for the demand this place is receiving I suppose it has to happen. I do not mind having to serve myself water, the con gas and sin gas is a nice touch, but having to annoy and stop a chef preparing food to get ice is ridiculous. If a process is going to be self-automated make it 100%. The portion of guacamole was downright stingy and when I asked for more with still half of my chips left...I was rudely told no by the host/server that had been at the door. Keep in mind you it was 10 o'clock at night and there is no way they were going to reuse what was left for the day tomorrow. Simply unacceptable. I'm also confused why there are no margaritas here, must be something to do with the liquor license but isn't' this encompassed by Frontera? I'll be back for lunch soon, hopefully there will not be a line.
