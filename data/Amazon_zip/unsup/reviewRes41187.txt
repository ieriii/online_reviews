I have to be honest, my expectations weren't met as I really had high hopes for this place. I've lived in Logan for over 4 years & couldn't wait to give list quaint & intimate place a try. I'm all about great food and for a high price tag it better make me wet my panties. Here's what we had - one of the last days for the summertime menu. 1. 3 strips of Wagyu Beef yaki, candied octopus, unami tomato salad, ichiban shoyu glaze 2. 8 presentations of summer all bite size - beet foam, quail egg w/ horseradish, tuna w/ candied ginger, pickled lotus & mushroom, asparagus shaved salad, 3 beans w/ something, pineapple w/ bourbon blueberries, and cucumber with kiwi sorbet 3. Scallop & Crab Motoyaki served in a mussel shell 4. Chilled Summer Squash & white corn soup, lobster pached in dashi, and chilled intensified mango juice poured over 5. Natural fed veal served on top of thai-basil pistachio pesto, eggplant 3 ways (fried lightly with panko, grilled, and mouse), smoked & grilled frisee salad w/ white anchovy. 6. Oyster & blackberry fritter infused with homemade hot sauce. 7. Japanese watermelon refresher, black lava salt, orange, yuzu-habenero sorbet 8. Peach flight of sorbets & ice creams. 9. Special extra course w/ brownies, dark chocolate salted caramel and pomegranate sours (like sour patch kids) The best: course 3 (more please!), 4 (great combo of flavors) and 1 (the beef was mouth watering) in that order.  Could've skipped: 7 Disappointed: 5 - my veal was chewy and 8 - i love ice cream & this left me disappointed & was happier w/ the extra dessert course that came out.  Service however was prompt and friendly while very attentive. The back room area that was recently enclosed allows for more diners.  Overall, the price tag doesn't add up to the meal - sad but true, but I can say I've tried it and mark it off my list.
