This seems to be yet another one of those places with a great theme that falls a bit flat in execution. I was really excited to try the Ephemere-cured salmon salad, but the fish didn't taste that much different than a mild version of lox. The size of this $7 'salad' was also a bit humiliating (4 small pieces of garlic toast and a handful of arugula?) The Mixed-Mushroom/Seitan Veggie Burger with Sage Jelly is certainly an interesting concept, but it was almost too crazy with the flavors for any of them to stand out. I can't deny, though, that I love their customized fry flavors (the closest we have to Pommes Frites in this city) -- the truffled fries were quite tasty. Curry fries were pungent, but would've been preferable to see them with curry sauce as opposed to powder. I was also a bit disappointed that they don't have at least *one* warm beverage offering in honor of the season--such as a spiked cider (theme-appropriate), Irish coffee, or even hot tea.
