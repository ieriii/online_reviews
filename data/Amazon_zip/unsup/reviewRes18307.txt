If Kumas had balls to be kicked....Bad Apple would be the foot delivering swift justice. Things to love about Bad Apple 1) No obnoxious two hour wait for above average hamburger Nine times out of ten you walk right in and get seated. 2) It's in Lincoln Square so the parking situation is stellar. 3) With the exception of HopLeaf and Map Room this has one of the best beer selections in the city. Food is great, the Big Texan is like an Ambien. Fries kind of leave something to be desired but not enough to go four stars.  Solid choice - will never disappoint.
