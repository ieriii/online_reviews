We decided to go here because the 2011 Reader poll named this restaurant the best Thai food in Chicago. My favorite (Sticky Rice) came in second. I will rate what we ordered: Egg rolls-Average. Opart beef-Well seasoned, taste a little gamey to me. Panang curry w/ shrimp-Good. Combo fried ride-Less than average. Need more flavor It wasn't bad, but we won't be back.
