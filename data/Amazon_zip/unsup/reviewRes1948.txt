DO NOT GO HERE......during peak lunch hours (the lines get LONG). Other than that, if you're in the Chicago area and love dogs, it will be a crying shame not to visit Hot Doug's. This place has the BEST dogs that I've ever eaten in my life! Parking is on the street (free) and the restaurant has about a dozen tables and some counter space (and some tables outside). The line is usually out the door no matter what time you go but it moves farily quickly. The two times I've visited here, I went after 1:00 pm so the line wasn't too bad. The service here is nothing short of EXCELLENT and the menu has a varied selection of dogs and specialty dogs (ie: Ribeye Steak dog). I ate the Ribeye Steak dog and the Mole Chipotle Chicken Sausage dog and actually had dreams about it that night.....it was that good. The fries are pretty good, especially the cheese fries. The large order is enough for two people. Although the prices for the specialty dogs are a bit high (averages around $8.00), it is definitely worth it. They don't accept plastic so bring cash. DO NOT leave Chicago without visiting Hot Doug's....you can thank me later!
