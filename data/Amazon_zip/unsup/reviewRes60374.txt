Here are my issues with this place, which I hope will be helpful when you visit.My last visit was the second time at this place, and the same issue happened. There were six of us who came in. Nothing in the menu said that for a party of 6 or more, gratuity will be included. Below is a diagram of our bill:$169.00 - Subtotal  16.50 - Tax (9.76% of subtotal)-------------$185.50 - Total, including tax  38.05 - Service chg (gratuity, 22.51% of subtotal OR 20.51% of total)-------------$223.55 - Total with Service chgFirst of all, I'm not stupid. Except for this place, ALL restaurants I've been in charge a maximum of 18% gratuity, and they base it on the subtotal before taxes, not on the taxed total. I asked the manager why the large gratuity, and she said that's how they do it in their restaurant. I never experienced being charged 22.51% for gratuity.If you have anything to say, PLEASE make a response.Here are other complaints we had about this place:- they charged us $2 for a side of unagi sauce- the service was slow- when a waitress fixed the feet of our table because it was wobbly, she continued serving customers WITHOUT WASHING HER HANDS
