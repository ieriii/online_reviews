Never had a bad meal here, the steaks are not cheap & all side dishes are ala carte, so your bill can inflate pretty quickly, however the service & atmosphere are pretty consistent with the price you are paying. The steaks are the star of the show here, but salads & sides tend to be pretty good too. Too pricey for me to go here regularly, but nice as a "special occasion" dinner destination.
