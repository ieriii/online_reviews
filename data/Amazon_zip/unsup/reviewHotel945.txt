Well, bed bugs like it here, what more do I need to say? The shower hadn't been cleaned properly in the room, room was dirty upon close inspection. Reservation made for conference, couldn't get out with other hotels booked. Got bit like crazy, bed bugs all up in here! Checked them out on the internet and it turns out that they have had lawsuits at this hotel for bed bug attacks! Just put it into google and see for yourself. I'd avoid this place.
