I visited Chicago for my birthday and met a really nice guy during my trip. I mentioned I was vegan and he suggested this diner to me, and even offered to take me there the next evening. When we arrived we had to wait about 20 mins but the staff was nice and polite so I did not mind at all. Once we were seated we started with soy-shakes that were superb and delicious (chocolate coffee flavor=yum!). I had the "chicken fried steak" and I could not get over how great it was. It was the best I have ever tasted. The portions were so big I probably only managed to eat half even though it was so incredibly good. The waiter was very nice and my water glass never got close to being half empty. The date continued with a nice tour of Wrigleyville and the rest of the city. I was contemplating if it would be the best date I've ever had but Chicago Diner was the winning factor. ;)
