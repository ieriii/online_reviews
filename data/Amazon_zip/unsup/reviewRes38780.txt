Family Friendly place that offers great thin crust pizza. Had a group of 10 and were able to accommodate fairly quickly on a saturday night. The Chianti Wine was delicious as well as the bruschetta and mini personal pizzas. The staff is incredibly friendly and have made the experience worth while to be returning customers for a long time!
