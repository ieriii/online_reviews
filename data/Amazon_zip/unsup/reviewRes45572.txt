By the way: if you arrive late (and some restaurant guides tout the late hours), the menu is limited to sandwiches, and the kitchen absolutely closes at midnight. The food is good, but if you are thinking about this place after performances, it may not be the best choice. If only the staff would inform customers better about the the kitchen's closing time and, when they finally bring the bill, don't ask whether you wanted anything else. We did and went elsewhere to get it!
