When living in Pilsen, I enjoyed many meals at Nuevo Leon. I'd go as far as to say that it is the most authentic Mexican food that I've had (outside of Mexico and my families kitchens). It reminds me much of meals my grandmother used to cook for us when visiting Mexico. It has that homemade feel and taste, which is comforting.  The meal portions are large considering how inexpensive the dishes are. You are served chips and salsa (2 reds, 1 green) and a mini course/appetizer before your actual meal. The chips and salsa are both homemade and just perfect! The mini course can be a soup/stew, meatballs, taquitos etc. It is usually different each time, which makes it exciting. It gives you the opportunity to sample more from the menu. My favorite meal of choice is the Pollo en Mole, which is only $8! You just about get half of a chicken, so you'll get to enjoy another meal out of it. The chicken is boiled, so it perfectly juicy and tender. The mole is so tasty and not too spicy. It comes with rice and refried beans as well as your choice of tortillas (corn or flour).  The service is just as great as the food. All of the servers are very friendly and welcoming, which makes an already fantastic meal even better! Note: It is cash only! There is always plenty of street parking (metered) or they have a smaller parking lot around the corner.
