My girlfriend and I stumbled upon this place for a late night dinner on our first day (Sunday nonetheless) visiting Chicago and it was an incredible experience. The owner greeted us personally, made excellent food and drink recommendations, and checked in on us as regularly as the wait staff! Both the red and white sangria are the best we've ever tasted (and we have our fare share of experience!). Order the saganaki-- the owner let us throw in the alcohol instead of holding the whole presentation away from us. The sausage-stuffed chicken thigh is amazing and the chicken schnitzel made my girlfriend homesick (in a good way). We only wish we had room to try the desserts. I can't decide what is better about this place--the food or the owner's personal touch! He even offered to give us a free limo ride back--too bad we had driven there. The only advice I have is that if you are going to use the yelp offer, show the owner that you have redeemed it online (if you are using your phone) and there will be no problems at all. We can't wait to take our friends to this place in the future!
