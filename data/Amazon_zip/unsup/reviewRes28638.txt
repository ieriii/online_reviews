Do not get carry out from here unless you are going straight home, or happen to carry a large bowl around with you to mix ingredients in. I ordered pad lard nar, which is a single noodle dish right? Wrong. Apparently it is actually a cardboard box STUFFED with broccoli and completely plain unflavored noodles, and a separate, overflowing container of gravy and tofu. Good luck! (Especially since you won't be given a fork or chopsticks.) That being said, once I was finally able to assemble and eat the dish, it was pretty delicious.
