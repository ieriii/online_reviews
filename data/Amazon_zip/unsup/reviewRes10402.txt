Yay! I'm a fan. I have been to Piece twice now and it never disappoints. There's nothing like a good beer to complement your pizza, and Piece has lots to choose from. There was also no shortage of hoppy beers, which is awesome. The baked goat cheese was pure deliciousness. The portions are huge. We ordered a medium pizza and it was more than enough for two people. We stuck with the traditional tomato sauce and added basil, fresh tomatoes, garlic and Italian sausage. What is cool about Piece is that you can pick from an array of toppings and three different sauce selections. So you can really be creative and make any pizza topping fantasy come true. My only complaint about our topping choices was that there was A LOT of garlic. I mean, a lot. But, I still ate it and enjoyed every bite. We did have to wait at least an hour but we came at prime time on a Friday evening. I was fine with the wait as we made ourselves comfortable at the bar ordering hoppy beers, so no complaints from me. Our server was very friendly and we did not have to wait too long for our pizza once we put the order in. It's a cool vibe, and I believe they do karaoke on one of the weeknights. All in all, good and consistent experiences at Piece. I will return!
