It's like a nice bar that serves decent pizza. I wouldn't go so far as to say that their pizza is awesome, but it's definitely not bad. I've had take out from here before and it seems inconsistent at times, but I still like it. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, but if I'm in the area and want pizza. Thursday night is karaoke night. People here seem to sing a very eclectic mix of songs. cough* hipsters* cough *country*...
