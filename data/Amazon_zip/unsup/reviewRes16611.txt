Cool concept, cool decor, very interesting drinks made with very interesting combos of ingredients. You don't go here to get hammered (although a couple cocktails always do me in), you go here for the atmosphere and the fabby drink list. I highly recommend going with a group that doesn't mind sharing sips! The last couple times I've gone, it's been with two girlfriends, we each get something different to share and compare.
