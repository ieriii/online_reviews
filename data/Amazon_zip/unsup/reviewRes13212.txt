Glenn's has won me over.  Many a friend has read my review for Glenn's and begged me to try it again. Seriously, the soft shell crab po boy that I had had previously was really THAT BAD, I was hella reluctant. But, it's blocks from us and I wanted some seafood so in we went. For starters, the host gets 5 stars from me. We walked in on a Sunday at 5:00 thinking we'd be able to get in since it was early. We were told it would be a 45 minute wait. With a baby, that's tough and we went back outside to reevaluate the situation. That's when the host came out and said that if we promised to be done in an hour, we could have a table that was reserved. No problem! We're lucky if we can get the kid to sit still for an hour, easily done.  Thanks, host guy!  I had the Cajun BBQ shrimp. It was pretty amazing. I would definitely order it again. My dude had, well, I don't recall because I was that involved with my shrimp.  We were in and out in a hour, as we had promised the host. It was an altogether great experience and we'll definitely be back.
