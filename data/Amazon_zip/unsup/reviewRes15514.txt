This place is crazy sexxxy! It's gorgeously done and moody. The fabulous wing back chairs create an intimate setting within a large open room. The color, the curtains, the space are all truly hypnotizing. The lighting is perfect. Everyone looks great at the Violet Hour. The drinks and food are as good as the space itself. The staff is friendly, knowledgeable and attentive. We luckily went on a week night and got right in, but I would be willing to wait to get in if so needed. If I lived in Chicago, this place would be a weekly ritual for me. The mood of this place put a spell on me......I loved it.
