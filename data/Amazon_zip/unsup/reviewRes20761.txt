Although this place has sentimental value for me I can objectively say that I have never had a bad thing to eat here. The mussels are outstanding as well as the burgers. The service is always good. The crowd is quite good-looking and the decor and ambience are upscale without being shee-shee. I would suggest that "all the single ladies" hang out here too. There always seems to be about 5 well-dressed men for every woman.
