No one seems to be noticing my review of Icosium. Take it from me, this place is really great!!! Try it. The crepes and salads are delicious AND healthy. The staff is excellent. And there's a good liquor store nearby for a great BYO. Also, the Icosium ambience is funky and cool without being at all pretensious. Try it and let me know what you think!!!!
