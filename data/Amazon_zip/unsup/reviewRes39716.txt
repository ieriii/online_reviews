Love this place! I have been there 3 times and each time, the service was decent and the food great. The atmosphere is what I would expect from a restaurant where you cook at your table and people run around with charcoal pots. The service is abrupt, but who cares? I am not going to a restaurant to talk about my deepest issues with the servers. They are there to bring you food. You sit down, they throw down like 21 small plates of Kimche and different pickled ingredients. Very cool way to try a lot of new things at once. Also helps me when I go to H Mart because I know what I like. The meat is great but I think I go to this place for the experience and fun of it. I love cooking on the table, which doesn't surprise me because I like fondue too. I love that it is so interactive.  Take note, there has been a line every time I have been there, but it really wasn't that bad any of the times (all were on Fri or Sat night).
