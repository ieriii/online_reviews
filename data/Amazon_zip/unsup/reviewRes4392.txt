The Green Mill was the first real bar that I ever went to in Chicago over a decade ago, I got it right the first time, one of my all time favorite Chicago bars. I had just turned 21 and some older co-workers took me along, it was amazing. Oddly enough, I moved to Edge water a few years later and this became a regular hang (weeknights only) and I've seen some pretty amazing acts there. There is no way to describe or duplicate the vibe you get from this little place. I've had some amazing times here. The piano man that comes in early in the afternoon can hilarious treat you with various twisted songs. (theme from Spider-man, Girls on Film, Goodbye Horses) Even if you're not into jazz, you can have a fab time here but having a bit of music knowledge helps as this is a landmark location. The weekends are an absolute DON'T unless you simply have to see someone or there is an act you can't miss. The crowd is pure misery with a mix of Lincoln Park scenesters and tourists. Drinks are expensive, it's ALWAYS crowded and it generally won't be fun. But if you can go on a weeknight, get there at a reasonable time and get a table, pure gold.
