I grew up in this neighborhood and was back in the area with a friend so we stopped here to get a bite to eat and I was overall ok with the style ... All the bright colors photos in side and the bar area is cool to.. The only thing is the staff was more ingaged in work gossip then getting the orders in and out for people who are paying... Food was good the corn Muffins are fantastic... " try em". But when it comes to returning customers its all about the service.. And it just wasnt there this time for me.. would I go back? IDK.... Maybe if im in the area again...
