Tonight is our first time here, and we are loving every bit of it! Our room is clean, stylish and comfortable to hang out in. We really appreciate the attention to details that the Hard Rock displays, we immediately understood the brand as soon as we stepped in. Confetti exploded in our brains when we heard we could rent a guitar for free - we had no choice but to try it out! We even loved the guy who brought it up to our room, he was full of energy and personality. -- In fact, everyone we've encountered here has been that same way; which makes me think that either the company management treats them very well or that cool people just happen to work here (I hope both). I don't think one night here will be enough time to experience all that this hotel has to offer. We will definitely be back.
