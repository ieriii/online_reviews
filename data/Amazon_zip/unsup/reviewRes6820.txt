I have taken both my mom, my dad, good friends, and a few hot dates here on several occasions. I have never been disappointed!! The food is ALWAYS good, no matter what you order. The salads are yum, the entrees are yum, the deserts are yum. You can't go wrong here. My dad even loved it, and he lives in Italy half the time! I've also been to Italy half a dozen times in my life, and Sapori Trattoria is the closest thing you're going to find in Chicago to real quality Italian food. Try the salad with goat cheese, the caprese, melon wrapped in proscuito, pumpkin ravioli, chicken, tiramasu, irish coffee...really, everything is fantastic. Here's the best part - I have recently been put on dietary restrictions, and Sapori Trattoria is GREAT about adhering to your dietary needs without acting like you are a bad person for it (like some restaurants do). In fact, they even have gluten free spaghetti!! Yessss :-) Ask about their gluten free, lactose free, whatever options because they'll take care of you and you will NOT leave hungry. Sitting outside is nice. The downstairs dinning room is probably better than sitting upstairs, because I thought the music was a little too loud upstairs and it was hard to hear each other.
