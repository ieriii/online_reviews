yumyumyum! After stopping by here this winter for drinks, I finally decided to do a sit down dinner. They're menu is pretty great, a bit pricey, but what a wide menu for bar food/Irish inspired! They have drink specials every day of the week, and the best day is Sunday, because so many beers are just $2! I got the chicken/white cheddar chopped salad that was delish, I finished all of it. They sandwiches look amazing and huge, with great fries! They have a pretty good dessert menu, I would suggest the choc. guiness cake with guiness ice cream or the sticky toffee pudding cake. SO GOOD. I will definitely come back here again, specially cuz it's so close! Great place to take out of towners, too!
