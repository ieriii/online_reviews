OLD INEDIBLE BAKLAVA !!! This place does not mind selling its customers old baklava, i bought 2 pieces just today to try it after i read good reviews on Yelp, and i threw them in trash where they belong after the first bite. They tasted nasty, roten and old... i just couldnt believe it !!! and it is priced at $3.50 a piece !!! what a shame. shame on you !!! You just have to see those girls working at the register who can care less about your order.... Avoid this place by all means.
