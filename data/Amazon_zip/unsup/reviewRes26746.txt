I'm catching up on reviews - meal was last March, but the disappoint has stuck with me. This was our third time dining at Graham Elliot. Unfortunately, I think the restaurant is going downhill as quickly as Elliot's ego is inflating. The food was good, but nothing earth-shattering. The waiter was fine, but hardly on par (i.e. nowhere near) with the cost of the meal. Sprout, where we dined shortly before, was considerably better. Maybe this captures it: GE is the lollapalooza of fine dining. Great for out of towners and people who rarely go out and want to feel "hip". But if you saw the Pixies in the 90s, they're just old and fat now.
