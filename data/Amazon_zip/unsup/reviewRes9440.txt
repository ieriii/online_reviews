So, I had very high expectations for Sunday brunch here. It took long enough to get a reservation for a Sunday! When we arrived there were a ton of empty tables which begged to question why it took me so long to get a reservation. The menu wasn't too extensive in my opinion but I still found some interesting things to try. We did not try any alcoholic beverages but I did order a coffee (for a whopping $3.50 and I didn't even get refill!) The coffee was average at best. My boyfriend ordered the Marengo: "Omelette" which had scallops, shrimp, and giardiniera. It was decently sized dish which he really enjoyed. I had the Egg: Lyonnaise and I was not at all impressed. It had egg, frisee, truffle, pork belly and potato. When they say potato, they really meant french fries. However, other places on the menu french fries are referred to as Frites. Therefore, I was very disappointed when there were fries poking out of my dish. The egg wasn't very tasty either and was overcooked in my opinion. I've tried to make eggs in a pan of water and vinegar and that's exactly what this tasted like, I actually ate around the egg and for $13 it was a waste. The sides were actually my favorite but not quite enough to save the meal. The Lithuanian Bacon Buns were to die for and the sweet butter or cream that was served alongside them was out of this world. The Frites with Bloody Mary Ketchup were outstanding as well (tastier than the fries in my Lyonnaise. Overall, I was just extremely let down by this experience. I was so excited to try it out after hearing such amazing things but really the food was subpar in my opinion and for $54 I could have eaten three times at my favorite hole in the wall diner.
