My wife and I stayed for a couple of nights while in town for some meetings in the Near Northside area. I can agree with much of what's been said by other reviewers both good and bad: comfy beds, great location, very friendly staff, cool modern rooms, etc.; lack of windows in rooms with basically useless "balconies", issues with room temperature, frustrations with the keys and the various elevators, etc. That said, the biggest reason I have to mark this place down is, again as others have mentioned, the paper thin doors and walls. We stayed on a Friday and Saturday night when people were out enjoying themselves and coming back fairly late. No big deal. But even at normal talking volumes, not yelling, it sounded like anyone in the hall was actually in our room. It was impossible to sleep. Even the sirens outside sounded much louder than seemed normal. I actually tried shoving pillows at the bottom of the door to dampen the sound. It helped a little, but didn't really help us sleep (since it was still pretty loud and we were now short a couple pillows). It's a fun and interesting place at first, but clearly function (the function of sleeping, which is primarily what a hotel is for in my opinion) lags far behind form in this place. I would not stay here again.
