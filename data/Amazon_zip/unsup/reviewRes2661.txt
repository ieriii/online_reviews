Nothing beats a good ole Chicago hot dog! NY has absolutely nothing on us. When I first discovered Hot Doug's the wait in line was already around an hour. Now that it has been featured on Travel Channel shows, I hear that the lines are even longer! That is my only qualm about Hot Doug's otherwise I LOVE it! I think they're so creative with all their dogs and they taste so good. They have the standard Chicago style hot dog, but my favorites include the foie gras dog and any of their spicier ones. Try their duck fat fries although it's only served on the weekends. If you go to Hot Doug's be prepared to wait, but if you haven't tried it ever I really do recommend sucking it up and waiting in line to try it.
