Some of the best food in Chicago! Adorable restaurant and very friendly adorable staff. Went on a Sunday night and they had a small band (singer and guitarist) that just made the experience event better. The Romanian wine that was recommended was very good and complimented all the food perfectly. Had the sausage appetizer, the special chicken and the white chocolate crme for desert and i could not have been happier. At the end of the meal, the owner (who was very attentive and funny throughout the whole meal) came over to baptize us with a shot of Romanian liquor that he poured in our mouths. It was so much fun! I left feeling so happy that I was giddy, and it wasn't just from the liquor!
