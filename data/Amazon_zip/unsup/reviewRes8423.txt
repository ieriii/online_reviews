So my wife and I went during restaurant week and we got a good deal being $44 a person which included desert. I have been to brazzaz and chima and i actually thought the food was better there. You obviouslly go for the meat and it was good the staff was of course freindly and responsive but it just was not as good as the others. The salad bar was not very good as they only had a few items that you would see on a normal bar. I doubt i would go back but the food was good
