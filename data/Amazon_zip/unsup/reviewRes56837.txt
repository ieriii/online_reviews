I wanted to take my wife out on a romantic dinner. She only likes beef or steak. Not one to like seafood, not even lobster. She was skeptical when she read the menu and was mostly Asian cuisine. She ordered the spring rolls for starters. Then she got the bo la lot. Name says it all, it was enough to feed both of us. Same goes with side dish of house chicken fried rice. She enjoyed it immensely. I had the ground beef w/sate platter. It tasted wonderfully. The ambience. Music, candle lite and professional service made the experience unforgettable for my wife. The place was sheer romance. The website also alloes you to purchase flowers and it was on our table that night. Totally swept her off of her feet.
