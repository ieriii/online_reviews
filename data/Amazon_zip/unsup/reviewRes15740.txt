They say that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. Violet Hour's imitation of Sasha Petraske's and the rest of the New York speakeasies is sincere but severely lacking in execution. I understand that getting at table is tough and by 10pm, you're facing a line that's 10-15 deep. But the bouncer is reasonable, if not friendly, and you tend to make single serving friends as you suffer through inevitable wait to enter. However, said friends may be wearing a mind boggling choice of couture; golf polo, shorts and flip-flops. Perhaps not quite the sophisticated experience that the owners are going for. Dress code faux pas' aside you step inside and take in the dark and mysterious interior. A solitary bartender (in vintage gear no less) shakes cocktails under a spotlight of incandescence, and patrons in high backed booths sip cocktails and revel in a Chicago drinking establishment that doesn't have flat screen TV's above the bar, and Buck Hunter near the bathrooms. At first glance it seems nice enough, but then it's time to actually get your drink on. You order a classic such as a whiskey smash, or a caipirinha, and then you wait. And wait. Your wine buzz from dinner gradually fades, and you wait. Finally eons later, the drinks arrive and you contemplate ordering the next round before you've even had a blessed sip of the first. Don't bother. The drinks i'm sorry to say, overall are sub-par. Sweet when they should be bitter, bitter when they should be sweet. Actually, more of the former, as every cocktail I tasted was cloyingly saccharine. My whiskey smash easily had more simple syrup than whiskey. A penicillin tasted of sugar water, laced with absinthe.  The slow service, the terrible drinks, it was an uncomfortable experience and a complete waste of time. As culturally dull as the nightlife scene is in Chicago, Violet Hour is an unremarkable addition to the scene.
