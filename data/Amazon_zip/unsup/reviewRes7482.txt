in a weekend of 2nd chances (totally let down by Crobar again), me and my roommate decided to give this heavily touted restaurant another try, and boy was I glad I did. This time I went with the Angletti di Spinanci in a black truffle sauce. Absolutely delicious and leaps and bounds better than the gnocchi and pesto sauce I had gotten the time before. For an appetizer we once again got the avocado bruschetta which was on par as usual. Im glad I gave this place a chance and will definitely be back to try their $65 double date special that features 2 entrees and a bottle of wine. All i need to do is find the date to go with it.
