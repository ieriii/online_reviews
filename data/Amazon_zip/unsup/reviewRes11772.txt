Not bad. I really wanted a sandwich but alas I can't have wheat, so I stuck with the salad selection. I had the Smoked Asian Chicken salad which was ok but not fantastic. The rice noodles were too hard and the chicken was actually cut up pieces of what seemed like deli turkey. The dressing was quite tasty though. My friend had the steak and cremini mushroom salad which looked really good and the sandwiches my table got also looked excellent. The pancakes and french toast looked scrumptious.
