Did YELP pull my review? Hmmmm... Anyway Superdawg is a ripoff! It's days as the reigning hot dog mecca are long past. It's morphed from a must-experience institution to a pocket-pillaging ATM for the owners. No value remains. Very little by way of quality. $5.50 for a hot dog & fries? WHY? Because the can! Not only overpriced, but they've come up with cute little tricks to cut corners - like the insert in the burger box that reduces the amt of fries they give you by about half. In true SuperDawg style let me say... "See Ya! From the bottom of my value-loving heart!" Won't be back. 2 stars only because the food doesn't taste bad.
