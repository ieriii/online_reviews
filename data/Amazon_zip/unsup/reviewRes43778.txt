I love this cute, modern, and generally GOOD coffee place. After half and half recently closed, this is my new hangout. It is bright, clean, with great coffee (SF hazelnut latte skim). I love the waitstaff...friendly and super cheerful (but not in an annoying cheerleader way). It also grabbed a great location, right across the street from the damen blueline EL. Lovely!
