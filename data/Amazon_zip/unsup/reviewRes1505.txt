Let's face it. The world would be a better place if Zombies craved hot dogs instead of brains. Hot Doug's was my last stop on a 6 stand 'hotdog tour' of Chicago, straight out of one of those Travel CNN articles about Chicago's best hotdog stands. I was looking for the best overall hotdog experience, not just the best dog, or the best price. I'm glad I held it together and made it to this place, it was easily the best stand we visited that weekend. 9.75 out of 10, lost .25 since it wasn't the cheapest place we visited. I ordered the brat, with everything. My buddy ordered the Thurminger. They were so good, we went back and ordered more. Fries were right on. This place got points for price, taste, cleanliness, service (he'll tell you how you should top it if you ask him), and ambiance. If Elvis is alive, he eats here at Hot Doug's. So if you are a zombie, drop the medula oblongata and go to Hot Doug's. Ymmmm, more Doug's!
