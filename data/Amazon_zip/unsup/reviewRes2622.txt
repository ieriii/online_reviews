Since I only live a few blocks away and I'd heard people raving about this place for years, I decided to give it a try, since I found out they have a vegetarian hot dog. I waited in line for about 45 minutes; the owner (Doug) was incredibly friendly and took his time with each customer to make sure they were getting exactly what they wanted. The decor in there is awesome. My food was OK; the veggie dog wasn't as good as I expected, but it wasn't bad. I'll have to come back and try it again with a few friends, so I don't get bored waiting in line.
