If size matters to you, then ensure you get the female server.  Just kidding... well, no not really. Here's the deal - my dining companion and I noticed that at least on the patio, the female server brings out her bread baskets sporting the long bread sticks, while the male server brings his breadbaskets out with the short bread sticks (actually, they are just cracked in half and put into the basket). I know, I'm being petty, but it was just an observation.  In any event, a group of friends and I dined here last Friday and I loved it so much that I returned 2 nights later! The pasta is just perfect - especially the special pasta (stracinatte?) with the pesto, garlic and cherry tomatoes and the veal ragu (or prosciutto ragu). I've tried the grilled sardines, the stuffed zucchini flowers, the burrata, the above pastas, the stuffed roasted pork entree and the olive oil cake and I have not one complaint. I am, however, a pasta fan, and as Anteprima does theirs perfectly, I am smitten and slightly biased for life.
