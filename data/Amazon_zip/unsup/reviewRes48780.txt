Wow. I went for dinner the other night. I'm new to Chicago and was finding it very hard to find delicious food. Five different people kept telling me Publican, Publican, Publican. They were right. It is one of those places were EVERYTHING is good. Everything. From the beer (such variety!) to the apps (some fennel and cheese salad) and sides (fries with eggs were addictive, cauliflower gratin was equally amazing). Also yummy and memorable is the catalan fish stew (and I avoid seafood generally so that's saying a lot), the country ribs were a favorite of the table and the farm chicken with sausage was divine. Fun atmosphere, really really good food. Can't ask for much more. And can't wait to go back!
