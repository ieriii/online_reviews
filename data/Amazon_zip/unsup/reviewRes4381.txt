If you say you're from Chicago and haven't been here, then you need to start packing them bags.  This is one cool place, and I'm not even into music (gasp!). Though it is on the fairly expensive-side--both cover and drinks--you do get your money's worth if you stay awhile. And being that the joint is open until 4 o'clock in the AM, you can pretty much stay forever.  I'm not going to comment on the music because it's just a given. At the very least try the place out once. Real nice and cozy atmosphere. And if you being your gal with you, this just happens to be one of those places where making out is perfectly acceptable.
