Mia Francesca serves delicious food, the carpaccio appetizer, the Francesca salad and the daily menu are fantastic. I mean 20 years fantastic.  Service on the first floor is outstanding. But don't let them put on the second floor unless you willing to wait. I was unaware and had to sit with my salad for 50 minutes, I looked at my phone until the gentleman brought my entree from downstairs. I saw my waitress twice in an hour and a half. Lots of wait people standing around but none could give us butter for the bread. You know it is pretty bad when the manager feels sorry for you. The bread was great but the circus not so much.
