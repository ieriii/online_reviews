X marks the spot. Who would have thought that an ominous dark, warehouse entrance could lead you to a delightful sushi spot? At Sushi X, whereas the ambience might be slightly lacking, the sushi rolls pack such a punch, that they might as well serve them on cereal boxes, and you'd still be hollering for some more *if you could fit some more in the tummy, that is*. Forget watching whatever film they have playing as a backdrop to the mish-mash of chairs and tables cluttered about the tiny, Alice-in-Wonderland type of space. Once you're seated and have a menu right before you, you'll be in awe of the creative sushi rolls that come out of the mysterious back kitchen. Must haves include the Double Stack, Godzilla (I add eel to it), Yellow Jacket, and the Ginger Salad. Although at most other places, you could probably down 2-3 rolls before you curl over in gluttonous delight, 1-1.5 rolls is more than sufficient per diner. That being said, go in a group to try as many rolls possible. And, to really stretch your dollar, grab a gift certificate from http://restaurant.com - if you're on their mailing list, you can get gc's for 50% off, so that'll leave some room for dessert or the next trip to Sushi X.  Remember, Sushi X is a bit hard to find for 1st-timers. There's a black, warehouse entrance on Chicago Ave, near the Milwaukee intersection. There is street parking available and they also deliver, but not in the cool briefcase you see on their website. http://www.sushi-x.net
