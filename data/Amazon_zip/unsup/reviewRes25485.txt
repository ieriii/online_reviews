Had a great time there. The cheese fondue is good (had better but I guess it's as good as it can be in a restaurant). We had the entree with everything in (beef, chicken, all seafood choices...), it was delicious. I loved the different choices of vegetables and sauces. Chocolate fondue was to die for, and definitely too much! Service is very friendly and attentive. We arrived a few minutes early and were waiting at the bar, bartenders were super nice and made delicious cocktails. The place is georgeous and super romantic. I had an amazing evening there and will most likely be back.
