We have ordered from Art of Pizza twice now because Pie Hole wouldn't deliver to Andersonville. I love their thin crust. This is what pizza should be. The crust is not too thick or too thin. It has the right amount of cheese. And most importantly, they don't skimp on the sauce. Why is it most places put way too much cheese and forget the sauce? As far as I'm concerned, sauce makes the pizza. Love it, yay!
