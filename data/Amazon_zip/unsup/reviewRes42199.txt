Tank noodle is amazing!!! If you're willing to wait the few minutes it usually takes to get a table you'll have a lot of great inexpensive and delicious options for lunch or dinner. I crave this place when I'm feeling sick too. Try the Pho tai, and sauce it up your way with all the beautiful condiments including thai basil, peppers, chili sauce and limes. It's good food and good for you. Couple that with an order of hot jasmine tea and you'll be feeling better before they can bring the check!
