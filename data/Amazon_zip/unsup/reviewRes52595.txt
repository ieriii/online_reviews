Everything here is inconsistent. Although I sat with a large party, the place was pretty empty, since we had arrived for a very early dinner. Sometimes the waiters are breathing down your necks and sometimes you can't flag one down to save your life! The salad bar has lots of variety, but many of it seemed overly salty. In fact, a lot of the food here was either extremely salty (the beef ribs) or completely bland (the house special). We would have to request specific types of meats because they would never come around--and forget about the shrimp. We saw shrimp once and had to specifically request for them to come by with it at least 4 times before we even saw it again near the end of our dinner. There were LONG waits before another server came by with meat and a friend's drink didn't come until the end of the meal, while another's drink came within 5 minutes. The flan was also overcooked and not worth it. :/ I think the best thing about this place is the free cheesy bread... One word for this place: Random. I won't be back.
