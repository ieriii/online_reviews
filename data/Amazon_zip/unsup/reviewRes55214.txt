Went here for dinner and was it awesome. Come hungry because it's pretty much all you can eat. There are so many varieties of meat. You can pick which part you want them to cut. It's perfect. Fogo de chao is by far the best restaurant I've been to. It's definitely on the pricey side but well worth it. It's about $48 per person well for 3 of us it cost $220. But like I said its worth every damn penny
