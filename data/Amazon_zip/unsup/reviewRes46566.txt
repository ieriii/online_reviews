First let me thank yelpers Amanda W. and Rob L. for suggesting this restaurant. I really enjoy the quirkyness that is RJ Grunts. It's a pretty funny place. I do, however, feel that it's way too cramped in there. I was luck y when I went because I got one of the two seater booths which are off to the side. The bad part was the fact that it was right by the kitchen so there was a constant flow of traffic which was kind of annoying. The food was pretty good. I actually had a difficult time deciding what to order because everything sounded so good. I ended up getting the pattymelt with chips and a lemonade. Everything was really good! The server was pretty nice too except she kept referring to us as "girls" You know saying stuff like, "You girls doing okay?" Yuck. I'm more than positive that I was older than her. There was no wait which was especially nice for a saturday early evening. I would definitely like to try this place again. The menu was very enticing...in fact I already have some ideas of what I'm going to order. Oh and by the way I did take a peek at the infamous salad bar. Eh. There were no eggs. A salad bar with no eggs? boo.
