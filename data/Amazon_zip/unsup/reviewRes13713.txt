My first impression upon arrival was- "This is tiny... how quaint!" Somehow though (silly me), I got confused and thought they didn't serve standard American espresso drinks. Sadly, I turned to leave this adorable little place, but the barista waved me over and asked why I was leaving. I explained with a most pathetic look on my face (I'm sure) that I couldn't have any form of dairy anymore- not even soy. Sugar either, and that I couldn't have any of their tasty-sounding drinks. But the barista, warm and polite, explained to me that he could absolutely make me an Americano. And boy, was that Americano good! I'm really trying to get my girlfriend to come here with me. She's not a coffee drinker, but I think the look of the place will win her over and we'll be able to make more pit stops here. Thanks, 90 Miles!
