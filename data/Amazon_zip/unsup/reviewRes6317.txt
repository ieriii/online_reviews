Where do i start.....The atmosphere of this bar was one to remember, from the long bar to the cozy dining area surrounded by a gigantic wine selection for your choosing and can be purchase like any other wine store and only costs 7 dollars for a corking fee.  The staff was very accommodating including the owner and management staff. Got along so well with them, they sent over some free deserts. The food itself was awesome, myself and a friend order a number of different Italian dishes and we were more and more impressed with every bite. I saw a number of daily specials so you may want to call again.  I would recommend this place to anyone in Chicago.
