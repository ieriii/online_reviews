Crisp is a lot of things: clean, efficient, friendly, and bright... it's also very tasty. Furthermore, in the spectrum of korean fried chicken offerings, Crisp gets put close to the top because, quite frankly, there isn't much else around. That being said, they still make a great product and I think the Crisp BBQ and Seoul Sassy are really solid offerings. However, I can't in good conscience give this place a 4 or 5 when I know that there is better out there (namely Toreore in H-mart). I only went with the chicken so perhaps their other offerings seal the deal for this place, but, seriously, this place is called 'crisp' and has a chicken as a logo. Nothing personal Crisp - just keepin it honest
