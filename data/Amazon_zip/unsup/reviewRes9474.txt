If you don't want to break the bank, do brunch here! Let me start off by saying that me and husband are Dale fans. I was so excited to see him greeting us as soon as we entered. We ordered the truffle shandy and the afternoon delight, both of which were strong and refreshing. The brioche was soft and light and the chocolate and lemon sauces were perfect with it. I ordered the truffle quiche and I was expecting it to be super heavy but with the arugula salad it was pretty light. The quiche itself was super-creamy. I also got to taste the croque madame made specially for us without the ham and it was deliciously crispy. The only thing I wasn't very impressed with was the parsley potato. I would've liked it to be a little more flavorful.
