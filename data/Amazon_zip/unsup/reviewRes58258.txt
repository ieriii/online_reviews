If I can give this place negative stars I would. I stopped by there today at around 2:30 for lunch. The place was not too crowded and I sat by the kitchen area. I waited 30 minutes and no one came to take my order. I saw a few employees standing by the kitchen and they knew I had been seated for a long time and I asked them if someone was available to take my order. They said they were not assigned to my table and the person who was ...well she was taking care of others. Finally I left without being served and very angry.The employees there have a don't care attitude towards the customers because the place is always packed. I am disgusted by the way I was treated and will make sure to tell my friends, co-workers and family to skip this place.
