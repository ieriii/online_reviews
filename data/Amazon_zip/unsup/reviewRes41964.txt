This place is awesome...a true vietnamese find. I always get the seafood soup! It is a fun atmosphere, and funny, they load up on paper towels from the supply store and you see them stacked to the ceiling. Very authentic. All the plates delivered around you look delicious. There menu is a book, literally!
