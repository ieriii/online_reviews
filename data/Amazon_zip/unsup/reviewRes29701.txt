By far my favorite BYOB in the city! Generous portions of value-priced and absolutely delicious Thai keep my wife and I coming back and bringing friends along. Being in the shadow of the Western Brown Line el stop, this is a great launching point when heading to Belmont (Vic) or downtown for a show later in the evening. The Aragon and Riviera are a short bus ride away (Lawrence) as well if you're heading in that direction. Try the Peanut Lovers dish...it's what my wife craves!
