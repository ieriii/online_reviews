I love the pizzas here. They cook fast, and the service is prompt. The location is great for walkers, train commuters or drivers. Seating is a bit tight, but it's not a problem. The only downside is that it can be a tough date place, because the "hard materials, flat surfaces" design choice causes noise to bounce all over the place. Conversation can be a real challenge on a busy night. Not a place I would go weekly, but a great treat now and then, best enjoyed with old friends, not people you're trying to get to know or romantically woo. The pizza is just fantastic.
