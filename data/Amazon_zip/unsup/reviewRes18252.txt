I really love almost everything I have had to eat here, but do not plan to come on a Friday or Saturday between 7-9 and just waltz right in and find a table, it just won't happen. The wait will seem a bit daunting, but believe me it is well worth the wait, and they will call you when your table is up so head down the block to the bar on the corner and have a drink (or two) while you wait, the time will fly by. As others have said the gnocchi is to die for. Recently we went here for a girls night out and the waiter suggested trying it with a creamy mushroom sauce, it was delish, but I still love the original. Lasagna is great, as is the creamy carbonara, actually I can only think of one dish I have not enjoyed (porcini pappardelle) the entire time I have been coming here. If you're patient (waiting for a table) and like to enjoy a good meal where you won't be rushed that's BYOB try Caro Mio and when the menu is too much for you trust the waiters, they always have a helpful suggestion.
