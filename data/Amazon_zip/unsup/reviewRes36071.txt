My 3 stars might have been 4 if the person I went with hadn't hyped it up for about a month. "Best breakfast ever". Bold statement, I know. Regardless this place is a very typical breakfast place, definitely sits nicely in greek town. Nice decor, relatively small place though, generally friendly staff except when you try to get a table without your whole party present (one other person).  Nothing mind blowing or spectacular on the menu, everything gets the job done though. I only got around to the breakfast side of things so I'm not sure how the rest of the menu plays out. There's also this rule to breakfast, who knows where I heard it, probably my own head, but skillets are to be made with old fashioned hash browns NOT baby reds. I would've been all over that menu option if they went the other way on the potato front. Maybe baby reds are fancy or classy OR the trendy way to go, but if you're serving something in a skillet you are now obligated to put hash browns in it. Lastly, we ordered a 'side' of french toast to share with our own dishes we had ordered. The waitress failed to mention there isn't a smaller size and just went ahead and placed a full order of them, still paid full price, no big deal but I'm pretty sure someone else would've found a reason to complain about that. Overall good experience, decent breakfast. If you want to really enjoy breakfast and possibly have your mind blown may as well head over to Toast or the Bongo Room.
