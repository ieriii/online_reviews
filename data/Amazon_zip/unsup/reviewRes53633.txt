My beau and I had dinner at Schwa on Friday, July 1st and to say we were blown away would be an understatement. I am fairly traditional in my food experiences/preferences. Schwa pushed my comfort level, taste pallette, and food sophistication to the nth degree. It was beyond compare. The young men serving drinks, setting silver and serving and explaining our dishes were wonderful. They were humorous and well spoken when explaining each dish as they served it. We couldn't agree on our favorite food but the schmore dish, the rabbit and the crab dish were amazing. Thank you so much Chef Carlson and staff, for such a wonderful evening.
