Fun, beautiful location overseeing the area just south of Watertower on Ontario and Michigan Avenues in Chicago. The entryway is Grand - a sweeping staircase (escalator) brings you up to the restaurant which is enormous. The style is sort of a nouveau art-deco. Lots of gold colors, archways and very nice glass lamps highlight the restaurant. We had a table on the Ontario side of the restaurant with beautiful street views. We went for an early dinner (late lunch?) at around 4PM on a Friday. There were probably a lot of people there, but the size of the place and the number of tables dwarfed the number of people. So, we, a party of six, were seated immediately. The menu is very large and diverse. We all had different items off of the menu from hamburgers to salads. I had a cuban sandwich which had a nice twist to it. The bread was outstanding, the pulled pork fresh and tasty. It had prosciutto and also had a spicy relish along with traditional mustard. I don't eat cheese, so I skipped the swiss. But, overall it was very good. Their french fries are served Belgian style and were excellent. Finally, the service was outstanding. Definitely a go to again restaurant.
