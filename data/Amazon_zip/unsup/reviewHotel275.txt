We recently stayed at the Seneca for two nights during the week. We got a decent deal online, which is why we chose to stay here. How to describe the Seneca...well, it kind of reminded me of grandma's apartment. Nice, comfortable, functional, but kind of old school. In fact, I believe the rooms are converted studio apartments. At least ours was. The kitchen was fully functional. It had a refrigerator, range, microwave, plates, glasses, pots, pans, etc. etc. The bathroom was very small, and again resembled and apartment bathroom...not your typical big hotel bathroom. The furnishings were also nice, just dated. Other upsides of this place... The hotel staff was very nice The location is great, just east of the John Hancock So if you are looking for romantic or trendy, this is not your place. But if you want functionality, the Seneca definitely fits the bill.
