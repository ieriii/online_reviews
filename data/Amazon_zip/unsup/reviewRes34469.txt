Read a lot about this breakfast spot so decided to do the trek with my little daughter in tow. We came on a Thursday morning so we didn't have to wait for a table. Service was attentive and very friendly. The hostess came over to say hello right after we were seated. I happened to mention that it was my daughter's birthday and the next thing we know, she comes out with a strawberry nutella crepe and candles. My daughter loved it!  While the service was great, the food left a little something to be desired. I ended up ordering the blueberry banana pancakes. They were fine, but nothing special. Turkey sausages were ok, bacon was nice and crispy, coffee was so-so. I left somewhat disappointed because I really wanted to like this place, but agree that there are better breakfast spots out there. I will say, though, that they are family-friendly and serve up really big portions.
