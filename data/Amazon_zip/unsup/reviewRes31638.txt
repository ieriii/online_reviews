Sunda has moved onto my list of favorite Chicago restaurants, maybe because the brussel sprout salad is literally one of the best things I've ever eaten in my life. We celebrated my mom's 60th birthday here. Indian parents are the true test for good service (even more so than the plethora of celebrities that frequent this place) because they can be extremely demanding and are not easily pleased. So, I can say without a doubt that the service was excellent. The restaurant was very trendy, and we got to eat at this large table in the center of the restaurant, which I thought was awesome, but everyone else disliked because of the bench seating. I knew they'd find something wrong with the place, so I'm totally fine if their only issue with the entire experience was lack of back support. I had heard the restaurant was very loud, and it wasn't a problem at first because our reservation was at 5 pm, but as the place started to fill up it did get really hard to hear what everyone was saying. The waiter introduced the menu by saying everything was set up for sharing. (Hey, I think I've heard that somewhere before.) So of course, we opted for the small plates/sharing. In addition to the salad, we really liked the corn fritters. The stuffed avocado sounded much better than it tasted, and the shortribs were fall-off-the bone tender but lacked flavor. I was confused though because he said even the entrees are meant to be shared, but it just looked like a regular meal to me. The drinks are also delicious and I highly recommend the Polynesian Storm. I will most definitely go back again for the brussel sprouts, but will try new items for the rest of the meal. We got a reservation the day before because we were eating so early, but for a weekend dinner at a normal time you have to plan weeks in advance.
