I visited Sunda after hearing rave reviews about the atmosphere and food from a couple of different co-workers. As I live pretty close to it and my friend from out of town wanted to get dinner at a good Chicago restaurant (read: non-chain or tourist trap), I told her to meet me here for dinner. FOOD: Crispy shrimp "toast" and spicy tuna "jam" - Nice, fun dish. The shrimp were definitely ground up within the "toast", but this was delicious. Definitely something to get instead of edamame for a starter. Miso bronzed black cod - Fork-tender and flavorful, a perfect complement to the pork belly. I really liked this sablefish, and it was perfect with a side of Sunda's jasmine rice. Adobo braised pork belly - I LOVE pork belly. And the serving size was enormous. It was prepared with care. Add all of those up? This is one of my favorite pork belly dishes of all time. Lychee and raspberry sorbet - Light and refreshing, this was a perfect dessert for the time. It was gone before I knew it! Sunda also has great cocktails (don't remember what I tried...perhaps another reason why I think the cocktails are so good??), and it's a trendy spot to hang out on a Thu/Fri/Sat night. SERVICE: Service was fine overall. Our server was very nice and knowledgeable, and gave us good recommendations and suggestions. She was also around frequently to see if we wanted anything else and water service was top-notch. OVERALL: The hype is justifiable in my opinion. Sunda is popular for a reason - consistently good food, a great atmosphere (if not a bit loud), and a solid menu suitable for everyone. One small beef with Sunda - they don't have any "half-portions" like places like Sable have on the menu for its larger plates (although Sunda DOES have a good helping of small plates of their own). I'm the type of person that likes to try a little of everything, not a lot of one thing when trying out new restaurants. But the food quality and taste delivered, so no more complaining. Just more eating.
