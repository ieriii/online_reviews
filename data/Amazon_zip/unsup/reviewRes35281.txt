Solid seafood restaurant with a 1940's vibe and generally upscale service. The raw oysters were superb, crisp and cold and delicious. The drinks and wine were very good, although the waiter disappeared a bit too often and we had to rely on the food server for wine advice. A bit strange. Main courses included a terrific soft shell crab dinner, sauteed in lemon & wine, and a Surf and Turf with tasty king crab "legs" (a bit too small, though, and merely cut pieces) with a perfectly cooked steak. Our teenage son polished off his bowl of seafood gumbo, and the little one had a generous helping of excellent, authentic fish and chips. Desert was a stand out raspberry pie - wow - and also chocolate ice cream with a side car of hot fudge. Lemon sorbet was way too bitter, with obviously added lemon rind - not our favorite. Desert wines were not served with the deserts, but a tad too late; another misstep. Still, the food is simple, fresh, and well prepared, and I would absolutely come back again.
