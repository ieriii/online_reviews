I've eaten here too many times to count. Although the atmosphere is kitschy, Nuevo Leon is unbeatable in terms of value. The menu leans gringo, but it's also stocked with traditional Mexican fare. Bring your own booze (there's a liquor store a door or two away), but definitely avoid the Sunday brunch rush.
