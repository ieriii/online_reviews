I ordered the wrong thing, but overall my experience was good. We sat on the heated patio (and had no lack of heat). In fact, I was right next to the fire place. They seated us at a table for two where I was in an over-sized wicker arm chair of sorts - very cozy.  The croquetas and empenadas were excellent, and my friend really enjoyed his ropa vieja sandwich. I got the veggie dish, but it was mostly peppers which i don't really like to eat straight-up.
