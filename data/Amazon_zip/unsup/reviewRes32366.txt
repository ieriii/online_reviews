Really great service. Our waitress had the perfect balance of "checking in with us" and giving us time and space to eat. I'm vegan and I got the fabulous reuben sandwich with vegan cheese and sweet potato "fries" (they don't deep fry their "fries"). I'm addicted. I"ve been going in at least a few times a month to get the reuben. My non-vegan friend got the eggs benedict and said they were pretty good. I tried a little of the weird tofu stuff that comes with it and wasn't very impressed (it was bland and had a weird consistency), but my friend said that other than that, it was a great meal. Vegan cookie for dessert, and we were happily stuffed and satisfied. Great job Chicago Diner!
