Uh, what isn't there to love here? The incredible beer selection is what to come for, and if you're feeling like you have a little room left over, stay for the meal. Sure, it's easily a 2 hour wait on a Saturday night, but with a good group to drink with, it usually passes pretty quickly. Try the Kasteel Rouge..a Belgian cherry beer that I've recommended to many. Oh yes, they serve food too! CB&J, duck reuben, steak frites, lots of delicious entrees. BUT let's not forget the essential: mussels! Oh and their fries are pretty much perfect for how much drinking you're doing too...
