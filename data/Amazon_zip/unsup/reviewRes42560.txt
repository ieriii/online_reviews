I was a bit disappointed in their deep dish. Although I generally don't listen to hype, many friends told me nothing but rave reviews about this place so I went to check out their deep dish. The crust was admittedly very good. However, their sauce was nothing to write home about, their cheese was good, but not quite anything special. Their sausage was all right, but I do prefer Giordano's style. The workers were very courteous and the restaurant was very clean, so that was definitely a plus. I do want to give them a second chance, but this first impression was simply so-so.
