Every time I want to write a review about this restaurant my mind goes racing feverishly about their delicious food. The memory brings in me the worst primitive instincts. It's that good! As a descendant from Central Asia I'm a big fan of bread, goat cheese, and good mutton. Noon O kabob caters to my primary in-born palate. Their menu is not complicated, but the secret of their cooking as one old Persian man remarked to me while waiting for table, is that it's simply made of fresh ingredients. True. Naan is always fresh out of oven and Baba Ganojh is not parched. Their lamb koubideh is amazing with charbroiled tomatoes. As an appetizer I highly recommend eggplant dish to go with your nan. As I write this review I am already drooling . . .
