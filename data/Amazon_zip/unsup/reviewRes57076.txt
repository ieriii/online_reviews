So the other day I was walking to another establishment but passed Revolution Brewing and decided to go there instead. It was the best change of mind ever. The Apple Wood Smoked Wings = Super Tasty, spicy but still full of flavor, they don't have ranch dressing though. Margherita Pizza = Even Tastier, the tomatoes were to die for and the fresh basil added a lot of flavor. I had the Bottom Up Belgian Wit - delicious. I can't wait to go back for a dinner so I can try more food and drink more. : )This was also my first outing in Logan Square....I'll be visiting more often.
