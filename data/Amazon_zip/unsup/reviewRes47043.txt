Uncommon Ground is a great place to bring family, friends, or out of towners. It's a very unique place using locally grown ingredients (many of them grown on the roof of this establishment- how cool is that?!) Apparently a lot of the decor is salvaged material that has been restored which is pretty cool and funky too. Uncommon Ground has a nice big bar with comfortable seating throughout the bar area. They also have a large dining room and a nice outdoor seating for nice weather days. I've sat in all three areas and been comfortable and well taken care of. Some things to try- spinach artichoke dip, burgers, sunshine salad, honey mustard chicken sandwich type thing, their daily flatbread. Everything tastes fresh and yummy. The waiters are all very nice and well informed about their menu. YUM!
