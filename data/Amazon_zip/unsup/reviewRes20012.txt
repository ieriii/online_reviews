Coast began what was to be a very tasty night. We had a great server, although we did have to open our own bottle of wine. I find it odd that Coast will limit the amount of wine to one bottle per two people, tell you that legally they're not allowed to open it, and then throw you a corkage fee on top of all that. I guess it's the ambience and reputation. Still, the both the food and the service were perfect . I wouldn't say it's the best sushi ever, but the server was honest and steered us in the right direction, and we enjoyed every bite. We had the scallops and the soft shell crab appetizer to start, both very tasty. We ate our way through four rolls and a piece of nigri: white dragonroll, coast crab roll, po boy roll, white dragon roll. Suzuki nigri because I love me some sea bass. They were all very good, my favorites being the white dragon roll and the coast crab roll. Full though we were, I had spied a strawberry chocolate dessert on the way in that I felt needed to be ordered. I'm glad I did. It doesn't seem like something that would be in a sushi restaurant, but oh was it yummy. Coast, I like you, but I don't like your BYOB rules. They're weird!
