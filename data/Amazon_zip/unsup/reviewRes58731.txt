The food is good. But not great. At least not for the price and the skimpy portions. Having had several meals under the chef's directions I can tell you that if choosing the chef's menu, you will be surprised once or twice, very pleased at least once, but disappointed at the end. You feel as if you were promised a magical journey of gastronomical delights, but then wind up with cheesy rice and cheezit crackers. Or popcorn sprayed lightly with truffle oil. Both easy and a let down. I expected more each and every time I visited (total 3 to give it a fair shake.) The service is American. The dishes are midwest haute cusine. The prices are more for NYC or Paris or Shanghai. Overall I think you should try it, but most likely you too (if you've had a bit of culinary exposure) will come away a bit bummed and still very hungry. One gets the inkling that he is trying too hard to impress, and that in and of itself is non-impressive. Taking a concept cuisine and making it seem effortless as Joel Robichon does is something that is not easily done.
