This is definitely a restaurant ideal to celebrate a special occasion...and it shall not disappoint! The food was absolutely stupendous and the perfect amount. For eight courses at the right size, you leave perfectly satisfied and not overly full or wanting more. Make your reservations well in advance as they fill up quickly. What I was really impressed with was their fantastic customer service, which started before we even went to eat there! They called to confirm the reservation a week in advance, and the person on the phone explained when to show up, and as their BYOB, explained that they partner with a few wine stores who suggest pairings and will actually drop the wine off at the restaurant for you! They recommend two to three bottles of wine - you can take back what you don't drink even if you've opened it or you can do what we did and give the rest of your last bottle to the wait staff. (And BTW the wine partners offer amazing suggestions for the food based on your palette/preferences for wine - all at fantastic prices.) At the restaurant, the service, the timing, everything, was wonderful. It's not snobby at all either, which one may expect from the pricing and quality. It was very comfortable and if you want to wear jeans, no one will raise an eyebrow. You'll be there for a few hours, eat amazing and very inventive food, drink your wine and have a celebratory experience worthy of the occasion of which you're celebrating. Enjoy!
