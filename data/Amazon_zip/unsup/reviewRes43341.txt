I am a sucker for weekend brunch, and I always request to go here when I visit my friend who lives in Wicker Park..... very much an MMMMM breakfast. Great coffee, and the panini breakfast sandwich is excellent. The only downside is the layout of the restuarant. They make you wait in the corner where the waiters have to walk through and you feel very much in the way. That said, at least you get to order right away, so your food is being made while you wait!
