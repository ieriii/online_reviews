The Sultan;s Market, has the best falafel sandwich in town! I love it totally delicious, their chicken platter is also very flavorful. However I would have to say their lamb tasted a bit dry and unflavorful and they are not that cheap but they do give you a decent amount of food, you won't leave their feeling hungry. I would go back there just to get the falafel sandwich.
