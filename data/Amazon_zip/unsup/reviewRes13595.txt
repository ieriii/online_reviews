I'm going to try to be brief: Good food, bad service, and this has been pretty consistent the 3 times I"ve been there.  The last time I went there was the worst and we aren't going to return here. We ordered 2 iced teas, 2 cups soup, an appetizer, I had a salad, and husband had a fish dinner. The food came out ridiculously out of order. First, entrees came out pretty quickly. We hadn't even gotten our drinks at that point.  Then the appetizer and all the rest of the food came out about five minutes later, all at once, all smooshed on our little 2 person table. We had to ask again for our drinks and for refills later into the rushed confused meal. The waitress had to apologize about 3 times for screwing things up. We shared a piece of pie (secretly figuring they'd probably at least give us this free for all the goof ups). No, the bill was exactly as it was. They didn't take anything off the bill for this very uncomfortable, botched dinner! No need to return, the food was good, but not great (though my husband likes the heavy food much more than I do).
