This place totally lives up to all of the hype! I have to say, this was one of the best meals that I've had in a long time. The catfish, collards and grits were amazing. My friend's pork belly was amazing (which I typically dont like, but they do it right). The whiskey selection can be a little intimidating, but our server did a great job of guiding us. We experienced one little glitch... our cheese plate took a bit long to arrive and our entrees arrived before one of our starters. But for a week old restaurant, I can overlook it. All in all, we had a fabulous night. Great staff, cool spot, delicious food. Cant wait to see the inn upstairs when it opens. Thanks Longman & Eagle!
