This is a super overdue review. That sentence is both assonant and truthful. I had been hoping to go back to Demera to confirm my initial impression from several months ago before reviewing but haven't gotten back. Life gets in the way of delicious foodstuffs sometimes.  Anyhoo, it was the Groupon for Demera that got me back on the Ethiopian wagon after an initial trial probably fifteen years ago. I was vegetarian at the time and my family went on what my dad would call "an urban adventure" down to Addis Abeba in Wrigleyville. For whatever reason, Ethiopian did not make a hugely positive impression on me. Fast forward to cashing in this Groupon. I found the glossary on the menu to be extremely helpful. Not only in terms of the dishes, but also the description of the injera. I think it might be the only man-made superfood: gluten-free iron and protein in a spongey pancake. Sign me up. Also, our waitress was helpful and put us all at ease in this brave new world of deliciousness.  Since the Groupon was for the whole shebang, we had an appetizer, vegetarian messob, dessert and a bottle of wine. They were out of the honey wine but the red we had was an excellent complement to the food. Our appetizer was the sambussa sampler, and wowsers, they were good. They definitely rock the boat if you're aiming for lower-fat eating (fried dumplings will do that) but sharing a couple is worth it. Three of us shared the messob for two (choosing everything but #27, 28, 31) and had plenty. Especially me. I ate a lot.  The prices without a Groupon are manageable and it's definitely possible to fill up without the appetizer/entree/dessert combination. It's also a shade more elegant than you might expect on the corner of Lawrence and Broadway (no offense to Green Mill or the ghost of Al Capone). I hope to visit and eat a lot again soon.
