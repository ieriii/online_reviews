I came here for the first time for lunch during the workday. I called ahead and they said 8 people wouldn't be a problem. During the week before 2pm you serve yourself at the counter and don't really have to wait a long time to get any food. Many of the choices are point and receive style along the line. 20 minutes for a Chicken Kebab to cook up for lunch which isn't bad at all. Artopita with Mushroom and Emmenthal was the right amount of flaky pastry, small mushroom pieces and cheese that melted and ran out of the side as you cut into it. The lunch came with a pasta salad to accompany. On an Hour Lunch time schedule along the west loop it's perfect to stop by after finding parking which can be dodgy here and there during the rush of lunch time. Go between 1-2pm if you want to get in and out within the hour.Definitely would go back again and again because it's delicious and made well fast and reasonable for lunch.The bakery counter is unavoidable especially if you have a love of beautifully crafted pastries and breads. One and only criticism is they have tiny bottles of water/soda/juice to choose from. Tiny, cute over priced bottles. Other than that A-Ok.
