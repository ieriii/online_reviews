I'll be honest, as a New Yorker i normally stay away from the lines regardless of what people say about the quality of the food. This time I was the tourist with my father at the whim of my sister and her boyfriend. I'm glad i wasn't the one in control because i may have walked away immediately. This was by far the best dog(s) I've ever had. fantastic ingredients and wonderful spices... its hard to get a bad dog. Dont worry about which one you should get. you will not be bummed out... Doug was waiting at the register to take our order and really gets the concept of not rushing people through the ordering process. I committed to waiting as soon as i saw the line so you dont need to make it up to me by rushing me when i get to the front. That might be what i appreciated the most. Doug. He gets that its about the person at the front of the line. Not the back. get the italian style chicken sausage dog. its amazing!
