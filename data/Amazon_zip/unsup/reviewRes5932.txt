Just went here last night and WOW WOW WOW. I will start with my only complaint: this place does not take reservations. It was fine because we were going to a concert on a Tuesday and showed up at 5:30...there were plenty of seats, however the no reservation thing will keep us from going here most nights. Now on to the good stuff: Wine list--fantastic. Drinks, martinis, etc...fantastic. We were with a group of 4 and got several things, ALL of which were amazing and served with perfect timing.  Ricotta cheese with honey--holy cow. Cheese plate--wow, ravioli, pasta, pork shoulder with polenta, filet and octopus--ALL AMAZING. I wish we could have had dessert, but we needed to get going. OH! And the decor is spectacular. Wine everywhere, open windows--super neat. CAN'T WAIT TO RETURN! This place is a rare find.
