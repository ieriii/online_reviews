Came here last Saturday for Mike Jones from Las Vegas. This place has a great vintage feel to it with good acoustics, atmosphere, and drinks. It's a bit hard to find seats when you get here late so come early. They charged us $12 on Saturday but the band played on till 5 in the morning. The only bad thing about this place is the proximity of the bathrooms to the stage as it's really distracting when you're trying to enjoy the music and people are walking in and out of the restrooms right next to the drummer.
