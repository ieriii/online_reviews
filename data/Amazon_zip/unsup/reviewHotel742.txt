This place was awful and I do not intend to go back even if the company is paying for it. If you sign up for a package and misread the fine print and don't ask a question and they stick you with a charge, that's your fault. However I called down to the front desk and asked them specifically if my room (rate schedule in hotel speak) covered Internet charges. They said yes on Friday, but when I checked out on Monday I was pleasantly surprised with several internet charges that they're not taking off. Also - if you're expecting to sleep soundly til say 9, you'll be awakened by the sounds of their maintenance and renovation crews drilling things into the wall or dropping things on the ground. Which is something they don't tell you about when you check in.  Yes the beds are comfortable but there's another Westin on River North that's really easily accessible. Or there's about a dozen other hotels that you can pick from along the Magnificent Mile. Don't stay here. If you have a reservation, cancel it. Tell them I told you to. You'll end up paying way too much to be disappointed.
