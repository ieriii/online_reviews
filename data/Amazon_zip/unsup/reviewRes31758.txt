Sunda has great decor, beautiful people, classy atmosphere, AMAZING desserts. Unfortunately what made this review is what Sunda LACKS. I am usually not one to harp on price, as I am willing to spend a good bit on a fab meal, however, my meal here was not fab. $10 for a veggie roll- which is LESS tasty than the rolls I get at Green Tea for $2? $8 for cauliflower? $5 for jasmine tea? After these prices I was expecting an orgasmic dining experience. NADA, nothing happened. My tummy was no longer rumbly, and the food was edible, but....umm...NO. Not terribly pleased. Add that to a trip DOWNSTAIRS to go to the bathroom, acoustics so HORRID that I could barely hear my dining companion, uncomfy chairs and Sunda is left with 2stars. Our server was fine, nice enough, but nothing special. The desserts are the only thing that made my experience memorable, my bread pudding WAS very good- but If was looking for a great dessert place I would head to Hot Chocolate, NOT Sunda.
