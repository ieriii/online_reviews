Went in on a Sunday right when they opened... Sat in the bar and waited for about 10ish minutes just to have a menu brought to us (that's why the -1 star). I'm inpatient! I can't help it... The food was great. Had Calamari, the chopped salad, and zesty gnocchi. All were fabulous! The chopped salad is truly out of this world! I would definitely come here again, hopefully I won't be waiting 10 after I'm seated to get a menu though.
