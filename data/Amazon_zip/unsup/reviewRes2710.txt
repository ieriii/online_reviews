Oh, where to begin with a review of Tru. The decor is something out of an 80's horror flick. The meal is a long one so be ready. The courses never stop. The service is the best I've ever had, and it will probably always be the best I've ever had. It was like everyone that worked there had choreographed the serving process. Almost scarey. It's what I like to call ART FOOD. I'm not much for art food. It was beautiful, and almost everything tasted ok. Nothing wowed we with taste. It's like presentation over shadows the taste so you kind of forget the food is just good at best. There was a lot of gelatin going on. I had 3 course that had some sort of jell-o like substance in them. Everyone dining there seemed a bit pretentious. I laughed alot while I was there. It was an experience for sure.
