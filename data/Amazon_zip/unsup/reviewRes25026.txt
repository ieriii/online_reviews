If it wasn't for restaurant week we would have never found this place but good thing we did. It was great. Service was outstanding from every single member of the staff. We arrived 15 minutes early for our reservation and were still seated immediately. It smelled like bad oil when we walked in but that went away after a few minutes. We had a 3 course meal for $33 and loved every bit of it. The cheese appetizer was delicious. I'm lactose intolerant and this was worth getting sick for. The main course of chicken, steak, and veggies was pretty good. The set of 8 dipping sauces really made the course. As far as dessert...MMMMMMmmmmmm. Chocolate dip with graham cracker crumbles, YES! The meal also came with coffee, a nice touch. The building was really cool. Very unique. A great place for a date or to get together with friends.
