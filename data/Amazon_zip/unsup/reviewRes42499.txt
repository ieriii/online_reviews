I'll leave the pizza debate up to all the haters out there. The fact of the matter is, I wouldn't dare make the generalization that "This place has the BEST pizza". That's none-sense. Despite it's namesake, I give The Art of Pizza four stars for everything BUT the pies. Don't get me wrong. These guys have a great pizza. Both thin and deep dish. The sauce, buttery crust, gooey cheese. It's totally solid. But have you ventured into the other 85% of the menu? First off, the submarines are total shitkickers. About a foot and a half long, and crammed with all the goodies, these are the real deal. For $4.99, they are a downright steal. Their dinner/lunch specials are shockingly good deals. Monday night's lasagna is fantastically huge piece with bread, soup and salad for a mere $5.99!!! Given, it ain't gonna blow your mind, but frankly, it's a solid homemade lasagna, the soup was obviously homemade and delicious and all that for well under $10?! Beef and sausage combos for $1.99 on Wednesdays?! Come on, the prices here are verging on scandalous!!! Check it out!
