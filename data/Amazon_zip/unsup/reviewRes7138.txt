Ask for Rachel as your server! She was awesome and added to the entire dinner experience. We had a great time, the food is bomb and the best is it's totally reasonable. $12 for enough pulled pork to last you a dinner and following lunch. You can't eat for less $ in the Gold Coast.  Great value, cool atmosphere, I give it 4 stars
