I came to Cafe 28 for brunch on my brother's recommendation and holy cow, it did not disappoint.  The server was really personable and when I ordered fruit for my 8 month old, he came out with mickey mouse pancakes covered with fruit and said it was compliments of the restaurant. That type of service alone gets 5 stars, but believe me people, it gets better.  I ordered the Honey Jalapeo Pork Chops and they were, in one word, orgasmic. The meat was tender and the flavor was sweet with just a tiny hint of heat. Perfecto! The black beans and white rice are delicious as well. The beans have this smokey flavor that when mixed with the plain rice is awesome! My food at Cafe 28 was so good, I seriously contemplated licking my plate when I was done. Not only was the service awesome and the food incredible, but they have the best mojito I have ever had (and I have had a few). This place is a triple threat!
