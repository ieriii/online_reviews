I really wanted to like this restaurant since we live so close to it. Unfortunately the whole experience was not good. It started with a cockroach-like looking bug scurrying across the floor under our table - we were told it was a water bug. We overlooked this bad start (it was a nice day and the doors were open a lot so there was a good chance it just came in) and ordered our meals. The Caesar salad was a little dry, the chicken was VERY salty (think eating pure salt), and the steak didn't have a good flavor. The strawberries that came with dessert were sour. The service was slow. The one positive note is that the manager did come and apologize for the bug - but we were surprised to see that there was no offer to give a discount (even after running around until we killed the bug). The conclusion is obvious - I don't recommend the Kinzie Chop House (my favorite is still the Chicago Chop House).
