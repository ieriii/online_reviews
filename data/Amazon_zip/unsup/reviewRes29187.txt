Like other reviewers, I would say that they know how to kick in the spice at this place. Unlike Royal Thai, the portions are large and filling. I think it is strange to have Thai and sushi in the same restaurant, but who am I to judge? Delivery is a bit slow, but free California Maki roll for over $25 spent. Bonus.
