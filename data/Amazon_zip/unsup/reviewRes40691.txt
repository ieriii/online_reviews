i really enjoyed my meal at longman and eagle earlier this week. the servers were incredibly helpful - helped me pick out a great beer that fit my tastes and told us what they honestly thought of the different menu items. we also got an amuse-bouche of spaghetti squash and apple sent over that was tasty. then we sampled the pretzel and the meatball appetizers. the dipping sauce that came with the pretzel was so good and the meatball was a big hit but a little too pesto-y for some of us. but the best part was my entree. i got the pork belly and it's one of the most delicious meals i've eaten in awhile! i loved the red cabbage and the hazlenut spaetzle rocked. i would definitely go back!
