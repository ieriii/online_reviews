I have been to Tru three times in the past 2 years. Every time I have been there it has been pure perfection. The service is unparalleled. The food is fantastic. The atmosphere is chic, sophisticated and modern. I can't wait until I get to go back -- hopefully someone will take me soon! :) Ohhhhhh caviar staircase -- you are haunting my dreams.
