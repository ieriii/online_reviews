Disclaimer: This review is solely based on the service. We left within 30 minutes due to our experience. Coat check was only the beginning of the insanity. A woman was literally pulling my coat from my hands and then trying to argue with me about how to hang it. Then the reservations desk was angry with me because I got my reservation date incorrect, and instead of explaning to me what should happen next sat in silence working away at her computer and then pushing us into yet another line. Finally we got our two hour wait buzzer to sit in a room that was obviously about 3 times over the legal capacity with no hope of getting a drink. We happily made our way a block away for dinner and spent 1/3 of the price on just as lovely an evening. It may not have been as pretty, but I'm not sad about my choice.
