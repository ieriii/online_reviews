I was here on a date recently, and it was the perfect venue. The outside is very unassuming, with a worn out awning. Inside, it was cozy and warm. We were greeted by our awesome waiter and were provided warm bread with olive oil and parmesan. For appetizer we had the Crostini di Avocado. Creamy and delicous! A little too much olive oil, as I don't like the feeling of too much oil in my mouth, and avocados have oils of their own. But still delicious. I ordered the milk and honey ribs, which the waiter said he thought it was the best thing on the menu. My date ordered the mushroom risotto. The ribs are fall off the bone. Flavorful sauce with rich bbq. The ribs sat on a bed of carrots that were julienned too long. It's awkward to pick up with the fork...doesn't stick like pasta so hard to twirl onto the fork. Then you get sauce all over your face because the end of the carrot string hit your chin as you try to shove the fork in your face...but I digress. Ribs, good. The sauce is on the salty side, so mashed potatoes or rice would've been a perfect accompaniment, but it only came with the cumbersome carrots. I tried the mushroom risotto. The mushrooms were definitely fresh and flavorful. Again, maybe a little more salty than I would've liked. But still good. I would've given this place 3 stars for the food based on the above...it was delicious, but not something that would make me crave it again and go back. Perhaps if I tried a pasta dish, it might've been different. Shrug. I gave 4 stars because the service was excellent. The waiter anticipated our every need. When my drink was down to it's last few sips, I already had a new one. He was very attentive. Even more impressive, we had leftovers and he sealed it so well that it didn't make the car smell like food after seeing a movie!
