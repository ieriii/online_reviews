The fiesta pepperoni pizza is delicious- I mean it. A slice that never fails in scrumptiousness-- It isn't like any you've ever eaten before because they have taken standard pizza pepperoni and also throw on this big, broad, spicy sandwich pepperoni too- lending unexpected texture & depth along with pleasant chewiness from the smoky (wood-fired oven) flavor. It's not the overrated deep-dish that pounds thru your internal organs like a piece of cement. If you are looking for that, go up the street to Ginos (it's not as yummy). Or if you are semi-sucidal there is a Dominoes on Halsted. Ew. The california pizza with avacado, bacon, mayo is one of the best pizzas I have ever eaten. OMG... Seriously. I wanted to take the pizza somewhere special to make out. I would marry this pizza and you would be jealous because I wouldn't ever share. I like that the entire staff is so outgoing and friendly. Because they have such tasty pizza ready by the slice? Also, their families are always here lending a hand, recommend something tasty or a friendly taste-test. I like a little story with my slice. The space is small but I feel welcome to sit and eat. Also, they'll tell you, the staff has nicknamed me "pepperoni" for my choice favorite- possibly the only food to overtake Bobtail Signature Sunset in favorite status. Which they HAVE here in dwindling quantities because I am eating it all... Try it!
