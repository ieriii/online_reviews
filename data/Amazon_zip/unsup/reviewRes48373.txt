eh. The Good: The bread is delish. My mom's ribs were good, but have a lot of black on them...like A LOT. And were some of the most expensive ribs I have ever seen. The polenta with it was very good, too. The hamachi I had was decent, fresh. It was with almonds, salt, pepper, peas, strawberries. The chard by the glass is pretty damn good. The Bad: Got there at 5pm, was told our group of 4 would have to leave at 7pm b/c of reservations after us. That was kinda bleh. My friend's chicken, which didn't cost our table because they didn't have mussel. I thought is was medicore. The sweetbreads. They were good quality, yes, but soooo dull. Unsalted, nothing really came with them. I was left sad and blue balled. Because we have had such a crap time, they gave us dessert. Waffles were gross, I rather had an Eggo waffle. The fries were just bleh, even with an EGG! :( Even with them giving us food b/c of our crap time, the bill came out to be huge. HUGE. It's expensive fare. And for what we got, it didn't warrent it's prices. If this place interests you and you don't want to be hit in the wallet or dissatisfied, I think Bristol would be a better alternative. That's my take.
