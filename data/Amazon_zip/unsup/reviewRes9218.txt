I have ordered from here a few times and have eaten in the restaurant too. The food has been very good. I order the shrimp kebabs often. I love the dill rice, the amazing feta and grilled veggies and pita that come with it....I could eat this food every day. Also, the babganoush is outstanding in my opinion. I wish it were BYOB, but is not. Delivery has been quick and reliable. Very good food!
