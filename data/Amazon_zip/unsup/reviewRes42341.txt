Art of Pizza is decent fare, but I feel the need to give just a so-so review to pull this place out of the clouds.  If I had enough money and sticktoitiveness, I would start an above-average restaurant in Chicago and see to it that a second location would never come to be. Give it a few years for people to think they've got something to themselves, and bam, you've got an institution. That's what's happened here. Art of Pizza sees very little in the way of tourist traffic, and with just the one location, it's easy to keep it so. The way the locals have built the place up, you'd think it was fit for a last meal on death row.  With that out of the way, let me get to the positives. You can drop in and have just a slice (not widely available at Chicago pizza places). Pricewise, it's fairly reasonable. There are also quite a few tables, so you won't be stuck with the wait you'd get at the more high volume establishments. There is so much good pizza to choose from in Chicago, though. Art of Pizza is respectable, but if you come expecting the Holy Grail of Chicago deep dish, you will be disappointed.
