I took my co-worker here because he wanted Chinese food and I wanted to try something new. Normally used to Cantonese and Americanized Chinese food, which is more sweet. Sze Chuan cuisine is known to be spicy. When I looked around me, I saw lots of little red peppers with the dishes. We ordered 3 dishes, a fish filet dish, a lamb dish and some dumplings and they were all flavorful with some heat. The portions were generous. I can't handle overly spicy foods, so maybe that's why I only liked it, but my co-worker loved it. The restaurant was just renovated due to a fire I believe and it looks nice, but nothing fancy. You're going there for the food rather than ambiance.
