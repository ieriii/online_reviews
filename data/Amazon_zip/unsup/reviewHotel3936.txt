Love it like I love "Mad Men."  If you're a huge fan of the show, or the era, or the style..whatever... this place is great. GREAT. Don't listen to the bad reviews. I travel all the time for business- that's pretty much my life- and I know what generic, clean, mediocre American hotel rooms look & smell like. The Congress Plaza is completely different. Completely cool lobby, totally enormous rooms, friendly staff & better service than at your average big chain. Seriously. If you want to come to Chicago & stay someplace generic that you'll forget, that's up to you. If you want a place you can talk about having stayed there years later... that's this place. If you're not totally hung up or stuck up, you'll get past the dated interior. But- don't complain to management when the hair stands up on your neck after you could swear something just followed you to the elevator. Haunted it is.
