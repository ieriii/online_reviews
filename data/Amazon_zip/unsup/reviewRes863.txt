I was too busy enjoying my delicious $1.50 corn dog to write a review earlier, but here it goes. CASH ONLY! Street parking only (not much parking during lunch time) and $3.00 a dog fries are additional $3.00 (fries fried with duck fat additional) Saturday/Sunday only (cheese additional) Seating is available ONLY once you've put in your order (also limited) My boyfriend is a hot dog man, so we'll be popping in and out. 1 star down because I've never paid $3.00 for a dog that didn't come with fries
