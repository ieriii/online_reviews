First of all just the decor alone is enough to love this place, the Jlo top they have framed to the sexy Gwen Stefani pic in the men's bathroom. But going to what's important the food and service well all I have to says awesome awesome awesome ,fresh and spectacular ,the mojitos are great and overall the ambient is wonderful sexy and date ready or for a night of sexy salsa dancing on their bar side. Kudos to the awesome cooks and chef...
