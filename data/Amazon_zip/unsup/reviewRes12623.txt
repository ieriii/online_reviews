Ive been to Cafe 28 about 7 times in the 10 years that i have lived here and wish it was 100 times.  All for the Pork Chops. Went for my birthday tuesday night with friends and once again it didnt dissapoint. My buddy had the Pork Chops with me and said they were now in his Top 3 pork chops of all time.  I have had the salmon, halibut, cuban sandwich, and roasted cuban chicken. all were very good! Staff here has always been uber friendly. Feels like you are eating at someone's house with how you are treated. drinks are strong, apps are good ( try the bacon wapped dates), entrees are big, and deserts are all home made. can get pricey depending on your level of soberness, but well worth a nice night out great date place as well.
