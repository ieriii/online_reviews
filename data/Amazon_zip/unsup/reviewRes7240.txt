I love BBQ from all over, and this was the best I've had yet. Really amazing. I came here with a party from work, and we were lucky to try a lot from the menu. We had chicken wings, brisket, ribs, pulled pork and more. My top recommendation is the 'competition style' ribs. Wow! As far as sides go, the honey glazed corn bread and baked beans were my favorites. We got to meet the chef, Lee Ann, who I actually remember from the Bobby Flay Throw-Down. She was really nice, and took us for a tour of the kitchen. The smokers were really cool. The high quality ingredients and effort in preparation are worth the extra money.
