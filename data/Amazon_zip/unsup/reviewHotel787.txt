I really liked this hotel until they messed up my reservation and I was looked out of my room.  I was there for a conference and paid the conference room rate, but I extended one extra day, and had to pay a different rate. I discussed this with the staff at the front desk when I checked in and they said it would not be a problem. Unfortunately, it was a problem. I got locked out of my room the last day of the conference, and to top it all off, I left my ID in the room. I had to wait one whole hour for security to come by and open the door for me. Then I had to run back down to the front desk and wait another thirty minutes in line to take care of my room cards. I was all set to go out for a night on the town before leaving, and it was interrupted by a problem that should have not happened. Other than that, I really liked the hotel, the staff, exercise facilities, and especially the location.
