Gets one star just for the annoyance of the parking valet situation. You drop the car off at the front entry, and of course you would think you would pick up at the same place when you need your car. Instead they send you down two escalators to pay at an automated booth. Then after going back up with my paid ticket, and letting me stand around for twenty minutes, the knuckle-head says to go back downstairs to get my vehicle. Lack of communication...annoying.
