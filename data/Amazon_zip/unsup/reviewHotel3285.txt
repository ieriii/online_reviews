got a great rate on line and within walking distance of soldier field which was our goal for seeing U2 ... alas the concert has been postponed but we headed to Chicago anyways, well because it is chicago! In a beautiful old deco building - lobby is a large open space that flows from couch area to front desk to bar -- the bar was playing vintage 80's and 90's videos though the music being played wasn't the same which was a bit disconcerning. I arrived early but was given a room which was great ... although the view of a wall, roof and air ducts pretty much blew .... the room was very quiet though which was a nice trade off. Bed was beyond comfortable and the bathroom clean and well stocked. But whats with all the dim lights? between the very dark hallways and all the lights in the rooms seeming to be 15 watt bulbs ...is that the rock star style? lol i didn't mind though a lit magnifying mirror in the bathroom would have been a really nice touch. Carpet was a bit worn - but that could be forgiven i'd stay again as the location is great and had no complaints with staff or room ...
