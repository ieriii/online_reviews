Had brunch with a friend here on a Monday afternoon. Place wasn't all that busy, which to me was ok. I'm usually overwhelmed by how busy brunch restaurants are but that's probably because I usually go on a weekend. With that being said, our service was very friendly, attentive, and quick. The restaurant itself was clean and modern. Was a bit surprised when I walked it because I didn't expect that considering the look of its surroundings in Bridgeport. The first thing I noticed is that they serve Metropolis Coffee which is out of Chicago. Being organic was already good for me but it made it even better seeing that they also support local products. The menu was quite simple. There weren't too many dishes to choose from. My friend recommended the "Nanadict" which is their take on the Eggs Benedict. The chorizo, egg, and the sauce came together really well for me. It was served with a side of really crisp and creamy potatoes and a mound of fresh greens mixed with some vinaigrette dressing. One of the specials that day was their version of Chicken and Waffles. After our waitress described it, my friend was immediately sold. The crispy and savory chicken strips complemented the waffle and gravy really well. I think the gravy is what made the dish so good! It definitely was not your traditional sausage gravy. Prices were above average but the service and food quality made it all worth it.
