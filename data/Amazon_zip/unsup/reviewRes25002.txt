Do you know why pirates wear an eyepatch? It's so that when they go from a brightly lit space to a dim one, they already have one eye adjusted to the light, when they're in a dangerous situation... or when they enter Mercat a la Planxa. Expect a dimly lit, lively interior, alongside an open kitchen. Plenty of staff around, service was fine. Our table got the (3-course) tasting menu. It was kind of hard to hear what the declaration of what each dish was. The tapas ranged from meh to "omg, I could pop those braised rabbit dumplings with brandied cherries like candy". Besides the rabbit dumplings, the other highlight of dinner was the tender lambchop, and I'm not a huge fan of gamey things either.  Other tapas served just seemed like fancy versions of flatbread pizza, bruschetta, goat cheese, and prosciutto spinach salad with alright flavors. The garlic shrimp and prawn smelled better than they tasted. I liked the idea of the paella croquettes, but I thought the flavor was lost next to the crispy texture of the croquette. No sightings of Iron Chef Garces here. :o(  (P.S. $14 valet is at the Balbo entrance to the Blackstone hotel. Also book on Open Table.)
