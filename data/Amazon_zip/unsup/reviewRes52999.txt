I had been watching the shady BBQ place around the corner on the drive home and wasn't too surprised when it shut down. When I started to see the artists spending hours working on the exterior the excitement started to build. It seemed like we waited for years before we saw the "Opening Monday" sign in the window and it seemed like months before Monday came, but it did. I can't even begin to describe how amazing it feels to have places like this move into my neighborhood because it brings people here and I no longer have to explain what I mean by "West Bucktown." It's not Logan Square, it's not Bucktown... It's just our neighborhood and we love it. I hope that 90 Miles is here to stay because we love it! We got the pollo and the ropa viejo. The food was well seasoned, the milkshake (strawberry and mango) was light and frothy and the service was incredible. They were so genuinely happy to have us there, we'll definitely be coming back! Whoo hoo, welcome to the 'hood!!
