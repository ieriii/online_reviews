HORRIBLE!!! Management is to blame!  1. No doorman was on staff to help open the door despite the amount of luggage I had... CORRECTION! There was a doorman, but HE CHOSE TO IGNORE ME!! 2. RON, the front desk guy informed me it wasn't his problem that no doorman was on staff... Thank you! 3. COFFEE MAKER? Seriously, do you check your rooms before admitting new guests - you have a fridge but I can't keep anything in it?? *** After making a request for one, you STILL MAKE ME WAIT 30mins plus for it, WTF?!/! 4. Air Conditioner - OMG!!! That thing is loud!! When I said LOUD I mean seriously loud, waking up in the middle of the night loud! 5. STARCHY Sheets!! I don't understand, some downey wouldn't hurt. 6. Modern Decor completely misses the ball, the burgundy, green & brown combination was not doing this place justice... (if there was any for this place!!) DON'T STAY HERE!! It's really not worth it! I have stayed at many hotels such as Swissotel and Fairmont and NOTHING, I MEAN NOTHING was THIS BAD!!! I wish the management would train their employees to be more friendly, help each other out and remind them that they are their to service their guests!
