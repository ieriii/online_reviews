Fish lovers rejoice! Another clich-laden and completely unnecessary review about how great this place is! Glenn's Diner had been on my radar for a while, and it didn't disappoint. Arriving around 5.30pm on a Saturday, the place was already fully booked for the rest of the night. The host allowed us to loiter until some seats opened up at the counter, and from the garlic bread with gorgonzola sauce to the rainbow trout with brown sugar and pecans, everything was perfect. Fish entrees came with a side of al dente broccoli and perfectly spherical baby potatoes, soaked in butter. Glenn's is BYOB but also has a decent drink selection. I didn't partake for hangover-based reasons (see previous review of 4am karaoke experience).
