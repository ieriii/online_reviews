What a treat! We celebrated our 10 year anniversary last week at Bonsoiree. It was one of the best choices we made. We order the 7 courses meal and every dish was superb! The price tag struck me at first, but after the first course, I was sold.  Will I return? Of course - for the 13 courses treat next time!
