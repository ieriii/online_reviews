This was one of the better Chicago dining experiences I've had in...ever. Carnivale features an incredible blend of great food in an energetic atmosphere, replete with outstanding drink specials. We dined in the balcony overlooking the main restaurant, providing a great vantage point without feeling as if we were dining on display. Our server was knowledgeable and helped navigate the menu (which has lots of great offerings). We ordered the ropa vieja and guacamole as our appetizers - were were impressed with both. My girlfriend ordered the churrasco, and I had the atun. I thoroughly enjoyed my atun - thick slices of ahi tuna over fingerling potatoes and a spiced-just-right sauce. I paired my atun with a bottle of Estrella Damm, a Spanish lager. Maybe not the best pairing, but I had previously experienced beer from Spain and wanted to give it a shot. For dessert, we opted for the churros and loved the dolce de leche and chocolate dipping sauces that accompanied them. While this was an excellent location for a date night, we're looking forward to returning with a group of friends, both to further explore the menu's offerings as well as to delve into their notable cocktails. Nothing quite like a mojito to warm things up during a cold Chicago winter...or to cool things down during a hot summer. Really, at this point I'm just looking for excuses to return.
