I didn't stay here, but the Lyric's opera ball was held in the Grand Ballroom of the Hilton Chicago. This is an older building with beautiful architecture. Ornate accents, grand staircases and beautiful details, the theme is Victorian classic. The Grand Ballroom is really beautiful and ideal for a bar mitzvah or wedding. The exterior of the hotel is just OK. For hotel food, it was very very good. We had a petite filet that was cooked perfectly and scalloped potatoes that were superb. The dessert stole the show. A dark chocolate and pistachio mousse cake was amazingly rich and delicious.  House champagne was a bit sweet, but decent.
