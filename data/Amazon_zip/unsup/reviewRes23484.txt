Whenever the office discovers a new delivery restaurant that is willing to deliver to our zone on Fulton Street we are on it like fly on yah...you know. shhh*t. Taco Tico and that lizano sauce...yum..think this is unique to Irazu...correct me if I am wrong...they are tasty and love the crunch of the tortilla and crunch from the cabbage. Patacones are a meal unto themselves...roasted garlic...damn good. Beef, plaintain, chicken empanadas...good, not too greasy...hits the spot when consumed with hot salsa. All their shakes and the many varieties in which you can satisfy your cravings...don't you dare order soda...order the shakes. Last but not least...drum roll....oatmeal/banana milk shake...sex in a cup. Little extreme but really its so good and unique. PS: Foodler! Again...any restaurant using foodler or any other online ordering system just GETS IT.
