I went to The Publican because of a nice review in Chicago Magazine. It was listed as a top Sunday Brunch restaurant. We had the eggs and bone marrow, eggs and duck, and pork shoulder, sticky buns and bacon. All were the best versions of those foods I ever tasted. I was like "Nom Nom Nom" and "this is really good" and "Mmm"! It was really good. Our waitress was super hot and service was excellent. I found nothing wrong with this place, which is upsetting, because I like to bitch and moan a lot. This is my first 5 star rating.
