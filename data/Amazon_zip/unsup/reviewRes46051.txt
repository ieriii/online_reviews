I am a huge fan of the Cheesecake Factory and heard this place was a more specialized Cheesecake Factory, so I had to try it. Personally, I did not see anything special or spectacular about the restaurant. It is basically a down-grade to the Cheesecake Factory, although its suppose to be an upgrade. The decor of the place is pretty similar, same feel, but just a lot more golden decor. Walked in the place was packed, there was a wait, and went up stairs to see if there were some tables at the bar and it was packed as well. Got seated and the waiter described the menu as a fusion of cuisine from various locations in the world. About 3/4 of the menu was the same as the Cheesecake Factory with a little twist. I had the Miso Salmon because I liked it before and it was pretty much the same as the Cheesecake Factory, but I think I like the Cheesecake Factory more. The salmon was a little overcooked, and the sauce was just mixed into the whole platter. On the hand they would usually put the sauce around my rice, so it was not saturated in it. All-in-all our meal was good, but I would have much preferred to have gone to the Cheesecake Factory where the menu is larger and could have had the same food. I guess the view is nice in Chicago and the decor was a little nicer, but I would prefer going to a hole in the wall restaurant with amazing food. I would come back and eat here again, but overall everything was mediocre.
