We used to go to Garcia's on Western, which is decent. But after just one visit to Nuevo Leon, I'm hooked. We went with a big group and were seated promptly even though it was busy and full. The first thing I noticed was the atmosphere. Something similar to a family holiday party. There were many large groups seated, and some smaller ones along the wall. Everyone seemed to be enjoying their time and the food.  While we were looking over the menu and deciding what we wanted to feast on, the server brought out the chips and different salsas, as well as an appetizer on the house, which were like beef flautas. I think it's a different app every time you come? But it was delicious The portions for the entrees were huge! I got the lengua a la mexicana and thoroughly enjoyed it. Horchata was only a dollar! I really enjoyed my visit there, everything just seemed sooo, "authentic". Will return again for a 2nd look
