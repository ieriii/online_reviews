The duck here is absolutely delicious! This is the only place my family comes to for duck. My dad started bringing me here and introduced me and my friends to it. It's really great, whether you're dining in and getting the Peking duck dinner, or you're getting some duck or roast pork to go. It's just amazing overall. This neighborhood is known for having great restaurants, and Sun Wah is definitely one of those. Great to bring friends to, the Peking duck dinner is enough to feed around 2-6 people, depending on how much everyone eats.
