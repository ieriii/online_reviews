Finally ate at The Publican today after wanting to make it there for a year or so. Came with my mom and brother for Sunday brunch and we were able to get in easily with no reservation. I ordered the Grilled hanger steak and thought it was great, it was served on a bed of rice and garnished with some delicious pear slices. One problem was that the servers were very slow on drink refills. We only got one coffee refill and it was at the end of the meal when we were about to leave. Our cups sat empty for at least 15 minutes. Not a big deal, but we were thirsty! I'd definitely recommend The Publican to someone looking for a Sunday Brunch spot. The prices are reasonable and they do what they do quite well.
