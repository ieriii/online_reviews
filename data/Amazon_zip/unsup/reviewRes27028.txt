I really enjoyed the experience at Graham Elliot. In sum, the food was superb, the staff was friendly (but not too friendly) and informative, the wine list was good and the atmosphere was great. The atmosphere was relaxed, yet loud enough to have a good time with your table without disturbing the other patrons. Most people dressed a "nice casual", but there were some in suits, etc. Most people should be comfortable wearing your "nice" jeans; I wore jeans and a corduroy coat. Indeed, the majority of the staff is wearing jeans. We went with the 10 course tasting menu, and a couple bottles of wine. It was great. The pumpkin soup was awesome and the hen and swordfish was excellent. The staff was very informative and explained each dish as it arrived. I will definitely go back.
