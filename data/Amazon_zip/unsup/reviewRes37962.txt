This was the place of my first taste of Chicago Deep-dish pizza, and i was not disappointed. We went with the Chicago Special and it was almost like eating a polish sausage flavored pizza pie. Just a tip, but if you don't care about where you eat it, i'd just call ahead and then pick it up for take out. That way you don't have to wait forever, and you can enjoy it with friends elsewhere. The weather's getting warmer too so buy a pie and enjoy it outside!
