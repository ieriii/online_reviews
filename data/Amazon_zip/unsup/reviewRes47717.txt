This review is for the rooftop. A group of us arrived around 5:30pm on a Tuesday evening to celebrate my client's birthday... All of the large tables and booths were already taken but we were able to snag a cozy seating area in the corner (they don't take reservations for the rooftop). The drinks and appetizers are priced reasonable and they have a decent wine list. Definitely try the hot crab dip and spicy chicken samosas.... the fondue was okay. I didn't have any of the sliders, but a couple of the guys had the beef sliders and they were raving about it. It was a gorgeous night last night... and being on the rooftop allowed us to enjoy the perfect weather. The crowd is good... non-touristy and a little more on the young professional side (e.g. late 20's and 30's). However, the waitresses are very young and very impatient... and sometimes hard to find.... this won't stop me from going back.
