Two visits in two weeks, so I've become a bit of an expert on Bad Apple. As far as the space goes, I like that it isn't too big and it's also not so small that I have had to wait for any extensive amount of time either Saturdays I went - both of those times by the way were right around 7pm when you would expect the longest wait time. My first visit, I had the fig and goat cheese burger. Here's one complaint...being that I am pregnant and obsessed with goat cheese I had to make sure that there version was a domestic, pasteurized option. I was told that it wasn't so I had to switch out my beloved goat cheese for a white cheddar...eh, very disappointing. The burger itself was very overcooked. I ordered it medium to medium well and it came back extremely well done. I also wasn't a huge fan of our waitress this time. She was really rather non interested in our table and upon my second visit, with an awesome waitress who actually went and found out about the cheese selection - I learned that our waitress the first time provided us with some not so accurate information. Therefore, I could have had the goat cheese and would have been much more delighted. The second visit, my burger was better prepared. I had the Frenchie and loved loved loved the excessive amount of brie flavor. I had the firecracker, chipotle, and truffle fries and in this case the truffle fries win. I wish the pretzel bun wasn't an up-charge, but being that I'm a sucker for pretzel buns, that's a $1 investment I am willing to make. I have a feeling I will back here often as it's location is convenient and well, I love burgers. Not gonna lie, the beer list looked impressive and I will be looking forward to taking advantage of that as well.
