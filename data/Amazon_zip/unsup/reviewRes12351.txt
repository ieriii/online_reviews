Cafe 28 delivers a great meal. The atmosphere is pleasant and the staff is always so friendly. I love the Ropa Vieja. We also ordered the Coconut Shrimp as an app and was nearly licking the plate. Don't miss this one! We also ordered the Goat Cheese as an app. It was ok...nothing fantastic. Will be back again soon. Food is tasty.
