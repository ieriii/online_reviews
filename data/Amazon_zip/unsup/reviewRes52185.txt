Great atmosphere, friendly service, and of course, the deeeeep dish. This was our first stop in Chicago and it turned out to be a great way to start off the trip. -Famous for their sausage patty deep dish. -Great cheesy garlic bread with marinara dip. *Tried Giordano's couple days later and was not satisfied. **Some might not like the cornmeal crust.
