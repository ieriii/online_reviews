Highly recommended. I live in Lisle, Illinois, so I frequent the one in Downers Grove, Illinois of Ogden Ave. It is the best chinese food that I have had in Chicago. The food is authentic, flavorful, and the service is fast and friendly.  And they remodeled the restaurant in Downers Grove, Illinois, so the dining environment is clean, warm and inviting.If you're a big fan of spicy foods, this is the place to go. They use authentic spices and their dishes put out a lot of heat.
