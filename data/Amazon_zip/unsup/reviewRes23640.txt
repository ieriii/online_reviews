I really love this place and try to bring out of towners here as well. The first time we were here I reluctantly ordered the oatmeal shake (with water, not milk) on the recommendation of a friend and expected to be grossed out- it's THE. SHIZ. I either get the steak sandwich or the costa rican sandwich, which are pretty much the same thing but not- the descriptions are on the menu, figure it out. I love the costa rican sauce as well, the next time I'm there I'm going to buy a bottle. My vegan girlfriend swears by the vegetarian burrito, which she can only eat half of at a time so she has dinner for the next day. Very inexpensive for the portions. Cash only still, I believe.
