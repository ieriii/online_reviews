Note to self: wear a bib at the next outing =D Went with a big group of hungry boys in the mood for tasty asian fusion. Not a huge venue, but after 15 mins of waiting, we managed to snag a big table for our group. My man & I ordered: * 1/2 order of Crisp BBQ wings * 1/2 order of Seoul Sassy wings * Seoul Steak Bowl Don't say I didn't warn ya fellow yelpers... portions are HUGE! I don't know where they get their chicken from, but these wings are not your typical wangs. They keep the drumstick & legs together, and coat 'em in delicious sauces. I liked the Crisp BBQ because Seoul Sassy had too much of a kick for my weak self. The Seoul Steak bowl wasn't extraordinary, but marinated bulgogi on top of a bed of rice.... it's hard to dislike such a dish. Their sauces tie in all the flavors, so go crazy with the extra condiments. I'll be back for the chicken wangs with my bib & wet wipes! So crispy! So tasty!
