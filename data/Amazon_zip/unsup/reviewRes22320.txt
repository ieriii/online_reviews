Another great find in Chinatown. My Mexican friend suggested this to me. There is no malice in that sentence. I have a lot of Mexican friends but I've been to Chinatown a gazillion times, with a gazillion different friends and never been introduced to this place. Parking was plentiful at about 5:30pm. Ordered: Tony's chicken with 3 chili and the Crispy shrimp in lemon sauce (suggested by the waiter after I asked). I loved both choices. Dislike: slow service My friend tried Tony's chicken before so she knew it was good and yes it was. Crispy, spicy, a hint of sweet peppers and very addictive. The shrimp was really good too. Crispy lemon flavor whole shrimps. After doing some more research on this restaurant, I discovered LSC is part of Tony Gourmet Group and there are other restaurant bearing same names - Lao Beijing & Lao Shanghai which I will definitely check out too. Next time I patron LSC, I will have the Chef's special dry chili chicken as I see lots of customers love it as well. it looks similar to Tony's chicken but without the sweetness. Can't wait to go back!
