Definitely worth your time to check out. We went on a Saturday around 9pm and waited less than 15 minutes for seating. It's a two-level resturant with graffiti everywhere. Fun entry with staircase up to second floor.  Our pizza (a small) took at least 45 minutes to get to us, but that seems to be on par with Giordano's. The waiter was (unsolicited) a little apologetic and checked up with us a couple of times before it came out. The bar's idea of a virgin margarita was basically some lime juice in a soda glass with a load of crushed ice. Weird? But the waiter was nice and kind of acknowledged this as he delivered it to us and offered to take the drink back if it didn't work for me (not necessary).  All in all a fun placed and we'd go back.
