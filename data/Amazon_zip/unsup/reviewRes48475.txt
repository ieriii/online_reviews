Hm... I don't think I can add much to the countless 5-star reviews here but here's my two cents. Best. Fries. Ever. Frites with organic egg on top. I know. It sounds like heart attack waiting to happen but it's seriously good. So good, my friend asked the waitress how they are made and the waitress screamed "WITH ANIMAL FAT" We didn't know what to think about that... anyway... Basque stew. Broth is amazing... light, savory, seafoody....mmmmm..... Just order it and you'll be happy. The toasted bread they give you is magical by itself but with the stew... I was left speechless. For some reason, I didn't enjoy the meat dishes that much. Usually I love encased meat of any form but not here. I'm sure others will vehemently disagree but oh well.
