Its a whisky bar. I say, try the whisky. In fact, try several of them. Longman has a varied list of taster ladders, all starting cheap and working northward. I think I went with the "stairway to heaven" sampler and got stuck on a whiskey found halfway up that stairway. Cool atmosphere. I was fresh off a plane and we hit the spot late enough that the place wasn't crowded. Cool bartender who didn't look at me like I was an idiot when I asked about the multiple flavors of whisky or whiskey (yes I learned there is a difference) offered up at the joint. The wierd wild game appetizers were good enough, but the variety of spirits stood out the most. I remember them well...and most of the rest of the evening.
