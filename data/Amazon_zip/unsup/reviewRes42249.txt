You know what's awesome when it's cold & rainy? Parking 2 feet from the door of the building in a private lot and indulging in a hot slice of deep dish pizza. The Art of Pizza's chicago style pie is now officially my second favorite in the city (sorry, my heart and stomach will forever belong to Pizzeria Due). And, the fact that I can get a single slice for my single self at Art of Pizza rocks the house. Because honestly, I don't need leftover deep dish pizza in my fridge. The side salads are also cheap and very fresh. Note: Avoid the creamy garlic salad dressing unless you like salad dressing that has the taste and consistency of Hellman's Mayo. The staff inside was great; they gladly pointed to each pizza and told me what toppings each by-the-slice pie had in a friendly manner (which I give them credit for doing so nicely, as I presume they have to rattle off the pizza types 9490854893 times per day). They also have a huge delivery area if not leaving the house is more your style.
