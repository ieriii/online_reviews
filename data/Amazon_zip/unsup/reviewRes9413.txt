As I hide inside my dark air-conditioned home on the hottest day of the year, I keep thinking about one thing, over and over again: the Bugeymosa from brunch at Sprout. I don't drink much. Hops are the enemy. Classic martinis are gross (IMO, except for the stuffed olives). It takes an expertly crafted fruity cocktail to make me happy. The Bugeymosa is THE most refreshing cocktail I have ever had in my life. I don't really know what they put in it. Frankly, I don't care. I tried a sip of my friend's and immediately ordered one for myself. Similar to the Bugeymosa (Sprout's twist on the mimosa), the food menu reads like my dream brunch menu: biscuits and gravy, steak and eggs, eggs Benedict, shrimp and grits, lox platter, waffle, etc.. but everything is done with a twist. When was the last time you had eggs Benedict with lamb? Or, steak and eggs with crab, Thai basil, and sambal? Or, an omelette featuring one of my favorite cheeses (manchego) and little fishes (white anchovy)? Frites with a side of wasabi tobiko mayo? (I have never eaten so many frities in my life. LOVE that mayo!) Never? Then get yourself to Sprout on a Sunday, ASAP. This meal was absolutely spectacular from start to finish. - We arrived early and were seated at the bar and given glasses of water, without asking. (Mega bonus points!) - Our party of 5 was seated in the private chef's table room - with a stunning chandelier and a little boat-style window that lets you peek into the kitchen. - No children under 12 are allowed at this meal. YES! - The service, food, and drink are all stellar. There is a cocktail featuring coffee, horchata and a bruleed banana! Swoon. - You can see Dale (yes! from the TV) walking around. I'm already planning my return for another Bugeymosa (or 3?) and some more frites with wasabi tobiko mayo. And a celebratory dinner sometime. Oh, and did I mention that they have Lithuanian bacon buns as a side? You're welcome. ;)
