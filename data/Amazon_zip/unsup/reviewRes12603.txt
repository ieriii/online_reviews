I've been for lunch and brunch only, and used to get lunch to-go when I worked in that area. I found lunch to-go to be the best bet; a sandwich with tostones and a side salad makes for a big lunch and will run you about $9. And your spending $7-$8 at the Subway down the block? For shame. All the sandwiches are pretty good, but the Cuban could use a little more mustard for my taste. We used to take clients for lunch when they were in the office, and it was generally met with a positive reaction. The staff is very nice, but the pace can be a little leisurely if you're on a timeline (hence my frequent to-go orders). I had a pretty bad experience at brunch once, but given that I've had many meals there without issue, I'm happy to write it off as an aberration. Still, I find it worth mentioning there can be issues (it was THAT bad).
