Where do I even begin? I started eating pork for the first time IN MY LIFE a few weeks ago. Decided that The Purple Pig would be the best place to get adventurous. The reasonable prices and no wait helped too. My bf and I sat at the bar where the very friendly and knowledgeable bartender guided us through our meal. I'd recommend the croquettes, pork neck bone gravy (my fav), razor clams, and the pork jowl.  The restaurant itself has indoor and outdoor seating. I'm partial to the communal tables and the bar where you can watch the chefs do their thing. Trust me, if this pork newbie loves the Purple Pig, you surely will.
