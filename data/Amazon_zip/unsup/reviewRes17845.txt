Yuuuuuppp! Me likey! Went here after we found out the wait at Longman & Eagle was 3 hours (WTF???).  I'd heard good things about this spot and figured we'd give a try. We were with another couple and was hoping my Yelp machines wasn't going to make me look like an arse! We didn't of course and had a great evening here! The drink list was GIGANTE and I was like a giddy 10 year when I saw "Butter Beer" on the list! (HP, duuuuhh). The food list was also GRANDE and I went with the "Zen Belly" because I heart some pork belly. The sandwich was extremely tasty and was nicely complimented by my truffle seasoned fries. I'm glad we came here and will most definitely trek my mex-rican arse up to Logan Square soon!
