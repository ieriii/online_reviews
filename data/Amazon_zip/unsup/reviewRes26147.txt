Pan Pizza? More like deep dish! My wife and I rolled in to Chicago a little late on Friday, and were starving. Thankfully, my friend had the foresight to order some pizza before we got to his joint. Pequod's was his choice. And while one might think you have to get Chicago style pizza in Chicago, this certainly is not a bad option. My friend ordered two pizzas- green peppers and mushrooms on one, and pepperoni and sausage on the other (carnivores gotta eat). Typically the pizzas take anywhere from 40-50 minutes, so plan ahead people. We got there before the pizza arrived, but it wasn't long before we were rocking some of the best "non-deep dish" pizza I've ever had. The two medium pizzas were enough to feed 7 (though 3 of those people weren't that hungry). The sausage was pretty stellar, and they really packed on/in the toppings. It was a great start to my weekend in Chicago. Oh yeah, Pistons beat the Lakers that evening too, so double in your face! Overall- I would definitely order pizza from here again.
