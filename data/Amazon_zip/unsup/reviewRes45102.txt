Hands down, my favorite Italian restaurant in Chicago and the closest thing to a true family-style Italian restaurant meal outside of the boot. This is a must for groups of friends and loyalists to fresh pasta and authenticity. It's a great place for a date if you can handle loud, boisterous atmospheres. Ante Prima features a long list of outstanding antipasti that offer a wide variety of meats, vegetables and cheeses. Always a good move to do an assortment and pass around. The caponata is an extraordinary marinated eggplant that can not be missed. Pastas are handmade and the sauces represent a party of different flavors and textures. As with the antipasti, definitely order a variety and pass the plates around. The Orecchiette with Spicy Lamb Ragu is always a hit and one of my all-time favorite dishes. Entrees and wine list are fantastic (plenty of recognizable Italian producers) and the service is friendly and insightful. Parking across the street at the bank is a HUGE bonus. We brought kids along our first time there and they had a great time. The older one with a good palate loved exploring new flavors. Meanwhile, the younger one who was a little freaked out by the menu ended up having a great time and the kitchen was more than happy to whip up a simple pasta and marinara for her.
