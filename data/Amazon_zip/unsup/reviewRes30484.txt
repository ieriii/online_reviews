I had the opportunity to visit Sunda on a business lunch, and it was as good as expected. We chose to get a few appetizers and a few rolls to share. The Rock Shrimp Tempura was out of this world. I would order that dish every time I walked through the door. The Duck....What...Pork? was also delicious. We went with the pork belly which was cooked perfectly and flavorful. I only wish I could have ordered half pork belly and half duck. Given the name of the dish, I think that would be a natural option. For our maki, we ordered the Spicy "Tail of Two Tunas" and the Scorpion. I love sushi, and I was not floored with either of the rolls. I did not feel like either was a good value nor anything truly unique. Nonetheless, they were solid rolls, but not work the price. Our server was very friendly and patient as we took our time to order the maki. Over all, a good experience.
