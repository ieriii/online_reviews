Tough call. I went here to see live music, so it should be noted that this review is for that experience ONLY. Small room, which is good to see a band EXCEPT when the room is jammed with large tables as well. There's really no bar to hang out at, so you're stuck at a big table with 6 or 8 people. I don't like being stuck at a large table, sitting down when watching music. I'd rather roam around, hang out by the bar, dance if I feel like it, and finally end up hovering around the sound board where the sound is always the best. Plus, I don't like getting involved in a GIANT check situation. Sure, if I buy my drinks at the bar, I may end up spending the same amount of money, but I don't get the sticker shock of having it shoved at me all at once. Plus, if you're in a crowd of one or two cheapskates . . . you get it. Plus, people (and me) did get up and dance, and I think I was shaking my ass right in some guys face who was sitting behind me. Need a proper dance floor. This is a nice room, and a cool stage. It needs a proper dance floor and less tables, and it could be really nice. I'll give if another try - they get a lot of world music, which I like - if there's something else. Do not take this review as a comment on the food, as I did not eat. ONLY the live music experience.
