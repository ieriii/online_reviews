The pros of this place outweighed its cons. I'm a big fan of ambiance, a the dim lighting and dark wood bar of the Green Mill was right up my alley. The downside, beside the $12 cover, was the lack of seating and the "no talking" rule that's instated once the jazz starts. My friends and I were backed into the coat rack area and stood, hunkered down, until a booth finally opened up. The drinks, the other pro, were stellar though. Strong and reasonably priced.
