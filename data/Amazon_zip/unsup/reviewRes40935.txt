What a fantastic hole in the wall fine dining experience! This place is tiny and cute, warm and friendly.  I brought my boyfriend here for his birthday and the staff went out of their way to make it an excellent experience. We had to wait a few minutes to get a good table and as we waited they brought us their amuse bouche! It was an excellent way to start the evening. We then had the 7 course tasting menu and everything was fantastic. We didn't even get a menu, our waiter just said "Let us cook for you!" I am so glad that is what we did because every dish was more fantastic than the next. 1st: scallop 2: amazing duck dish! (my favorite) 3: crispy pork belly 4: skate wing 5: lamb 6: cheese course 7: amazing pastry plate!  My only complaint was that we should have only gone for 5 courses...we were too stuffed at the end of the meal to completely enjoy the pastries. I have been to some heavy hitters in fine dining and this little BYOB definitely competes with some of the more expensive fine dining experiences I have had.
