Food is delicious. Bigger than the ambiance. Excellent craft brew list. The mussels are definitely good, as is the CB&J, which was probably my favorite and most innovative dish of the evening. I really liked the craft brew list, and the restaurant has that neighborhood bar kind of feel to it. Some place to come back to if you're in the neighborhood.
