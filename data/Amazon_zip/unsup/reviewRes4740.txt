The Purple Pig made me wait 45 minutes on a Sunday night after I just walked around the city in 90-degree day all day. The wait was nevertheless, rewarding and satisfying. Who doesn't like some wine and swine? The bar scene is vibrant and the wait is well, gruesome. Yet, once we were seated, we were greeted by a very friendly waitress. The wine list is very extensive and to be honest overwhelming! It does have a good range of wine from around the world at different price point. We had half bottle of pinot grigio and it was only $24! We got several dishes to share because this would be our last meal in Chicago and we went all out to make sure we try a good selection of food here since we just waited 45 minutes. The bone marrow is absolutely the best on the menu. It is actually a reasonable price too because they gave us 4 big bones with buttery crispy sour dough and cilantro to go with. I love it even though previously I was a little afraid of the texture. The beets salad with goat cheese was surprisingly delicious. In addition, the 3 cheese platter we picked was great. For entree, we shared the fried pig ears and it was so good! You must try that if you like crispy deep fried dish and who doesn't really?! You might be grossed out by "Ears" but trust me, ears are very subtle delicacy. We ended our dinner with Pig Tail and it actually tastes like Chinese pork belly stew. The pork was stewed to such tenderness that it falls apart from the bone with sweet savory sauce. We were so full that we could not get any dessert afterwards.
