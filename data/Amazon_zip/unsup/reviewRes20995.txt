second time around, we got soups, guac and chips. i got the pork belly and my girlfriend got the veggie soup. actually, it doesn't even matter because the only thing we remembered from the meal was how salty everything was. the flavors and spices were all still there, but we were both disappointed in the salt lick of a meal.
