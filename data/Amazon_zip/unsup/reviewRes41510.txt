The problem with Ruths Chris is that it is in a very competitive market segment. For the price, your alternatives are Joe's, Gene & Georgetti, MK, and a plethora of others. Within that context, the experience simply doesn't compete. I ordered a USDA prime steak, medium rare. The steak was decent- texture was nice, and it was cooked correctly. Unfortunately it was smothered with butter and put on one the most inadequate presentation plates I have seen. I also made the poor decision of ordering the side of au povre which was simply unacceptable. The sides were underwhelming. We ordered a side of asparagus, sliced baked potatoes with some type of garnish, and a few others. None of the sides were of any real value, and the asparagus was tasteless. Wine selection was average, we found a bottle that was acceptable under ~70. Finally the service and ambiance were average. All in all a disappointment. We live in Chicago and probably should have known better, but wanted to give the restaurant a fair shake. It was a mistake, and I suspect we will never return. Joes!
