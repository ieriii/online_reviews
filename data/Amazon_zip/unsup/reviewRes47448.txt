Lockdown is okay, but I don't understand all the rave reviews that are here. Clearly this place wants to be Kumas, but they're simply not at the level. The kitchen is slow and the food is probably not much better than the average bar burger in the city. The beer list leaves much to be desired. I'd go on Tuesdays for the half off burgers, but that's about it.
