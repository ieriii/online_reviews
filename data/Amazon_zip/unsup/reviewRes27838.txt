Ok.. heres the place for authentic Mexican food without a huge price tag. there is no alcohol, however it is BYOB. Expect a line if you go for lunch. The Tacos, carne asada, beans, Corn Tortillas, spicy vegetables on the table are all great! Definitely worth a try. Don't forget to go next store o Sabina's Tortilla Factory and get the best chips ever (spicy).
