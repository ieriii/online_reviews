I've never understood the fascination some people have with waiting in line for up to an hour on a Sunday morning to get brunch.  Milk and Honey has good food. I've had breakfast and lunch there. But nothing was amazing. It's crowded, and they have a very strange seating system where you wait in line, get a number while in line, order food at a counter, and then get a table. The waitresses are rushing around frantically trying to organize seating, all while calling out numbers.  Basically, it's the hustle and bustle I look forward to avoiding on the weekends.
