Cool area of Chicago! Great staff! They even handled a kid (who could have actually been the devil himself) who was screaming the entire time we were there brunching. Ugh. Really Mom, figure it out, and if you can't your friend that was eating with you sure as hell should have. I digress. They provide a TON of spectacular food, so skip dinner, supper or whatever you want to call it, the night before. Ha! I'd still be eating the 2 entrees that we split should I still be there. Both were fantastic and scrumptious!
