Famous for being Chicago's first steel-frame skyscraper, this place is ideal for a weekend getaway if you're planning on catching Wicked at the Oriental Theatre, or the Chicago Theatre and even the Cadillac Palace Theatre is within walking distance. You've got the Atwood Cafe right there and great shopping on State Street, too. The Hotel Burnham also offers something called 'pillow menu' where you can select different types of pillows. Try the herb infused pillow.
