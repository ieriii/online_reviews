So now that I've been here for dinner and sampled the seafood, I can honestly say I'm a huge Glenn's fan now. Another stop on my mom's Food Network Chicago tour. We arrived 15 minutes early for our Friday night reservation, and they told us we couldn't be seated until our entire party was there, even though our table was set-up and ready to go. I was irked because we were only missing one person, but no worries, we headed up to the bar. "Sorry, unless you order food, you can't sit here." Wha? Totally lame. I was REALLY irked at that point. But we headed outside to wait for our other party, who was now stuck in traffic. Five minutes after our reservation, the nice hostess said if we order drinks at our table, she'll break the rules and seat us since it was starting to rain. Score! Drinks and crab cakes all around. Our final person arrived, and crab cakes were consumed by all. And oh.my.god were they good! The sauce that comes with them is amazing, and my only regret is that I didn't have more than one. I got the potato encrusted white fish, which was to die for. Light and fluffy and generous with the potato coating. The 'slaw and veggies that came with it were also perfection. Everyone at the table was delighted with their meal. My mom's scallops were incredibly rich and decadent, and the Applejacks Tilapia was surpringly good! Overall, a wonderful meal, and I get the feeling I'll be coming back a lot more for dinner since my veggie fiance is in love with the HUGE $6 veggie sandwich.
