When we first moved into the neighborhood, we were told that Nuevo Leon was THE PLACE to go for Mexican food. We typically ordered for pick up and the Carne Asada was very tasty every time. I'm a little one so when I wasn't as hungry I would order the 3 taco dinner (steak of course) I noticed sometimes that one of the tacos would be a little different in flavor than the others. (In terms of spices used, saltiness, so on) I figured maybe it came from a different batch or the cook got a little heavy handed, or it was just a bit more well done absorbing the flavors of a busy grill plate. That assumption lasted until once when we showed up too early for our food and had to wait at the counter in front of the fridges and kitchen. That day we saw a server return back from cleaning off tables and the server poured one salsa cup into another and put the married salsa cup into the fridge holding the remaining full salsa cups that are used on the tables! Moments later that salsa cup was taken by another server and put on a table... I shudder to think about the origins of my special tacos!!!!! (I should probably add that the proprietor was standing right there) We walked out immediately. I apologize for not posting earlier.
