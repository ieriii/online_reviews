I had the best time here!  A wonderful quartet was playing on a Monday night. The cover was only $6. We arrived a little after 11pm, and it was definitely busy, but not absolutely packed. We were able to find a small table.  I read some reviews where people said the waitstaff was not too friendly, and I do agree. Our waitress never once smiled, and she abruptly served our bevvies.  And when we first walked in, we were seated by the bartender who was also curt. But I suppose the staff gets a lot of crap from tourist idiots, so I guess I could not blame them for getting beat down.  It didn't really bother me...they just seemed to have a typical indifferent East Coast kind of attitude *shrugs*. I'm from Philly, so at least that's how I took it. Go and have a few scotches on the rocks and enjoy the beautiful melodies, and old-time jazz ambiance!
