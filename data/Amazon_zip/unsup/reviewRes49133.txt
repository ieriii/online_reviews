This place was great! Came in for a pre-dinner wine/snack and it was great. Bartender was super nice and gave great suggestions. We had the habla espanol flight, which was a lot of deep reds, but it was delicious. Also got a cheese flight and the bartender poured a free glass of white that he thought would pair well with our cheese selections. Definitely a chill bar that was perfect for a Saturday afternoon.
