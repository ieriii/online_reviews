Wow. This place is amazing. My 4 stars is based on one dine-in experience and one delivery. My gf and I ordered a whole Seoul Sassy fried chicken. I dream about this dish. The flavors are powerful but balanced. The crispy friedness was exactly what I had been craving. I'm a fried chicken lover, and this is my all-time favorite. If I were rating on this dish alone, it would be an enthusiastic 5. As far as the dining experience goes, be prepared that this is a fast food joint. There are shared tables, which are wide, and the kitchen is a bit noisy. Hence, it was difficult for me to hear my friend who was sitting across from me. I do not fault the restaurant for this at all. I'm just putting it out there in case you have other expectations. The four stars that I gave really reflect my experience with delivery and the Buddha Bowl. I love bibimbop, but this dish lacked cohesion. I was disappointed, but am willing to consider that something was lost due to the time for delivery.
