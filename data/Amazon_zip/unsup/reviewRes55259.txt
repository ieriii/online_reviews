Food was bland, especially the meat being extremely cold, and way too salty, the service was much like you'd find in a Dennys, They we're nice, but didn't care, like they're all there to make money and get you in and out ... this is by far the worst Brazilian steak house I've ever been to and I've tried them all. Don't waste your time or appetite here...If you want a better deal and much better quality food, go to Brazzaz. They're meat is 100% better than this place. Do yourself a favor and go to Brazzaz and you'll see!
