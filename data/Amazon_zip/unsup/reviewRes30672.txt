In Chicago for a few days and needed to find some gluten free friendly restaurants. Since we were staying in Boystown it seemed to make sense to hit up those wacky vegans right up the street. Score!!! Gluten free menu!!! They had some decent choices but I can only speak for the Avocado Tostadas. YUM. Two crunchy corn tortillas topped with black beans, quinoa, peppers, onions, jalapenos, and tons of avocado. I'm in love with the chimichurri sauce they serve with it. All in all, pretty darn tasty. I must also say that I was slightly terrified at the prospect of trying their vegan "milkshake" although everyone I spoke to highly recommended them. TRY THEM!!! That may have been one of the best shakes I've ever had. Don't get me wrong folks. I'm not vegan or vegetarian by any stretch of the imagination. I grew up on Crown Candy Kitchen and Ted Drewes and I venture to say that I won't be giving up bacon anytime soon...however....I will happily drink my soy, tofu, whatever the hell it was, not a milkshake, milkshake anytime I'm back in Boystown.
