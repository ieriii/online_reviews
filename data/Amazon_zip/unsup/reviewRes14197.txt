Glenn's is phenomenal. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable. The food is incredible. I would highly recommend the shrimp cocktail, french onion soup, scallop appetizer, scallop entree, apple jacks tilapia and fried perch. I don't think you can go wrong with anything here. It is an original concept with incredible execution. The only thing is that is gets VERY busy, so call ahead and make a reservation.
