Went for brunch awhile back when it first opened. I had the breakfast lasagna. OOHHHH MY. It was crazy good and I actually crave it. I didn't have to eat the rest of the day it was so filling. Been there a few times at night. I like this place. Decent beer selection, good drinks, and pretty good food. Especially for bar food. My advice - stay away from the turkey burger slider. Yuck. But the meatball sub is awesome, the cheese fries were super good, and the goat cheese on pita appetizer is YUMMY!
