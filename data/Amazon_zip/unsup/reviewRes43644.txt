I head to Milk and Honey about twice a week for lunch and or coffee. Though the food is great, the owner and a few of the staff are cold. They know by now that I am regular, when I smile and say hi they are very unwelcoming. Enough to the point where I am now going elsewhere for lunch and coffee. When I pay $27 for 2 sandwiches and 2 soups, just shoot me a smile once and a while and a thank you. There is one girl there, short brown hair with bangs, who is super sweet and nice!
