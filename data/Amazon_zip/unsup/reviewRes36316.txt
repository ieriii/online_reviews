DELICIOUS! portions were huge and good. We had an omelet and a sweet crepe. The omelet was enough for two people- came with toast and jam. There were two types of jam, one house jam and one something normal. Both were so delicious that I wanted to buy a jar to take home (which you can do!) Contrarily, the crepe - Nutella, bananas, and chocolate- was good but too sweet for my own breakfast liking. The coffee was also great. Kind of pricey for a small cup of coffee but definitely worth it (especially if you drink up and get refills!) The lines are always long for brunch/lunch, especially on the weekends, so be prepared to wait 30-45 minutes to be seated.
