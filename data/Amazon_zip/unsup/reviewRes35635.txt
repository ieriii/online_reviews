Please sir, I only make enough money to visit Shaw's but twice in a lifetime. But holy hell is it worth it. I am a huge fan of sea-food. If it comes out of the ocean, I'm eating it. This is the best seafood restaurant I've eaten at, barring some pretty unbelievable places on the West Coast. At Shaw's I have had: Oysters - super fresh and tasty. Shrimp - prepared in any way - delicious. Alaskan red king crab legs: bigger than a baby's arm. Lobster: succulent and fresh. Crab cakes: unreal. All their sides are a la carte, which is a huge downer, but those au gratin potatoes they make - the bomb!! They didn't even have grilled asparagus on the menu but she made it for us. That said, the service is fantastic. I know some people have had terrible experiences there, but I've been there two times and I don't really have anything to complain about at Shaw's except for the price and the tourists. I'm not a tourist hater per-se but this is a hotbed of non-Chicago people. Anyway, if you have a couple bones to throw towards this Lettuce establishment, get some king crab legs and lobster bisque and get all elite up in that piece. Thanks.
