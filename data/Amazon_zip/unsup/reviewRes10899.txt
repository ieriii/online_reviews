I don't know what it is, but everytime I go to Piece, I have an awesome time. Even though the place is consistently packed, the servers are in a good mood, and you don't wait that long for beer/food. Beer made in-house, constantly rotating list. Everything is always good. Pizza is thin-crust. Sausage is a good choice. I haven't tried the white sauce, but I like the red. I've come here for lunch, too, and they do a personal pizza which is a good size. I consider this one of my "go-to" restaurants, and go there as frequently as my schedule/diet will allow. Highly recommended for a night out!
