Yes, I am a huge fan of steak. Therefore I am a huge fan of Kinzie Chop House. They do steak and they do it great! I love the fact that they take the time to educate their customers on the different cuts of meats available as well as advise on the preparations to suit each person's taste. My go to is the bone-in Delmonico. Simply and tastefully prepared, the flavor of the beef is as intense as it is tender. I am a steak purist so I never go for the flavored crustings, but others whom I have dined with have always been happy with their selections. I have been coming here for years now; birthday celebrations (mine and others), out of town guests, or just simply wanting a nice solid meal. Ambiance is great, never too noisy. The staff is courteous and attentive. Great wine list and full bar offerings. Finally, one last thing to gush about: their prices! Amazingly well priced steaks compared to the many others in the area- quality AND value! Now, if only I can get out of work early enough to take part in their Happy Hour!
