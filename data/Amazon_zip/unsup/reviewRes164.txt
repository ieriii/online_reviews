My fiance took me to Alinea for my birthday, and it was definitely a once in a lifetime dining experience. Two weeks later I am still talking about it and showing pictures to anyone who will listen.  Each course was completely unique and played with your sense of sight, smell and taste. We opted to not do the wine parings, and I am glad we made that decision. Both of us were so full by the end, we could barely finish the one glass of wine we'd each ordered. Plus, if you're a light weight like me, you'd be so drunk by the end that you wouldn't get to fully enjoy the final courses (the wine pairings amount to approximately 4 glasses per person). I loved the fact, too, that the wait staff had a sense of humor. You could tell they love what they do and take the food they are serving very seriously. But, they all had a dry sense of humor that kept things light and fun.  This was a dining experience I will never forget, and is easily the best dinner I have ever had.
