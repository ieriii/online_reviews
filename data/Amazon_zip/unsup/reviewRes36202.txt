Beautiful. Really beautiful presentations of Thai and sushi. Four of us did a lot of plate sharing, so we got a lot of sampling done. Some very creative menu items, including novel cocktails with Asian influences. (I notice a lot of reviews describe this place as BYOB, which must be old news.) The room itself is not beautiful, the outdoor seating is unattractive, and some of the artwork on the walls is interesting-but-creepy, but I wouldn't take away the fifth star for that, because the food (reasonably-priced, BTW) is, well, beautiful.
