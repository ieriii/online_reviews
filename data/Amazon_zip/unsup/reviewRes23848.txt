So I belong to this dinner club and we do different cuisines every month - honestly I wasn't all that keen on crepes; and was I WRONG or what? I have since then eaten @ Icosium literally 1/2 dozen times. Given that it is out of my way in every direction possible and involving a transfer, that's saying a lot about this tiny but cozy Algerian cafe. Chicago crepes is my favorite but I would recommend everyone to build their own and check out how creative you can get. Dessert crepes will blow your mind!!! I am surprised I can still type... ;-)
