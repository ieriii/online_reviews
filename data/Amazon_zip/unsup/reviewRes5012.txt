Wine Cheese and Swine. Yumm. As long as you avoid the post work crowd you can find a table here and nosh on some delicious small plates for half of what you would expect out of such a quality downtown Chicago restaurant. Their toasted bread is one of the most addicting things I have ever come across and love the fact that they make it a part of almost every dish. Getting panchetta mussels served in a mini pig dish made me squeal with joy. I also had my first introduction to bone marrow here and it couldn't have been more pleasant. They also have Co Bigelow soap in the bathrooms which is a nice touch.  My one complaint is that a distinguishing feature is communal seating at some of the tables. When you get some crazy lady slamming on the table and rattling the dishes on which your food sits, it makes for both a distraction and annoyance.  I will be back here every visit I make to Chicago in the future because their entire menu just rocks.
