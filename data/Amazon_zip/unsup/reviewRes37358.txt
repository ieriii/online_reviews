Great grocery store with a deli off the side. The chocolates and coffee selection is above average. If you want to get unique treats for a friend I would recommend this place.They don't let you take pictures of anything in here (and are pretty fast at yelling at people) so I guess its common people want to take pics? not sure. The cafe was a bit overpriced...we had the salmon breakfast meal (not sure exactly what it was) and that was good. The sandwiches weren't as good at zingermans. It seemed like whole foods...a little more homey...higher priced but not different enough that I would come back for anything specifically.
