Bin 36 hosts a series of Wine (and Wine & Pairings) classes. Last week I attended their "Wine Speak" class, which was led by Jan Henrichsen. Jan is an engaging and extremely knowledgeable asset to the Bin family. She packed this 30-minute course with innumerable wine facts. I can now expand my wine assessment beyond "Yum" or "Yuck"! I can tell you if my wine has legs, is fruit-forward or mineral driven, if it's an honest wine or if it betrays it's nose! Can't say enough, LOVED the class & will be taking more of them.
