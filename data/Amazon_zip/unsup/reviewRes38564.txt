See the other 700+ reviews, but I'll add my piece: This place really is great...if you're lucky enough to grab a table. If not, there are plenty of other places to check out in the neighborhood. If you do get that table though--there are plenty of options here to keep you and your group settled in 'til close. Check out the CB&J! This place is a favorite of mine, if we can beat the crowds. Oh yeah, and Delirium Tremens is where it's at.
