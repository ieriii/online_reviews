Another yelper (An P) is totally right about Hopleaf. What ever happened to you, Hopleaf? Great food, awesome beer selection, but what happened to the service? Waited an hour and a half on a Monday night for a seat.. no biggie.. they're busy and the place was packed.. plus got to go to George's Ice Cream and Sweets down the street :P Once we were seated we promptly ordered the mussels and the mac and cheese.. Two really, really good dishes.. Forgot what I had to drink, but I've never been disappointed in trying different beers which this place has a plethora.. Problem was I could of used another beer or two with dinner and we could of gotten another ginger ale as well.. Unfortunately, we didn't get more drinks as the next time we saw our waitress after taking our food order was about 30 minutes after we were done eating.. She came back with dessert menus to which we just asked for the check. Another 25 minutes pass.. No check.. Finally she brings the check and doesn't come back for another 15 minutes so we left leaving cash.. Hopleaf, I know you're busier than before, but you can't leave people alone unattended for so long. We would of been happy to stay more and drink, but that would of required asking if we needed anything else.. If we wanted, we could of just left without paying as the place was overpacked and our waitress was nowhere to be found.. tsk tsk..
