OH GOD yes. I had one of those, hey ex-boyfriend, let's catch up nights, and we came to Pequod's. The place was packed, meaning that I could blame my spaciness / awkwardness on being overstimulated, which I very much appreciated. As for the pizza, holy crap it was good. We got pepperoni and jalapeno, and it was yummy. The sauce is good - flavorful and not too garlicky, and the cheese on the crust really is great.
