I would recommend this restaurant whole-heartedly!It's small, quaint, and charming. The food is excellent. I have eaten here on the first year that it opened and the menu changed through the years. I like friendly chef who greeted us at the table (a very nice personal touch). Reservations a must. The restaurant is small so it is impossible to get a table during weekends.
