The hotel is beautiful with many subtle Chicago touches. I stood in a wedding here last weekend and it was just ok. While checking in at the front desk I was not sure what name the room was booked under but the gentleman apparently doubted if I was even at the right hotel. I believe he was joking but his insinuation was not appreciated. We stayed three nights and the first day our room was not cleaned. I called the front desk with two questions and no one picked up. The message I left was never returned. The suite we got ready for the wedding in did not have a dvd player or anything for us to hook a computer up to the tv with. When I did encounter staff they were nice but overall the experience was underwhelming. The wedding party had a wonderful weekend but the bottom line is for the market the hotel is trying to market itself in (close to $400 a night rooms, $15 dollar drinks) the service and small touches were simply not on par with the rates. We easily could have had an equally good time somewhere else.
