I could get used to this lifestyle. My husband surprised me with dinner at Alinea for my birthday, and it epitomized a luxurious dining experience in every way. Alinea knows what its doing, from top to tippy toes. Instead of deconstructing every aspect of my superb meal, I present the highlights: - attention to detail, from a new linen napkin every time you get up to visit the restroom, to the valet who found us free parking across the street - a vegetarian meal that substituted ingredients to create food that never compromised on flavor, AND produced results identical to what everyone else was eating - personalized souvenier menus - courses that focused on all the senses - especially sight, taste, and smell (the sweet smell of cedar, the nutmeg air - infused pillow) Every part of our food was surprising and beautiful, but I do think Alinea does better on savory courses than sweet. Only because these are the memories that linger. Special standouts were the one bite courses. I could never imagine that such a burst of complementary flavors could come through in a single mouthful. Whatever you need to do to have a meal here - clean out your bank account, take out a second mortgage - do it.
