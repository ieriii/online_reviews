This place was too good to express in coherent sentences, but I'll try. We were astounded with the selection they offered for the salad bar... smoked salmon, sushi, tuna, heart of palms, and just so much more. That was just the salad bar. We tried to pace ourselves, but once we flipped that card over to the green side... Dang... they just kept coming at us with the meat. Even when we had the card flipped over to the red side, the meat just kept coming. I was with two other guys and they both backed down after the second round. I tried to go for a third round just to finish what was left on my plate and squeeze in some desert, and I almost didn't make it out the door. I was just sooo stuffed. The servers were amazingly attentive and the acrobatic performance that they put on for those getting bottles of wine just went above and beyond. The ambiance was fantastic. We felt like royalty while we were there which was great. Unfortunately, we left with a bill to match, but they worked hard and we ate well so it was well worth it.
