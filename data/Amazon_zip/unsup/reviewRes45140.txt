Happy to have the fabulous weather this week-end, I wanted to enjoy great food outdoors. Friends had shared that Anteprima had an intimate patio and I was ready to try it out! As I'm able to walk to Anteprima, we were greeted promptly and taken to the lovely patio (small due to the large parties). Our server was a lack luster server who really did not provide any guidance and no assistance describing the menu. He just stood in front of us like we were supposed to take the Q and provide him direction (mute actor perhaps??). The food however was fantastic! Sunday - Thursday, they have a $29 3 course prix fixed menu with 2 options: 1 starter, 1 pasta 1/2 order, 1 entree OR 1 starter, 1 entree, 1 dessert. We went full bellied and went for the pasta inclusive option (insert smile and rubbing belly motion). We had the grilled octopus and zuccini florets - both perfectly prepared and delicious, next came the pasta: orecchiette pasta with spicy lamb sausage and bitter greens- good and spicy but the bitter greens soured me a bit, would not get again. The spaghetti with clams was to die for, still thinking about it today!! Entrees were the grilled duck and portebello mushrooms and NY Strip steak with arugala, preferred the savory duck but both were solid choices. Overall, excellent food, great neighborhood italian place, want to go back but the service was really lacking.
