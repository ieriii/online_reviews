At one point my dad probably single-handedly kept this place in business. He managed to bring every single one of my relatives here when they came into town... and we have a big extended family! I was expecting not to like Carnivale, mostly because it sounded so over the top from what I'd heard about it. In reality, the service and food at Carnivale are top-notch, and everything is done and served with festive Latin flair. I still found the colors and music a little loud and bright for my tastes in the main room but think I might have preferred one of the smaller side rooms. If you want to eat somewhere that's unforgettable, Carnivale is definitely that!
