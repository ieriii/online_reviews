yes it is as good as it gets....no better!!! If you like meat this is definately the place to be!!! I keep going around and trying new restaurants and steakhouses and came to one conlusion....i like other restaurants but i really enjoy fogo!!! I have no complaints and their salad bar rocks....for desert you have to, have to try the tres leche!!! It will leave you speechless but wanting to return for more!!! I give fogo 5 stars because there aren't 6!!!
