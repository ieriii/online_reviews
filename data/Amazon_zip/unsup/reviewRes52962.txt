We ate here for Anne S.'s birthday celebration, and the food was incredible. I loved every bit. The cassava chips with garlic were yummy. My chicken rice dish was oh so good. I love plantains and I never get to eat the often enough. So of course I was very happy. We really stuffed our faces and even shared Anne's desert. Cause she's nice like that. There was some funny business on the bill result in a questionable discrepancy of a couple of dollars. I may have been more miffed about it if I wasn't in a total happy food coma. I was just too delightfully full of delicious food to put forth the effort. Overall, not too shabby. It is a really cute place. Or server was a sweetheart. They also have a lovely patio space that we would have loved to experience had the weather been more agreeable.
