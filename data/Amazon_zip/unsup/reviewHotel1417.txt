The man and I decided to do a last minute hotwire valentine's night in the city and this hotel is one we got. I have to say the price, $95 is incredibly low for a downtown hotel. I loved the close proximity to the Mag mile shopping and restaurants. The hotel itself is very quaint but they have remodeled it in a streamlined way. The room was small but big enough for two. The bed extremely comfortable and the big screen TV a hit. I was disappointed that there wasn't a bath tub (it being valentines day and all) but the rain head shower was nice. Staff were friendly, the girl at check in with the dripping nose should probably get a hanky though! LOL I'd go back and might if it ends up being my hotwire selection next time!
