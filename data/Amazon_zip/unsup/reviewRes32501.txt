We get takeout here several times a week for dinner - our kids would get it every night if we'd let them. Dine in or take out are equally good. If you're looking for a family friendly place - the staff are extremely welcoming to children so bring'em along. If you're looking for the best deal - check out their lunch special! Less than $10 for a combination platter and pop. Yummy! One warning - like many restaurants that have spicy foods etc, if you bring in your winter coat to dine with you - expect it to smell like Ethiopian food for the next few days.
