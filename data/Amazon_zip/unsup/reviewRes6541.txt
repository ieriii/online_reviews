This place is the bee's balls. The food was fresh and innovative, the server was attentive and my friend and I were in and out of there relatively quickly, without feeling rushed by the staff. My friend and I picked this spot as a pre-show feast before a concert at the nearby UIC Pavilion. It's a bit of a walk but not bad at all. We ate the following: *the honeycomb and ricotta with toast. What a combo. Light, creamy and sweet app. *next up was the marscapone polenta (if you've never had polenta, it's similar to grits) and the ragu of the day. Today's was veal meatballs. The combination again was out of sight - richness of the veal mating with the smooth creaminess of the polenta. Killer stuff. *next up was the pizza de la fattoria. It included pork belly, potato, scallions, asiago, bchamel, and, get this, egg yolk drizzled over it. Rich and full of flavor. *But the piece de resistance was the Davanti Burger. One wouldn't think to try a burger at an Italian joint, but that person would be wrong. The carnivorous delight includes something delicious called "bacon jam" along with roasted tomato, fried cheese curd, arugula and smeared with roasted garlic mayo. Bravo!
