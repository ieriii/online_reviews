Mad props to any place for being open as late as this one, first off. And its centerpiece, the barbecuing, is done well and a fun experience. The panchan is an explosion of variety. Pricewise and servicewise, I'd say it's alright. Location, quite far north in the middle of nowhere, is a bit of an obstacle, but whatever. Though I'm not in love, if you're looking for BBQ I'll give you this name first. (Also it's hilarious that this place is in the category "Gas & Service Stations." Almost +0.5 star.)
