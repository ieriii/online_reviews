OK... the food was good but nothing to go back for. I don't know why everybody gets excited for a sandwich finished off in the oven. My sandwich was over salted and the bread was so hard it cut my mouth. If Rick's name wasn't on this place with the exact same food it would go out of business. Really! Do you all like over paying for a sandwich you can easily make at home with a can of SPAM.........YEEEEEESSSSSSSS! Get real people.
