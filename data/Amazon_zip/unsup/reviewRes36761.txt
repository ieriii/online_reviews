Went there with the hubs and 1 other couple last Friday. We ordered 8 sushi rolls to share and were rather surprised when all 8 dishes were delivered to our 2 small tables at the exact same time. The big plates they use for cute presentation took over our tables leaving us very little room to move around. The tables are so close together that I felt too squished to leave the table to wash my hands. On the upside - the food was lovely. We order a lot of delivery from Indie but the crab rangoons are MUCH nicer eaten at the restaurant - the filing is liquid awesome.
