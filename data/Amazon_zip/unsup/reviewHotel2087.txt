I attended a banquet dinner here and I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised. Easily, one of the better banquet meals I've had in a while. I tend to steer clear of chicken in fear of having to consume dry tasteless chicken but it was seasoned well and juicy. The vegetables were fantastic as was the chocolate cheesecake with raspberries. I would highly recommend hosting an event here. From what I heard from the host, they were easy to work with and were extremely accommodating.
