Rating: Superb Phenomenal, creative, classy. Some of the words that immediately come to mind when I think of my visits to Tru. One of the finest restaurant in the city, without a doubt. Having been fortunate enough to try many top restaurants in the country, Chicago's Tru ranks up there with the best. I first encountered the talented Executive Chef Rick Tramonto at Trio Evanston and his style, selection and implementation of the menu items is truly (sorry-couldn't resist) spectacular. Definitely get the Grand Tasting Menu, incorporating a wide variety of courses giving the customer a solid feel for culinary nirvana. If you go to celebrate a special occaision, be sure to mention it when making a reservation as the staff is extremely attentive and will even create a customized menu for you--a must if you want to recall the whirlwind of preparations and ingredients. A must try, but plan on around $160 per person without drinks for the Grand Tasting Menu, block out 3 hours and Let the Good Times Roll!
