Yes, I know the prices are high...but this is a store where you can get certain things you won't find at Jewel.  For example...delicious red velvet cupcakes with cream cheese frosting. Yum. Do you need a box of Cafe Du Monde bignets? Well, look no further! Do you want a tube of tomato paste?! You can find it here! Though I can't afford to go here for all my grocery shopping, this is a great option for all the hard to find goodies.
