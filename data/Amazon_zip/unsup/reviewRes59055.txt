One day after finishing breakfast I was doing some reading with my coffee. The manager came up to me and ask if I had a problem, I said no, he then ask me to leave so he could turn over the table.This is the most insulting thing than any restaurant can do!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I will never go to this place again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
