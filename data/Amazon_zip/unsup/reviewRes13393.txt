Yes, I know this is my second update review on Glenn's but this must be said. I have been coming here regularly for 3 years now. My last couple visits I have noticed the food & service slipping down the slide. My husband also mentioned the same. He comes here way more often than I do. We just came here for brunch/lunch on Saturday. I had the Reuben and he had the Canadian scramble. My sandwich had more sauerkraut than corned beef. I also had cole slaw instead of their famous potato pancake. My slaw was very heavy with mayo that I couldn't eat it. I ate half of my Reuben because I didn't want to eat a vat of sauerkraut. Usually their scrambles are really good and well "scrambled" together. My husband's Canadian scramble was scrambled eggs with the other fixings just placed on the side of his eggs. He had to mix everything together. The scramble tastes better with everything mixed in. Maybe there is a new cook in the kitchen or they are doing things differently? I want to go back because they have an awesome fish selection. I may give Glenn's a break for a while. I hope one of my most treasured dining spots in the neighborhood will not let me down next time.
