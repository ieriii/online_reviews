One thing that's tough to find in this town is a place that serves great non-fried chicken. Well....my search is now over! Tried Fogo 2 Go this week and their Brazilian BBQ chicken is top-notch. $11.99 will get you a whole chicken and 2 sides (the mashed potatoes kick-ass)....the chicken is melt-in-your-mouth great, authentic Brazilian BBQ (minus the price you'll find at places downtown). They are great for delivery too!!! Person on the phone was extremely professional and actually told me how many orders were in his que prior to mine. The ETA he gave me was accurate within five minutes. Food is delivered promptly and hot!!!!! GREAT JOB FOGO!!!!!!! Keep it up.
