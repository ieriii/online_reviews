Salad bar and soup was great. The meaty was salty, I know that meats at churascaria's are usually a lil salty but this was way saltier than fogo was ( they offered to prepare with less salt.). The service on the other hand was an excellent ,well trained, well oiled machine and The deserts where amazing. I didn't drink because they didn't have a liquor license when I went. Overall great service great salad bar choices good meat (just salty).
