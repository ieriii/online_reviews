Classic old school Italian restaurant with many traditional dishes with a huge menu. Very friendly staff and owners. Nice atmosphere. Cute 'tucked away' private booths are perfect for dates. Everything I've ever ate here has been delicious, and you should never go home hungry. Complimentary pizza bread given to every table as well as a whole loaf of Italian bread. Perfectly crispy on the outside, nice and soft on the inside. Entrees are served with soup and salad and a side of pasta. How can you go wrong? Great value and moderately priced. Some favorites include the Steak Diane, any steak here is really tender and cooked well, veal parm, Lobster night on Wednesdays, and Rich's special which comes with filet, veal limone, and breaded shrimp with veggies for $20, cant beat it. I understand the desserts are great too but never had room. Highly recommended for just about any occasion.
