Great neighborhood Italian food. If you go on a Friday or Saturday night, make sure you make a reservation because it does get a bit cramped when you have to wait, but if it's nice out, it's nice to wait outside. It's BYOB with no corking fee. They also deliver, but I like eating there better because it has great ambiance and decoration. I've taken out-of-town friends there several times because it's right down the street, and everyone has loved the food.
