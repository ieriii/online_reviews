the wait here is too long for what the food experience is worth. Granted i am not a big fan of deep dish pizza, but when in Chicago, you do as Chicagoans do (or maybe real Chicagoans don't really go here at all?) Anyhow, if you're lactose intolerant, do not come here.....there must have been at least 2 pounds of cheese in our medium pizza. I am not lactose intolerant, but just looking at it, made me feel like i should be. And as some other reviewers have mentioned, where's the sauce? if the the whole purpose of the deep dish pizza is for one to stuff as much ingredients in there as possible, then i'd like to see the sauce portion to be at least half as proportionate as the cheese. Anyhow, i don't think I'd miss the pizza here.
