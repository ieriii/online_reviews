Oh man due i love Garcia's! Ive bin coming here since 2001 since my boy Kevin brought me here for the first time.....this place rules......great Mexican food...prompt service...and the corona's are always ice cold....i was hanging out with my buddy Luke and we were trying to figure out what to eat and he threw out Mexican so i said Garcia's and to my surprise he had never bin there....i had the #1 Combination plate which included 1 Chile Relleno-2 Steak Enchilladas-Rice & Beans and a small salad for $9...it was fantastic....Luke had the Steak Torta with rice and beans which he loved...and again the beers were just freezing everytime a new one was brought...For 50 bucks total we both ate and drank like kings!
