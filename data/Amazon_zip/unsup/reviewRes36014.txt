Having worked near Halsted in the Greektown area for the last 14 years, Meli Cafe has become my second home! THE best place for breakfast in the area. Best omelet and waffles I have ever had. I love this place. It's super small, and always packed, so be prepared for a wait but once you sit down the breakfast is worth it! It's not cheap eats, so be prepared to pay a pretty penny for breakfast, but the food is worth it!
