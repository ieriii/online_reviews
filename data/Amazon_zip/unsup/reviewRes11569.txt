The wait was almost unbearable. I was set on trying this place out though despite that a friend I was with really wanted to give up and go ANYWHERE else in the vicinity. He seemed to think it was worth the wait afterwards. My raspberry cheesecake hot cakes were AMAZING, and I had some of the chocolate french toast tower too. All around good food and service, but the wait for a table and food were the reason a star was lost. Mmmmm, GREAT food. Try it out!
