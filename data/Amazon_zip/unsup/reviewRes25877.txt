First - the rating of 3 Stars is not for the food - it was great. It was not for the service - it was excellent. The three stars are for the portion size (small) and the physical restaurant. Portion size - I know this is a Tapas restaurant and portions are supposed to be small. And they were. Too small in my opinion. I think about 50% bigger would be similar to other tapas restaurants. Physical Restauarant - the room is very big, and very spread out, with exceptionally high ceilings. It is no an intimate place. I felt like I was in a train station lobby or hotel lobby rather than a restaurant. Not much they can do about the high ceilings - maybe hang some banners or put in a tent. While i liked the food, I would not go here again.
