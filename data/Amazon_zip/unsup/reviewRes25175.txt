We came here for the Chicago Restaurant Week special. I really enjoyed the dark ambience and the food, my husband wasn't such a fan of the dark but really did love his steak and scallops. I loved the shrimp, and I really did enjoy the cheese fondue. I just wish the bread was toasted... that would have been amazing. The dipping sauces were also highly tasty, and the portion for the dinner special was just right. The service was great, and I would definitely come back here with a group! One little tip... it seems obvious, but the trick to fonduing well without losing all of your food, is making sure that the fork angles up when you put the food in... that way it won't slide off when you grab it. It took me a while to discover that pearl of wisdom. ;0)
