We got in on Saturday for the "Underground" menu. The small staff does a synchronized dance of course distribution which results in each table literally getting the same course at the same time. The process is so intent, you feel like you're imposing when asking a question. But I did have questions. Probing ones like: should I be putting the gourmet mushrooms in the consomme (which tasted burnt)? Should I be working from left to right when tackling the multi-faceted duck course (which was tasty, but not stellar)? Like foreign policy, these are crucial issues that warranted proactive explanations. That excitement that comes with the staff illustrating the dishes is half the fun at a place like this. Call me high maintenance, but I felt shafted by having a plate put in front of me without a peep. More about the food...The pork tenderloin course with apples was amazingly hearty, but the cut was a bit tough. The meal ended with a tiramisu that was solid, but felt standard. It was a very good meal, not great. I'll chalk it up to the night and menu.
