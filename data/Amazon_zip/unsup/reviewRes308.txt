I went here Saturday night for my wedding anniversary. We did the short menu... only like 12 courses (only!).  The atmosphere was great.. We walked into a glowingly lit entrance hall, and then the sliding door to the left silently opened to let us in. It was very futuristic. I LOVED the food. Some of it was really good, some of it blew my mind. There was a soup that made me laugh while I was eating it... it was so fun to dig around and try the different tastes, textures and temperatures. We also did the wine pairing, which was wonderful too. The sommelier knew his stuff, and told us the story behind each bottle as he was pouring it (note that this was primarily because we showed interest... i don't get the feeling that he would have forced this on unwilling listeners). My only negative was the price. The short tasting was $145 per person, plus $110 more for wine, and tea & coffee at the end were $6 each. The whole thing, including tax & tip, was about $700 for the two of us. Yeah, $700. I'm not sure anything is worth that. Think about what you can buy for $700. But clearly, people are willing to pay that amount. And it was fabulous stuff, beautifully and whimsically presented without crossing the line to ridiculous (no pop rocks or smashed corn nuts and the use of foams was quite restrained). So... in the end I would say it was one of the best meals of my life, but I'm still struggling with the price. I may go again, but boy, if it were a little less expensive I would go a lot more.
