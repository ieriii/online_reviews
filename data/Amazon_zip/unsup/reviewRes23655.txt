I write this review as I devour the leftovers from my Huevoz con Chorizo and I am trying to figure out what is there to add about this place that hasn't already been said in the 273 million reviews that it currently has. But I will try anyway. I walked in nursing a killer hangover from the night before and just wanted to eat and read the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy for the quarter millionth time. It was 4:30 pm (don't judge, it was a rough night) and I finally got out of bed and wanted breakfast. And since it was half way decent outside, I finally decided to venture out to Irazu after having read the yelp reviews on multiple occasions but never managing to make it there. The chips came with 2 kinds of salsa and both were pretty spicy. I loved it. Most places I go, I have had to learn to accept that the salsa is not going to be spicy enough to my liking. No such issues at Irazu. The huevos con chorizo and the oatmeal shake kicked the crap out of the hangover I was nursing. I also came to the realization that eggs scrambled with spicy sausage is the greatest idea ever and wondered why was I not doing this every day of my life? I'll be back. And often. A good place to go grab some breakfast as a really late lunch/early dinner.
