Great restaurant with good food and excellent owners. I've only had 4 dishes or so here, but they were all 4/5 stars if not better. Now when I come, I just get the staple beef pho and call it a day. 7 bucks to fill me up? I'm down. They always end your meal with complimentary fruits. It ranges from mangos, pears, apples, to pineapples and blueberries. 2 more good things about them. 1) The owners/waitresses are always so nice and helpful when you're there. 2) If you order to-go, they package everything so nicely!4 stars for food, 5 for service. Bumped down to a 4 since this isn't a high-end restaurant, so the actual food should count more than the experience.
