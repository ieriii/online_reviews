I stayed here for a business trip and had an average-good experience. At least it was not the boring cookie cutter hotel I usually have to stay in for these sorts of trips. I got in pretty early, around 10 am and I was able to check in which was great. I didn't have much interaction with the staff but the bell hops out front who opened the front doors for me about 30 times in one day when I decided to try to see Chicago in 8 hours in between fielding work requests were great. The room itself was fine and as to be expected from a hotel like this. Not overly wonderful but certainly comfortable. The bathroom was pretty small and there were too many doors that you had to open and close. If you're staying here for a while you might want to make sure you have one of the bigger bathrooms. There seems to be a lighting problem in this hotel - there were not enough lamps in my room nor did they emit enough light.  I too had the $28 oatmeal and coffee! Seems to be the breakfast of Yelp champions. I do agree it was way overpriced, even by room service standards.  I feel bad for the people that work at the front desk here, they have to do everything by candlelight. They should at least let them have bigger candles.
