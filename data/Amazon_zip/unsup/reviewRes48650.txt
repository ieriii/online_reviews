The food here is great! They have a nice variety of oysters served with mignonette (which is my favorite way for oysters to be served). All the oysters we had were delicious and very fresh. The Hamachi Crudo was to die for. It was seasoned perfectly and the pistachios added a nice butteriness to the fish without overwhelming the delicate nature. We also tried the Veal Sweetbreads, which almost tasted like foie. The preparation was perfect (similiar to MK's early fall preparation of foie). It was so delicious and the best part was that they didn't cook the poor sweetbreads to death, which many places tend to do. Our larger plate selections included the Walleye Fry and the Pork Belly. We loved both. The Pork Belly was perfectly crisped and the ragout was delightful. The belly was so tender and I appreciated that they rendered a lot of the fat off which resulted in a nice chunk of pork belly that melted in your mouth. The walleye fry was also very delicious. The remoulade-like sauce was a nice touch and the sweet potato sticks were awesome. The food was served rather quick here. Great beer selection and a nice alternative to going to a fancy wine-dinner. Best of all everything was reasonably priced.
