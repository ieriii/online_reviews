I have only eaten here once, last year when I was in Chicago. I wish I lived in Chicago so I could eat here all of the time! I can't wait to go back. I had the half pipe sandwich and it was so good. That was only the second time I had ever had seitan and now I am obsessed with it. None of the restaurants in Omaha serve seitan. This place is amazing. I had the coconut cake for dessert, that was the first time I've had a vegan dessert. It was really good!
