I'd venture to say that this is one of the top 3 places to get a microbrew in the city. Awesome selection, pitcher available for $12-18 (for good quality/alcoholic content beer) and a group of quality bartenders. A great atmosphere for hanging out with friends. Do yourself a favor and go see the Neo-Futurist's performance of Too Much Light Makes the Baby Go Blind and follow it up with a 12:30 to 2:00 AM romp out at Hopleaf. Always a good time, and not too expensive for the value of the entertainment ($7-13 for the neo-futurists ticket + $17 for a pitcher with tip = a good night)
