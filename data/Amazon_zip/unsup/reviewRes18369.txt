I was vacillating between four stars and five stars. It's wonderfully quaint in a relatively quiet neighborhood. The prices are very reasonable. The portions are HUGE. I generally stray from cliche and carby Italian food, but I gladly indulged in a huge plate of mushroom risotto and the best bruschetta (w/ fresh mozz) I've ever had. I didn't look closely, but I'm assuming the varied art on the wall is from local artists, and I'm a huge supporter of the local arts and any establishment that is equally supportive.  I was going to go four stars because of a run-in we had w/ someone upon arriving 15 minutes late for our reservation. We're late. We get it. But, telling us that we're late and they'll get busy and waiting even longer to seat us won't help the situation any. We ended up at the same table that stayed empty while we were waiting anyway.  Then I remembered that the manager (or perhaps owner) was very apologetic, stopped twice to ask how our meal was, and that we were toting six bottles of wine between five of us. Five stars it is. I'll definitely be back, and I'll arrive for my reservation on time.
