The Fairmont is STILL fabulous. My Marathon Man and I stayed this weekend, and the location was just perfect. Less than a mile to the starting line. The hotel was rather gracious about extending the checkout time by an hour and a half, so that runners could get their post-race shower. The bathroom is great...beds and pillows were just about perfect for me (husband's ribs were a little sore - I guess his sleep number score is a little higher than mine). The office chair was inspired by the Eames aluminum group - handsome. I especially like it that the rooms are spaced in groups of four, so hallway traffic is minimal. Even if you aren't in town for a race, it's a couple blocks from Millennium Park and scads of terrific sight-seeing.
