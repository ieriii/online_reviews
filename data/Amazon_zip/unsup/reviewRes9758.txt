This was definitely a beautiful and romantic place! I'd say it was 5 stars for the ambiance and romantic candle-lit atmosphere. I made reservations here for Valentine's Day and got a 3 course meal for $50/person. I'd have to say that I was disappointed with the food. I thought there'd be more of a French influence in the dishes but there wasn't even a hint of it. The food was good enough but I could've gotten the same stuff from restaurants at Argyle----with better prices! It would be a nice place to have a special date-night dinner with your significant other. Even then, I wouldn't go again for a special dinner. If you are still willing to give it a try, definitely get the mango sundae. They definitely got it right with that!!
