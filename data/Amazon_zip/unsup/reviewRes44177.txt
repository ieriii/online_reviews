I've stopped in here twice on a whim while having dinner/brunch nearby. Both times I got a red velvet cupcake, once plain with cream cheese frosting, and the second time with a raspberry filling and an italian buttercream. Both cupcakes were delicious! I was very impressed by their italian buttercream. My friend got a vanilla cupcake, which was unfortunately on the dry side. The cakes in the window are BEAUTIFUL. I've not been to the cafe yet, but I've heard great things, so I'm sure I'll be back soon!
