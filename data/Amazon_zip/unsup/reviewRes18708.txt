Okay, three stars alone for the gravy fries/cheese curd concoction!  They make a damn fine burger, too. Mine was served on an English muffin with a white cheddar sauce and mushrooms. Just lovely. I had some kind of ginger infused beer that was a perfect summer brew. Put those ramen noodles away and go get some meat.
