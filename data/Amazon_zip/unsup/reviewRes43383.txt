Yes yes yes! On the other hand, THIS is where the goods are in Chicago! Sunday brunch in the sun, by an open window, Milk & Honey's version of Huevos Rancheros (oh Yes! Yes yes!) steaming before my tearing eyes and anticipating lips, fluffy French Toast and wonderful underful coffee - Yes Yes Yes! And in Wicker Park, it couldn't be better. It's the bester.
