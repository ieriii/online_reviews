Outdoor turns into indoor with portable fireplaces under a lighted glowing tent. Despite the yelp page here, they actually take reservations and mentioned a meal option for such a large group. Apparently, they are trying out this new family style option where you can get horchata, chifrijo (appetizer), salad, plantains, chicken, onion beef, rice and beans and a option for either bread pudding or flan all for the mere price of $18.50 - assuming everyone in your party agrees to it too. The server who took our order didn't know about it had to go back to the kitchen and returned with an astonished look on his face and limited english spoke excitedly, oh it is very, very good!! So yes, we did get family style and asked if we can substitute the as advertised and ever so popular avena, aka oatmeal shake. It has the consistency of a finely blended oatmeal, but taste of a malty horchata. Either way, it lives up to it's name!! Food comes out whatever large bowls they can find and assortment of pyrex, just like how mom would do. It's rustic, it's charming, food is great, with a fun laid back atmosphere, it felt like a mini getaway. If only for just one night. I don't know what they do to the rice and beans dish, or even the chicken casado, but it's flavorful and juicy. No one leaves hungry! We had so much food left we ended up getting boxes for it. After getting stuffed, the bread pudding is way too heavy and eggy, plus it felt weird with golden raisins. The flan is way better. It can get a little loud because of the el, but otherwise if you couldn't figure it out, a fun place to bring friends.
