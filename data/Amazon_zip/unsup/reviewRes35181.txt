In a spirit of co-operation and mutual profit, Sun Wah Bar-B-Que and their neighbor and competitor, Hon Kee Restaurant (on Argyle, near Winthrop - http://tinyurl.com/8zu2n) have worked their schedules out so that we diners seeking Chinese BBQ can get our cravings for bar-b-qued pork, roast chicken or duck, or mixed pork innards, 7-days-a-week. When Hon Kee is closed on Tuesdays, you'll find that Sun Wah is open, while Hon Kee stays open on Thursdays when Sun Wah is closed. Nice, huh?
