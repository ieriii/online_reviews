I went to eat at this Tank Noodle restaurant, and the cashier and waitress there were rude to their customers. It was the worst experience I had from eating at the restaurants. We ordered Pho and Noodle Soups there. As soon after the items were placed on the table, the waitress presented us a check as if they implied that they wanted us to pay and get out of the restaurant. When we finished the meal, I went to pay and the cashier made me waited for five minutes while she was talking with her co-worker. The other male cashier stepped in to take to my money.
