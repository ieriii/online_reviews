Throughly enjoyed my lunch at Milk & Honey the other day. The atmosphere is clean, bright, and informal, cute but not overly sweet. You order at the counter, seat yourself, and wait until the staff brings you your food. The menu items are written on large black boards behind the counter. My avocado, gouda cheese, tomato, and lettuce sandwich on multigrain bread with reduced balsamic was incredibly satisfying. (Note: I substituted mustard with balsamic vinegar, which was absolutely delicious) The sandwhich came with thicker than average potato chips. I am normally not a fan of potato chips, but these were extremely flavorful and not too greasy. My friend had a mixed green salad with rasberries, goat cheese, and slivered almonds, which she really enjoyed as well. Both items were perfect meals to eat on a hot summer day. There is a very good selection of sandwiches at Milk& Honey, as well as breakfast food and special daily salads. I will certainly be returning sometime soon.
