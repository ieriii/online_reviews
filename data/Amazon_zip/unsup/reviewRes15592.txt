This past saturday was my 2nd visit to Carnivale. My first trip was a great experience. I enjoyed the food and a young man, whose name I dont remember, but wish I did, was a very friendly server. The only negative was I was unaware of family night on Sundays. Never again!!! I dont know Latin cuisine very well and while I liked my last meal there, I decided to defer to our server for some help this time.  She asked me some questions about what I like and I very much appreciated this b/c usually servers will just point out their favorites or the most popular dishes. Her name was Andrea and she recommended the Arrachera after I told her what cuts of meats I liked and that I loved onions. She did not steer me wrong! I think I will be getting this every time I eat at Carnivale. So Yummy!  I also think I will be asking for Andrea to be my server from now on. She felt like family. Very warm humor and seemed genuinley concerned with us having the best experience possible. Having been a server in the past, I can be a tough critic when multiple courses are not timed well. We had Sangria for cocktails, Guacamole for an app, main courses, and split the chocolate cake for dessert. Our cocktails came out shortly after we were greeted, which we were able to enjoy for 5-10 minutes before we received our guacamole, which was delicious! The main courses were only brought out after we were finished with the app and it was cleared from the table. No rush and no wait with any of the courses.  The atmosphere is fun and not cramped. The entire staff seems gracious to each guest and the prices are reasonable. I will be returning often! Thanks Carnivale and Andrea!!
