Food wise, this place is simply nothing special. Burger was average and the pizza was average. Service was brutal. And for an average burger, 2 soft drinks, and a personal pizza to come out to almost 40 dollars w/ tip (where any tip would have been generous considering the service) is crazy overpriced. This place is average at best. Just another gimick bar to lure the trust fund hipsters into paying more for food because they brew their own beer.
