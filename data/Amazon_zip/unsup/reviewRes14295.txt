Super cute place that I wanted to go ga-ga over, but just didn't quite live up to the hype. I got the Ropa Vieja dinner. The plantains were awesome and while the meat didn't blow me away, it was certainly a plentiful portion that I managed to eat ALL of. The black beans, however, were a huge dissapointment. There was no flavor - no salt, pepper, bay, nothing. On the other hand, my boyfriend's lechon was seriously rockin - total porky yumminess. I was sneaking bites off his plate any chance I got. Like others have mentioned, this place is super tiny. If you don't like sitting super close and making friends with strangers, I would suggest takeout.
