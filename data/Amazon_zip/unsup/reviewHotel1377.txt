This maybe the best hotel that I have ever visited, based on service.  First, we arrived about 3 hours before scheduled check-in and they let us into our room with no added fee.  Second, they had the most comfortable bed that I have ever slept in.  Third, they had a huge shower with the rainfall spout. The room was a little small, but we were only there to sleep. Fourth, they had a couple very helpful concierges. They made some great restaurant recommendations and were able to get us tickets to a show and give us bus/train information. Fifth, on our check-out day, we were up late the night before and got a late check-out, at no extra cost. Sixth, after our late check-out, they kept our bags at the hotel for six hours until our flight left, at no extra charge.  When it seems like some places nickel and dime you for everything, this place was a welcome relief.   Also, it is a great location, about a block from the Hancock Tower and Michigan Avenue. If you are in town to shop, this is ground zero for upscale shops.
