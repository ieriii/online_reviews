BYOB sushi bar in bucktown that is ok for sushi. The sushi was good, but I have had better taste-wise. I do recommend this place if you want to dine cheaply, but desire the ambiance of a nice restaurant. Definitely DO NOT get the kabob desert thing that my friends and I shared. It was like 4 pieces of fruit and a bowl of hershey's syrup...
