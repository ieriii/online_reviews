We went to a friends birthday, and her boyfriend ordered the birthday cake from Grand Lux. Carrot cake with cream cheese icing! Omg!! It was definetly one of the best carrot cakes I have had, especially when your not a big fan of carrot cake. Next time I will have to keep in mind Grand Lux for desserts/cakes/birthdays
