Definitely enjoyed my trip to Nuevo Leon! I love that they serve a little appetizer with the chips and salsa. This time I was given a delicious bean and meat concoction on a plate with a warm tortilla on top. It was both delicious and I was super starving so I was ready to lick my plate and my friends by the end of it! Our food took a little longer than others around us to come out but I'm thinking it may have been because my friend ordered the fajitas combination. I had a few bites of his food and I loved it! I took his leftovers of the onions and peppers and have already decided that's what I will get next time! I ordered chicken enchiladas suizas with green tomatillo sauce. It was also delicious! I'm definitely obsessed with their refried beans! The guacamole was a little bland, I added salt to cure that problem. Loved the salsa, the darker chipotle looking salsa that came in the smaller dish. Haha wish I knew exactly what kind it was. Cash only!! And I noticed just around the corner they have a parking lot. At 8:45 pm street parking was easy though.Can't wait to go back! It's both a good and bad thing that it's not close to my house. :)
