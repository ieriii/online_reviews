So glad that my first review can be to one of the best restaraunts in Chicago. I took a very special person here for their birthday and it was absolutely amazing. We started with a wine and food pairing in the all glass champagne and wine room. The chefs really knew how to compliment cheeses and meats to their red and white wine selection. After the mini tasting we were escorted to our table. We started with the winter harvest tables. What a selection! There were so many different salads meats breads fruits to choose from that there was no way we would be able to try everything in one trip. Throughout the experience our server kept bringing us little goodies. Our favorite was the mini stuffed red peppers! When it was time for our meat selections we were excited. Chefs came table side similar to a brazzilian steak house except the variety was much more than steaks. We tried all the different chicken salmon ribs and pork. Our tastebuds were overwhelmed with the different flavors and food combinations. Though we thought we couldn't bear dessert our server brought us the s'mores cake... ummmm Aaaamazing! The price was high but I left feeling no regret. The food was the best I have ever experienced and the service was impeccable. The fireplaces add the perfect touch of romance and I can't wait to come back again!
