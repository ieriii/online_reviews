Let me first say that the food is outstanding. Living in the neighborhood, I was so excited when Nana opened. I've been for brunch a few times, and it was really good. So when a friend came in from Toronto we decided to show off our neighborhood's great little gem for dinner. However, the experience was really off-putting primarily due to our server. Overall she was fairly condescending, but we were willing to give her the benefit of the doubt at the beginning.  When we asked questions about the food, she seemed insulted that we questioned anything on the menu. She asked us if we wanted drinks, and we said we were ok with water and I was saying that I might order a drink later, but then she took our drink menus in a bit of a huff. Once we placed our order, she then neglected our table for the rest of the evening.  Given that it was busy, it would have been excusable except she kept stopping at the tables next to us so it was clear she didn't like our table!   We wanted to order dessert, but she brought the check before asking so we decided to go elsewhere.  And, to top it off - our clothes smelled so bad when we left! So....despite the fact that the food is yummy - there are so many other good restaurants in chicago that I'm not sure I'd pay a lot of money for someone to be rude and super snobby to me.
