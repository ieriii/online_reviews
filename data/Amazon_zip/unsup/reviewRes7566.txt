Fogo de Chao is our family's go-to place in Chicago for special occasions and this time we were celebrating Father's Day. From the first sip of a Tropical Caipirinha through the succulent medium rare lamb chops and filet mignon, right down to the last bite of mouth-watering molten chocolate lava cake, Fogo is sure to ignite a fire in your belly!  Included in the price for lunch and dinner is also a fantastic salad bar and three side dishes: plantains, polenta sticks, and positively dreamy mashed potatoes. But those in the know will save their appetites for the main event -- the MEAT! A full bar and excellent customer service complete the experience of dining at this Brazilian Steak emporium.  Five hale and hearty stars for Fogo, the best of the best!
