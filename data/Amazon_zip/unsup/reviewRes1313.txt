I try not to give five stars out too often, but this place deserves every single one of them. Their designer, gourmet dogs/sausages are not only delicious, but are hard to duplicate or find anywhere else in the city. If only they would open up a location the Loop, I would probably be 75 lbs heavier and a lot happier with life. :) The owner is cool and plays by his own rules. Yes, the lines are long. But keep the faith; it is well worth it!
