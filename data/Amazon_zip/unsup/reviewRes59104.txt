One of my favorite simple breakfast restaurants. The owner remembers your face when he isn't busy. I love to work here and I love that they didn't feel the need to overcharge just because of where they are located. The portions have decreased in size since their opening, but this is the only place that understands what I mean by scrambled eggs runny!!!! I LOVE THIS PLACE!! Very crowded on the weekends. Sometimes the wait can be over an hour:(
