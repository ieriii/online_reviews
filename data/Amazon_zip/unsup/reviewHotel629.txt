Please put in some fans in the bathrooms! Why do most of the hotels I stay in these days forgo the wonder of a fan? Water gets on the ceiling, the mirror is foggy, and well, you know, sometimes you need one for other unmentionables. The rooftop pool was not as awesome as the photos would lead you to believe - not really a surprise, though. Check in and out was easy - also easy to sneak extra people into a room as the lobby is always packed and has folks milling around constantly. Our room was cleaned even though we hung out a "do not disturb" sign, which was kind of annoying.... We pricelined the hotel and got a great deal for two nights, so it was worth the money. The hotel restaurant/bar is actually pretty decent as well! We enjoyed a late night 20% off bottle of wine...yummy wine.
