I do love their granola, and confess to eating it literally 5 days a week, but I can buy that anywhere.  As for going to the restaurant - I'm not really blown away, and the whole wait in line to order, and then wait again for your table... I guess I would rather go somewhere else. Food wasn't bad though, just won't get me back.
