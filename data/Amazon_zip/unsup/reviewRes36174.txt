The duck is SOOO good! You can get a whole one for about $16. Most of the food is so cheap and tasty but just be careful of anything with shrimp - in my experience the dishes have been a little fishy-tasting. I highly recommend the duck with rice - only $5 or $6! On Thanksgiving they will cook your turkey for you Sun Wah style. This place is incredible.
