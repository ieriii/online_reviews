We went to L&E for NYE brunch today. The food was very good and the quality of the ingredients used was outstanding. But where food is their forte, the customer experience piece seems to be lacking presently. We arrived about 20 minutes after they opened and were seated promptly by the hostess, yet from drinks to food orders things just seemed to be amiss. Items were frequently forgotten even after multiple requests, special dietary requests seemed a bit daunting (nothing annoying or super-specific, but I'm pregnant so I just asked for no soft yolks on my eggs), and our food arrived to the table a bit cooler than desired. I will say, however, that what our waiter lacked in efficient customer service strategies he made up for with a pleasant personality and an amiable smile. Overall everyone in our party greatly enjoyed their menu selections, and I will certainly return again in hopes that I simply experienced an off day on the service side.*On a side note, the soap they provide in the restroom is simple heavenly!
