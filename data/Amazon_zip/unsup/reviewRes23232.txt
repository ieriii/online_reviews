I first ate at Irazu about 10 years ago while gearing up to spend a month at a Costa Rican high school.  I remember thinking the neighborhood was really divey and gritty at the time--but things change.  Luckily the tamarindo shake/refresco hasn't changed.  Costa Rican food isn't as spicy as other cuisines of central America--and I like it that way. I usually get an order of casado and have enough to take some home. I have tried to make my own gallo pinto at home, but it's never quite as good as theirs. And really, why shouldn't cabbage salad be served at every meal?
