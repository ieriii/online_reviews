AMAZING!!! From start to finish, this restaurant blows all of the other Brazilian steakhouses out of the water. For one, it's got the most selection on the harvest table with a wide assortment of cold and hot dishes to feast on. The plantains that come to the table are about as mouthwatering as the rolls and regardless of how much meat I eat, I always ask for seconds on the rolls and plantains. I find that the gauchos here are more personable and pleasant. Everyone is extremely informative on how the drill works. The ambiance is a little classier and special than the competing restaurants in this genre. This has a more romantic feel to it, although I'd hardly call anything about shoving your face full with your body's weight of delicious grilled and cured meats romantic. Doubt it is going to send anyone home for some intimate moments. The tables seem a little more secluded though which I appreciate since I feel it necessary to attempt to hide my gluttonous consumption here. With additions like grilled shrimp and grilled pineapple to help cleanse your pallet between the rounds of seasoned meat is just a nice touch that some of the others don't have. Another huge positive is that once in a while I get a buy one meal get one free coupon in the mail. As soon as one of those arrive, it's a given it will get used.
