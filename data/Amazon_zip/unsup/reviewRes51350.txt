Garcia's sets the bar for my pastor and fish tacos. You get a great filling meal out of the $5 burritos, but tastewise not as good as the tacos. One thing I got to scold you for is the guacamole though. I'm sorry Garcia's but it was an utter disappointment. It seemed like there wasn't much avocado content and mostly some kind of filler. I have to tell ya, even Chipotle does better guac!
