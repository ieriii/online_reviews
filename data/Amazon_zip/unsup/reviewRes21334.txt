I do find xoco to be very good, particularly for the money. However, it's not as incredible as some people say it is. I found myself underwhelmed by the Milanesa, woodland mushroom and Cochinita Pibil, although I know that many swear by the latter. The pepito was a very good short rib sandwich. Guacamole and Chocolate are both fantastic.  The best menu item is the Saturday special: goat barbacoa. It's one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. Unfortunately, Saturdays are even more busy than the rest of the week, and I haven't been able to get it again. Along these lines, I recommend going at off hours if you want to sit down, or alternatively, takeout is much faster.
