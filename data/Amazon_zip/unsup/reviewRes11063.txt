Was much better years ago, but getting worse. Pizza crust used to be my favorite but now it taste like cardboard. Service is good, but forget about having working air conditioning during any days above 32 C or 80 F. Always packed because people go there because its mainstream; remember, new, trendy, mainstream, then up for sale.
