OMG, everyone needs to go to this place. It's a small, verrrry small, family-run restaurant hooked onto a bar. You will not find more reasonable food in the city, plus it is DELICIOUS! Don't get distracted by the aging decor, think shabby chic... Head here for Saturday breakfast / early lunch (they close at 11:30am and are not open on Sundays) or stop by for either meal during the week (open until 1pm). Servers are friendly and treat you like family. All the food is terrific, but don't leave without getting a cup / bowl of the cream of chicken with rice soup. It's a bit salty, but you won't find tastier soup anywhere in the city. Like I said above, this place is tiny! The earlier you get there (before 8 or 9am), the better your chances of scoring a table. Sometimes you may have to wait 15-20 minutes. Parking can be tight during busy times, and you may need to circle the residential block to find a spot if you aren't lucky enough to score something in the 2 tiny lots. Food is usually served very quickly. Tons of cops eat here, so it must be good, right? RIGHT!
