Came here during Bonsoiree's Valentine's day special menu... This ain't a cheap meal...but it's worth every penny! I personally loved the wagyu beef and dessert the most... I wish I could make those heavenly green tea milk shakes at home! Bring someone special to this place. It won't disappoint...but I would highly advise checking out the pre-fixe menu first online! (Seems to change often!)
