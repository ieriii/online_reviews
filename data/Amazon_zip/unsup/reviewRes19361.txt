I'm moving far away this summer to a place halfway across the world. My time in Chicago is coming to an end and, frankly, there's a lot I won't miss. Coast, among a handful of other places, will definitely receive a weepy goodbye from me. I love Coast. I always have. Truly, it is one of the top 3 best sushi places I have ever been to...anywhere. The fish melts in your mouth and the maki mono never looks or tastes like it was just baptized in rice. Sure, it's a wee bit on the pricey side but if entrance into Heaven required a bottle of wine and $100 (which is usually what I spend on average when it's my boyfriend and I) then I'd say most people would gladly pay up. I know I would, and do. This, my friends, is sushi divinity. Hell yeah.
