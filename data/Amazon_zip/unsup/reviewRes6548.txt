We went here of course because we had a Lettuce Entertain You gift card. I have to tell you though, I was so surprised at how unbelievable the food was. We went there as sort of an "after the fact" holiday dinner. We made reservations, but we still had to wait about 20 minutes. Not bad at all in opinion. It gave us a chance to grab a cocktail at the cute fully stocked bar they have on the side of the restaurant! After we were seating, our waiter showed up right away. He was great! I wish I could remember his name, but he was awesome! Suggesting great bottles of wine, and his favorite dishes. I chose one of the specials and my boyfriend got the fillet. We both were mmmm'ing all through dinner. After dinner, we chose a great brownie thing. Our server ended up giving it to us for free. Overall, I would have to say it was the best! We would go back there a million times over. I recommend it for sure!
