Delicious!!! I have lived in Italy, thus as extremely particular about Italian food in Chicago, especially pizza. I've heard about this place for years, and finally made my way out there last night. OMG! SO GOOD! I woke up craving it today! My boyfriend felt the same -- as close to being in Italy as it gets in Chicago. And they have pizza bianca! Yum yum yum!!!PS: You get a complimentary canoli on your way out -- what a lovely sweet touch!!! Thank you, Spacca Napoli!
