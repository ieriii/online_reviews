Pros: - Lots of side dishes to eat and try, especially if you're not comfortable with Korean food - Fairly large restaurant so there's hardly a wait - Not necessarily a place where you get bang for a buck, but pricing is fair for what you get in quality and quantity Cons: POOR AND SLOW SERVICE! They tried to bring us our check without giving each of us the soup that is included in the meal and when we complained about it, they didn't apologize and didn't seem to care. Instead, they threw us our soups and ignored our table for at least 30 minutes after. FYI, there is a buzzer on every table that lets the servers know you need something....but apparently everyone was deaf that day. Overall, it was a very AVERAGE outing for Korean BBQ. I'd rather go wait in line at Cho Sun Ok....and you should too.
