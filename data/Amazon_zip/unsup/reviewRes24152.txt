nice find in chi-town, came with a host of friends who say this is the real deal for szechuan. 80's zoot suit 'host' at the door is a nice riot. we ordered a ton. cold spicy noodles. chinese 'kimchi'. sauteed bean shoots. spicy fried diced chicken. white fish and vegetable stew. mabo tofu. all good and very spicy. also swing by joy yee noodle further down the strip mall for fruit bubble tea.
