Ok, so never ever ever ever ever ever get the thin crust. What a waste of time! Actually, it was god damn awful. We ordered it for delivery last night, and because the girl on the other end of the phone never asked or repeated back my number, we didn't get our awful pizza until 2 hours later. BUT!!!!! I still can't hate this place. The pan is where it is at, and although I'm super happy they deliver to me, dining in is the way to go. Super yummy crust, cheap beer, what more can you want?
