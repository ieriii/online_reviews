WAY overpriced and food was nothing special. Place was "cute" and pleasant but so what? I had the "Nanadicts", their take on eggs benedict and my wife had one scrambled egg, an english muffin and a fruit cup. Total with coffee was $26, add $6 for the tip and I was out $32, outrageous. And the muffin was as tough as a inner tube and the coffee was so-so. Next time I'm in the neighborhood I'll go to the Ramova Grill, Healthy Foods or the Mexico Steak House.
