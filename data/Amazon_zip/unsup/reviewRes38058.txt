Hopleaf used to be one of my favorite restaurants, and I visited at least monthly if not more often. But the overcrowding is a huge problem, and management doesn't seem that interested in addressing it (no reservations policy) and the staff seems annoyed that you're not willing to wait 2 hours+ for dinner. The food and beer are amazing, though. It's a rare treat now rather than a neighborhood favorite.
