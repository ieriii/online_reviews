A smoked salmon bagel and glass of fresh squeezed orange juice is one of my weekend/hang-over musts! I have had bites of my friend's granola, huevos rancheros and breakfast paninis (served with a side of chips, surprisingly a perfect breakfast side!) all which have thoroughly impressed me. The only thing I would not recommend is the homemade granola bars, kinda hard to eat and tasted a bit gross. Again though, definitely get a glass of the o.j. despite the high price (something like $2.75 for a glass), you will be pleased. And the line goes fast despite its looks. Promise.
