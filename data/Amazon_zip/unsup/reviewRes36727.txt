I love Meli. I want to give it 5 stars. It's my favorite breakfast place in Chicago but every once in a while I'm not crazy about service. I love their specials. I usually get the omlette of the day and 99% of the time I'm glad I did. They combine ingredients I would never think to try together and they work. They serve Intelligensia coffee which I love. Now for the negative. They have gotten better about this but the service can be bad. I understand that there is often a line to get in but it is rude to receive a bill before you are finished eating. I think because of this it is sometimes hard to get a refill on your coffee. This seems to have gotten better. I have not been here in a couple of months so hopefully they keep getting better.
