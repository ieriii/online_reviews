There's a definite reason why the line for this place is typically out the door. I've been here a couple of time and Doug's has consistently delivered the goods. Here's the '411'... - Spicy Thai Chicken: peanut sauce is a bit overpowering but still a tasty dog - Smoked shrimp and pork: definitely a show stopper - The dog: a classic done RIGHT! My friend and I split the spicy thai and the smoked shrimp along with a small fry. Everything was top notch. There are free refills on soda and plenty of hot dog memorabilia to stare at so what are you waiting for???
