I had a great time here. We went on a Saturday around 11:45 and only had to wait 20 minutes (please keep in mind this was right around the holidays so there were a lot of people) I had a standard breakfast of eggs and bacon and it was delicious. I really enjoyed the coffee and the bellin... doughnuts were great! they were really big but light and fluffy and the dipping sauces alone could be enjoyed by anyone. Our waiter was awesome and so were the people who were helping him bring our food. I would love to go back and try dinner!
