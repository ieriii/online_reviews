Great concept. Lots of fun for big groups. The salad bar is tasty and I could just go for that. It has some stuff that you don't normally see on a salad bar like hearts of palm, beets and carpaccio. I had a reservation, and they sat us almost an hour after we arrived. Unacceptable. The service was ok. We asked for a couple of types of meats and it took awhile for the guys to arrive with them. It's noisy and pricey but will definitely keep a large group satisfied.
