After hearing great things about The Art of Pizza, I was really excited to have some. Maybe that set me up for failure? We ordered some of the deep dish and it was not very good. The crust was hard and the sauce tasted really cheap and reminded me of canned generic marinara sauce. Sorry, but I'd pick Lou Malnati's or Giordano's deep dish over The Art of Pizza anytime.
