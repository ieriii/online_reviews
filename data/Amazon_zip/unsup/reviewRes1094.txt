Got there early expecting a crazy line, but it wasn't bad at all. About 20 minutes. Got to the counter and Doug was there taking the order. He's a super friendly guy and you can tell he cares about his business. All of the workers there were also super friendly and kept the place tic tocking along like a well-oiled machine. As for the food, we tried a bunch of options. Duck fat fries - meh. Maybe I was expecting too much since they're so hyped? Side note if you try them - it's a pretty big portion. Easily shared by 2. -Chicago style hot dog - was just okay in comparison to other hot dog places. -Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli - ok but forgettable -Cognac-infused lamb and pork sausage with fig goat butter and centenol cheese - again, just okay. No specific flavors were jumping out on my tongue in joy. -Favorite of everyone I was with by far was a sausage that had Vosges bacon chocolate on it. Funny enough we ordered it for a friend who was late and ended up eating it. SUPER glad we stole her food because it was the saving grace of the sausages. Since the line was short we went back through again when she finally arrived. Unfortunately I don't see it on their menu anymore... I really, really, really wanted to love Hot Dougs. And based on the friendliness of the staff alone I will most likely go back and continue to try their crazy concoctions. But I feel like this place is over-hyped. It has cool menu items, but I didn't find the flavors to be as exciting as they sound. :(
