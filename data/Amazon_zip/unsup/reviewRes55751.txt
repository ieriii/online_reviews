My friend and I have been regular customers at Calo's for a while. On a recent visit in March 2012, on a Sunday at approximately 3:00pm, we decided to stop by for drinks and dinner. We found parking, were seated at a booth by the bar. BTW, there were 3 people sitting at the bar, 2 in the booth behind us and ourselves, for a grand total of 7 people. I observed that there were 2 waitresses working with the napkins/ silverware in a table in the back.The busboy brought us our water and the delicious bread plate. We ate bread and drank water. 10 minutes go by, we eat more bread and more water. 15 minutes pass we ran out of bread and drank sips of water. After 20 minutes, we are out of bread and water and no one has come to take our order. Mind you, there are 7 people in the place. A third waitress arrives, apparently to start her shift, and joins the other two in folding napkins.My friend and I got up to leave. As we pass by the hostess station, we find 2 hostess' and the manager. We told them that we were leaving because no one bothered to take our order after 25 minutes of being seated. They looked at each other, looked back at us, and then back at each other again. We walked out .The manager didn't even offer an apology, a free drink or appetizer, NOTHING!!Sad to say, but you have lost 2 customers for life. Apparently you have gotten too big for your britches! BTW, every time we used to go to Calo, we spent big money between drinks and dinner.We ended up going to Rockwell's Neighborhood Grill ( in the area of Rockwell and Leland) where we were warmly greeted, promptly served, ate a great satisfying meal and paid much less than at Calo.
