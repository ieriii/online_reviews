We Pricelined Hotel Felix and got a pretty good deal. Given what we paid, it was decent. However, if we had paid the rack rate, it might not have been worth it. The decor is very contemporary and minimalist. I very much liked it. The front desk staff was very friendly, but not the most deft at using the computer system. We had to give them the same credit card three times during our one night stay because apparently it didn't get stored to the account. We got into our room and it was small but very well appointed. Unfortunately the bathroom was not cleaned. It was very strange...there was a wet washcloth in there and not the full compliment of toiletries. The manager and housekeeping staff were very attentive to this and solved it quickly. The bathroom has NO counter space. The sink it very cool looking but not very functional. It sits only about three inches below the faucet so you can barely get your hands under it to wash them. The bed linens were nice and the bed was very comfortable. We found their claim that the rooms are "whisper quiet" to be false. We were awakened several times at night by street noises, noises in the hall, and an alarm from the neighboring room. The TVs are full HD and the free Wifi is a plus. We enjoyed a little getaway within the city, but not sure if we'd stay there again...especially if we had to pay full price.
