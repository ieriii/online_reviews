3 words: Roasted bone marrow. I am smitten. Sure, Gilt isn't the only place in town that offers bone marrow on the menu, but their presentation with butter-toasted french toast wedges, fresh parsley leaves and onion jam was perfection. We also tried the hand-cut pork meat balls which were fatty and delicious! The cocktails were strong and yummy as well. I can't wait to go back and try other things on the menu. It's also got a speakeasy-like basement which is only open certain nights of the week (weekend?). That may just be my new hideout during the harsh winter months.
