Overrated...entirely. We had 7:30 pm reservations on a Thursday night - for just two people. 8:15 rolled around, so we asked how long until our table would be ready. We were told that none of the tables seemed to be budging. We waited another 20 minutes before asking again. We were told it'd be at least another 20. After giving the hostess the evil eye, she finally offered us some free tapas and told us we were next on the list. As we ate that (about to eat our hands as well), we noticed that a couple who arrived at least 20 minutes after we had was being seated. We complained to the hostess, who gave us a lame apology. Finally, around 9:05, we were seated. The food...so-so. Certainly not scrumptuous enough to make up for the wait. To their credit, the restaurant didn't charge us for our drinks, either...so between the free tapas and drinks, they tried to make up for the wait, but all in all, I wouldn't return.
