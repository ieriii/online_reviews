Loved the atmosphere. Loved my wine. Had a great dining partner and a great waiter. Everything else was just okay for me. Did the Tapas style menu that they have on Tuesday and nothing was amaze-balls. I thought the gnocchi tasted frozen, which was a bit of a let down. There was some sort of avocado-ish bruschette which was good. It was like a Mexican and Italian lover got together and had produced some edible offspring on a piece of crusty bread. Also good was some sort of honey-glazed ribs. Weird that the two really great things were not part of a traditional Italian cuisine. The pumpkin ravioli was interesting and tasty, but not on the tapas menu. I'd say splurge on entrees, as the quality is better. Agh, I expected the tiramisu to be better, but don't think I didn't eat it. But if I'm going to commit carbocide, I prefer it to be totally worth it, the way Volare is. End scene.
