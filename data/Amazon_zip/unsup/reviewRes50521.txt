Always a good choice. Been here many times, and I have never had a bad experience. My last visit, I had the peppercorn steak, so good! My girl had shrimp and cheesy grits. I think it must be their specialty, it is consistently perfect. I really have no knocks about Wishbone. If you can't stand kids (meanie!) you might want to be aware this place is a stroller magnet, but they handle it so well you wouldn't be bothered. Go. Nuff said.
