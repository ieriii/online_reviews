Eventually, one stops being able to order mixed drinks that are as boring as rail liquor and random soda/shitty fake ass juice. That's where places like the Violet Hour come in to save the day. These are some top notch cocktails. The place can be a bit difficult to get into, and the lighting could be better, but the service and drinks are excellent.
