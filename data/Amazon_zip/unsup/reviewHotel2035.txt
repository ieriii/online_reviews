We did our hotel room block here at the Holiday Inn Mart Plaza. Considering your not in the room a whole lot, they offered the best rate around! Rooms were great, everyone received a room with a view of the river which are great views! Room sizes were larger than the typical room too. We were given a corner room, very nice! Beds are comfortable, with your choice of pillow (soft or firm). There is an indoor pool too, which our nephews enjoyed. I walked in there once and it was nice, not overwhelming hot or chlorine smelling as most indoor pools tend to be. Large open lobby great for meeting up and taking wedding photo's. Lobby bar is nice too, which they had later hours. Pizza is good in there as well. Overall I would recommend the hotel for others, it's away from the mag mile and all the regular touristy area's however it's perfect for wedding room blocks for reasonable price!
