Went to this place last night for a friend's birthday. The atmosphere was somewhat over-the-top. I kept saying "I didn't know places like this existed outside of los angeles." I didn't mean it in a good way - The thing is, it's got that glossed-over faux pretentious feel to it, and you get the feeling that most of the patrons are just trying to be seen or something. So that kind of rubbed me the wrong way. However, the food itself was quite good - I liked the homemade tortilla chips and the guac, although outrageously expensive, was good (nothing I couldn't have made myself, which is why $13 for a large bowl is a bit annoying). I split the Ahi Tuna dish, which had mushrooms, potatoes, and pomegranate seeds in it. Delicious- and glad I split, considering the price and the amount of chips and guacamole i ate. plus i ate at el charro earlier anyway. To drink, I had the red sangria. Very refreshing - it was also one of the cheapest cocktails on the menu so of course I ordered it...but I really liked it. I'd recommend it for sure. Overall, the atmosphere was a bit over the top and fake, the drinks and food were too expensive, BUT...the food was great and the service was quite friendly. We were sat upstairs kind of away from the rest of the crowd so that was good. one bad thing that happened is that we were there for a friend's birthday and they brought out the requisite birthday cake thing, then charged us for it! it's not like we asked for the thing, the waiter said "are we celebrating anything special today?" he totes tricked us. It's in a strange area, it seems, so you kind of have to drive/cab it, as far as I can tell (seriously who takes the green line).
