I went to Nana's for brunch on Friday mid-morning and had an excellent experience! I requested a table outside for a party of 5 and Nana herself was very accomodating. The servers were attentive and the food was delicious. I would definitely go back soon for the Nanadict. All the juices were freshly squeezed. Note to Nana: We need mimosa's on the morning menu please. ;)
