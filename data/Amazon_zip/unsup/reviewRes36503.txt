This restaurant is amazing. Simple awesome food. We came here Saturday morning around 1030, and only had to wait a minute for a table of 4. I will preface that the hostess was a tad snippy with us, not willing to seat us until all 4 were present, when the 4th was just parking the car. There could have been a bit more friendliness...but oh well, we overlooked that once we got our food. I was craving waffles, but one look at the specials menu, and I had to go with the creme brulee french toast. The fiance and I split that and the strawberry waffles. Also present at the table were the pecan waffles, a breakfast sandwich, and a strawberry-banana smoothie. I am literally still thinking about that french toast. It was insane. One piece of it was all I could handle, but I will, without a doubt, be back for it. The waffles were very good too...not as amazing as the french toast, but what could be?? My friend said her breakfast sandwich was delicious, and to quote her, the potatoes were some of the best breakfast potatoes she's ever had. I had a sip of my friend's smoothie and a small twinge of envy came over me that I wasn't having one as well. Glad I didn't, when I was rolling out of the restaurant. The place is small and simple, and I'd imagine it gets very crowded typically. Prices are pretty average. Don't forget to bring your glasses thought...the menu is enormous.  Two very enthusiastic thumbs up.
