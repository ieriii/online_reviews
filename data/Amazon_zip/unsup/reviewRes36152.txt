Now, I don't know what the BBQ is like in Hong Kong, but if it's at all in the same vein as Sun Wah, then those people are some seriously lucky eaters. This place is really special. The duck and pork here is like nothing I've had anywhere else. It is browned and crisped to perfection. I usually get some rice on the side and they have a nice selection of different sauces for dipping. Try the spicy soy if you like hot food. Don't expeect a lot from the decor, because this place is clearly all about the perfection of the BBQ meats and not about the ambience. But if you're ready for food that you will be thinking about for days then head on over to Sun Wah.
