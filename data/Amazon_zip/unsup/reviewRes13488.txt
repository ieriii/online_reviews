I had been to this place years ago and hadn't gone back since it's not near my neighborhood (out of sight, out of mind) but then I saw it on one of my favorite Food Network shows: Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives. After that I was sold on making a repeat visit. I went there on a Monday night and it was packed. I wasn't aware you could make reservations (rookie mistake) and we had to wait about 45 minutes for a table (although we were told 20 minutes). It's a small space and they are trying to serve as many people as possible, so it's pretty cramped. I went with a couple people and we each got something different, and all of it was delicious. I got the catfish with shrimp/cornbread stuffing (which I could have eaten as a meal all alone), hollandaise, and asparagus. The two people I came with got the crab legs (dear god, SO good) and apple jack encrusted tilapia (which was sweet and savory). The guys that work here are really nice and laid back, but not super attentive. We had to ask for things like refills and they didn't come back to check on us until 30 minutes after our food was served. I will certainly be going back here when I'm craving fresh fish or crab legs. I'd like to pretend like I'd give the rest of their diner food menu a shot, but with 15+ choices of fresh fish to tempt me...I doubt I will.
