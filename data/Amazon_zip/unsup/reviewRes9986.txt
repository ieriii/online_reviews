Pizza? Craft Beer? Hipsters? Check, check, aaaaaaaaaaaaand check.  Piece has been on my radar for quite some time now. Mostly because of the three things listed above. You really can't go wrong when this particular trifecta is aligned (or if you replace the pizza with sushi, burgers, or wings, and the hipsters with bikers, punks, or hippies), but I digress... I came here for the pizza and the beer, mostly. Both were DELICIOUS. I didn't eat any of the hipsters, but they also looked pretty good. I ordered a flight of all 7 draft beers, each at $1 for a 3 oz. pour. Here's my snobby breakdown of those: Golden Arm: Typical light beer taste with the label of a traditional Kolsch Bier. A Lil' Strange: Wheaty Belgian style ale with lots of banana notes and bites of clove. Dark-N-Curvy Dunkelweizen: FRUITY FRUITY Wheat beer. That's all I got there. Worryin' Ale: Rye Beer that tastes very much like a red ale. Malty, carmelly, and sweet(ish). Wingnut: Imperial/Double IPA and tastes exactly as it's labeled. Good malty backbone, lots of pine and citrus aroma and bite, bitter finish. The end. Cap'n Kickass: Maltier than the Wingnut, almost *too* malty, with a biscuity and citrusy aftertaste. Roland the Headless Assistant Brewer: Nice dry stout with a bourbony bite to the finish. On to the pizza: It's hard to order here because I am the most indecisive person alive and there are so many choices. Build Your Own Pizza is too much pressure for me but I think I did a decent job. I got the White Pizza with bacon, fresh basil, and goat cheese and then added a ton of pepper and cheese. I ate the whole damn thing too. OINK.
