Our server was Ben. He was FANTASTIC. Very knowledgeable with the menu & all the different items we were interested in. We started with an appetizer & then ordered four maki rolls, the golden child, caterpillar, dragon, & rainbow roll. All were VERY delicious & FRESH. I would consider this one of my favorite sushi places to go. I haven't tried the other items on the menu, but I absolutely LOVE their sushi. The service was wonderful & I left feeling very satisfied.
