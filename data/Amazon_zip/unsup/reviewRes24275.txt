Give credit where credit is due. I tried to hate Mercat a la Planxa, it is downtown in a very touristy part of town and they are so very used to their patrons being pure tourists, but even Chicagoans can find great eats and solace in a meal at Mercat a la Planxa. Coming from work downtown, I conveniently hopped on the Red Line and walked a few blocks over to Mercat (located in the Blackstone Hotel). I ordered a Spanish beer while waiting for friends and it was not overly crowded in the bar area, and plenty of people were seated in the dining area enjoying their eats. We were sat at our table which had enough room for me to put my backpack down (since I am always hauling my camera along). The server had some charm and seemed to like his work and gave us plenty of time to order and brought our drinks quickly.  Looking at the menu I was a little bit overwhelmed since any time I go to tapas I end up wanting to order everything. We all compromised and went for the Chef's tasting menu for $65 which was a four course meal with 12 dishes with portions for everyone to get a good piece. $5 Goose Island Matildas to boot and we were ready to go. What came next was a deluge of delightful plates showing off mastery of tapas and the tastes and textures were worth the money we spent. I really thought dinner was over after all of the plates, but then they brought out prawn and lamb and I was ready for my nap. Service: A Food: A Atmosphere: A Overall Rating: Daaaaaaaaaaaayum!!! :)
