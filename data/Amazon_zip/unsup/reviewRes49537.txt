I went to Bin 36 for dinner a few nights ago and here were somethings that I noticed -the staff all seem to have this awesome strut, it isn't snobby or snooty, but it could be the reason why service was so slow. -the cheese flights are a bit over rated -pretty much all the main courses on the menu were awesome, everyone in the party was very pleased with the food. -wine suggestions next to all the entres is cool, but if you aren't in the mood for wine, the server was good at suggesting a beer to complement the meal The punchline: Not a bad place to bring a date and get a lil tipsy on wine tasting, just don't go there if you are on any kind of a schedule.
