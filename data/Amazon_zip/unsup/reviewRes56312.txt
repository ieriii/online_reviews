After suffering through a chilly midwinter run, the Significant Other and I wanted massive amounts of moderately healthful food, and we wanted it NOW. Simply It was nearby and well-reviewed, so we decided to hobble on over and check things out. Our ravenous, aching asses rejoiced when appetizers arrived soon after they were ordered. The avocado wontons--fresh avocado and cream cheese in a crispy wrapper--were more refreshing than any fried appetizer has a right to be. A banana leaf-wrapped sticky rice cake was a little bland, but the accompanying soy-based dipping sauce solved that minor problem.I fretted that a mere bowl of soup wouldn't be enough to calm my angry stomach. Thankfully, my cauldron of beef Pho, with its flavorful broth, tons of rice noodles, and big side plate-o-fixins (fresh cilantro and basil leaves, hot peppers, plum sauce, etc.), managed to both warm and fill me up. Significant Other's catfish in a clay pot was spicily sauced, perfectly cooked, and not fishy-tasting at all. We cleared our plates and felt pleasantly full. Traumatic recent memories of trying to will my uncooperative legs to move and panting, Slow...down, at Significant Other disappeared in a puff of Pho-scented steam. A corkage fee-free BYOB policy brought a smile to my wind-burned face (a six-pack of New Holland Brewery's winter ale didn't hurt either), and the orange slices and puffed rice cakes that rounded out our meal were nice, too. I'll be running (OK, probably briskly walking) back to sample more of the menu and take advantage of their lunch specials.
