The best deep dish pizza in Chicago! I have had many debates with my fellow Chicagoans about where the best pizza is and I always say Art of Pizza! It is so cheesy and not overwhelming with sauce like other places.  I will say that there have been times when the delivery was slow and the pizza came not so hot anymore. It was not the best experience, but all the other times have really made up for that! Everyone in the city needs to try Art of Pizza at least once!
