I love Xoco! Although I definitely feel some tortas are better than others. I had the milanese the other day, and it was okay, I ordered it because I hadn't tried any of the grilled tortas and wanted to see the difference. I don't think I would get it again! The guy next to me was eating the pork belly (my favorite) and I almost asked if we could trade but then realized I would seem like a weirdo. I just tried the Shrimp and Bacalao torta. I didn't really know what to expect because I never had bacalao before but it is lenten Friday so I decided to go with it instead of the safe mushroom goat cheese. It was good, a little salty ( I asked for no olives so would have been even saltier).The bacalao was very mild, it basically tasted like a denser piece of cod, and the shrimp were big! It tasted like a hearty Portuguese seafood stew on bread, how could that be a bad thing.
