If there's a better Korean restaurant in Chicago, please let me know. I love their food, but gosh, their service is terrible. Check you bill carefully because they can overcharge you purposely: add items here and there, add tip without letting you know even when you're in a small group, etc. I love the floor seated tables, which is why I give SSGB a better rating than Kang Nam. Disappointingly, the Dol Sot Bi Bim Bop is ok. It's not really garnished with the bellflower root, mushroom, and fern stems that I expect with the typical Bi Bim Bop. Their Soon-dooboo, an uncurded spicy tofu soup, did not have uncurded tofu and tasted just like the free spicy miso soup that comes with your grilled meats. It's not that I don't like the Korean miso soup, but Soondoboo has a waaaay better taste. I'm a soondoboo fanatic, so I was extremely disappointed. Shame on them for messing up a basic dish!
