After 1,000+ reviews, I fear my review will fail to add any real value. However, I am compelled, yes COMPELLED, to offer my two cents. Three friends and I recently decided to grab dinner on a Friday, and one recommended this place. I was the one that called them up to make a reservation. Unfortunately, the server had no record of our reservation when we got there (damn you Smart phone, you provided me the wrong phone number). No problem, there was a nice corner for us to hang out and enjoy a few drinks of The Green Line. Props for supporting a local brewery. Now, the pizza... I simply cannot describe, in words, how much I enjoyed it. My expectations were rather low since I am not a fan of traditional deep-dish pizza. One bite in and my expectations were surpassed. Three slices later and I became the latest Pequod super-fan. I now find that it is my duty to introduce everyone I know to Pequod's Pizzeria.
