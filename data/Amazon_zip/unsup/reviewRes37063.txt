Yes, this place is expensive. Like really expensive. You just need to go in knowing that. They have amazing produce, a great deli counter, and a kick-ass cheese selection. Also, their bakery is the bomb and the candy selection is an even bigger bomb. Most of the employees are nice enough, but there are a few real crabs in the bunch.
