Went there for brunch on a Saturday. It was around 1pm so we got seated right away. There's a lot on the menu and everything looks good. The coffee came with 3 beignets. They were a little cold and chewy but still tasty. We ordered Eggs New Orleans. The eggs were perfectly poached. The crab cakes under the eggs were delicious. The popover was a little stale if I have to be picky. We also ordered the buckwheat banana almond pancakes. They were perfect fluffy with crunchy almond slices and caramel all over. It's a little more expensive than other brunch places, but they give you a lot of food. Can't wait to go back.
