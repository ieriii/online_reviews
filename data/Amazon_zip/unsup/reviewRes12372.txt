Two friends recommended this place to a friend of mine and she took me and a friend visiting from out of town. They won't seat you until your entire party is there, so we waited at the bar, the bar wasn't so incredibly big but the bartender was nice, didn't charge my friend for her club soda.  Once we were seated, I observed the candlelight and the exposed brick and the large painting and realized that the decor felt cozy. Nothing spectacular or sleek but definitely great date spot. Now that I think about it, we didn't get any bread. Nor did we get any water until much later. But it didn't bother us because we were busy catching up. However, I can see that being annoying if you're hungry. We had the special appetizer, crab cakes: good, fresh tasting Honey Jalapeno Pork: AMAZING sauce and delicious mashed sweet potatoes Cuban Roast Pork: lacked seasoning but falling off the bone and delicious, love the rice, not a personal fan of yuca but it comes with those. Salmon: good, couscous was delicious. We had a trio of sorbet/gelato but it's tiny, tiny portion and nothing special. I will try something else next time. TIP: the restaurant takes up multiple storefronts so to find the entrance, go to the corner of Irving Park Rd. and Ravenswood.
