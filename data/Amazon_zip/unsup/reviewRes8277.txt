It pains me a little to give this place only 3 stars. I wanted to love it. A friend in the neighborhood raved about the pizza here and told me I HAD to go. I read all these glowing reviews on Yelp. Citysearch ranked it one of the top 10 pizza places in the city. But I've gone twice now and both times I left feeling a bit underwhelmed. I like the pizza, I just don't think it's great. I also think the service here tends to make you feel a little rushed. This is a popular spot - it's always busy to the point of being full. But I don't like feeling like the second I've taken the last bite of food, I should pay the check and jet. I like to let the meal sit and finish my glass of wine slowly, not be rushed out cuz there's people waiting. I mean, I did just spend a bunch of money here didn't I? At some point in the future I will give this place another shot. Probably when it gets nice out again next spring and I can sit on the lovely sidewalk patio they have. Because I really do want to love it, I really do.
