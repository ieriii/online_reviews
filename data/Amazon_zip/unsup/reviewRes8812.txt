Get the Lamb Shank and Sirloin combo. It's ridiculous-good. They bring out the lamb shank in this bowl, and it's sitting in a pool of it's own delicious meat juice. The meat falls right off the bone. I mixed up some of the juice with the dill rice, tomato and a little piece of the sirloin. Taste bud explosion!  Also had the Pomegranate Mushrooms for an appetizer. Definitely a unique taste. I've never had mushrooms like that before, but they were quite scrumptious! Service was pretty decent despite the fact that my family and i went there on Wednesday night around 8 and it was packed! Love that they give you free feta and radishes to start (as well as raw onion, but I can't handle that)
