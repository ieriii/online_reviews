This is my all-time favorite restaurant in Greek town. The food is fresh, prices are reasonable, staff are friendly (albeit a bit slow) and it is probably the only cafe I can think of in Chicago that gives me with real, pressed white napkins and silverware (not like the crappy stuff you get at Denny's). This place reminds me of Europe! Everything I've had here is amazing - try their sandwiches with come with a side of the most amazing potato or pasta salad. Their salad is amazing and they also have this stuffed buttery pastry stuffed with cheese/ham/spinach/whatever else is their specialty called atropita (sp?) is crisp, warm and absolutely perfect. Beside the sometimes-slow service, my only thing I would advise is to steer clear of the salmon pizza - it was served with feta cheese, capers and smoked salmon, so I almost was salted to death. This restaurant also has an array of fresh pastries and cakes (everything from baklava to traditional fruit tarts and carrot cakes). They also have other traditional greek desserts; one of my favorite being their greek yoghurt, which comes with a side of honey and walnuts. Yum~ although i know not everyone may like it - if you mix all three together, it gives this amazing experience to your mouth because it's sour, sweet, smooth and crunchy all at once. :D A must-go..and especially wonderful place to have a fantastic cup of coffee and long chat with friends!
