This review is for breakfast only, I'll look forward to a hopeful 4-5 star fish-dinner experience in the future for sure, the fish menu looked great! I'll never go back for breakfast with so many other good options in the area.  Corned beef hash from a can, cold potatoes and over-easy eggs cooked wayyy over-hard. Kitchen was verrrrrrrrrrrry slow to get our food out. It was a beautiful sunny day so we sat outside. The manager was very rude to us when my friend took down the umbrella, which... seemed to be designed to easily be taken down. A simple, "Sorry, we have to keep those up," would have done, not patronizing "Put that back up!" We are the patrons, no need to act like an a-hole, sorry to bother you! My umbrella-lowering-friend lovingly referred to this gentleman as "________ with the ugly shiny shirt" for the rest of the meal. You can fill in whatever pejorative you'd like there, I believe he used them all and I can't say it was unwarranted. Otherwise the server was fine, and told us (at 9am) unfortunately Glenn's Diner couldn't serve alcohol on a Sunday until 11am due to their liquor license. Ok, bummer but no problem. Server comes back at the end of the meal just before 10am when we're about to leave and says, "The owner decided that we are now allowed to serve liquor, do you want your drinks now?"  The owner decides the liquor law? Please be more clear one way or the other Glenn's, thanks. So in conclusion, poor food, ok service but unclear on the liquor law, rude management and slooooow kitchen. I strongly recommend skipping their breakfast!
