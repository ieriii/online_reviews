oh my goodness, xoco. yes, the wait was 55minutes, and we were waiting outside of the door. BUT, we got to see rick bayless!!!! and he was working in the kitchen :). i got the mushroom torta which was DIVINE... mushrooms tasted meaty and juicy! we also got the cold chocolate, which was probably my favorite. real cocoa beans... and reminiscent of holidays but for the summer = WIN. also had their fresh, piping hot, soft churros... mmmm! lastly (yes i know), got the coconut pudding... which was delicious. sadly i was too full and already overwhelmed with sweets. AWESOME MEAL!
