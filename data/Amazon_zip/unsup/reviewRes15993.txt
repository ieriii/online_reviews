The worst restaurant experience ever. I'm vegan and they gave meal with pork...twice...they changed my dish again and again...the waitress was horrible, I told her about it several times... She even brought another bottle of wine we have ordered...Later there was a mess with credit cards...this place sucks!! The food is not cooked well, the quality is really bad, looks like they buy it in local Wal-Mart. Even thought we made a reservation, we were waiting for 30 minutes near the door. People who work in Calo care about money, but not about customers...horrible place. I wish I could give no stars at all, very disappointed.
