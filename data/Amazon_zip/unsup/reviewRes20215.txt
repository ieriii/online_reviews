An interesting take on a fast-food sandwich shop / mexican street food. Serves tortas with different meats each accompanied with a different salsa. Caldos too (which I didn't try, they're only after 3pm). I'm not a great fan of the toasted, crusty hard bread which crunches in your mouth. Sometimes I feel like my teeth are going to shatter. I prefer the soft breads typical of tortas in Mexico.  The flavors are definitely there with many different choices, will definitely come back. It's a great place to stop by if you're in the neighborhood! Churros are tasty too!
