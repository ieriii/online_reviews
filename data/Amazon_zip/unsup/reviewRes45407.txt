I've been to Wilde on a few occasions and always seem to get in on their fish and chips entree. I went one time for brunch and it was just alright; however, those fish and chips are always a solid choice for dinner. So I went with a couple of my friends for Thanksgiving day dinner. They had a prix fixe menu which ended up being pretty good. It was priced at $30 dollars but covered all the courses minus drinks. They did have a $5 Guinness special that night. I did end up getting myself a turkey dinner and even though it wasn't home cooking ... it was pretty good and without any effort. The restaurant is laid out pretty nice with some comfy areas such as the library towards the back and the fireplace area up front. The lighting is not too bright and the decor is pretty nice with lots of Oscar Wilde artwork. Wilde is a solid 3.5 stars place for me but I'll give them 4 because they were there for me during Thanksgiving and it was a great time too.
