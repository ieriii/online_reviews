How can I not give this 5-stars? After reading a random article in Maxim some years back ranking pizza joints in Chicago (Pequod's was top), decided to make the pilgrimage with a group of guys from college. We were not disappointed and haven't been since. This has become the favorite spot for all out-of-town guests.  I've been coming here for 4 or 5 years now and it seems to always get better. The sausage pan pizza can become quite addicting as I suffered serious withdraws when they closed for several months in 2006. (A small fire, prompted them to remodel the downstairs dining room) Even though I loved the old dive-like interior with the giant mural of Comesky Park, the new digs have grown on me. Oh yeah, the food... The pan pizza with caramelized cheese crust is a tasty twist on the Chicago style. A hearty layer of dough is topped with mounds of mozzarella and finished with a layer of their one-of-a-kind sauce. Order one of these bad boys with their spicy Italian sausage and you my friend will be in heaven.  Note: They do deliver to a majority of the north side, but it doesn't compare to fresh out of the oven.
