I had heard about this place from my roommate and for 6 months had wanted to go. I finally made it out and it didn't amaze me like I thought it would. The food was good, no doubt about that, but it was also overpriced. I've had some good Mexican food at half the price, maybe not the awesome setting, but nonetheless this is not incredible Mexican food. Then again, it's in downtown Chicago so I don't know what I was expecting. I would recommend El Nuevo Leon (just not dessert) for Latin American cuisine,
