This place has all you can eat King Crab... Nuff said. LOL!  My boyfriend, knowing that I LOVE LOVE LOVE King Crab, took me here for the first time about 2 years ago after I graduated from my Paralegal program. From the outside, it doesn't seem like much and in all honesty, I was a bit worried about the quality of food judging from the appearance of the place from the outside. Well never judge a book by its cover because the crab here was AWESOME! Sweet, fresh, and succulent! As good as any that I've had at Shaws, Tavern, or any of the high end seafood joints. I don't know how they make money on this since I probably ate at least 1/2 of their crab supply that night. ;)  We have been back several times since and we love this place. It should be noted thought that I haven't had anything else but crab when I'm here but if that is what you are going for, be prepared to have a party in your belly! Yuummmmm sooooo good!  Now, the only reason why I gave it 4 stars out of 5 was because every time that I've ever come here (even though we make reservations) I have had to wait at a minimum 15 mins. I don't get that since we made reservations... I mean, isn't that the point of a reservation? To have a table when you get there? I probably wouldn't even be that annoyed with this except for the fact that it is VERY tight in there so it is not comfortable to wait when you have the back of someones chair basically right up against you... OK... maybe I'm being a little dramatic about that part... but it is VERY tight in there. In the summer, to wait outside is not bad but the winters... there is no where to go until you want to battle the brutal cold and/or snow.  Other than that, the food is wonderful and worth the wait and the wait staff is great as well. We have never had anything but great service there. If you want to eat your face off in crab... this is the place for you! =)
