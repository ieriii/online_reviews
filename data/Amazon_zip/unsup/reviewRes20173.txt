I've heard great things about Frontera Grill, and decided to check out Rick Bayless' other restaurant, so here i was. I had the chicken tinga with a cafe con leche and infamous churro, while my friend tried the milanesa torta with a mexican chocolate. We really enjoyed our sandwiches, and it filled us up just right, but didn't leave us feeling totally gross and in a food coma. The coffee was delicious. My friend's thick mexican chocolate was really good as well, but I don't think I would be able to drink a whole cups worth, but it's definitely worth trying if you're here. Order one to share. And it went perfectly with the churro, which was perfect! light, fluffly, and had just the right amount of cinnamon and sugar! would definitely come back here if i'm in chi-town!
