I was bowled over by the beer list! Yeah! Everything else was mediocre, run of the mill. We started with an appetizer of cheese curds. Bland, bland, and more bland. Nothing had any flavor. Not the cheese, not the greasy fried breading and not the ranch dipping sauce. The food selection is limited. Sandwiches, some burgers and a few salads. I got the southwest cobb salad. It was ok but rather small for an entree, more like an appetizer or a side. The burgers that my friends got were not that large for the $7 - 9 range. The fries were very greasy and also on the tasteless side. The food needs to step up to the incredible fantastic taste treat of the beer list and show pairings that would be suitable. "Apple" isn't too far from my house but with all the competition around I wouldn't come here for dinner, maybe a drink at the bar after eating somewhere else or on the way to another restaurant.
