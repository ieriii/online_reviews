I take my friends to this restaurant to celebrate their birthdays. The inside dcor is a rustic orange that has a romantic yet manly appeal. The servers do their best to sit a party of two in the circular atrium that overlooks Michigan Avenue. Tuesday is the best night to eat at this restaurant if you want to avoid the half-hour waiting lists on Friday and Saturday. If you're a fish eater, I recommend the 'Mahi-Mahi Barbacoa' or the 'Halibut Mediterranean.' You can request a different carbohydrate or a double serving of vegetables than what is offered with an entree. And please, try the 'Molten Chocolate Cake' with a melted chocolate center (baked to order). It is DIVINE, but you must be a chocolate lover to truly appreciate it.
