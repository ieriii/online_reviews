I need to clarify my rating system for my visit to Simply It-  It was a wonderful experience and the space and the staff were great- "5 stars" even. I brought my Dinner Club here, which meets once a month and each person chooses something new, maybe out of the ordinary, for the group to try. It was a BYOB in a central location, so an easy choice. A few club members had reservations about "Vietnamese food" and really didn't venture out as much as I would have liked with the ordering. People played if fairly safe, sticking with spring rolls and wontons mostly. I ordered a couple Saigonese Crepes for the table to share, which are basically lettuce wraps. This was probably the most adventurous choice. All of the rolls and sauces people got were very good. Fresh ingredients, and beautifully presented. It was all very light. Thats why I was looking forward to something a little more substantial for an entree, and at the recommendation of my server, got the beef shortribs. These things LOOKED sooo good and the sauce that was on them rocked. However, upon putting a large piece of meat in my mouth, I knew I was in trouble. I chewed and chewed and chewed. And chewed. This rib was NOT coming apart. It was impossible to eat. Again, the flavor was delicious and I was hungry and so ready to enjoy this dish. But alas, we were all disappointed because I think everyone got this same thing. We all tried. And we all failed. Food was left on plates and bellies left half full. Our bill, including tip for 8 people, was $16 each. Really??  Yep- and we did order a lot of apps. I will definitely give Simply It another try and venture out a little more. The menu is large and there are at least 20 other items I'd like to give a try. Not the shortribs though. Sad sad sad.
