Steak tacos. Steak tacos. STEAK TACOS. Get them with cilantro and onions, and maybe cheese, but that's it. Then be sure to ask for extra of the negro salsa, or black salsa; it's the best out there, and douse away.  You can also buy larger portions to take home. I keep getting steak tacos at other places, the only other place that even comes close (pretty close) is Perez on Randolph street. Pasadita's steak is tender, juicy, and perfectly charred and seasoned. Although there have been a couple of times where I've gone in when it's slow, and the steak was chewy, I think from sitting on the griddle too long. But this doesn't happen that often. Don't bother with chicken, or any other filling. The steak tortas are also divine! I've watched the taco prices creep up here over the years (from a buck fifty to over two bucks), so they're not the cheapest taco joint in the city, but it's worth it.
