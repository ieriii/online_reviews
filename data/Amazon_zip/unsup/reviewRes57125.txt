So, being from Texas, I was weary of eating Latin American food up north. However, my worries were for nothing. Carnivale was ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. While a bit on the pricey side, the food you will eat will make it worth it AND more!The guacamole is amazing! Get some to start off with.Both my boyfriend and I had the pollo estillo billy. DELICIOUS.Absolutely fantastic!
