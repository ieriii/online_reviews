I went to school with a girl named Jill Crisp and I miss her. So when I heard of this place it made me wanna go -- what? Huh? And even though Jill Crisp was nowhere to be found in CRISP, I still liked it a lot. I had the the Big Buddah Bowl. And they ain't kidding when they say BIG.... tons of food. Plus, an egg on top. My friend got the fried chicken and it smelled like heaven. A lil cramped in there - so try takeout. Or go when it is not super-busy. I recommend this joint. And if you see Jill Crisp there, tell her I say HI.
