I have been dropping major hints to my BF (ok maybe directly telling him that I want him to take me there isn't as sublt as a hint) and he took me here as a suprise for our one year anniversary celebration. He wouldn't tell me where we were going and we were walking around somewhere in the Wicker Park area, when I noticed this really cool mural and while we were walking past it and all of a sudden my BF swung me around and opened the door where the mural was! And this was my introduction to the Violet Hour.  We got there right around 6pm on Saturday night and even though they open right at 6pm, the place was already half full! I love the high back chairs and the super intimate seating. Violet hours definitely gives off those old school speakeasy vibes, all the lights are turned down lows, romantic candle lights at your table, fireplace toward the back....Men - if you want to impress your ladies, take them for a drink here...and bring your wallets! Drinks here are not cheap, however given the fact that these are more like downtown prices, one feels as though the price tag is worth the drink after seeing how much effort goes into one drink. These just are your normal cosmos and martinis here folks!  We ordered the cheese plate and we each had two drinks. My BF had the manly drinks - both from the whiskey section and both tasted like they could put hair on your chest! I tried a drink from the potable bitters section and then a Johnny Roosevelt from the champagne section. Even my BF thought the Johnny Roosevelt drink was good, which is a great compliment since he doesn't really like champagne and really only drinks whiskey drinks. I was very impressed by Violet Hour!
