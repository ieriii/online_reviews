A nice bar and restaurant which is a welcome break from the crap that dominates River North and the Gold coast. The bar was packed and the wait was approximately 45 minutes which wasn't too bad for a Saturday night we thought. While we waited there was a nice patio area that looks like a converted garage but a nice place to hang out on a nice September evening. Great beer and wine selection and all the drinks and food seemed to be priced fairly. We looked at their menu online and when we were seated a lot of the dishes we were looking at on the website had been taken off the menu. Not a big deal as it happens in a lot of restaurants however I think more attention could be spent on updating their website. I was expecting great things from the food however I felt it was only average and I wouldn't rush back there for the food. We had the Meatballs with Polenta and Parsley Pesto which was very good and a solid start to the meal. The Agnolloti was good, small portion (our server told us that all their portions are on the smaller side so we knew what to expect) but it didn't really stand out. Maybe I was just hoping to the English Pea Agnolloti that was on their website as opposed to the Mushroom one that was on the menu. The mushroom salad with Duck egg was good and a nice twist on a salad. It was our favorite dish of the evening. We had the Corn Risotto and the Piglet Risotto which were both ok but lacking in Salt. The Corn Risotto would have been better it there were more Corn Kernels in it and the Piglet was a heavy dish which dominated the Risotto. The Heirloom salad that was on top of the Piglet was excellent. Service was good throughout and there was a nice atmosphere in the restaurant. I would go back if I was in the area but I wouldn't travel out of my way for Longman & Eagle.
