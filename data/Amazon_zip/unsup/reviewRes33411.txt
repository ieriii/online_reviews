I think this place really deserves 3.5 stars. We arrived about 9:45 on Memorial day and our wait was only ten minutes tops. We order a cinnamon roll and it was not all that good. How can you mess up a cinnamon roll? I ordered the Popeye's frittata and it rocked. It was huge and awesome and cheesy and good. My friend got some spicy egg dish...spice and I are enemies so I cannot tell you how it tasted. Our food did come with a nice selection of fresh fruit and the coffee was ever flowing. However, the parking is another story....to read the story, check out Purav B.'s review but I will say this: take the bus!
