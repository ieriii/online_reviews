I am one to try a restaurant over and over to give it a chance and I have to say it's been a roller coaster ride for Indie Caf. I do love their food but the service has much to be desired. I have never walked away unsatisfied with the food. They have a wonder full selection of food and my favorite is the sushi and there daily rolls. I have been going to the restaurant for Lunch and Dinner and even take out for quite some time for maybe five years or so and the food never disappoints. But I must admit the service is spotty when the restaurant is full the service is lacking but if you manage to go right before the dinner rush it's spot on. Take out & Delivery is spot on everything comes hot and with in 30 to 45 min of the time of order. I have lived in the Edgewater/Rogers Park area for many years and this place is one of my all time beloved eating spots. I do a delivery every month for my get togethers and all my guest love the food. So for a spot on food experience Indie rocks but for a dinner experience go early or after the dinner rush. The service is fair but is way more attentive when it's a bit slower during the week.
