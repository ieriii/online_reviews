Do you like fried chicken? Of course you do because you are a normal human being with functioning taste buds. So you can stop reading. Ok not convinced? Well the wings here are super yummy and they give you the big full wing so like 3-4 will fill up any human being for the most part. The crisp BBQ sauce is super delicious not too spicy just the right balance of savory and sweet. They also have a good selection of sides and bowls, etc. but if you are ordering them as a side you best have someone to split it with or you are going to need a to go bag. They've also got some authentic Korean beverages that are fun to try. It only takes 5-10 minutes for them to fry up the food so it is a quick delicious place to get some to go chicken.
