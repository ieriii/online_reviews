I'd heard good things about this place, but I'm not a fan. I didn't really see the need to pay Brazilian steakhouse prices to feel like I was sitting in a ski lodge. A pretty ski lodge, but really. The food was ok, and I might have given them that third star if not for the little troll that served us. He had quite the little attitude on him. All of that wood and what basically amounts to a fancy fire pit may appeal to some, but if I want that I'll go to Colorado.
