Out of the 3 brazillian steakhouses in the area (Fogo, Sal, and Brazzaz) I have to say this one is the best. Salad bar and bread are amazing and the meats are not too salty and has great flavor. Shrimps (only available during dinner) are yummy and I love the grilled pineapple to cleanse the pallet. And it's a total bargain if you go during lunch for half price since they have almost everything during lunch that they have for dinner. Definitely a must try place!
