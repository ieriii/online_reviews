An upscale, trendy, candlelit type of romantic with beautiful interior kinda restaurant. This is the perfect place to catch up with your girlfriends or for a romantic date with your significant other. =) I had dinner and drinks with a couple of my girlfriends on a friday night. Even though service was super sloooowwww... we enjoyed our time at Gilt Bar. since we were planning on going out after our late dinner, we decided to go family style. first, we started with the roasted bone marrow with onion jam on toast. -the bone marrow alone tasted a little funky but when you add the onion jam on the toast and top it off with bone marrow, all the different flavors come together and tastes so yummy! then came the rest: pan roasted scottish salmon -i'm always a bit hesitant when ordering salmon bc it always comes out dry. not at gilt bar. the salmon was just enough juicy and tender all through out! sauteed green beans with roasted tomatoes and parmesan- WOW! prob the best green beans i've ever had. you must order this side dish when dining at gilt bar. side of fries- super crispy and full of flavor! orecchiette with spicy pork sausage & herb- fantabulous! i think at this point, if you have not been to gilt bar, you should give it a go because words cannot describe how tasty everything was! you can find street parking or pay for valet. our dinner was pretty cheap because we all shared everything and we left pretty full but not the disgusting type of full. :)
