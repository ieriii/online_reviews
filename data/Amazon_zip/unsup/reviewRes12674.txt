We came here as a group of 5 on a whim. The place we were supposed to eat had a very long wait and we were starving, so we saw this place and figured, why not? Amazing choice. We were seated and told to help ourselves at the appetizer buffet. This buffet alone could serve as your meal, it's that amazing. It has salads, soups, breads, fish, cheese, etc... love it. I naively thought this was the meal, so I loaded up on the quinoa salad and seared tuna. Then the server comes back and asks if we'd like to try the meat. YES, I for sure would! They had some of the best cuts of meat I've ever eaten. Endless food for $40? That's a deal! My boyfriend and another guy at our table must've went through 5 plates each. We all had an amazing time, the food only added to the great night. It was so good, we decided to go back to this place for our anniversary. The decor is ritzy, but nobody makes you feel out of place (like they did at Fleming's). The bathrooms are upstairs, which is bad/good. It's bad because sometimes you REALLY don't want to climb stairs after stuffing your gut full of steak, but it's good because you should be getting that exercise after that meal.
