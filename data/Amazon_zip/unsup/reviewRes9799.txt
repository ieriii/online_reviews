I had a very enjoyable going away dinner here with some girlfriends. Wanted to check it out because of the Top Chef contestant, Dale Levitsky, since my friend loves Top Chef just like I do. You get a 3 course meal for $60 which was really reasonable.. plus 2 intermezzo courses. For the app, got a soft shell crab that was cooked to perfection and came with some veggies on the side. Not impressed with the veggie side but still overall good. Ordered a nice white fish for the entree that was light and pa fried nicely. The dessert was just ok... got the savory corn and it seemed too rich and dense for me. The palate cleanser, granita, was not very good... the flavors weren't quite there... and the cheese plate was actually a mini grilled cheese, made with cheese as the "bread." As much as I love cheese, it was a little much. I ordered a blueberry and thyme cocktail that was quite yummy and also tasted my friend's raspberry one.... delicious! I would definitely go back when the menu changes for another nice night out. It was also nice that Dale came out and took a picture with us when we asked.
