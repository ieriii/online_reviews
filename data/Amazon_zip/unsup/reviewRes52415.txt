I have been here twice, my bf and I love this place the meat is amazing, the potatoes and bread is really awesome. it is a little pricey but its worth the money if you ask me.. the dessert is really good and over 6 dollars but its good. if your looking for a new experience and want to celebrate an important event or occasion this is your place.
