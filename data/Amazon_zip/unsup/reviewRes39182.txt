Loved the January V cocktail, the polite and friendly bartenders and the menu. Food was good, but it would have been great had it not gotten cold between the kitchen and our table. The gougre would have been wonderful if they were hot! The rabbit wrapped in bacon would have been scrumptious had it been hot and instead it was luke warm. And the head cheese hash on rye gnocchi would have also been so much better hot! It was pretty much room temperature once it got to our table. I hope that this was just a one-time mistake as I would otherwise give this place 5 stars. *Really enjoyed the 'white flight' of un-aged, un-blended whiskey:Rye, Oat and Wheat. What an educational treat!
