I work about a block away from this restaurant, so have probably been over two dozen times for business brunches/lunches. It's a relaxed, cozy space with enough variety to please everyone. The food is always well presented and fresh, and I really love all the smoothies and coffee.  People oftentimes complain about the wait and the prices. I don't really see an issue with either. I've never had to wait more than 5 minutes on the weekdays during the peak times, and the prices are higher than an average meal, but you definitely get enough food for leftovers. I would highly recommend any of the salads!
