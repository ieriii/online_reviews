When an offer for Geja's came up on Groupon, I decided that it was finally time to try this Lincoln Park institution after ignoring it for the 7 years that I was a neighbor of Geja's. I took my husband there for his birthday last night and I was extremely pleased with not only the atmosphere but the service, wine list and above all the FOOD. The cozy, romantic interior was wonderful and different than many other Chicago eateries. We ordered the beef, shrimp and lobster dinner and for $49.95 I would say that it was a deal considering the multiple courses included. The cheese fondue was decadent, the meat high-quality and vegetables very fresh. The ending of the dark chocolate fondue with fresh fruit, pound cake and marshmallows was heavenly. I know this isn't the healthiest choice of a restaurant, but you have to be okay with that before you go! I am so happy that we finally tried Geja's and would recommend it to others looking for something a little different.  It's no wonder Geja's has stayed in business for so long.
