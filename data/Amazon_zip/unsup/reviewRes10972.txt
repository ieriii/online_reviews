There's a reason people wait in line to eat brunch here. It's worth it. Everything I've eaten here has been delicious and I love taking guests here. They get excited when the see the creative menu and their eyes get all lit up when they see their food. It never disappoints, and if they do screw something up, in my experience, they make it up to you somehow.  I recommend the White Chocolate & Caramel Covered Pretzel Pancakes, but really, everything is good.
