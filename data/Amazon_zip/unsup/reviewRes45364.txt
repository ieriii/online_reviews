Wilde's is good, not great. Pro: They turn out one of my favorite bloody mary's in the city. Spicy and delicious and with an adorable little side car of Miller Lite. Truly delicious. Pro: This place has a nice atmosphere, especially if you can snag a table by the fireplace during the winter. Pro: Decent beer list. Con: Their food is a little "meh." I've never had a bad meal here, per se, but I've also never had a really delicious meal either. For the quality of the food, I personally think it's a little overpriced. Especially their brunch menu.
