Can't believe I haven't written a review for this place! I've only been here once, but I really enjoyed it. First of all, DO NOT PAY FULL PRICE! I get those "buy one, get one" or just plain "$35.00 meal" coupons in the money mailer ALL THE TIME. So be patient, wait for your money mailer, and save yourself up to $25 a head. Second, I haven't been Fogo or Texas de Brazil, so I'm not going to make any comparisons. I did enjoy Brazzaz, though. The meats are decent (although some cuts were a bit over-salted), the shrimp was good (I went for dinner, there was shrimp. It was one of my fave things!), and the salad bar is pretty extensive. However, I wouldn't say that the salad bar was spectacular--lots of cold salad-mix kind of things. The best part of the meal, by far, was the pineapple. I'm a HUGE carnivore, but I found that I just couldn't get through that many cuts of meat! Also, I didn't honestly want to taste twelve different cuts of steak cooked with exactly the same seasonings. The pineapple, though, was out of this world. I think the sugars carmelized when grilled, so it was the best, most mind-blowing, juicy, sweet pineapple ever (and I've had some really good pineapple). I think I had more servings of pineapple than I did of meat, and I was glad that I didn't pay full price, because I'd feel pretty silly paying $59.99 or whatever the full price dinner is to eat $4.99 worth of pineapple.  However, although I enjoyed my experience, it's not a place I'm likely to revisit. The meat was just overwhelming, a bit over-salted, and all similar-tasting. For the same price, I think I'll hit up a steakhouse and get a really cool (smaller) cut of steak.
