So this was the spot chosen for my big 2-4 birthday this summer. I came with my dad and step-mom prepped for a big meal and quite a few cocktails. Carnivale did not disappoint. First off the space is amazing. Bright colors, flashy walls, a fun bar area and a HUGE open dinning area. LOVED the atmosphere. I would love to come back on a weekend night for a girl's night filled with some live music, dancing and beverages. The food was great. Guacamole is one of my favorite foods and this one was super chunky, just the way I like it. We also order the ceviche trio and while it was tasty, I thought the portions of the ceviche were way to small for everyone to have a taste. Overall I just prefer Nationale 27's ceviches. My rents loved the plantains and although I thought they were yummy, they were a bit too sweet for me to have more than a few bites. As for the entrees, everything was mmm mmm good and everyone was happy with their choice. I ordered the braised short ribs which were shredded up and served over some whipped mashed potatoes. I ate it up in a heart beat. My parents order the Churrasco and the Mama Mendez "fish dish" and both were extra good. Overall a great dinning experience. We had a hard time picking out our meals and I would love to go back. Now for the fun part, the drinks. My dad and I stuck with the red sangria and margaritas which were both actually pretty darn good while my step-mom tried the blueberry mojito and the white sangria. One sip confirmed that I not much of a mojito drinker but the white sangria was light and refreshing. Definitely check it out for a special occasion or just a girl's night out on the town.
