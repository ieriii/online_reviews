So I've been to The Gage twice now. The first time I went with my boyfriend and we sat at the bar. Food: The scotch egg: a little underwhelming but not bad at all. I prefer Paramount Room's. Chicken livers: delicious. Flavorful, and a nice portion size. Potato soup: I'm a pretty big fan of potato soup no matter what, I liked the flavor a lot, could have used more chunks of tater, but that's just my preference. Service was friendly but not overbearing, accurate in recommendations and prompt. My second visit was with a group of four and we sat on the patio and had a delightful, energetic server who stuck around long enough to make a quick joke here and there, followed up on decisions made (I was grateful he convinced me to go with the Saison rather than my usual Sophie - it really hit the spot). All in all, the service is knowledgable, the food is dependably good and comes out with a quickness. I love the style, just sleek enough without being pretentious. A great place to stop in after a day in the Modern Wing.
