I went there on a Friday at 2 pm and it was packed. Waited an hour and twenty minutes.  It was worth every second. You get in there, and one side of the wall is the menu and all the specials, and the other side is pictures of sausage and hot dogs. And when after all the time spent in line, Doug is there to take your order. I ordered a large drink, and he politely told me that there is free refills on the small drink. I got the Alligator Sausage (which I split), The Apple and Cherry Pork Sausage w/ dried fruit, some manchego-esque cheese, and sweet curry mustard, with an order of duck fat fries. My friends got the corn dog, bratwurst, hot dog, and regular fries. Everything was off the charts good. I would never imagine mixing shrimp sauce with a smoked alligator sausage. But the stand-out to me was the pork sausage. The flavors mixed and matched so perfectly and there was nothing better to wash it down with than some duck-fat fries and a gulp of Mr. Pibb.  Suffer through the lines, and make sure you go on Friday or Saturday.
