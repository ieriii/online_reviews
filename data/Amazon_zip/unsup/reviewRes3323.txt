Forget Virginia...THIS PLACE is for lovers...bi bim bop and chicken wing lovers . This place is one of my favorite spots in the city of Chicago due to their bountiful offerings which include two of my favorite foods...CHICKEN and BI BIM BOP! Every time I eat here I must order both. I end up in an intoxicated state of bliss. Not sure if I want to break out into the "running man" or write a love song. I urge you to try Crisp. It may be the only meal in recent memory that I've actually said a prayer AFTER eating! BTW...ignore the posts about not bringing a date here since the wings are a lil messy to eat. You SHOULD bring a date here to see if they can hold their own. If they roll up their sleeves and aren't afraid to get "saucy wit it", then pass the wetnaps...you just may have yourself a keeper.
