This is my favorite place in Chicago to eat breakfast/brunch/lunch. It's a veritable pharmacy of delicious, with something on the menu to cure what ails me no matter what. 1. If I am hung over RX- Breakfast burrito 2. It's almost lunch time, and I'm hungry for lunch food, but it's the weekend and they only have brunch food RX- eggs benedict 3. For some reason, I don't have to work and it's a weekday. - the grilled chicken sandwich with pear and gouda 4. I'm five. - any of the crazy sweet pancake/french toast concoctions.
