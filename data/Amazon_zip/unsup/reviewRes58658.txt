This was one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had. We went on a Friday evening and it was not very busy at all. There was staff standing around talking, and yet it was very difficult to get any service. We wanted the honey wine and were told that it was no longer offered with the coupon deal we bought. When we asked for help in selecting items, we were directed to read the menu, which was fairly vague in description (we wanted more description on the sauces that were used on the meats). Our fried appetizer came out still cold in the middle, and the entree portion of the meal was barely above room temperature. When we asked the server she simply replied it's supposed to be that way. Since all of the items we ordered were meat, health safety-wise I would guess that it should have been hot. This was a huge disappointment and an addition to my stay-away list.
