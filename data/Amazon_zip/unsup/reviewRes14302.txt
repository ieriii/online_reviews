So after a great night of partying and waking up super hungry it didn't matter what I wanted to eat, I just knew I needed FOOD!!!! So after much thought into finding a place close by our place, my boyfriends suggested to go to 90 Miles Cuban Caf. So we got out of bed, showered, got dressed and heading our way out the door. We walking to this place from Montrose to Clybourn which is about 3 miles, at this time we were extremely hungry and antsy to get there. So after a 30 minute walk we finally got there. It smelled delicious!!! We were so excited to walk in order and stuff ourselves. I order the, "Bistec dinner", which includes a medium size pork steak, caramelized onions, garlic, cilantro, black beans, white rice and fried plantains all for $9.95 plus tax. My boyfriend order , "Ropa Veija", which is shredded pork cooked in their Cuban sauce ( the portion of this dish is very generous), black beans, white rice and fried plantains for $9.95 plus tax. We didn't order drinks, we had complimentary water they had by their counter but the food was awesome for my tummy!!! Overall, 90 Miles Cuban Caf is a great Cuban restaurant. Their decor is very vintage, which I love. They have old Cuban newspaper articles, magazine ads, Cuban fashion, Cuban posters and old family photos in Cuba all posted around the walls. They don't have many seats inside, but they do have an open patio which you can sit and its BYOB! I recommend this great little spot between Clybourn and Belmont. Whether your hungry, not so hungry or in the mood for Cuban food. You should definitely go there.
