Despite the tourists, the loud, rude women, and the location - I like Grand Lux Cafe. I don't like going downtown but I will for this. Went Saturday for my birthday lunch with the family. We got a great spot near the window, had the nicest waiter EVER, and everyone was happy with their meal. I went here once 2-3 years ago and had the Sesame Tofu and it was amazing - this past weekend it wasn't as great (it was lunchtime, during the busiest time of year however) but it was still delicious. They even brought me a birthday treat which was very nice! All in all Im going back for sure because I want to try pasta there, but I'll wait until after the New Year. Oh - and they tell you an hour wait or so but you always get in faster, which is nice.
