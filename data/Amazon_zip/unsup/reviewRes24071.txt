Very family-oriented restaurant with great service. The food was not that impressive. The Pork Souvlaki was really really dry. When I mean "really really" dry, it was cracking dry and my jaw got sore right away. Could not finish eating it. The dessert was average, too. We both have been to Greece and know that it was not on the delicious side in terms of food quality, but overall it was acceptable considering the location and price. We walked away paying about $17/pp. A good place for family and senior citizens, but not a hip romantic place. Pretty decent for a late night dinner.
