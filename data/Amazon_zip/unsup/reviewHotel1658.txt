From first glance you can see that this is an old building, but the insides are very modern. The decor is very nice, especially the oversized Christmas ornaments. The lobby is equipped with modern leather couches that are comforting and stylish. The service is exceptional, everyone was extremely friendly. Was here for a corporate Christmas party and had a blast. The cocktail hour included a never ending open bar. The area that the cocktail hour was held felt a bit crammed, but it was cozy. Since people were not sitting on the couches, they were just getting in the way. If possible I would suggest for them to move the couches around a little for the cocktail hour so there is more standing room and less of moving through a maze.... The dinner served was mouth watering. The steaks were tender and the tilapia was soft and flavorful. *** the steak is cooked medium rear, so if you like it more cooked, get the tilapia. The dessert was not good, at all, maybe only the chocolate covered strawberries but it's hard to mess that up. The cakes and pasties were just not appetizing, the texture, the contents and flavor were all off. The rooms are "small" but I've seen smaller rooms in Europe. In my opinion how much room does a person actually need in a hotel room. A bed, a desk, and maybe a tv..check, check and check. The pillows and the actually bed were soft and comfy. I am always in the lookout for a better pillow, I might actually email the hotel and ask what brand pillows they have so I can purchase some for my home! They provided validated self-parking for $25, ooooor you can do what we did and park less than a block away in the outside self-parking area that has a $14 weekend speacial :) The rooms run about $160 a night on average, and I think that for the location in downtown Chicago and quality if hotel that is a great price. Also, if you are an out of towner, this hotel's location is superb :)
