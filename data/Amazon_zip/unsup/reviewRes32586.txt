I'll admit it - I only knew about this place because I'm enough of an AFI fan to pay attention to where Davey Havok says he eats on the road. It served me in good stead, however, when I was trapped at RTC Great Lakes (for three months longer than I should have been) and befriended a vegan shipmate who'd gone vegetarian out of necessity, and couldn't stand another day subsisting on corn and apples. I told her about the Chicago Diner, and on our first free Saturday after that we hopped on the Metra and were on our way. I'm still an omni myself, but incredibly picky in regards to meat and in many cases will choose tofu because I know it won't taste "funny". On the diner's menu, however, the thing that piqued my interest most was the portobello caesar wrap. Stuffed with big slabs o' mushroom, veggies, your choice of soy or dairy cheese, and creamy caesar dressing. OMGSOGOOD. I actually ended up ordering this the next three times we visited--and now I'm sad, because the last time I checked the online menu, it was gone. I'm determined to approximate this at home. Their shakes are indeed delicious--special nod to the choco-peanut-butter--but they disappear way too quickly for costing $6.50! Their seasonal desserts are also great, in particular the margarita cupcakes that I enjoyed at the height of last summer. My friend brought back a slice of raw berry "cheesecake" that didn't hold its shape too well on the train ride back, but still tasted great. The restaurant is on the small side but feels cozy as opposed to cramped, and the waitstaff was very cool and friendly. You may have a bit of a wait for the toilet during lunch rush, but chances are they'll let you use the opposite-sex restroom, eheh.
