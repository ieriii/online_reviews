Attended a soft opening here tonight. Tough to give a full review as only cocktails and light apps were available but I was wowed by a rosemary crusted lamb chop with great flavor, a tuna caponata tartlet, and a prosciutto-wrapped fig. Great hospitality was on full display in the former Timo space, including a phenomenal patio.
