Fan frikin tastic. Having come from the south where most ethnic food joints are Americanized and have bland food, I can say that Garcia's has FLAVOR! (and lots of it) I usually order the torta with avocado instead of meat and its the best sandwich you could ever want to eat. My husband makes it a point to try something new every time and has not been disappointed yet. His favorite so far is the Huevos Con Carne Asada. The chicken soup is a LARGE portion so be careful if you order it as a side. We love this restaurant!
