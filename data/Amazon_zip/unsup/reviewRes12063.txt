The four stars are for the micro brews at piece. I absolutely love the selection. If you are a fan of IPA's then this is the place for you. Shy away on weekends, as the wait can get up to over an hour. Food is ok if you are hungry. They offer two types of pizza, "Red" and "White". I strongly recommend the traditional red sauce. Food and drinks are reasonable.
