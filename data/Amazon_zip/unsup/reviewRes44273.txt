A great date place. The BYOB bit makes the whole experience affordable, and the food is terrific.  The tempura sweet potato roll is to die for. I now ask for that exact combination at every other sushi place I go to! The salad roll as well is excellent. Wakamono is one star short of perfect because the music, especially in the bathroom, is deafening at times. PLEASE. Turn down the music. It's not a f*cking night club. There are enough dance bars in Boystown already. Please let me enjoy my meal, and my date, and our conversation. The food is grand, but I go out to eat to enjoy the company I'm with, as much as the food itself. The sister restaurant, PingPong is also excellent, yet plagued by the same blaring music.
