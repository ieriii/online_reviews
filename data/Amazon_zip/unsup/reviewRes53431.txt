This review is not about the restaurant nor the food. I'm just going to comment on the service i got when i was at Alinea.Excellent service. At least one waiter would stand unobtrusively in the background at all times to tend to my needs and they were really very respectful and very prompt.I love it here, the food may not be that delicious as the other restaurants but the service is what will make people come back.
