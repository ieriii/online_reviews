This was a recommendation from a friend and I have only been once but I am already dreaming of the rolls! The rolls are scrumptious and huge! One mega roll is all u need! We had the double decker and Godzilla, both were fab. The double decker was so fresh tasting with cilantro in it and the Godzilla was heavier and very filling. It's a tiny place (fits 30 ppl maybe) and don't really recommend it for large groups. Service is kind of crummy but the food was so good, they still get 5 stars from me!
