Went for a Saturday brunch and the place was packed. After the long wait, starving and finally seated, we were promptly ignored by the waiter. After they finally took our order (during which they managed to confuse who was waiting on our table), we got our food. I had the Popeye's Favorite Fritatta. They do offer a variety of toast alternatives, e.g. pancakes, English muffins, etc. which was nice. While it was good, it wasn't amazing, and probably not worth the whole ordeal. When we were leaving, around 1:30PM, the place was a lot less crowded. I would recommend going for a late brunch, when the service might be better.
