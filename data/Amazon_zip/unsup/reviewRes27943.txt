The very true test of a great pizza, like love, is the morning after. Pequod's gets my highest pizza rating and this ol' Taylor Street gal knows her pizza.  I thought it was one of the best ever and the crust was not only pretty but crunchy. Whole family loved it - Don't know why we never tried it before as we pass by there all the time. Thanks to the Pizza god above for my daughter's maturing taste buds, and delivering us from the evil taste of Domino's. Amen.
