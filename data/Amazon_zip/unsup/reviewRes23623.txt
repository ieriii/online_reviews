5 STARS! I've never been to China and haven't experienced Chinese food first hand but the experience we had a Lao Sze Chaun seemed to show us the real thing. It was one of those experiences that changed my definitions of what a food is like. It was so good, and the value was very good as well! The lamb spiced with cumin was fantastic. The lamb was served sliced and sauteed-very well done and finely finely balanced with cumin, ginger, onions and jalapeno peppers and dried red chilis. It made for flavors that were full and fiery, but tasty as well! We ordered the sesame chicken,and that was really good also. I've never had any like it - it was savory and not too sweet and perfectly battered. We went for lunch and it was worth the trip from the Loop! We got there at 11:45 and didn't need a reservation, though later in the afternoon it looked like there were plenty of people who come back and for good reasons! I would definitely go back and take people. Great! Thank you! It was so good!
