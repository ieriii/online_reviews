BEST Chi-town brunch ever. Love the atmosphere and the waiters were very attentive. I really have nothing bad to say about this place. EVERYTHING on their menu is amazing. Get The Red Velvet pancakes and ask for extra cream. It's too die for. The omelets and sandwiches are delicious as well. You can definitely taste all the fresh ingredients in each dish.. Overall, no complaints about this place. I never had to wait for a table every time I went here. Others have complained so make sure to get their early!
