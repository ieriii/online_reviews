I'm here about once a week or so, and while the service and the food aren't always stellar, I'm not usually disappointed. The food's reasonably priced, and they make the best fresh limeade -- just like I've found when in Mexico. Best value is to order a taco dinner with extra tortillas, since they are overstuffed and you can easily make extras. The margaritas here aren't my favorite, but they're not horrible.
