Very cute atmosphere. Loved the full bar in a separate room. The Ginger Martini was yummy! The sushi was ok. It didn't blow me away. The choices were pretty standard. None of the contemporary rolls really interested me. I think they should work on coming up with more. I also wanted miso soup but theirs is jalapeno miso soup. That sucked. I'm not into spicy soup. It's a little on the pricey side but the food came out quickly, the staff was nice and the ambiance was good. Overall opinion: A-OK? Maybe. Eh-OK? Definitely.
