I love you, Chicago Diner. I love you so hard. Remember when you took the lasagna off the menu and we almost broke up? Those were rough times. But it's back and I'm back. J/K, I never left. Not when this is one of the few places I can find Temptation soy ice cream, which is prolly the best soy ice cream I know of. I wish the water weren't room temp and that your waiters weren't sometimes overworked to the point of confusion. Your nachos used to be huge, I don't know what happened to them. That makes me sad. I also wish that my drink order didn't sometimes come out until halfway through my meal. I guess that's what happens when you hand blend fresh berries for the margaritas, but still. If you lived closer, this would be a serious relationship, for reals. But I'm glad I have you around for those Saturday flings on the north side. Kisses!
