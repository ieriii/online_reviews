Upon a friend's recommendation, we went to Caro Mio the other night. Just walking into the restaurant and being hit by a wave of delicious smells, you know you're in for a treat. We showed up on a Friday night around 8 and was told it would be a 30" wait, he suggested we go to the bar down the street, and he'd call us.  Dinner was really tasty. Portobello appetizer to start was buried in this fantastic simple tomato sauce. I had the stuffed gnocchi special with tomato cream sauce, which was to die for -- possibly the best gnocchi I've ever had in my life. My fiance had a ziti special with peppers, sausage and meatballs which wasn't actually that good. Loved that it's BYOB and friendly service.
