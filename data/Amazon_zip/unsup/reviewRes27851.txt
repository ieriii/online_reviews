Rick Bayless is the ambassador of Mexican food to our unsuspecting American palates. With wife Deann he has traveled what seems to be every part of the country, eating his ways across taquerias, fondas, fine restaurants and home kitchens. His restaurant captures the very best of true Mexican cooking. On a recent visit to the Windy City, we searched for this establishment on Clark. Come early as they do not accept reservations.
