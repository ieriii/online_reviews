I have been to Frontera Grill countless times and have had only great experiences!! The food and service are both excellent. Be forewarned - they don't take reservations and you will have to wait but it is definately worth it!! If you are expecting Americanized Mexican ala Don Pablo's, you will likely be disappointed, this is real, excellently prepared Mexican food from one of the best chefs around. I highly recommend checking it out, you won't be disappointed.
