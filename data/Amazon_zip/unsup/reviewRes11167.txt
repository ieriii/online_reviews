I've been hearing about Piece from a lot of my Chicago friends, so I was glad to have experienced it during my last visit to my hometown. The place was packed, which I hear it always is. We had to wait like an hour for our table. Fortunately, we're content with standing around and drinking. Unfortunately, I don't remember which brew we were drinking, but it was good. We had a group of six guys and we ordered two large pizzas, which was the perfect amount to satisfy all of us before a long night of partying. Our pizzas had a bunch of different toppings, and they were tasty. Most surprising to me was the total price... after the two pizzas and a beer or two each, the bill came out to under $80!
