Hearty food, the stick to your bones type, that is so delicious and has such a wide range of flavors. There are many things on this menu that I would never had tried on my own but the Publican serves them is such a way that I am not scared to try them. Sunday brunch is also a must. On top of all of their delicious meals their desserts are absolutely amazing.
