We came here for an engagement dinner. There were 6 of us. It was as if there were a circus going on in the place. Waiter had no clue what was going on and asked us twice what our orders were because he said he forgot. Food. Te food was not good at all. Meat was actually low grade. Appetizers came out 45 minutes after we placed order. Entrees came out over an our after that. Food was crappy ad service was non existent. We will never go back to this place again. The decor was nice but they should have spent what they did on decor on quality of servers and food.
