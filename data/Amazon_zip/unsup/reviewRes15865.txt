I absolutely love this place! The first thing you notice is the ambiance: beautiful vibrant colors! The environment is very modern and playful. The food is excellent!!! My boy friend had the Aracherra which was undeniably delicious. I had the Churrasco which was bursting with flavor. Both steaks were made to perfection. Unfortunately, I had to take one star away because the service was not lived up to Carnivale's standards. Our waiter was not as attentive as he could have been. He first bought us the wrong round of drinks and then it took almost about twenty minutes for us to get our check.
