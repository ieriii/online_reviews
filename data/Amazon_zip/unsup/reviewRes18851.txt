Solid 4 stars for The Gage. Great location along Michigan and across from the park, there is a lot of chances for people watching if you sit outside. Luckily there are some mid-range height bushes to give you some sense of privacy as you stuff your face with the deliciousness that is served to you. Our server was a bit quirky, she would lean in and really tell you about the food and dishes... It got funny after a while, but at least she was pretty attentive and alert. The other servers kept our waters refilled and crumbs swept off after every course! Tried the fish special of the day, which was pretty tasty. Big fan of the bread fondue appetizer... I could probably just order the cheese as my drink next time. We even stayed for dessert, even though we didn't have that much room. I hit the Irish coffee pretty hard (paid the price later) and we tried the gelatto and cream cheese dessert.... YUM. Get ready to spend some money here, but if you would like a nice dinner/lunch... this is definitely the spot.
