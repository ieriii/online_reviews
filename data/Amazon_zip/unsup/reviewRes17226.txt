It seems that despite my best efforts to resist the enticements of my friends, I always end up truly enjoying myself at restaurants. A buddy had to cajole me for the better part of an hour to make the trip from Lincoln Park to India House. I know it's not far, but it was freezing that day! We made it for the lunch buffet which I found to be extremely awesome. The food was varied, continuously refilled and an interesting mix of flavors, some Indian cuisine I was very familiar with and some that was new to me. Overall, I truly enjoyed it. I highly recommend the buffet for lunch if you can swing it. Another huge plus is the waitstaff was extremely helpful and extremely attentive. First-class service. The restaurant wasn't too busy and I'm not sure if it's because the buffet is not exactly a bargain deal or because people are unaware of this place (althought 240+ reviews would suggest otherwise). Stop by for lunch for sure!
