Stopped in for drinks to avoid Friday night post work traffic, and to get out of the rain, and was pleased by the original mixed drink selection. Though we didn't eat, the place was packed which leads me to believe they have got to be doing something right! It appears they are still re-modeling the lower level, and once that is completed, I am sure there will be plenty of seats available. Worth a visit.
