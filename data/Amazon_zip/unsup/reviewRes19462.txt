Loooong wait for good food, not "incredible" food. 3.5 stars. After reading yelp recommendations, we ordered the: -Guacamole + Chips - Wild Mushroom Tortas - Chicken Tinga Torta - Churros (w/side of chocolate sauce) Everything was excellent; tiny portions, but good enough to feel moderately full after eating. I just don't think the tortas were worth the 30-40 minute wait. I also felt that the prices were a bit steep for the portions, but then again you can taste the quality and freshness. Perhaps, I'll have to try something else off the menu since the appetizers and desserts were delicious. Going to XOCO has made me want call for a reservation at Rick Bayless's higher end restaurant, Frontera. I think I may have better luck there.
