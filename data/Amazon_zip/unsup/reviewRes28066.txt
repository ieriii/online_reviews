Ever since I watched Rick Bayless decimate the competition to win Top Chef Masters, I have been a fan ! He not only seemed to be a hugely talented chef, but also a really down to earth, and humble individual. Every single time I visited Chi-town, Frontera Grill was top, on my list of restaurants to visit. Unfortunately, every single time, we were unable to do so. Either it was all booked-up or the wait was too long. We finally made it this time, after a two and half hour wait. Third time lucky, don't they say ! My experience was great on all counts. The food and drinks were well prepared and executed. Starting with a mango-basil mojito, which was refreshing and moving on to the phenomenal ceviche trio. This dish was definitely the highlight of our meal, and consisted of albacore, tuna and shrimp. The seafood was extremely fresh and the multiple flavor-notes were well balanced. We also ordered the tamales, which were sweet and moist, and topped with sauteed onions and peppers and a cream sauce. For our entree, we ordered the mole trio. I figured that since Rick is always cooking moles on tv, it should be good. Out of the three, we loved the poblanos in green mole. Didn't really care for the lamb enchiladas, covered with mole and the red lamb mole. The latter mole had a bitter taste that one would expect from a sauce containing chocolate and chili, but it was not that pleasant to my palette. Guess, I am just not a mole person ! We finished our meal with the coconut flan with fresh mango and sorbet.....great dessert ! Service was great and our waiter was very knowledgeable. He was pushing us to choose the carne asada. Should have listened ......oh well...next time ! This restaurant barely missed getting 5 stars only because of the loooong wait and the mole. Excited to try Topolobampo and Xoco on our next visit !
