the rooms are pretty nice, the look&feel is somewhere between classy and sleek. but the hotel is just massive. the lobby feels like you're constantly at a convention. when i stayed, 'die hard' crashed in the last 20 minutes, so my 90 minutes of time invested went to waste. i had to push, but the hotel gave me a credit to say sorry.
