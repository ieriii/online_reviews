They took great care of 20 of us on a Saturday night. Very friendly service. Most of us ordered the house specialty (entrana - skirt steak). Skirt steak is definitely thought of as lower-quality cut generally, but we all loved it. Despite being a steakhouse, given my personal preference for chicken, my favorite food was the chicken though. It was amazing. We also all loved the empanadas, the calamari, the shrimp, and the fried plantains. The cocktails were really good too. I had 'la cantadora' and really liked it. Certainly not a 'gourmet' restaurant, nor does it try to be. But very good food and very lively/fun atmosphere. I definitely recommend it.
