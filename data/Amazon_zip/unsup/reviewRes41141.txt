When I am not feeling well, I head to Tank for a big bowl of chicken pho. Toss in some fresh bean sprouts and Thai basil and there is really no better cure-all. Sorry Mom, but this definitely beats your Lipton! I also stop in for bubble tea. There are plenty of places in the neighborhood to grab one, but Tank puts big chunks of fresh fruit in theirs. Great summer treat!
