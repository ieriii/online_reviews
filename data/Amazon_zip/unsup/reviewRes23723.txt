This place rocks. I have only been there in the summer to sit outside because there does seem to be a lack of outdoor, inexpensive byob options. I always get one of the steak dishes - which are to die for. My favorite is the bistec tico. It is skirt steak, not filet mignon or anything, but it is unbelievably flavorful, the portion is huge and the price can't be beat. The oatmeal shake is an absolute must. I have been known to stop there on my way home from work just to have one. It tastes like oatmeal cookie ice cream! I brought an out of town friend here whose family is Costa Rican and she thought that it was very authentic.  The only thing I haven't liked is the ceviche. Totally bland. I was shocked given how flavorful everything else is. Oh, and there isn't much ambiance. Nice to sit outside but it isn't like the view of Milwaukee Ave. is all that appealing.
