Staycations. I never do them. But when it came to the Drake, I was all for it. Ever since I moved to Chicago, I'd been wanting to know what it was like. So, I decided to surprise my husband with a little down-time at the Drake. How fun! I thought I just booked a room but this was definitely a suite. There was a large sitting space, if I recall a fireplace, an incredible view of the lake and the drive. Also, I wish my bathroom looked as spacious as this one. When we walked into the suite, there was jazz playing. Peel Me a Grape. Need I say more. The little bar on the ground floor was cozy, though we only stayed long enough to get a bottle of wine to take back to the room. The elevator had old wood interior and must have been a refurbished original. So glad whoever was in charge of restoring this hotel did. What a great piece of architectural history and a great exception if staycations seem not high on your list.
