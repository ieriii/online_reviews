I had a half day off work for Good Friday, so I had what I believed to be a brilliant idea... why not run over to Hot Doug's for lunch? Tragically: 1 - None of my friends were able to join 2 - I didn't have a book or magazine with me 3 - I was wearing open-toed shoes and it was quite windy and freezing cold 4 - Everyone in the greater Chicagoland area had the same idea as I did, so the line ended up being almost 2 hours start to finish... Once I got inside, of course, all of the anger and frustration went away, and I regained the ability to wiggle my fingers and toes. I went with a traditional Chicago dog, duck fat fries, and a Spicy Jerk Sausage that had fried plantains, brie, and a passion fruit mayonnaise. I couldn't actually distinguish the taste of the mayo but the plantains were a GREAT touch. Hot Doug's has a great classic dog - it's got the "snap" and is super cheap...less than $2. The duck fries are delicious and all, but honestly, I think it's better to go to Hot Doug's during the week (non-duck days) because the line's a bit more manageable. Whatever day you decide to go, be ready to devote a good chunk of your afternoon to the anticipation and consumption of sausages. It's not necessarily a bad thing, but it does require advance planning.
