I love this place! I have never had a bad experience here. While sometimes the service is a little slow, it's a pretty laid back place so it kind of goes with the territory. In fact the best service I've had here was definitely worth 5 stars and it was on a busy evening. You must try their Macaroni! It's to die for. They also have great salads. I love this place for the cozy feel and great patio and open window veranda seating.
