These wings are so big... you gotta call them WANGS! As my good friend Lisa M. would say, the wings here are "amaze." They truly are, crispy skin with the best Korean Seoul Sassy sauce! I was tempted to try their rice bowls, aptly titled: Buddha Bowls but the wings were screaming my name! The place is small with communal wooden benches but the service was fast and it's also BYOB. These Korean wings are the best wings I've had and put regular hot wings to shame!
