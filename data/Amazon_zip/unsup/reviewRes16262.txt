I must say that I love this place. Between the ambiance and the incredible cocktail menu, the fireplace and chandeliers... how could you not feel a little proud to be sitting here drinking a Hush and Wonder or a Vodka Cobbler? The service was awesome, the menu expansive.. it may seem pricey at first, but if you think of how much booze goes into one handcrafted drink, you really are getting your moneys worth. The only thing that irked me was how tricky it is to find the place... but they do that on purpose. So I must laugh at myself for that. At least I didn't come for Bud Light in my sneakers ;)
