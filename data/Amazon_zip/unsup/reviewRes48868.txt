Beer and pork lovers oasis, The Publican is a lively European style beer hall with a hugh selection of craft beers, and excellent food. In my recent visits we started with the fresh walleye fish fry, seasonal oysters, colorful beets salad, and crisp apple salad. The star entrees were the delicious pork belly and zesty country ribs. The large communal tables, cozy booths (or stalls) and ample beer selection encourage sharing and conversation, Great place for tasty food and a lively atmosphere.
