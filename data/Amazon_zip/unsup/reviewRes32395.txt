For me, this is the veggie mothership- a veritable institution for vegetarians worldwide. Just for that simple fact, I give it 2 stars. The free adjacent parking lot in a neighborhood where it is hard to park- well that's another star right there. Service was super friendly and bubbly. The food was totally eh. In 1980 I'm sure it was mindblowing, but now that we're in 2008 and vegan and vegetarian cooking is prolific, I really didn't taste anything that I couldn't make at home. It was pretty standard fare... not bad, not great... just fine. Thanks to Yelpers who came before us... we ordered the chocolate chip cookie dough and peanut butter shake. THANK YOU! That alone was worth the whole visit. I'd definitely eat here again if I lived in Chicago... but I'm sure there is much more "modernized" vegetarian fare to be had elsewhere in the City, now that we're in the 21st century.
