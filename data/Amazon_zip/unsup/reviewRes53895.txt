Probably one of the best meals I have ever had in Chicago. The food was small plate and inventive. Why only 3 stars out 5? Read on and I'll explain. The pork braised milk shoulder was divine. So rich it melted in your mouth. Salted beets with goat cheese were a bit too salty for my taste, but hey thats me. Wine list was approachable and expansive enough that it covered even obscure regions. Service was prompt yet not over bearing. Server (Gina) was always available when needed yet not trying to shove courses down your throat to push the check. It's nice to be served by somebody so adorable and sweet. My issue came when I noticed one of the members of the management team adjusting themselves constantly, basically right in front of our table. You know a male member (dual meaning). Absolutely disgusting. My wife could not believe what she saw! I'll go back........when that is eventually gone from my memory.
