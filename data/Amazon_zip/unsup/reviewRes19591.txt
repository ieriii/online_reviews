Warning: Do NOT go here if you are starving and need to eat immediately. This place rocks. Rick Bayless is smart for thinking up this place. The wait was not fun, but made the food that much better. I had the Cubana, a mexican type panini. It was insanely good. I didnt actually love the churros so much, but I was also really, really full. Its places like this that make me want to move to Chicago...promptly.
