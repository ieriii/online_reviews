I have visited Grand Lux 5 other times previously, but my most recent visit left me feeling a little sour. The wait time for a table was as per usual 45mins to 1 hour, which i was OK with. The food was tasty, and like others have said, there was a ton of it. I had the Sunday night pasta, which is HUGE. I was actually able to get 2 more leftover meals out of it (and i'm a 195lb guy). My only problem came when one of the waiters brought my little brother his bowl of clam chowder soup. Instead of placing the bowl in front of him, he handed my brother a full bowl of soup which was hot, heavy, and ended up in my brother's lap. The apology was weak at best from the waiter, but the manager definitely went out of her way to help my brother...she even provided burn cream for his leg. Unfortunately this was the first time that my entire family had sat down for a meal together in a month, so i had expected a much smoother and quieter meal. After the soup incident, nobody felt much like talking about anything except how bad we felt for my brother. This has strongly made me reconsider visiting this restaurant as a way to impress out-of-towners.
