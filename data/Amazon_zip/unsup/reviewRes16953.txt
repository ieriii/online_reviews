We tried this place for lunch today. We walked in with no reservation as the lunch rush was kicking off and were seated quickly. As everyone else has mentioned the decor is amazing, and it's shocking how big the place is. I ordered the Jibarito sandwich while others went with the Chivito. I was jealous. Definitely go for the Chivito, the Jibarito was quite lacking in comparison.
