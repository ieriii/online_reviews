When you visit Chicago, your three must haves are pizza, hot dogs, and italian beef. When it comes to pizza, almost every person would include Gino's East in the discussion.  We arrived at 6pm with a group of four. We were quoted an hour wait time, but it became a two hour wait. They don't make the pizzas till you order it and, because the deep dish pizzas take an additional 45 minutes to make, it wasn't till our 3rd hour that we started to eat. That being said...if you're visiting this place, make sure you come early.  This being said, is it really deserving of the hype that it receives?  Perhaps, but we didn't really see it with our visit. The locals that we dined with told us that the quality of the pizza we received was not as good as it could have been. Our pizza crust was perfect and flaky on the outside, but the bottom of the pizza pie disintegrated under the ingredients. I'm told that a perfect pizza pie will hold together and have a nice crisp.  The positive is that we thought that the ingredients that were used for our meat pizza were flavorful. I liked the sauce and we all loved the sausage.  If I were to come back to Chicago, then I would give this place another chance. But we weren't blown away by the 3 hour wait for food and our final product was simply good, but not great.
