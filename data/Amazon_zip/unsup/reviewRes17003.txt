I've been going to this resturant fro a couple of years now and I've yet to be dis-appointed. Kock your socks off n dragg dem dead good! I like my drinks straight up and mixed, if you're into mojito's then go for the Pamagrantedf or Coconut, thy're the best, if you're looking for harder orange burbon press with bellow's burbon. fav food: lunch the chavito(wagyu beef(steak) ham, bacon, fried egg & topped off by a buttery prezzle roll with assorted chips and /or cheviche. dinner: never go wrong with anything... never! fav: pork adobo, arracherra, birmundi, ropa veja, and g reat humongus three layer icecream cake( bottom: guava, middle: pastaccio, top: Passionfruit, each layer separated by a thin layer of chacolate cake & top it off with warm chacolate sauce) but don't just take my word for it... go eat and enjoy and make your tastebuds worth living! also wendsday nights music and dancing! oh and yes the ladies that are there are as yummi as the food... get any better?
