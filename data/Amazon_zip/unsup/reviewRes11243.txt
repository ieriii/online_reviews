So good! Delicious pizza that's served on a cookie sheet the depth of the table. In fact, they have to put it on a tray that raises it above the height of your cups since it covers almost the whole table. The beer is really good too, what being a micro-brewery 'n all. Definitely check it out. It's not far from the Damen - O'Hare El stop on the Blue Line.
