Very good sushi. And I'm picky so that's saying something. The serving staff was nice, if a bit space cadet (one woman offered us hot towels twice, and 3 different serving staff tried to pick up the check folder when it was empty). It's connected to the bar next door, which doesn't bother me except that that bar uses a large amount of incense, and sometimes the scent of the incense wafted across the table. This isn't a good setup for eating food when scent can interfere with taste.
