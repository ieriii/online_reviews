Third Coast is a mecca for its Gold Coast neighbors and area students. It's a little like Uncommon Ground in its wine bar / coffeehouse / restaurant feel, but not quite as good. It's underneath an apartment complex, and its deep dark wood and dim lighting make it a romantic little winter nook. The food is good, the coffee and wine better. It's crowded on the weekends, but is a good spot to meet a friend for a cup of coffee or do some work on your laptop.
