Great location, close to Museum Campus, Millenium Park and public transportation. A bus runs just outside the door. The hotel itself is a giant historic Art Decoish building with impressive chandeliers and halls. Quite a landmark even though I have to remark that I have been to more inviting looking hotels (it's size makes it a bit borg-cube-like and its all dark bricks). As many hotels in historic buildings it seemed a bit dated to me furnishing wise (a lot of carpet in that place ...) and extremely dated interior-stylewise. Curtains and carpets and all the furniture are dark and kind of Empire-ish. Most people under 40 probably feel as akward entering a room like this as I did - probably a lot of people past their 40s either! Priceline made me stay in this Hilton - would not necessary have chosen this "grand hotel" style - helped save the budget though. Still, I had a decent stay here. Staff was friendly, especially the room maides. They asked me and my husband every morning if we had any special wishes apart from regular cleaning. We successfully ordered anti-allergic foam pillows instead of the feathery ones. Bathrooms are spacious and all marble, pretty cool. Shower, TV, Coffeemaker and everything else worked fine. As we came to explore Chicago (in which case the hotel is not at all a bad option as it is great to walk to everywhere from here) we did not spend time in any of the fitness and restaurant facilities of the hotel. Overall very ok experience to stay there but I kind of missed a real "soul" of the place - especially as it obviously tries to maintains this "historic" image. It is a kind of anonymous atmosphere probably because of the enormous size. I would give it 3.5 or even 4 if it were not for these very dark and carpeted rooms ... the style is just not very appealing to me, therefore it is only 3 stars for the Hilton.
