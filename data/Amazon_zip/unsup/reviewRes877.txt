This place deserves a five. There's just some sort of vibe that this place gives whenever I go. The anticipation of eating here builds as you're forced to wait in line. And when you finally do get to order and eat, you're not let down. I've been in this line during hot summer days, beautiful spring and fall days, and one really cold winter day. Yes, the wait sucked, but it was worth it. It's weird how that works. Some notes... I highly recommend that you get an order of the duck fat fries AND the regular fries. The difference is subtle and you won't appreciate it without a reference. Doug himself is going to take your order at the counter. Yeah that's him. I've never seen him upset or be unfriendly to a patron. He's just been a happy go lucky guy whenever I go. Check the website before you go. The place does close on occasion for the holidays and for vacations. The place is usually closed around the same dates every year though. You may think you won't get a seat. But you will. I know, you feel like you're back in the lunch cafeteria at school as you gaze across the full tables and strange faces. But it'll work out. You may end up sharing a big table with some other people, but that's not such a bad thing. You will probably have the ultimate ice breaker with you, duck fat fries... Share some, and make some new friends over encased meats.
