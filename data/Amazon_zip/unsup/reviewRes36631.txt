I've been searching for a Thai resturant (been to a few that were just not good) that makes drunken noodles as good as my favorite Thai resturant in Southern California. My search is over!! This place is the one, the bonus is they also serve sushi (which my boyfriend loves). The service was not the best (waitress hardly came to the table to see if we needed anything), had to flag her down a couple of times. Maybe once I become a regular service will get better : )
