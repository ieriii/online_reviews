My favorite place for authentic spicy szechuan cuisine. Go there on a weeknight or better yet for lunch. They have a lunch menu with smaller size versions of many popular dishes (not much smaller). You have to ask for the lunch menu because they don't give it to you willingly (kind of annoying actually - but now you know it exists). Monday through Friday is when the lunch menu is served. Prices are cheap and each dish comes with your choice of Hot and Sour soup or Egg Drop Soup (I always get Hot and Sour) and an egg roll, but they charge $1 for a bowl of rice, but even then its still cheap. Another tip, is sometimes if you pay cash, they'll give you a 5% discount off your bill, but you have to ask - but it may not always be the case. My favorite dishes, in no particular order, are: 1. Dry Chili Chicken (for a slightly sweet version order Tony's Dry Chili Chicken); 2. Dan Dan Noodles; 3. Szechuan String Beans; 4. Pork with Wood Ears; 5. Potherb 6. Salt and Pepper fish; 7. Potstickers (really excellent); 8. Tri-Color Bean Curd There are a lot of delicious veggie and fish options. As far as Ma Po Tofu is concerned, it is very authentic here, but a bit greasy for me (its the large pool of red chili oil floating on the top), but its is very tasty. I just don't always order it because it can be kind of painful to eat.
