I don't like duck, but I do love BBQ pork and Sun-Wah has some of the best I've ever had. This place is huge and there are always large groups of families and friends. Friday nights expect to see lots of tables reserved for those that have pre ordered their Beijing Duck. You do need a reservation if that's what you're interested in. The duck is served with rice, veggies, various condiments, and bao. It's carved table side and then the carcass is taken back to the kitchen and made into soup. While I can't tell you how it tastes, I can appreciate the entertainment value. For those, like me, that don't care for duck - don't worry. There are plenty of other delicious things to order. Portions are huge so I usually get one of their "Barbecue Over Rice" plates which consist of a generous portion of meat, rice, and some bok choi. I love their Chinese Broccoli, so one order of that with 2 "over rice" plates makes a great meal for two. All for about $20. They've also got all kinds of soups - noodle, won ton, dumpling, with all kinds of meats and broths. These are also big enough to make a meal and another favorite of mine. The space is one big open and loud room, but the people watching is great. A mixture of big Asian families, gay and straight couples, large groups of friends, birthday parties, kids and seniors. It's never dull. Probably not a romantic evening, but I think it's great for the first date. What to know - if you want Beijing Duck - order ahead and make reservations. They do get busy and I've often had a wait on Fridays - but it's worth it. Go with friends and be adventurous - try something new. They do serve liquor but you can BYOB, but I think that the corkage fee is a little steep. Rice plates and soups are around $5 - $7, entrees are around $11 - $15 but are huge and meant to be served family style.
