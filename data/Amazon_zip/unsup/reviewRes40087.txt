After years of hearing I should try Korean BBQ, I finally did. This place was great, so great in fact, that I've been back a second time. They give you so much food that we've gone home with leftovers both times. I would love to give this place 5 stars but I knocked it down one because they only have one chicken dish on the menu. I've been told for a Korean BBQ place that I should be lucky they even had one chicken dish on their menu. I still highly recommend going there.
