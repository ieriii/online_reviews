This is my first ever review on Yelp....so I figured I'd better start with a good place! Geja's is probably one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago!  I love fondue in general, especially when you're with people whose company you genuinely enjoy, b/c its such a lengthy meal you get a lot of time to spend together. And Geja's capitalizes perfectly on this characteristic with its intimate ambiance. This is probably my idea of the perfect date spot -- its a small space with dark velvet curtains, wooden tables, lit by candles....you get the picture. However, I've only been to Geja's with my family, so that pretty much killed the romantic mood. But we all had a great time, and although its a romantic setting there were plenty of other groups (not just dates) there besides us. Meaning I didn't feel out of place at all to be with my parents and younger sister. And the fondue was great too, I enjoyed the cheese fondue more than the stuff I've had at the Melting Pot. I would highly recommend Geja's for a date spot, or a great place to meet up with old friends or family! If you've never been you've at least got to try it once!
