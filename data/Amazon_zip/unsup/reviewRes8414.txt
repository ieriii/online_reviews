Use this review as a proxy for all the Brazilian steakhouses. All are chains. All have some type of creepy house cocktail that you shouldn't order. All stuff you full of every cut of chicken, pork, and steak. A few guidelines for enjoying your Fogo experience. 1. The salad bar is a tool not a destination. Graze on it sparingly between gaucho visits. The cowboy chef waiters occasionally have to go back and reload their skewers. Do not by any means be thrown off the trail and make the salad your meal no matter how good the fresh mozzarella balls are! 1. Don't be afraid to shut down the crap. I know it feels bad to deny the top sirloin guy, but give him the red card anyways. Make the fillet guy your best friend. Caveat: Parmesan crusted pork tenderloin is delicious. 2. Try not to resort to primal urges. You will way over eat and send yourself into a food coma death spiral, thus killing any hope of going out after dinner. 3. Leave the girl at home. This is a good place for a guys night out or a corporate function. Chances are your lady friend does not want to witness the carnage that is all-you-can-eat steak night.
