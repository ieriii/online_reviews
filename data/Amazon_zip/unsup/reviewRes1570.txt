I love Hot Doug. I think hot dogs are gross ( I found a bone in an Oscar Mayer once) but I still love this place. One of my friends used to work for Doug and I know for a fact that he treats his employees really well, so I completely support his establishment--even if I do stick to the meatless dogs (which are, for real, the best around). I'd love to see him back over in his old hood, though. His place was such a nice fit.
