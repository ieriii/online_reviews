Wow, wow, this place is incredible! We ordered empanada combo, mariscos al carbon and arepa rellana for appetizers. The grilled calamari, baby octopus and shrimps were so good, empanadas were just okay, but the dipping sauce was very good! The steak was just beyond description, so tender, juicy and my mouth is actually watering again! As a side, the sweet plantains are definitely my favorite, I wish they replace the potatos with all plantains. Next time when I visit las tablas, I'll try to come in the evening for its live music performance. FYI, go downstairs and check out their bathroom.
