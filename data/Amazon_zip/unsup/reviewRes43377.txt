If you have not been, I insist you go this weekend. The menu is not overwhelming and their items could satisfy any appetite. I live in Lincoln Park and find myself making the trek over to Wicker Park to eat at this gem. I like everything about this place (except maybe the line on weekends) And honestly if a breakfast/brunch place is not crowded on a weekend morning, how good can it actually be. Please go and try the Huevos Rancheros. Actually try whatever, but just go you won't regret it.
