Hey, this was pretty good, and almost worth the huge wait. Apparently there's this "celebrity chef" who owns a bunch of Mexican-ish restaurants in Chicago and elsewhere. Personally, I'd never seen or heard of him until I bought a jar of salsa with his face on in Whole Foods. I still don't think I'd recognize him, even if he'd served me himself, so the celebrity factor didn't influence my decision to come here -- it was entirely my co-worker's suggestion. I arrive at XOCO to join the end of a 30ish person line, and have no idea how the place works. The beauty of being at the end of a long line is that you get to learn the system by watching everyone else: the down-side being that the first 20 minutes of your lunch break are spent queuing. The wait is made slightly more pleasant by the wonderful smells, and the ability to order drinks while you stand in line -- I had a bottle of IPA. At the front of the line, you order (including drinks and dessert), and pay for your meal. Then, and only then, do you get seated. Another 10 minutes later, the food arrived. We shared the Ahogada (carnitas) and Pepito (short rib) tortas (sandwiches). The Ahogada was served upended in a bowl of spicy tomato soup, and was my favorite of the two. An Aztecan hot chocolate was beautifully creamy and spicy, and a good accompaniment, especially in the winter. For dessert, the churros were also fantastic. $20, all-in, for a large sandwich, a couple of drinks, and a split dessert. Not cheap, but reasonable for an excellent lunch. The queuing detracts somewhat, so if I visit again I'll try to go outside peak hours.
