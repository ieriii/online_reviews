Old Szechuan is one of the best Chinese restaurants in Chicago. Yes, it's in Chinatown and doesn't have the best decor, but it's authentic, reasonably priced, and delicious! I have been a loyal patron for 8 years and I keep coming back. This restaurant is recommended by a Chinese professor from the University of Chicago and my Chinese parents.Both the hot pot and the regular menu items are great. This is what we usually order:Chef's Special Sizzling Rice Ginger PorkGarlic SpinachDry chili chicken (Don't eat the chili peppers)Salt and Pepper SquidMaPo Tofu (Spicy!!)(I may not have gotten the names exactly right)The saltiness of the garlic spinach goes great with the Sizzling Rice dish. They also serve deep fried mantou - YUM!A note about how to line up at this restaurant. You need to go into the restaurant, get the attention of one of the servers to let him/her know how many are in your party, and get a ticket. It's a bit chaotic so I would suggest just having one from your party get the ticket, and then wait inside until they ask what number is next.
