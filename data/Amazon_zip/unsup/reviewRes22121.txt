I have been visiting Superdawg for 10 years and recently it has been a somewhat over priced bad customer service experience. I have had a hair in my french fries. they acted as if they did not want to work. This is a younger group of ladies that were working so they took a job that they probably didn't want and that is just how they acted. The pop did not taste like pop & it took a while for them to get my order. I guess once the older people left it went down hill. I still left a tip even though after finding a hair in my food I shouldn't have.
