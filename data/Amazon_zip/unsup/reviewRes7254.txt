It's shocking to me that I still haven't reviewed this place, so let me correct that! We stumbled onto Sapori Trattoria over a year ago (thanks to yelp!) when we were searching for some Italian food, who knew that it would turn into a near-obsession. It goes without saying that the food is incredible. It's the type of restaurant where you want to try everything (and everything will be fantastic), but you will quickly find your favorite and stick to it. For me it's the spaghetti with veal meatballs and sausage, others are big fans of the lasagna. Just don't eat all the delicious bread before your meal comes, as it's tough enough to finish an entree here on it's own. What I really enjoy about Sapori Trattoria though is the quirkiness of the chef. I regularly get coupons in the mail with extremely long, hand written letters/stories spanning the envelope and enclosed documents from him. It's utterly bizarre but also completely awesome. I can't recommend this place enough. Yum!
