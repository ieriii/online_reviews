potato croqueettes----can i just say the best ball of fried goodness ive ever had? it was light, just enough crunch, and came with this great dipping sauce. also ordered the mussels because im in love with seafood. it was great because they had bacon bits in it and it was cooked in this awesome broth---it was sweet & strong and soo good to dip bread into. We also ordered chicken kebabs---but by this point I was so full I couldnt eat that much. the kebabs were allright,& the white dipping sauce wasnt your traditional white sauce. It tasted more like sour cream & it wasnt too heavy, another point of awesomeness. the cheese & meats were pretty stellar, the meat was so fresh and not greasy. this place is a win win win.
