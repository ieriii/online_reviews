Last night I had dinner at the Publican and it couldn't have been any better. The food was delicious! My two particular favorites were the steak tartar and the Potee. Everything was made to order, and for the table to share- which is personally my favorite way to dine. Our dishes were served perfectly paced and our service was great. I also loved the setup of communal tables even though we were seated in an enclosed booth which I thought fun.  Overall- a wonderful experience that I will be back again and again to enjoy.
