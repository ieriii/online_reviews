I'd call this hotel a WINO (Westin in Name Only). Every Westin I've ever stayed in anywhere has been a clear cut above this poser, but it seems Starwood gets to call this a Westin because of the spectacular, unbeatable location. And that's the only reason to stay here: Location, the best in the city. Lobby and staff are okay. My issue was the shabby rooms, uninspired and needing renovation. While the bed is still "the bed" -- truly wonderful -- the rooms at this Westin feel like a mid-tier chain (Ramada, Holiday Inn). And beware, light sleepers: These rooms are loud. I vividly heard all hallway activity inside my room as if it were being piped in by speaker. As I feared, hallway noise (door slamming, in particular) jolted me awake three times, and I woke up feeling lousy. The TV doesn't have a channel guide, so you have to turn to each channel to see what's on. Like some other Yelpers, I too got locked out during my stay, trying to negotiate their 1990 door fixtures and locking system.  It's all about location in Chicago, and this one can't be beat. But sadly and surprisingly, Starwood has allowed this hotel to deteriorate. Even an average Westin at this location would be incredible -- I hope they pull it together because today, this hotel aspires to average.
