Based on other reviews I was expecting extremely slow service but we had great service at the lunch buffet-no wait at all at any point and friendly staff. I also felt it was reasonable at $15/pp since buffets include appetizers and dessert. A very large selection of vegetarian dishes, 3 desserts, tomato soup, etc. I was also expecting spectacular naan based on other reviews, but felt it was just as good as I've had elsewhere. Great atmosphere. Looking forward to going back.
