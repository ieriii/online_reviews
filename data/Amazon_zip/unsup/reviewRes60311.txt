I WOULD NOT RECCOMEND GOING HERE. I ordered a 9$ bottle of saki, waiter returned with a 22 dollar bottle saying they were 'sold out' Bit the bullet, bought the 22 dollar bottle and not but halfway into the drink i pour this out... goo.gl/n4imX A FLY in my sake bottle. Needless to say i was not pleased and i requested the bottle be taken off the bill. The owner refused and then called the police, who came and explained that there was a 'legal limit' to how unsanitary a place can be. A restaurant that serves raw fish with those sorts of insects=gross. The police forced the owner to give me another bottle for free (exactly what i wanted :/ ) Id say the service is shitty here and the sanitation is even worse.
