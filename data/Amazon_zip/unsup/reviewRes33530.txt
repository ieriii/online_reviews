Service = amazing. Calamari = one of the best calamaris I've had Caprese = SOO GOOD and thick Lobster pasta = DELISH Pesto pasta = not worth the price but still pretty good. Nothing too special. Tirimisu = soft and rich. Would definitely go back. I also love the inside; It's a little small, but it gives the place character.
