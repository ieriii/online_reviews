I was in Chicago on business and one of my Chicagoan friends/co-workers was adamant that we try this gastropub. I valued his opinion before this suggestion and have since promoted him to infallible.  The three of us sampled a little bit of nearly every savory item on the menu and they all impressed. I'm struggling to recall them all but some highlights include a duck spread with baby pickles, chicken foie gras (slam dunk), the cold leek soup (very refreshing), Kobe meatballs (the least impressive, still great but I like my meatballs tender and made in the peasant style they originated in, 40% bread, 60% meat), scallops over oxtail (one of the group rated this one of the top three things he's ever eaten, it was his entree so I didn't get to try it), braised veal breast (this was mine, I struggled to finish it because I was full but I refused to leave any behind), monkfish (also didn't get to sample but it looked great) and at least a couple dishes I can't recall.  The Manhattan was suburb as were the other beverages I "sampled", for you, dear reader. Our only gripe was that our server pushed back when we wanted to order in rounds, Spanish style. We wanted to taste a little of this, see what we think, order something new, etc.  We still would have ran up a killer bar tab, so let us order and eat at our own pace (they were very slow since we arrived at an odd hour on a Sunday and it didn't seem like an unreasonable request). We even had a fourth join us half-way through our meal which would have resulted in an even higher bar/food total if they would have accommodated us.  Anyways, this was a very memorable experience and only picky, unadventurous eaters should hesitate to venture in. Some of the ingredients may scare them a little bit but if you order the meal and get them to sample something they'll open up.
