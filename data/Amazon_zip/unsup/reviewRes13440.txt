At first, Glenn's would have been given a 5-star rating. They were always fairly busy and the food and service was spot on! Lately, they have gotten to big for their britches and it's all about shuffling as many people in and out as quick as possible. Ever since they were on the Food Network, it's been going downhill fast. They never used to take reservations and now they do. Bummer. For example, we stopped in at 5:00 PM on a Thursday night and were told the earliest they could seat us was 9:20! The place is SO packed it's ridiculously hard to hear each other at the table and carry on a conversation. Sitting outside is better, when it's available. The food is tremendous, I will give them that. the crab cakes are the best I've ever had and the clam chowder is to die for. Unfortunately, I think they forget the local folks in the neighborhood who have been there since the beginning. Now, we cannot even get a table unless we call weeks in advance. Thankfully, you can still call and grab take-out to eat at home.... quietly.
