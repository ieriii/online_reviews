My husband and I treated my future mother-in-law to dinner her just to check it out. What a great time! I basically grew up in the area of Spain represented at this restaurant--it was like I was back home! The food was great, the service was top of the line and the atmosphere was outstanding. We noticed that they had a private dining room so we began investigating holding the rehearsal dinner for our wedding here. We contacted the restaurant, made the reservation and picked our menu. Nothing was a disappointment! Even though our group of 15 has very different cuisine preferences, everyone enjoyed everything. We had two servers who made sure our glasses and plates were always full. It was amazing from beginning to end. Either of us will recommend this restaurant for drinks, dinner or private dining!
