The duck was amazing and inexpensive... the waitress and i believe owners daughter were super nice.. I would stick to ordering anything made with or from duck. The egg rolls and fried rice were very good as well, not the same for the mongolian beef it may have been the worst mongolian beef i have ever eaten. But who cares when the duck tastes this good
