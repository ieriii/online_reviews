This is a pretty good Korean BBQ joint. The way this place really distinguishes itself is by giving you an oddly large number of side dishes--we counted 25 bowls. It's a little intimidating, but really, what other restaurant, of any kind, brings you 25 (yes, twenty-five!) of anything with your meal--at no extra charge?! And to boot, you can get any of them refilled, as many times as you want, at no extra charge. The BBQ is good, too. We got marinated beef and pork, and yes, it's fun to cook your own meat at your table. Good tasting, too--that beef marinate is phenomenal. Drawbacks? Well, we didn't know what we were eating with all 25 sides; in fact, less than half were easily identifiable. The waitstaff is super nice, but they only speak Korean, so when we asked what something was (it was one of the ones we didn't like), we got an extra serving instead. And really, if you're not into wasting food, you might not like this place: You're not going to like all 25 sides, so you're going to end up leaving a bunch of food on the table to be thrown out. Lastly, the place could use some remodeling, maybe a paint job, maybe something to brighten it up, as it's all dark brown wood inside. But a good place for Korean BBQ. I recommend you go if you like different things, want an eating experience, and want some good food.
