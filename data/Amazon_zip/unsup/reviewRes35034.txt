I absolutely love Sushi Wabi so I came here with lower expectations even though I was recommended to come here by a coworker. The prices were a little bit cheaper than Sushi Wabi and the food was actually pretty good. It's a very small place which is why they do a lot of delivery service. The place was half-full when I walked in around 6pm on a Thursday night so it's definitely liked by many. The dragon roll was very good. The caterpillar roll is actually better at Sushi Wabi, but still good. Those rolls were not as big as Sushi Wabi's either, but since the price is a little different, I am not complaining. I plan on coming back. FYI: BYOB.
