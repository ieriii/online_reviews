Stopped in last night with friends for dinner. Romantic atmosphere, kind of dark but nice overall. In my opinion it is a little cramped. Tables too close together. Can make it a challenge getting to your table. Fondue is fun and a totally different dining experience. I do wish they offered a different cheese choice. The gruyere/swiss combination is a little strong. Good selection on main courses. Beef, chicken, shrimp, lobster, and scallops. Choose your combination and get to cooking. I have a shrimp allergy and they accommodated me by bringing fresh oil to the table so there was no chance of having a reaction from the previously used oil. Excellent selection of dipping sauces for your veg and meats. Service was outstanding. The waiter explained everything as each course came out. The dessert fondue was fabulous. Would be nice to have a white or dark chocolate alternative but not a deal breaker. The flambe they do on the chocolate so you can toast your marshmallows was so fun. All in all we had a great meal and a great time. It is a bit pricey but worth it for a special occasion or a nice night out with your significant other. Even be a fun stop for a glass of wine and just the dessert fondue at the end of the evening. Keep our eye out for coupons. Makes it much more affordable. Geja's is a place I will be going back to and would recommend it to people.
