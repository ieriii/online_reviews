Amazing, amazing, amazing! There is nothing left I can say about Pequod's that hasn't already been said by the other 1,100 reviewers. The caramelized crust, the pan blackened bottom, and the secret sauce are the 3 components that make this the best deep dish in Chicago. Seating can be tricky on a busy night and the pizza can take a while to come out at times but to me this is all just part of Pequod's personality and vibe. Pizza this delicious shouldn't be made too easy to get, so the long wait only adds to the appreciation of the magic. There are times where I wake up salivating from dreaming about the Pequod's tomato sauce and that blackened and buttery crust. If you haven't tried Pequod's yet, then do yourself a favor and go there immediately!
