I feel ya Carrie S I was confused as well by the old school exterior while the cakes in the window are works of art! The red velvet cupcakes were so moist and delightful. Delightful doesn't even completely describe them they were magically delicious! I was trying to do tasting to figure out what type of cake I wanted for my birthday and they were so nice and helpful. Still a bit pricey but I guess its worth it if you are paying for art!
