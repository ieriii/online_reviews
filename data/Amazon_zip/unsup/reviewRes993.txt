Hot Doug's. Best Hot Dogs ever without a doubt! Is there any other place you can get Foie Gras hot dogs? I think not! Found out about this fantastic hot dog place through Anthony Bourdain's No Reservations, so I marked Hot Doug's down on my must try list during the trip to Chicago last month. After getting to the place, we had to wait like 45 mins on a windy, freezing cold day. Once I had a bite of the hot dog, though, I completely forgot about the cold that I just endured. No Reservations? No complaints! Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel - To die for. There were four round slices of Foie Gras pate, creamy, silk and rich. Melted in my mouth. I regretted not ordering two after finishing my Foie Gras hot dog. Three-Chili Wild Boar Sausage with Chili-Garlic Mayonnaise, Raw Milk-Cheddar Cheese Spread and Crispy Fried Onions - Surprisingly delicious, with just a little kick to it. Crispy fried onions were thinly sliced on top, crispy and crunchy, along with the mild-cheddar cheese, it was a great combination. Antelope Sausage with Roasted Red Pepper-Roasted Garlic Mayonnaise and Hickory-Smoked Sweet Swiss Cheese - The red pepper was cooked perfectly, neither raw nor too soft, and it meshed well with the Garlic Mayonnaise. http://www.yelp.com/biz_ I wanted to try out all of their specialty sausages if I could. Please, someone tell me there's some place similar in San Francisco.
