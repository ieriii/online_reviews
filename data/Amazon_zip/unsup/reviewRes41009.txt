Stumbled in here a few years ago with a friend and have been coming back ever since. Definitely a restaurant where you just need to wade in to the menu (which is HUGE.) On many occasion, I've been in and had to split a table with other groups due to the crowd, but as long as you're game and fine with it, it's a fairly pleasant experience. As for the food. Well. Let's just say that every single time I've gone, I've been more than satisfied with the quality and freshness. Never had a bad meal here, although their tofu spring rolls have gotten less spicy as years have progressed. Still, this is my go-to Vietnamese restaurant when I want to take visitors out. The lime juice and the Vietnamese pancake are ALWAYS a must, and the portions are ridiculous. You will NOT go home hungry.
