I'm usually the type of person who thinks that places like this are completely overrated. This is NOT the case with Sunda. Sunda was the best meal I have had in a long time. I went with my parents, brother, and boyfriend on a Saturday night. We had a pretty early reservation for 6:30 PM and they definitely don't screw around with their on-time policy. If your entire party is not there within 15 minutes, they give away your table. No questions asked. We were seated at the bar, and while initially annoyed, it turned out to be a great experience. Why?The bartender (who is supposedly a reality tv star) was SO nice and took charge of ordering for our table asking us only what we definitely would NOT eat. The best dishes included: spicy tuna roll and the brussel sprout salad (who would think!?), The drinks were chic and delicious as well.I would highly, highly recommend Sunda to anyone looking for a hip, cool, not overrated place to spend some time.
