Xoco was the first place I went to when I stepped off the plane last week. This was my fourth time in Chicago this year and I got an earful from my mother each time I'd go home Rick Bayless-less. Well, i guess there is no pleasing my mom - she was insanely jealous that I got to eat his food before she did!  And it was delicious! I met up with a friend for a late lunch (around 2pm) and the line was out the door! This wasn't an issue for us as we used the time to catch up and to mull over our lunch options. We each ordered a torta, I the Ahogada and she the Pepito. We shared a basket of chips with salsa and guacamole and I had an Aztec hot chocolate. The ahogada was set in an amazing spicy tomato broth...the broth also proved very practical - it moistened the bread just enough to where I was able to fit the sandwich in my mouth. I did not try my friend's pepito but she seemed to really enjoy it. The chips came with two types of salsa, both of which were excellent (and much better than anything Rick has out the shelf of your local grocer). The guac was good as well, but nothing special. I've seen one or two people on here that didn't care for the Aztec coffee...I thought it was fantastic! It had the perfect amount of spice to cut through the sweetness of the chocolate. One thing I really liked about this place was that once you go through the line for your initial order (which took us about 40 minutes), anytime you want to add something to your order, you can cut straight to the counter. This is especially advantageous if you want to order their churros with soft serve ice cream. Overall, a great place for lunch if you've got the time to wait. I'd def come back.
