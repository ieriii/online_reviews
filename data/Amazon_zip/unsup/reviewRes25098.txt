I LOVE this place. But where can I start to describe? The place. It is always bustling, but the place is big and spacey enough not to be crowded. I like sitting in their second floor because you can look down and see everyone, but you also get some privacy with the people you came with. The waiters are always really friendly and quick! The food. Whether it is their fries, soup, sandwiches, pies, or dessert, it is always amazing. Try their spinach pies and their baklava! Not to mention their hazelnut praline, strawberry shortcake, or basically any of their cakes! Furthermore, it is open pretty late especially on weekends which give you a classy option to dine in Greektown with friends!
