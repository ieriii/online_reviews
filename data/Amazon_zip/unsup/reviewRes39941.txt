Hipsters unite at this "look at us, we're unimposing" Logan Square public house/gastropub. It's off the beaten path - at least for me, but was fun to try. In all honesty, all we ordered was beer and a burger - but it was one of the better specimens I've had in ages. Very enjoyable. The extensive whiskey list at $3 a shot is a refreshing spin on the usual - and will be sure to bring us back.
