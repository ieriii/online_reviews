The place is small and has communal tables. We didnt have to wait. My bf ordered the buddha bowl and I ordered the chicken bowl. His was ok but mine was way too sugary. We replaced the white to brown rice and that was great but when they poured the sugary sauce in my chicken bowl, I just couldnt eat it. I guess there are other things that are fine to order at this place like the wings and burrito but I will not be back. I like Korean food but this place is just fast food quality so dont expect good korean quality food. If you like cheap fast food and are not picky with food then this is your place. If you are picky and are even semi healthy then go past it.
