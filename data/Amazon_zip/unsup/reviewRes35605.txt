Thanks to Chicago yelpers, we were here for lunch last week. We were seated right away at 11:50 AM. We had the stone crab as an appetizer with that great mustard-mayo dip.The crab was fresh and sweet. We had a cup of Boston clam chowder that was tasty. We had the fisherman's platter that includes haddock,calamari, shrimp and french fries and coleslaw. This platter was very generous. We finished off with the key lime pie. Our waiter was Phillip who kept refilling our water glasses. It was a nice lunch.
