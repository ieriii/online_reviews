The gourmet burger thing is being done to death these days but this is the one place that you need to go to.  The prices are very resonable and every once in a while they change the burgers up slightly. I love that I have srveral options on how to change up my fries, I do love to trufflize them but some days my fries feel like being covered in old bay or garlic. They have a great beer menu to make my husband happy but I always order the persnickity lemon- a lemondrop with frambroise-delightfuly girly and delish!
