Well I went with my girlfriends(Korean) and it was O.K. the very next week I went with my Guy friend(Not Korean) and Not only did we NOT get seated,but they let 2 Other Non Black groups that came in after us get seated promptly.Of Course I asked questions,but the lady was just like"Oh,I did not see you waiting?" REALLY we are both tall and Black and standing in the middle of the restaurant watching everyone eat...Oh well..
