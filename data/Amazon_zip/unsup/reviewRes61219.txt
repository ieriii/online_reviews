I have to say, I think Gino's East does live up to the hype. Despite the fact that it is clearly excessively indulgent, the pizza is just really good. What is not to like? The crust is super buttery and the pizza is loaded with cheese. In addition to the pizza we had a caesar salad which I thought was just fair, but when I return I won't be going back for the salad, I will be going for that deep dish pizza-maybe in about 4-5 months.
