I'm sorry but I think I have a god-given right to judge a bakery by their cupcakes when they have them in the cases and are charging people for them. And I have to say that the cupcakes at Alliance are consistently dry and awful. Wait, scratch that. The 25 cent, two-day old Easter cupcakes I got there were EXCELLENT. My roommate got a freshly-made red velvet cupcake that tasted like chalk but my old chocolate cupcake with a big plastic bunny on it was moist and delicious. I also have had coffee that was so badly burnt that I had to throw it away. The only reason I give Alliance three stars instead of two is because their lemon bars make me feel warm and snuggly inside. Mmmmmmmm.
