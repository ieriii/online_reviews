this is about tea. i'm a rather experienced patron of the high tea experience...been playing the game for a while. it's good here. i've done two bridal showers here and both turned out perfect. here is the trick: call the Palm Court and ask them when they recommend you take your tea. there are definite good and bad times to experience your quest for civility. you'll want to avoid the crowd of people who show up to the city once a year on a saturday and heard this was something they should do.
