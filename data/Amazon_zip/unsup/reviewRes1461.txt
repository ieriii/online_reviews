Must Order: Duck sausage w/ foie gras, Bacon sausage w/ carmelized onions & brie, Duck Fat Fries! There was already a long line wrapping around the building so we knew we were in the right place! As we got moved up in the line and ended up inside we were in awe over the menu. There were tons to choose from and we had a hard time deciding! We also see fries fried in... duck fat! Oh we definitely wanted those! But turns out it was only served on the weekends and we were there on a weekday and were flying to Maryland the next day! When we finally got over the disappointment of missing duck fat fries, we distracted ourselves with trying to select which of the many hot dog options we were going to have. Since we knew that it may be a long time before we would be back there, we ordered not one, not two but FOUR hot dogs. We got up to the counter to order and spent a few minutes complimenting the guy that owns the place (I wanted to take a picture with him!) then ordered our hot dogs. We had the bacon sausage with carmelized onions and brie, the duck sausage with foie gras, the bratwurst with carmelized onions and the classic Chicago dog. Of course none of them (except the Chicago dog, since I didn't want that one anyway) had any mayo or aioli sauces on it. On the side for my boyfriend. Our dogs arrived and we took turns biting into each of the hot dogs. The duck sausage with foie gras was delicious! You really taste the duck flavor and it's not too terribly overpowered by the foie gras. The bacon sausage with the brie was also delicious but quite heavy! You can almost feel your arteries closing and think "well... if I die now, I'll die with a belly full of bacon sausage & brie and I'm OK with that". The bratwurst was probably the least action packed of the three but definitely had flavor. I can't say anything about the classic Chicago because I didn't have that one but I think my boyfriend liked it quite a bit.
