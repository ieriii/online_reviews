It is said celebrities sometimes hang out here. Oh? First impression: Very friendly hostess and waitress. No attitude and pretense. Second Take: Pear sake was fabulous. Third Encounter: Lots of options on the menu. Truffled tataki tuna sashimi was delicious. The two-piece, melt-in-my-mouth white tuna sushi was a nice treat. Longevity noodles were tasty but you can totally make them yourself. Final Glance: Spacious, sexy and suffused with romantic dim lighting, Sunda is definitely a good date night spot. No celebrities needed to enjoy a good meal. Recommended.
