This restaurant has been upgraded to my favorite sushi restaurant. I have been a couple time previously and really enjoyed there food, but this time I tried a lot more menu items and was really really impressed! I came here with a group of friends on a Saturday night and we were there until closing. We had an excellent time, drinking our wine, and enjoying the fabulous food. What makes this place different than most sushi restaurants is the fabulous hot and cold appetizers. I would say you could skip on the rolls and just enjoy the appetizers. You MUST try the following: Yellow Tail Ceviche: has jalapeno in it and it is yum yum. Red Snapper in truffle oil: almost as good as the yellow tail dish. Tuna Guacamole dip: tuna and guacamole...need I say more! Crab meat wanton: Who doesn't like crab rangoon? Now take crab rangoon and dip it into a much better sauce! This is perfection. As far as the rolls go... my favorite is the Emerald!
