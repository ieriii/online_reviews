Sunday night we had dinner at Wildfire. I was surprised at how the staff always try to get their customers to hurry up and finish. The picked up the bread too fast and we had to ask for more bread. Hurry Hurry Hurry ! for the check payment. Trying to pick up dishes before we're done eating. Usually wildfire is a little more laid back, but tonight it was a little pushy. Coffee latte was great, brocholi could have been better, were not cooked enough (too hard), mushrooms were great. Too pushy on desert. Not enough gravy on the turkey dinner, and mashed potatoes were sloshy. There is room for improvement here. The downtown restaurants need work.
