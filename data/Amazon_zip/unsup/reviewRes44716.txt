Stuffed pizza: my god. Should have dipped it in gold to celebrate. I imagine it happened like this: Some bumbling minimum wage student made a pizza in the wrong order, and a young turk known only as Giordano said "Fuck it, we got a pizza!" I haven't had a pizza since. Granted, it's only been about a week since I tried Giordano's. Extra invisible points for allowing me the opportunity to witness the highly stressed, possibly single mother screaming at her kids like they were her ex-husband. I didn't know we paid for dinner AND a show...
