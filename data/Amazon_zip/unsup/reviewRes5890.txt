Wow. Let me get straight to the good stuff: You must try the ricotta with honeycomb. A very generous amount of sweet house-made ricotta cheese in a small mason jar and a piece of honeycomb on the side, for smearing on crusty bread. I don't even like ricotta, and I loved it. It was such a generous amount we had to ask several more times for bread to finish it off. You also must try the polenta. I've never had polenta served like grits on a wooden board before. It was creamy, cheesy, smoky ... if my tongue could have cried from happiness, it would have! We were there for lunch, so I also got a panini. I can't remember what was on it but it was fantastic. Only thing I would skip is the meat and cheese plate - a bit pricey for the quantity (or lack thereof). In any case, this is exactly the kind of place you want to be eating Italian food in: romantic in a corny way, striving to be rustic, a wall o'wine ... all that was missing was the old man playing an accordion in the corner and two dogs eating spaghetti.
