This is one of the only restaurants I've ever gone to with people, where I was actually embarrassed to have taken them there afterwards. The service was that bad. It was me, a white American, two of my Chinese friends, and two of their Polish friends. We all spoke perfectly understandable English. When we arrived, it was a little late, but they were still posted to be open for another hour. There were plenty of empty tables and yet the hostess looked put-upon when I asked for a table as opposed to sitting at the bar. I'm pretty familiar with tapas and Spanish food in general, but not an expert by any means. So we had a few questions about the meal. The server had a difficult time answering our questions and had to go to the kitchen to get some of the answers - and they weren't complicated, esoteric questions. The dishes came out in odd orders, and some of them were cold. I thought the scallops were poor quality - they were flat and tired looking - I actually think they may have been skate, not an acceptable substitution at a restaurant that charges this much. Which brings me to another thing - pricing. It's a nice enough space, but their pricing is overboard. Flavors were mixed - some plates were awesome, others were watery and missed the ball. Neither food nor service were really up to the level needed at their price point. I'd like to try it again sometime - but on my own, so as not to risk embarrassment again - to see if they really can step up to the task.
