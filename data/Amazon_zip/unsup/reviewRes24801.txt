Took my boyfriend here back in Jan for his birthday, I made dinner reservations a few weeks before. I didn't care for where we were seated, up in a little area but shoved in a corner. The lamp was so low he hit his head twice on it, mind you he isn't the tallest in the land, nor am I. One would think making reservations a few weeks before would put you in a better spot but hey... whatever. I have done fondue before (not here) but he hadn't. Overall it was a fun experience. The cheese course was.... ok. Something about it I didn't really care for. Meat and dessert were great though. The overall atmosphere was nice but sitting a foot away from the next table kinda killed the romance for us. The server was really nice, very attentive and polite. I probably wont go back due to that cheese course and the fact that there is no choosing anything.
