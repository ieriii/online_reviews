I loved this place and will definitely be back for more! I had the casado....juicy, rib-eye steak with rice mixed with black beans and sweet, fried plantains on the side. Delicious and huge! I'm glad that I have leftovers that will last me the next couple of days. I also had the oatmeal shake, which had a good taste, but it was a bit watery (I like how Tiztal Cafe makes theirs). I loved, loved, loved the ceviche....soury fish goodness! The restaurant was too full to accommodate our group of 7, so we sat out on the patio instead. Yes, the weather was in the 40s, but it actually wasn't that bad in there. The patio was enclosed with tarp and there was a large heating device in the middle, so that helped a lot. Service was also great!
