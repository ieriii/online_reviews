Wow was this Frontera Grill? We got seated before our reservation time...this was the emptiest i'd ever seen FG. We got everything we usually get plus more, but it was either decent or just not good. The appetizer sampler for two is always a good safe start, but the chervice was very chewy like it had been marinating in lemon juice for a week. The duck appetizer was VERY game, I love duck, but this was awful. The plantains (normally my favorite) were very perfumy tasting- idk never had them taste that way before. Thank god this wasn't our first trip in or I wouldn't go back
