LOVE Nana. So far, I've had opportunity to come here for breakfast with a girlfriend, and dinner with my hubby. Both were memorable experiences. the food is good. I tend to measure restaurants against my all time fave (who I won't mention here). And while this misses the mark on some spots, it certainly is the best, by FAR, that I have had on the south side. Breakfast is original and organic. And unbeatable, unless you are in the mood for sugar, grease and pancakes.  Dinner was a bit slow in coming, but tasty. The options all sounded so good we had trouble picking two we wanted to try. Desert was amazing.  Overall, I was happy to find such a trendy, well-appointed and NICE place to have dinner.  There is definitely a shortage of Nana-like places on the south-side, and we will for sure be back. With friends!! Parking is easy (rockstar--like right outside!!), service friendly and sincere, and food quality top notch. Can't wait to go back.
