Great skirt steak. Everything else is just slightly above average. I went on a weekend and there was a long wait. Once our table was ready, we were brought back through the very crowded restaurant to our table. There were just too many tables for the restaurant. This meant that you were basically sitting on top of everyone else. It also meant that the poor employees had very little room to move around. The restaurant allows you to bring your own bottles of wine which is a good thing. As for food, I ordered the skirt steak, which was the best I'd ever tried. The skirt steak meal itself is reasonable in price, but for just $1 more, you can add another type of meat. I tried chicken and felt that the chicken was dry and paled in comparison to the steak. Each meal was served with a few veggies and bananas. They were good, not great. They also provide two types of sauces to use. They were fairly good. The food is good and I would recommend you try it if you are looking for excellent skirt steak. You have to put up with some less than desirable things, but you will be thankful you did once you try the skirt steak.
