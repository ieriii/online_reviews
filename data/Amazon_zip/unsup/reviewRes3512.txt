Crisp = awesome. Their fries are amazing. The chicken is insanely good - I prefer the wings to the half chickens - as they are enormous and meaty. My friends and I refer to them as pterodactyl wings. The Buddha bowls are great and can make you feel like you're eating something kind of good for you without sacrificing the fried chicken glory that is Crisp. I love the Seoul Sassy sauce and the Spicy is kick ass without being too hot. The Seoul Steak Bowl is another delicious treat - make sure you get it with the Atomic Sauce on the side for an extra kick of spice and smooth texture to compliment the beef. I've ordered from this place for both delivery and pickup and have had some issues with missing or incorrect items so be on the lookout! I still say the best way to enjoy Crisp is to actually eat in with a few tall boys, douse yourself in grease, and call it a day. Keep it classy, ya'll.
