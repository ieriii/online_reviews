Do you love paying for pretension and bland food? well have I got a place for you! After hearing rave reviews and how friendly the staff and wonderful the food was I was underwhelmed. Admittedly we sat at the bar and ordered a bottle of wine with a couple of first courses, however, considering the place wasn't full and they were fully staffed AND it was the night before Christmas Eve - well what can I say- the staff seemed bored the former reality star chef refused to come out of the kitchen - apparently he was extremely busy to step out for 2 mins - but whatever...the food was bland and unmemorable - how on earth can you do that to Foie Gras? Well Chicago you're my home town but this sad attempt at being NYC is not working - Greek Town, Little Italy I will never forsake you again. Sprout you are not Charlie Trotters, Inn at Little Washington or French Laundry. Maybe a nice injection of Chicago friendliness would make a difference and please don't be afraid to season the food.
