I think if you are in town and staying in the Loop, you should have at least have one dinner at Giordano's....specifically the stuffed pizza with your own toppings on it. I had the Personal Cheese Stuffed with pineapple and Canadian bacon. The service was not overly amazing and we had to get the attention of the front desk that no one had waited on us for near 10 minutes after we sat down (it was the lunch hour) I was also bothered that the wait staff brought out water, then proceeded to simply leave the water at our table to serve ourselves....and the tap beers were like sampler size...super small. The server? I don't think she cared one way or another about much....kind of impersonal. The stuffed pizzas take about 35 minutes to make, and they are good to let you know in advance of this, in case you can't wait that long to eat. What you get for waiting...a really good pie with sweet, fresh tasting sauce, thick cheese, and a great doughy crust that is light and flavorful. I'd maybe go back, but would not expect an amazing customer service experience. Luckily for Giordano's, the pizza tastes good.
