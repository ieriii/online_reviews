My wife and I are giving up meat for Lent -- so naturally, we went to The Purple Pig to celebrate Fat Tuesday. What a great meal, and inexpensive as well! Our first course was an antipasti -- clams with short-grain rice and basil. This was followed by fried pig's ear, pork liver pat, and cured tongue. We finished the night with grilled cheese of the day (bleu and goat) and the most tender/tasty pork shoulder we've ever dreamt about. From the excellent service and recommendations from the waiters/waitresses, beautiful bottle of wine and comfortable ambiance -- I could not have been more happy. You need to go now. What are you waiting for? Oh yeah, tab wise, as they would say on Check Please, dinner without drinks was ~$25-30 per person (six courses!).
