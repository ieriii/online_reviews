Coming from the Bay Area, I needed my Pho fix quick when I moved here 3 years ago. And Simply It, simply fixed my Vietnamese cravings! Not to mention, Tuan the owner is amazing - talk about dynamic leader! I recommend: Grilled Lemongrass Pork Chops Grilled Lemongrass Beef (pre-made) Sate Shrimp Beef Pho FYI I've only ordered deliver and tried both lunch and dinner entrees, I can't imagine how the service and food is in-person...
