A real taste of Mexican cuisine. Both the drinks and the meal were artfully presented, and, despite the long line of eager breakfasters, promptly delivered to the table. If you go here, you absolutely have to order some variation of the hot chocolate. It is thick and luscious with innumerable spices that blend to create an experience like no other. Be aware that the portion sizes are fairly small--a fact that I appreciate as I am not all that hungry in the morning. Sidewalk dining is the way to go, with excellent accommodations for such a small space.
