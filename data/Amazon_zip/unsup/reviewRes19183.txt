Finally! a restaurant that looks like it will last on this corner!! we have seen restaurant after restaurant/bar attempt this corner! It is kind of dark but I think it adds a different ambience. Their beer is extensive!! and reasonable. I had the Texan which was awesome! and my husband had a burger that had a fried egg on it. He loved his burger as well. We definitely will be returning! We love Kumas and Red Robin (2 burger joints) and while it does not hold a candle to Kumas......for the price and location it is a definite A PEOPLE.....you know who you are.........ITS A BAR, A BURGER JOINT, we are not here rating for the New York times. its food....relax!
