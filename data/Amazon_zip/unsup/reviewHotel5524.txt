I have to admit, I groaned when my Hotwire hotel was revealed. I have never stayed at La Quinta property, but somehow made the assumptions that all La Quinta's are "crappy". I'm happy to say, I was proven wrong! My husband and I had truly enjoyed our stay. We stayed 4 nights during October 2011. *King Bed Suite: The rooms are clean, spacious and modern. I think this property may have had an update because the paint, furniture and dcor were in great condition. Our had room many electrical outlets, sofa, flat screen, microwave and mini refrigerator. Average size bathrooms with shower and tub. *Service/Hotel Amenities: The staff was friendly and helpful. No bellhop. Free wifi and breakfast daily. Parking available, but it's $36 a night :/ There is Cupcake shop and Argo Tea Shop in the lobby. *Location: Great location. The hotel is located in the heart of downtown, so there's pros and cons to its location. (The cons were very minimal) -Pros: Walking distance to El train, shops, drug stores and restaurants. 2 blocks away from Sears Tower! -Cons: Business close early. The scene is "dead" during evenings and weekends. Not many bars in the area. *Random Tips: -Giordanos' Pizza: 4 blocks away from the hotel. The lobby has Giordano's coupons. -Car Rental: isn't needed to explore Chicago, but if you do rent, there's an Enterprise located in the hotel parking structure. If you do a day rental, you can avoid the daily parking fee, by returning to car to Enterprise, since they are located in the same structure. -Take a Drive to Wisconsin: As a huge cheese lover, I was over the top giddy when I found out Wisconsin was only an hour away. We rented a car for a day and drove to explore Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The highway from Chicago to Milwaukee has many cheese themed shops and a shopping outlet with 5% sales tax! -Pet Friendly: Throughout my stay I saw a few people checking in with their pets.
