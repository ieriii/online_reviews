Fortunately, when I came here I didn't have to wait too long in line. I decided to order the Italian sausage special along with small fries and a small fountain drink, which came out to be a flat $10. I enjoyed the uniqueness of the sausage with the chopped up feta cheese and tomatoes. I'll have to come back and try out their other specials.
