When you wake up constantly thinking of Prince of Winter and Nanadicts with Soyrizo, it's time to YelpIt! I loveeeeee brunch spots and happened across this one doing an intense search for a Saturday spot for me and my gfs. I decided, let's take a chance. The menu has something for everyone. We arrive and its a slight wait. So what does any logical person do while waiting to be seated?! Order a Drink. We read the menu (nice mix of the not so norms) and I opted for the Prince of Winter. He made this drink with SUCH TLC, down to the 'roasted' Rosemary garnish. It was splendid. When we were seated, my favorite waiter (to date), Becky patiently walked our entire group through the menu. Talk about service with a smile. She suggested the Nanadict, but because I did not eat pork she recommended the Soyrizo. She said even meat eaters LOVEEEEE this. So I said okay.. let me try it. Can you say a little slice of heaven? OH goodness. I made a happy plate. Let's add on to my happiness. She suggested the sangria (that she made) and it was just as wonderful. Let's extend the service thing - even the people preparing our food took the time to ask us how was everything. I mean I had not one SINGLE complaint! The service, food, and drinks were excellent. The bonus was that it was reasonably priced! I'll be back - and looking for Omar and Becky!
