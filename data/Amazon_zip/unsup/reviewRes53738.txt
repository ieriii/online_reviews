This is my favorite restaurant in Chicago. Why? Because it kicks ass. Let me elaborate:They don't try to do a lot of things. They focus on encased meats and then get wildly creative within that area. They serve a veritable Noah's Ark of animals throughout the year. I have eaten delicious animals from all over the world, wonderfully seasoned and served with surprisingly perfect appropriate toppings. I would never have thought to combine cherries, elk, and blue cheese but I am damn glad that Hot Doug's did.Other things to consider: 1) they have an inexpensive, amazing dog that used to be named the Shawon Dunston (now the Dave Kingman). Solid good eating for under $5. 2) Best corn dogs ever.3) Best fries in town. And I'm not even talking about the duck-fat fries (which are incendiary and inspiring like the true form of Zeus which burned poor Semele).4) The ginger beer they have in the cooler is also kick-ass and a perfect compliment.5) They sometimes have the Gyros-dog. It is everything you dream it could be.
