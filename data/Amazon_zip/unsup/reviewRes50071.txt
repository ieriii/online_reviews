I went here for dinner on a Friday night and I was pleasantly surprised that we did not have to wait for a table. The place was open and casual, with big wooden tables. The service was pretty good and the atmosphere was quite loud. However, it wasn't so loud that you couldn't carry on a conversation. I ordered a steak entree. The entrees are huge... my slab 'o beef was quite large, although it was the smaller portion. It also came with a baked potato, yuca, and a plantain. Everything came out very simple, nothing fancy at all. (Nothing was cut up, it was just sitting on the platter in a big chunk.) Maybe that is how it is in Colombia? The steak was pretty tender, but a little on the salty side. Overall, the food was decent. The prices were fair--entrees were around $15-20. And they do have a full bar on hand but you also have the option of bringing your own bottle for an $8 corking fee. I would go back if someone else wanted to go, but I probably would try other restaurants first if it was my choice.
