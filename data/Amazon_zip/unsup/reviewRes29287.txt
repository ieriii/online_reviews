BONKERS! Best meal I ever had outside of my Ma's kitchen. So much care goes into ingredients, presentation..just freshness and GAH! It's orgasmic!!!! Got the Titanic Burger, minus the "bacon". I'm seriously big on burgers and so I was blown away by the notion that the best burger I ever had was meat-free: Stellar and satisfying in every conceivable way. Opted out of the sweet potato fries for their seriously-fresh slaw. Lingered on the patio sippin' some tasty lemonade-iced tea with friends. There was no rushing to turn over tables and our waiter was spot on with service and personality. Weather was perfect, the walk was great...just a killer evening. I plan on returning and actin' a foo up in this veggie goodness. *Note: No cocktails permitted on the patio.
