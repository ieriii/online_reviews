My advice to you - don't wear opened toed shoes to Glenn's. Ever. The seafood...dynamite. The drain in the bathroom with the sharp edges that sticks up about two inches from the ground and as Bryan Adams would say "cuts like a knife?" Well that part of my experience was far less than satisfactory. When stepping up to the sink to wash my hands, I sliced my foot open and was left bleeding profusely on the bathroom floor. With nothing but paper towels and water, I attempted to clean up the floor and my injury as best I could and made my way back to my table with a make shift paper towel cast and wells of tears in my eyes.  To make a long story short, the food was good but I can't even review it because it was completely overshadowed by the consequences of having a death trap in the bathroom. I would be surprised if I was the only person to injure themselves whether it be a stubbed toe, or even just an embarrassing trip. My server came over and apologized but I have to say, after the amount of embarrassment I experienced on the porch as I attempted to control the bleeding while other diners were eating just feet away most likely disgusted, I guess I thought Glenn's would be kind enough to comp our drinks or offer a discount for the inconvenience. That's not typically my style...but in this case, I was mortified. We were five seconds from leaving because we felt so bad that people had to observe some girl tending to her bleeding foot - in a word, appetizing. They should have been happy we even stayed and spent any money at all. I wish I could say when I think of Glenn's I start salivating over the salmon dinner I ate. Instead...my foot hurts at the memory.
