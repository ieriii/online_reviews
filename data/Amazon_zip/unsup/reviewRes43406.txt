I'm not that into deep dish, but if that's all that existed as pizza in Chicago, I would only get it from Art of Pizza. I'd consider myself a pizza aficionado, nay, connoisseur so trust me on this. Friendly, cheap, fast, calorific. What more do you want? Just don't try and order delivery on any major sporting event day. Terrible street parking if you can't get a space in the tiny lot. Plenty of dining in space, but the atmosphere is a cleaner Sbarro.
