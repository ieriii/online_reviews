Beer was good. Food wasn't bad for the price. Had the chicken sandwich, the bread was awesome, probably the best thing about the meal. The chicken was cooked perfectly. But the flavoring was kind of elementary. Got the potato salad, was basically something you could get at the store. But, it's a brewery, so I should say the food was where it should be for that. Overall dining experience, this is where it really lost me. I guess i just don't get it. First, It's overcrowded (the place is large, do they really need to cram that many seats in?) And the bar feels like a restaurant bar, somewhere you'd go while waiting for your table (although there's zero standing room), not so much for the bar itself. The bar is right in the middle, in heavy traffic flow. Just seems like a bad design for a brewery, If this was simply a restaurant, it'd make sense, but it's a brewery, you'd expect to be able to go here and just drink, but the bar atmosphere/layout doesn't really lend to it. Basically a very busy place and I felt a bit overwhelmed, couldn't get into a good conversation with our group because its so LOUD in there, not the music, just he chatter, the acoustics are awful. You start talking louder to each other and it just adds to the whole problem.  Crowd was very young/hip.  But the beer is good, the food is pretty good, a decent place on a block that needed it. I will probably try it again for lunch or something, when it's not that crowded.
