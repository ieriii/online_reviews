AMAZING CAKE. After researching bakeries for a special birthday cake to serve 80, we had the good fortune of coming upon Peter at Alliance. They created a 3D cake that looked like a golden buddha that was so convincing that most party goers thought it was a statue. To help save on cost, they cleverly created a large cake for 40, and created "Lotus Blossom" red velvet cupcakes for the additional servings. The creativity and presentation were spectacular. And the best part . . . the cake was worthy of the presentation. Moist, delicious. Amazing.
