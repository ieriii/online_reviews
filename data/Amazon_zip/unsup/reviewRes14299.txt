Me and my friends had to go to Hamlin Park to see my friend's Indian dance recital so I just looked at google maps to see if there were any places to eat near by. I asked my friends on twitter if 90 Miles Cuban Cafe was a recommendation and they said definitely. And they were not wrong. The people who worked there were super friendly and since it was 60 degrees, we got to sit outside in the nice weather. The food was excellent, the prices reasonable. I will definitely be going back there again.
