My experience at the Publican exceeded my expectations! Beautiful, simple and relaxing decor -- a welcome departure from culinary venues that are painfully hip or pretentious. Excellent servers that knew the ingredients (including their source) inside and out, with great beer and wine pairings. Top notch ingredients and very generous portion sizes. The unctuous, pure flavor in the Pork Belly was paired with expertly prepared Brussels Sprouts. Someone else mentioned the mussels: fresh and steamed to perfection, they were simply sensational. The Publican convinced me that Chicago is the spiritual home of pork!
