This place never disappoints and dare I say, best pizza in Chicago? I really like that you can pick your style of pizza and then you add your toppings. It's simple and customizable to your taste. The red is tangy and the crust is the perfect thickness. Go hungry and leave happy. As if having incredible pizza isn't good enough, they have the best selection award winning hand-crafted brews! If I were to open a restaurant, I would want it to be exactly like this place!
