After hearing about the craziness surrounding this place I was anticipating a 2 hour wait and food made from gold. I walked in and was immediately seated in the busy dining room, so score points for me (and for Revolution). The beer was great (I had the wheat), the service impeccable, especially for being so busy (we were never rushed even after finishing and nursing our beers), and the food, while not made of gold, was pretty delicious. My workingman's burger was even pretty good the next day (it was HUGE, I had 1/2 for breakfast). The blue-cheese potato salad was a little watery, but there were so many huge chunks of cheese in it that I quickly forgot. Overall, I will try to go back again, but I might wait a while. Lighting wont strike twice and I'm sure my next visit will come with a 2 hour wait.
