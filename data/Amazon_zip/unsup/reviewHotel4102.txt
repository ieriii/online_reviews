Got this room on priceline for ~80 a night. The bed was comfy, and the location was great (well public transport was like 4 blocks but I'm just being picky on that one..). I used a machine to checkin instead of checking in with a person (to avoid a long line). The machine gave me a room on the lowest floor with 0 view that was a handicap room. Seriously it had to be the worst room in the place. I realize it's my fault for using the machine... but seriously.... anyways, note to self avoid the checkin machines in the future.
