so. this was one of the first bars i saw after first moving to chicago four years ago. i thought it was a fun enough place, some of the beers are a bit overpriced, it is a tad too crowded, but hey. it's fun. i like the set-up, i like the atmosphere. then i took the opportunity this summer to rent the upstairs room for a small party. bad mistake. i contacted the owner about 5 times (per email and phone) before ever getting a response. he told us to just drop by (which we did 3 times), but he was never there, and the staff never had any clue about out reservation, even though he said he would tell them. so eventually things came together, we picked one of the open bar options, and we were told that we could bring our own computer with music, which would be hooked up to the stereo system. also, we were told that we could stay until 1am. when we arrived, the bar tender tried to charge people for their drinks (despite the open bar), and had no idea that we wanted to hook up a computer. he also wanted to kick us out at 11. that may have not been his fault, as apparently he was misinformed by his boss, and he eventually hooked up the computer, tended to the open bar and let us stay - as a compromise - until midnight. but it sucked anyway. and something like that should not happen at a bar as well-established as the Hop Leaf. Kind of embarrassing.
