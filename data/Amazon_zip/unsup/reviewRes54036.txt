This place was lovely-- I only went there once with my whiskey loving cousin (we spent an hour sipping whiskey and talking about the flavors) but I would love to go back and try something a bit more adventurous. The interior is beautiful (and violet of course) the seats are set up in a very secluded way, and our waitress was very attentive. I love that there's no sign outside, and that the door is somewhat hidden-- it makes you feel like you've discovered something rare and almost like you're walking into another world. I can't wait to go back!
