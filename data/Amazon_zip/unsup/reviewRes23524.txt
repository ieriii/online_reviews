I've had the opportunity to have other omelets since my recent one at Icosium Kafe, but chose otherwise so as to preserve the memory of The Best Omelet I've Ever Had.  The Best Omelet I've Ever Had was a custom combination of baby spinach, portabella mushroom, cucumber and goat cheese. That would be four fixin's for those keeping score, and I didn't even exhaust the options. Truthfully, I like a simple spinach omelet - it expanded my horizons to even add cheese - and it wouldn't have occurred to me to add cucumber if it weren't on the menu. The result was a little like Seinfeld - an ensemble piece where each distinct element added to the whole.  Clearly, cucumbers = Kramer. Besides TBOIEH, the other item of note was the dessert crepe I shared. I had fond memories of a banana and Nutella crepe I once had in California, but we opted for the Labella. The banana/chocolate/almond/coconut combination was very good, but next time I will probably keep it simpler in order to maximize the impact of ingredients. I just felt so rewarded after branching out with TBOIEH, but live and learn.   Otherwise, service and atmosphere are both solid. Our waitress was friendly, and there are numerous Algerian/Turkish furnishings throughout. It feels cozy, and the booths are perfect for people-watching.   I'll be back, and it will be soon.
