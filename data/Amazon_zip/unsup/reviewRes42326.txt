I had heard about Art of Pizza years ago from someone who said it was the best in the city. I don't think it is (sorry, I love me some Lou's), but it is damn good. By the slice heightens the appeal of dropping in for a quick slice. It also helps that the individual slices are monstrous in size.  Delivery is usually prompt, and I've never had a problem with the order; I do live 6 blocks away, so that may be why. The only complaint I've ever had about it was that I used to be one block out of their delivery zone, and they wouldn't cross it. But really, that's just silly and selfish. No legitimate complains.
