Uhhhhh, what's better than cylinders of meat that you can put in your mouth? This place is cool, it's decorated like a corner joint in a neighborhood that's a little less affluent than the one it currently occupies, but there's nothing phony about Hot Doug's phlavor! I've never made it for the duck fat fries, but I've heard from reputable sources (chunky monkeys) that they're delish.  As for the line around the block and the limited hours: Suck it up and quit being a cry baby. And who wants to eat a dog before 11am or after 4pm anyway. It's lunch food.  If you want late night hot dogs go somewhere with night life. If you want a tasty nd reasonably priced (though greasy) lunch, go to Hot Doug's!
