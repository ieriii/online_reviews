well, this place is growing on me... my first visit I was put off cause the fancy food seemed intimidating, but came here again for a lunch meeting and everything on the menu sounded delish. I'm not a seafood eater but I saw at the other table the fish and chips and it looked extremely tasty. So who knows, maybe i'll cave on that next time. But this time I did get their burger and it was the most perfectly cooked burger I've ever had in this city. It really was good. I would lunch to see more sandwich varieties on the lunch menu. The experience here is pretty nice, wait staff is extremely nice and helpful. The environment is modern yet comfy. cant wait to try this place for dinner! =)
