First, I have been a huge fan of Spacca Napoli so this review is written more in great disappointment than in disgruntlement. After a few years of coming here and loving everything about the place, we visited on a recent weekend night and had made a reservation. We were seated after all had arrived and the server came to our table promptly enough. She handed us the menus and did not offer to ake a drink order and then disappeared for a while.  When she returned and asked for our food order, we asked that she take our drink order too although we would have preferred the drinks first. Our order came in good time but the $12.00 antipasto was missing the grilled asparagus the menu promised. Although we declined to make an issuue of this, it seemed bad form to have it on the menu and then not deliver or even mention why; and, of course, no break in the price. A companion was less than impressed by the $8.00 house salad, which she said was huge but boring, with hardly anything other than lots of lettuce and a few tomatoes and barely any dressing on it. While my pizza seemed fine, I noticed that the crust seemed much less crisp than before and my companions found theirs so limp they did not eat all of theirs. The server was fairly inattentive and although we still left a generous tip, it seems the waitstaff is not so well-trained anymore. Perhaps the crowds on the weekend make the entire staff - from the hostess to the servers - very cavalier. Well, those crowds (and a big contingent of families and children) may be satisfied but those of us who have been there before know that the food and service have deteriorated. Which is sad. A restaurant should not take its patrons for granted. I will think twice before returning, which I truly regret.
