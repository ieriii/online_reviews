Wow, I can't believe people think the Bongo Room serves good food.  First of all, the service is horrendous. The host is rude and does not seat customers on a first come first serve basis. We were a group of three, and a group of four came in he sat them before us. This happened a few times, and we waited about 45 minutes before we questioned him about it. When we did, he offered us a seat at the bar.  During this occasion, we never ate the food. However, I have dined here previously, and waiting in a busy, loud, obnoxious environment for mediocre food does not sound like a way to spend a weekend morning.  There are a plethora of breakfast places in Chicago, and I rather pay more and eat in a beautiful, relaxing environment where everyone is treated with class, than a crowded obnoxious restaurant with mediocre food.
