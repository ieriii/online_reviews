I love Simply It! Whenever you walk in, you'll be greeted by the owners with lots of enthusiasm and seated right away. The food is awesome. They have the most delicious beef noodle soup (pho) that is my favorite (It's basically why we go here regularly) and the shrimp sate (spicy shrimp lightly fried with onion and broccoli). Other standouts are the simply it's beef (filet cubes sauteed in butter, garlic, and red wine), pineapple calamari (order it lightly fried for a lighter taste or normal for really crispy), and the siagonese crepe. The best part of simply it besides the awesome food is the super low price tag and BYOB. You'll leave stuffed, satisfied, and a bill for two rarely exceeds $50 with tip. Can't beat it.
