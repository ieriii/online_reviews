The peking duck is phenomenal. The skin is crispy and delicious. You can decide between fried rice or noodles and I would suggest going with the noodles. The fried rice was not that good. The soup they made with the bones was very tasty. I also had the garlic fried ribs which was amazing - must try! Ong choy was perfectly made. Do not get the regular roasted duck. There's no flavor in it at all. Their bbq pork is decent but nothing spectacular. The servers are rude and horrible but you don't go to a Chinese restaurant for the ambience or service. The food is worth it.
