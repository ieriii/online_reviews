This place was jumping on a Tuesday night! I couldn't believe every table was full around 7:30, we got the last open table. We started with a pitcher of classic margaritas. It was $25 but not enough tequila for me! So that was kind of a rip off. The food isn't that great. I had the 2 steak taco dinner and my steak was burnt and chewy kind of like beef jerky. I honesty can get better Mexican food in my hood. The only thing is Garcia's has a wonderful bar stocked with a lot of tequila! I doubt I will be back but it is a fun place to go when you are a group of friends.
