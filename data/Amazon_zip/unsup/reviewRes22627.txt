Oh, the memory of my daughter excitedly shrieking, "The girl hotdog and the boooooy hotdog" as we made the turn from Devon onto Milwaukee. I never cared for the mushy fries crammed on top of an otherwise decent redhot, but she adored this place for much of her youth, so I'm giving it 3 stars for the nostalgia and ability to please a very picky kid.
