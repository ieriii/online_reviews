Been here a couple of times when they first opened. Food was pretty good. Definitely different from the normal burgers and hot dogs in the area. Waitstaff was super friendly. I like that their menu changes with the seasons, meaning I'm getting fresh items, not frozen stuff. The only downside is pricing. I think some of the items are overpriced. Since they've gotten so popular after being on Check Please, Diners Dives & Drive Thrus and shows like these, I've passed by and see the line out the door. Sorry, but I don't want to wait that long for brunch. That might be why they can keep the prices high because they're still getting a steady stream of folks in. I'll still hit up Nana's just not as often.
