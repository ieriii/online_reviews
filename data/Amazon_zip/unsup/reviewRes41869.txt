I have been here with my fiance three times now. Each experience has been great, from customer service to their buttery steaks. We have been to their suburban location once and the city location twice. Their staff is extremely friendly each time and very knowledgebale with the wine and meat selections. What's great is that they also have fabulous prix fix menu deal. It includes a soup or salad, meat, side dish, and dessert. If they have that deal going on definietly chck it out, but Ruth's Chris is still amazing deal or no deal!
