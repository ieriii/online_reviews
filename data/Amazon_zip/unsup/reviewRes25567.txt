I recently ate at Geja's while celebrating an anniversary with my boyfriend. The atmosphere was definitely very romantic. The lighting was very low and warm with candles everywhere. The restaurant itself is located below ground, creating a cozy vibe to the place. The seating is private and the decor adds to the romance. I also thought it was a really fun place for a date because the dining experience was interactive. (I should mention that this was my first fondue experience.) I liked that there were 3 courses included in the basic menu. It definitely felt like a formal dinner without being too stuffy. The food was excellent. I especially liked the cheese fondue. I could've eaten that with my whole meal! It was definitely the best part. The main course was a little bit more work than I would've liked. I know I just mentioned that I enjoyed that it was interactive, but it was kind of stressful making sure the pot always had skewers in it (to keep the temperature regular) while also paying attention to how long the various types of proteins were being cooked. It might have been nicer to enjoy a more relaxing meal without worrying about the food so much. But that's the nature of a fondue restaurant I suppose, and definitely nothing against Geja's. So the restaurant was very romantic and the food was delicious....but the combination of the two did not exactly equal a romantic night. There is so much food to eat that the two of us left the restaurant STUFFED and all we felt like doing was going back to our hotel, changing into sweatpants and laying down while our food digested!
