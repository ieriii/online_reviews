Superior service with an Italian flair, and excellent food to match. Be sure to try the four-cheese ravioli if available (an appetizer portion will do, but you will be craving more)...it's one of the finest pasta dishes I have ever tasted. Also, my wife ordered the rabbit, which I'm normally not into, but must give credit when due...it was heavenly. Reasonably-priced wines available, and might I recommend the pistachio or caramel gelato for dessert. Already looking forward to a return visit.
