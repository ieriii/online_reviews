Five star food, certainly. I love the margaritas, chips and guac (it might be the best guac in the city). I tried the Trio, Trio, Trio-- a sampling of ceviches so delicious that I don't even know which one was my favorite. I had the carne asada for my entree, which was really tasty as well. As stuffed as I was, I still ordered dessert-- the mango crisp with rhubarb ice cream. It was so good, I wish I had saved more room for it. Frontera loses a star for its attitude though. The wait for a table was ridiculously long and when we were finally seated, the tables were so close together that I felt like I was sitting on my fellow diners' laps.
