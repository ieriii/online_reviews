give them a day to work out the kinks at the new local and then you won't get any better then this. friendly people operating a great lunch/ dinner spot (have yet to try breakfast, but coffee is tasty). the open air, back patio is alive with energy and music, creating a great atmosphere to unwind and enjoy late summer evenings (byob). the Bistec sandwich ($6.50 cheap around these parts and definitely well worth it) is fantastic, if you want to stray from the cubano. also try the guava and cheese empanada. sooo good.bring $12. get variety of flavors. leave happy. return soon.
