This place is old and a borderline 3 star hotel. Beds are lumpy, sheets are rough, walls are thin, and the bathrooms need to be renovated. On the plus side the service exceeds some 4 or 5 star hotels I've stayed at. Everyone from the front desk guy in the middle of the night to the concierge to the service lady to the shuttle driver were super friendly and helpful. If this is your first visit to Chicago I highly recommend this place as the staff will definitely make your visit enjoyable. I rarely stay at a hotel twice but I'll be staying here on my next visit.
