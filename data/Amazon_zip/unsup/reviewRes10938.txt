For thin crust pizza, Piece is very, very good. The options with sauce and toppings are excellent, and the amount of food for the cost is very good. The menu is very limited, but what they have is all rather good. The beer is the biggest draw for me. All of their brews are very well made. None of them are flat or bland, and none are too overpowering either. Each style of beer is accurate to the description, and well worth the trip to WP. Also, the other beers they serve on tap which are not their own are of good quality.  The waitstaff is attentive and friendly. Another plus is that they are knowledgeable about not only about the Piece beer, but also the other beers they're serving, which is a welcome change from many bars/restaurants.  Although I don't normally like Karaoke of any kind, the band that plays for live-band-karaoke is very good. The singers are also usually a good mix of practiced veterans and nervous first timers. It really has a perfect atmosphere for it. The only two downsides are that they sometimes run out of their beers. Which is a product of too much success. But, it's still discouraging when I'm come specifically for a Dysfunctionale, and they're out. Also, sometimes it's slightly too crowded. Again, a problem of being too nice of a place, and doing everything else too right, but it still can be irksome to have someone's elbow bump into your back at an inopportune moment. All in all though, it's one of my favorite places to eat and drink in Chicago, and always a good time when I go.
