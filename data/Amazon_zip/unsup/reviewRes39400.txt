The food is very good, no argument there, but quite overpriced if you ask me. I don't need to know what family farm the beef or chicken came from, nor the cheese. It's cool that you guys can tell me that, but that does not justify it being $3 or so more than it would be if the meat hadn't come from a local farm. The fact that they don't take reservations is retarded. It borderlines on too pretentious for that fact alone. Yes, your food is good, but no, you're not that cool, sorry guys. Their whiskey selection will keep me coming back again and again, though. The shots are small, but they're only $3, and the selection is seriously like you've just matriculated to Whiskey University.
