I've been meaning to go here and write a review since there were 40 reviews or so... 500 reviews later, here we are. Well, let me just tell you that is was worth the wait. But, I also can't believe i waited so long. This place is excellent. Everything I've had on the menu is exceptional. The forest burger is awesome. The smokehouse burger is heaven on earth. Who doesn't like a good burger? Who doesn't like pulled pork? Wait, let's put them together... Genius! It also doesn't hurt that you're sure to find a great beer to pair with your delicious order. I will definitely keep coming back here and hope they keep doing well and serving up great meals. I guess if I had anything to say that isn't extremely positive is that it is a little pricey. That's really why it doesn't score an easy 5-stars with me. You come here and are sure to get great food and drink... but you're also sure to leave with a light wallet.
