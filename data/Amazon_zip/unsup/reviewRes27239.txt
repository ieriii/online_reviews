I'm usually a thin crust girl when it comes to pizzas, but I'd heard rave reviews about Pequod's and had to try the pan to see what all the fuss was about. If the review were just for the pizza, I'd give it 3 stars. It was good, but nothing I'd run back for, though the "caramelized" cheese around the edge of the crust is my favorite part. It was definitely plentiful and a medium pizza lasted my boyfriend and I two meals. The crust doesn't reheat very well, though, so I'd recommend only ordering what you think you can finish. The sausage was good, crumbled and fresh with just the right amount of spice. It was a little bready for my taste, though. The reason I'll be back is for the good service and good beer. We were seated right away on a busy, Saturday night, upstairs and in a back room I didn't know existed. Still, the atmosphere was lively and fun. There were lots of tvs showing various football games. The beer list was pretty good for what I was expecting. A few craft beers make the list, and we shared a reasonably priced pitcher of Great Lakes beer while waiting for our pizza. We had a great night and a great dinner there, so if I'm with someone who has a hankering for thick, pan pizza, I'll point them in the direction of the neon whale with a thong on his head.
