I've eaten here for a long while and I've always enjoyed the sharp freshness of their food such as their spring rolls, and I love the hearty oriental substance of their soups. It's authentic Vietnamese food, and a very easy to use menu with the simple use of numbers as the label for each dish; "I'll have the 41 again as usual". The place is often busy so dining inside usually has a clatter of chatting and noise that fits the atmosphere of a busting cafeteria as many people seem to enjoy convening there. One of my favorite restaurants for sure.
