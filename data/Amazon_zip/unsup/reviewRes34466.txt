My friend and I were visiting Chicago and wanted one last meal before our flight back to LA. We decided to try Yolk and we were very pleased with the portion and taste of our food. He ordered a salmon combo with a side of apple cinnamon pancakes and I ordered banana crepes with strawberries on the side. The ingredients were fresh and the food was cooked perfectly. What won my heart though was the fact that the bananas and apples were freshly cooked; as oppose to being processed and drenched in syrup like many breakfast spots. Overall, I think Yolk is a good balance between diner style breakfast and your french inspired- new American brunch cafe.
