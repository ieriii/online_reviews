My husband and I went to Lockdown on a Sunday around 4:30 and had a great experience. We each had a burger (he had the Electric Chair and I had the Ponzi Scheme). I had mine cooked medium and it was perfectly cooked and very juicy. I also had one of their $4 bloody mary's and it was great. The place was not very busy but the bar was almost full and there was one other table of people. The service was great. I think we had 3 or 4 people check on us to ask if we needed anything after our food was served. I will definitely go back again. My husband also had a side of mac and cheese and it was good.
