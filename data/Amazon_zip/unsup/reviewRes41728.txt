I had my first experience with Tank Noodle last night, and I was very happy. I don't have a particularly comprehensive review (I tend to reserve those for locales I've frequented many times), but I can say that I loved the spring rolls and highly recommend the Fish entree I ate (more below on that). Additionally, I enjoyed the communal dining experience offered here. My friend and I shared a 6-top with two strangers who knew a lot more about Pho and Vietnamese dining than we did, and we four were happy to engage in conversation about the cuisine despite having never met. What is it about food and community? I love the combination. My friend and I were able to ask the two ladies at our table about the various food items being presented to us, and they were nice enough to tell us the answers. Example, the plate of sprouts, basil, some sort of hot pepper and lime confused us. Is it an appetizer? A palate-cleanser? We were total newbies and the waitstaff was running all over the place serving a packed crowd. Answer, given to us by the two ladies who shared our table: they are used to spice the Pho soups! Thanks, ladies! Anyway, my friend had chicken pho, and I had the salmon/pineapple claypot entree (salmon broiled in a really decadent combination of Vietnamese spices - not too spicy - with two large chunks of pineapple and some white rice). I thoroughly enjoyed my meal, the fast-paced and kind service, and the community dining atmosphere. If you're looking for a quiet dinner for two at a secluded table, this is not the place to go. If you're looking for delicious food in a packed restaurant alive with locals, families, couples and friends and you're into sharing a table with strangers you might strike up a conversation with, you will totally love Tank. it was a taste sensation adventure for me, and I dug it!
