Great pizza AND microbrews? God I miss the midwest sometimes. Then I remember how effing cold it was that night my friends and I swung in here. Sorry, it's true. I was freshly lit off of my Woolworth's Manhattan from Violet Hour and needed a warm up. Their IPA was pretty top notch for a starter. It was barely crowded, for being so highly recommended, and my friends and I got a table right away. And out of curiosity more than anything, we got the corn salsa as an app (chips & salsa in a pizza joint?) that turned into a great idea. They were delicious. We weren't adventurous enough to try and specialties like the white pies or anything, so we just got the standard. Our veggie sausage pizza wasn't the greatest I've ever had, but it was pretty damn delicious and three of us scarfed down the whole thing. Definitely well worth the trip over, if even just for the beer.
