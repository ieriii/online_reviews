Totally worth it!! Loved every moment. When we called they told us that they only take a limited number of reservations but that they open at 5 and they do walk ins (which is actually really nice otherwise you would be waiting for weeks/months for a reservation). Anyways they told us people start lining up around 4:15 and they weren't kidding. We arrived around 430 and got in line which wasn't too bad. They took our name and let us into the bar starting at 5 which was semi spacious with a nice menu of unique drinks. Wonderful margaritas with good bartenders! We only waited for about 30min for a table because they stagger the seating so there isn't a huge rush for the kitchen. We sat outside. The server and wait staff were outstanding. They had wonderful recommendations and the food was delicious! Get the ceviche trio you won't regret it and both the duck and shrimp entrees were outstanding. Flavors were unique and delicious. I have never had food quite like it before. The press coffee and tres leches for dessert was a wonderful finish to the meal. If you get the chance you should go! I will definitely be going back the next chance I get. It is worth waiting in line.
