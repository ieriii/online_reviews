First time back in much, much, much too long (about ten days ago)! Not a fan of the "center row" seating, but c'est la vie. I think it was because the table next to us thought that dining should be a "Sean Hannity Hour" type of discussion with the seat mates. So we adjusted: we ate :) Unfortunately, right now I have a few dietary restrictions, and the entire team made sure all was okay - they even stopped by with a few questions, just to make sure. Very nice and it added to the pleasant dining experience (once we hit "mental mute" on that one table, of course) the cheese course will surprise and delight if you haven't had it. If you have, you know what I mean! And have to repeat this adviceIf you have no dietary restrictions): just have them surprise you with the three courses. Pair it with wine. And get ready for a great, fun gastronomic adventure. Great for romantic dining, great for small groups. Celebrate or just cuz you like it. You'll have a great time Brunch is the next meal to be conquered there. Stay tuned!
