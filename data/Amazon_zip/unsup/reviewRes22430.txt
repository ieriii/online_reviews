BEST Chinese food in Chicago! I have to admit that Chinese is not my cuisine of choice, but I have eaten enough of the greasy practically fast-food variety to know that Lao Sze Chuan is the real deal. It's deceivingly good, despite the medium-grade (at best) decorations and walls full of cheap panda images. Fortunately the food speaks for itself... and when it does, it says "eat me! i'm delicious! and relatively cheap!" I almost stopped after the complimentary plate of spicy cabbage damn near sent me to the hospital... easy on the intake, one red pepper flake to the back of the throat and your meal could be over. But I powered through and managed to gorge myself on a feast of: Cashew Shrimp (SO yummy!) Friend Noodles w. Shrimp (great balance of sauce / noodles / shrimp) Ma Po Tofu (super spicey, but with the right blend of rice it balanced out nicely) Eggplant in Garlic Sauce (didn't love the texture, but the garlic sauce was delicious) The other two diners with me also got a chicken dish, which I didn't eat (but they liked) The whole meal only cost us $60 and there were TONS of leftovers. I will absolutely be back here again. Worth noting - we got here around 1pm on a Saturday and had a 10 minute wait for 3 people. By 1:30pm, the line was out the door.
