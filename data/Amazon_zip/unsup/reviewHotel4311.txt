Experience a part of the rich cultural history Chicago has to offer by staying at the Palmer House. There are tours of the facility available, but simply walking around and taking in the beautiful architecture and style of the hotel is a memorable experience. The lobby alone is worth just walking through if you're passing along the street. Grab a drink and sit a spell, you probably won't regret it. This is Chicago - live a little! It's an upscale property, but look for seasonal specials if budget is going to be an issue. The rooms are beautiful and surprisingly spacious (our room even included a walk-in closet), and tastefully appointed. There are iPods available for guest use in the lobby for internet browsing, express check-out, even reservations. The location of the property great and walking distance to the Art Institute of Chicago - also a highly recommended place to visit if you haven't before.
