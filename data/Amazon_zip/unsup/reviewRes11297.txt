Quite the mouth-watering breakfast/brunch menu! There were plenty of open tables when a friend and I stopped in late one Monday morning. I had the pancakes with fluffy lemon cream and raspberries...I should have written the exact description down, but believe me, it sounded impressive and it was. Typical prices for this type of spot--sehr trendy and beautifully decorated. Loved the greens and yellows.
