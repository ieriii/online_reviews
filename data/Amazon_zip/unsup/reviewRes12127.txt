I never knew about this place until yesterday, when my 2 hung over friends decided that we should have our obligatory hairs of the dog here for brunch. Screw the coffee, 3 Bloody Marys, please. The only interesting part of the Bloody Mary is the chili powder(?) - if anyone knows what ingredient it is, I'd love to know. We shared the Taste of Cuba: Fried plantains (oh, yes!), Croquettes (I didn't ask what was in it - my mom taught me never to question food placed in front of me), and Empanadas (I only ate the filling and gave my friends the pie crust) One friend decided on The Other Side of the World - scrambled eggs and smoked salmon, which he loved. Another friend chose the Steak Chilaquiles, which he thought was ok. I don't blame him, the cinnamon dust was pretty overpowering. I had the Spinach Benedict with a side of bacon. OMG, it was delicious. The spicy hollandaise was very subtle, bacon was crispy, and goat cheese mild.  Great first experience for me. Better believe Imma try the Jalapeo Pork Chops next time.
