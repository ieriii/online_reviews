Best stuffed pizza in the city - bar none! Went here for the first time the other day and was happy, stuffed, satisfied and may have gained ten pounds~! Had a spinach and tomato pie with soda and ranch dressing. Great ranch dressing, awesome pie and a waitress who refilled our sodas immediately after they were half full (not half empty:). This experience was only made better by their large screen tvs which were showing ladies bowling, almost saw a perfect game (she missed striking out in the 10th), and golf in HD.  If it wouldn't have been after a fun night of drinking I would of been able to review their beer selection since they have a full bar and many options on tap. This will have to wait for next time. It is right across the street from a movie theater too so next time may have to be for a dinner and a movie date. Because pizza and beer go so well together....
