The jury is still out for me on this place.First of all, I just want people to know that I am a big fan of Indian food.I had a good time the first time so I decided to go back with some friends for the second time last Friday night. Everything was tasting pretty good until I saw this little black thing in my salad. As I examined it more closely, I was shocked to realize that it's a dead fly. At this point, I tried to not let it ruin my entire appetite. I quickly informed the waiter of this and he didn't seem very surprised. As he took the unfinished salad away, he said he would take care of this.Long story short, I managed to work up an appetite and ate part of my entree. When I finally got my bill, my waiter told me that he had taken 25% off the price of my dish.I don't know..I'm currently a bit torn about this place. I genuinely find the food to be delicious and it's in the city, meaning that it's easy for me to get there. It was a nice gesture that the waiter tried to make it right but it makes me wonder how clean the place is and how often things like this happen.
