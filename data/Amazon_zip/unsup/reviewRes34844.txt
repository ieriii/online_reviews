Eh. The good: We had a group of 27 for someone's birthday (OK I didn't plan it, I'd never get that many people together for a 23rd bday), but the restaurant actually closed down the restaurant for our "private party". The bad: When we called to adjust the amount of people for the reservation the day of, they tried to inform us THEN, about 3 hours prior to dinner, that there was a $30 minimum per person. They conveniently forgot to mention this when we made the reservation. The grub: I really like the spicy tuna roll, it was the spiciest roll I've ever had, which I like. One of the shrimp rolls tasted a little funky, so after two pieces I left the rest. The place is BYOB, which I'm starting to appreciate more and more. You can find a better place, I think.
