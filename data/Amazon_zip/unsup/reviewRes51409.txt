Um, I'm just one person, but the food that was set before me could have fed a small family. I mean, I don't need that much food. So, naturally, I ate almost all of it.  Yikes. First things first, I was in dire need of a diet Coke after last nights debauchery. When I saw the server walking over with that great big plastic cup it was like the clouds parted, a light shone down and angels started singing. That damn diet Coke was huge, and topped with a juicy lime wedge, no less. God in heaven, that was nice. The guacamole was a bit bland, I like a bit of spice and plenty of cilantro. This had neither, but it was edible. The salsa was pretty tasty, though. I had the Enchiladas Verdes, also gigantic. There was some good flavor, the tortillas had a nice corn flavor and the sauce was delicious, but again, could have been more spicy. Next time I will order an item to share instead of gorging myself on my own entree.
