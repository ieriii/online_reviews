Certainly not your typical bbq joint, but worth a trip. Like my friend Kit mentioned, it is definitely more steakhouse than casual barbecue restaurant. The chips and pickles that they bring to snack on are great-- and don't you love when there is food on your table almost immediately after you sit down? I do! We ordered the hushpuppies as an appetizer and even my fiance who despises anything made with cornmeal loved them and the fact that they had a little kick to them. The barbecue was great and they bring a selection of sauces to the table so you can decide exactly which kind you want on your meal. Oh, and the side of mac and cheese was amazing-- I could have ordered it for my meal. Although we really didn't have room, we ended up ordering dessert-- 2 to share between the 3 of us. The key lime pie was amazing-- one of the best I have ever had. The derby pie was so-so. It's a little more like a pecan pie and as a personal preference, I am just not a fan. Overall, a great restaurant. A little pricier than we expected so it's certainly not the kind of place we'll be going to every week (especially when looking for a casual bbq experience), but definitely worth the trip.
