Nice menu selection and even nicer drink menu selection. Overall the food was okay (had a seafood medley dish with a heavy sauce but the shrimp in it had to be peeled, ended up being very messy and a pain).The prices though are too expensive for the quality of the food you receive. If you're on a budget and want a lot of bang for your buck than this is not the place for you.The atmosphere is definitely the highlight. Beautiful layout, huge space, bright colors, fun photos, mirrors, cool ceiling fixtures, lamps and plants all over the place.Fun place to try once, maybe a second time at most.
