I had heard about this place awhile ago and then when another friend mentioned that a coworker of his recommended it, we decided to go. We ended up getting a table on the second floor and each ordered our own small pizza. I had spinach and he ordered sausage. I'm a HUGE fan of Giordano's and this pizza was different from theirs, but different doesn't mean bad. Basically, there was less cheese, more sauce. A good amount of spinach, although I feel there could have been more, but I don't know that most people love spinach as much as I do. The most interesting thing about the pizza is the carmelized crust, which makes the crust worth eating if you're not normally a fan of the crust. My friend was figuring that he could finish off the small pizza, but that didn't happen. It's definitely more filling than it appears to be. We could have shared one pizza and finished it (if only we could have agreed on a vegetarian one!) but instead, we both ended up taking home leftovers. I had my leftovers two days later and it was almost as yummy as the night we had the pizza in the restaurant. I would definitely go back again if I happened to be in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way to go back. Giordano's continues to maintain a special place in my Chicago style pizza eating heart.
