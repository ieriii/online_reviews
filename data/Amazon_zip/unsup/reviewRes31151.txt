I visited Nana with some close friends of mine after hearing their rave review of the food and of the organic theme that the restaurant is trying to foster. Looking through the reviews, I'm a bit confused by what people are so upset about. Yes, there can be a long wait. We waited for about 40 minutes because we a) got there late b) it's Sunday brunch and c) this place has been open for about a month. Give them a break. Once we were seated, our waiter jumped on us almost instantly and gave us his full attention. When I asked about the gluten content of a dish, he acknowledged the importance of the inquiry and promptly whisked away to the kitchen and returned with a definitive answer. (For the record, Nana is safe for people with a gluten intolerance. Just ask.) As for the food...it's absolutely delicious. I had the Nanadict, my girlfriend the All-American Breakfast, and my friend had the Huevos Rancheros. Everyone reported that the food well-cooked and tasted great. Also: the portions are just fine, in my mind. You'll leave comfortably full, but not bloated. I don't get why people seem to have a problem with this. Take a chance on Nana...forget the naysayers, you'll probably enjoy it.
