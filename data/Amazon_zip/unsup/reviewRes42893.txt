Now, I haven't tried every deep dish pizza joint in Chicago but out of the places I have been, "Art of Pizza" ranks 1st! Art of Pizza has THE BEST stuffed pizza I have ever had. I'm from Indiana so I like thiner crust pizza and I was not a fan of deep dish till I had Art of Pizza. After having A of P I will never look back. Don't get me wrong, I still love my thin crust but there is a time and a place for each. The time is now and the place is Chicago and its time for some "Art of Pizza!"
