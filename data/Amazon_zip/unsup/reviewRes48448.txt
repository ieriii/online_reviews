I took my husband here for his birthday. The seating is a bit...odd, I guess. There's quite a bit of communal seating, and some of the booths are walled in, and you have to kind of open a door to get out of your booth. We went on a Saturday night (with a reservation, of course) and the place was packed. We started with the market salad and the frites with a fried egg on top. The frites were good, but I would have appreciated more seasoning. One fried egg on top of a bounty of fries only goes so far. The market salad was quite delicious. My husband got homemade pork rinds, which he really enjoyed. For our main courses, I got a fish fry with fried with lemons, artichoke hearts and eggplant. It all had a light breading on it and it was served with a delicious, tangy tarter sauce. My husband got the pork belly, which he really enjoyed. The highlight of the night for me was the dessert. It was a waffle with honey butter and blueberries. It was light, so it wasn't super rich and didn't weigh us down, yet it was so satisfying. It was hard to tell how much we should order on a menu like this, the layout was a bit odd. But, we left happy and had a great time.
