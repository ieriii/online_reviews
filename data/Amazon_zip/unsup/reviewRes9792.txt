Went here last night.Incredible, is the best word I can use to describe our experience. Food was fabulous,from the appetizers to the desert. There were 4 of us and we had 3 different appetizers and we each ordered a different entre so we could all try some of each. Again incredible. A small place, nice to get dressed up, good wine list and ALOT of food. Desert and coffee and our bill was only 250$. Can't wait to go back!
