They always had awesome pastry but people who work there are acting like they don't want to be there at all. They have great seating outside. They have a cherry bliss bar that I love. Anything I have tried in the past has been amazing. It's just people that work here don't really care if you buy or not buy anything. Kind of off-putting. From what I"ve heard they make great cakes and know a lot about weird wedding cakes. Hopefully their staff for that is nicer.
