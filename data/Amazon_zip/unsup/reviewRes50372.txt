This review is based on going to the Fifty/50 for a Bears game, which you might rate higher depending on your enjoyment of having a DJ spin thudding house music during the commercials, then having them return to the game after the action has started. Or maybe you prefer deafening conversations, being packed close together next to cool dudes with messy hair who are already too drunk during the first quarter, and panicked service because the place is so crowded. Or being at a vantage point, with about 20 screens, so you can't really see a screen. Food is OK except for the processed fries, everything is salty which is par for the course. I am just not enough of a slacker to dig this place, which is not really a "sports" bar at all.
