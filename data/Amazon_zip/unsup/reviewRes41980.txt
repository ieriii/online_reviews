I agree whole heartedly with Sandy R. with picking off the menu can make or f-up your meal. There are hits and misses. I have become addicted to #108. It's such a great meal. Moist, full flavor pork chops over fluffy rice, huge ass prawn, sweet Chinese sausage, one sunnyside egg, cup of herby broth, and some pickled cabbage. You gots to be real hunger for this meal, but when you get it, it's great. I have had twice in the last 2 months. It's truly amazing, and for $15 isn't bad for all you get. The tables are sometimes sticky, serivice sucks at times, but come when you aren't needing to rush.
