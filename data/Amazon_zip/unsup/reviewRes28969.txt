Very let down. I was promised the best pizza in Chicago by so many friends. When I finally got "the famous pequods Pizza" they had raved about, it was mostly a lot of bread and very little sauce. I'm a big fan of pan and deep dish Chicago style pizza but this just did not live up to the hype. The crust was very good, but there was just too much of it compared with the rest of the toppings. There are many places in Chicago I would try before Pequod's.
