I am a fan! Best micro-brew I've had in forever and one of the best pizzas in town!! I brought my boss in today for lunch. She had never been. I always get the ever-so-simple sausage with red sauce pizza. I built a more fun one for her: a garlic, spinach and chicken white pizza.....I know, I know. Not so new and exciting but so good!! Lunch time service is always great but hit or miss depending on the crowd. They have won tons of awards for their beers and it shows. DE-LIC-OUS!!! Lunch pricing is pretty cheap too. Split and salad and 2 personal pizzas for about $25. Not bad! Parking is usually pretty good depending upon the day and is metered or the new paybox.
