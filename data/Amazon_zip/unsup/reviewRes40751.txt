Definitely worth every penny...and with BYOB, a good value for a great night out. The staff is extremely friendly...even brought an additional course, when we raved about a couple of them. I have been here 6 times with my wife and for business dinners, and have not been disappointed. Definitely on par with Schwa, and easier to get into!
