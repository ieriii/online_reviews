I thought this place was great. They validate valet parking and it was reasonable considering we were in downtown Chicago. I think it was $14. Food was great. We ordered the Calamari but their calamari had shrimp and other things in there...it was good. Usually I just want ranch sauce with my calamari because I don't like the sauces that come with the dish but this time the sauces were really delicious. I would order it again! I ordered a southwest chicken salad and it was really really good. And my friend ordered the ahi burger and considering Chicago is thousands of miles away from the pacific, their ahi was really good! We were so full, we brought the rest home. I wish they had a place like this in SF.
