The pickles they start you out with are awesome.Went for restaurant week....Had the grilled shrimp app...Shrimp were great, and the dipping butter was good as well. The grilled polenta served with it was nothing special...soft polenta/grits would be a be a better accompaniment. Also had the meat sampler....Meat was good, but not the best ever, pulled chicken, pork, and kobe brisket. The BBQ sauces they have on the side were pretty disappointing. The vinegar based one was decent, the other 2 thicker ones were way too sweet, and I think the 'spicy' one was just the regular thick one with some red chili flakes added. meh.Had the Kobe Beef brisket entree. I have never had Kobe beef, but from what I know about it, I figured this would be a real treat. Again, not that it was not good, but it seemed pretty standard. Same 3 sauces were served with it, which did not help anything. The fries with it were ok, could have used 1 more minute frying...they were on the barely done side of done.Key lime pie for dessert. I enjoyed it...nice light way to end the meal.To sum it up: Service was perfect. The food IS GOOD but it is nothing that special. All in all....better off going to a less hoity-toity place for bbq.
