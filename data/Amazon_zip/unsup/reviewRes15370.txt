I've been to this restaurant many times and have never had a bad meal here. The food is typical Italian fare but done right. They have a full bar and a decent wine list. Prices are reasonable. The deep dish pizza is excellent here and I recommend it as a good eat-in or take-out choice. Calo's is a good all around neighborhood restaurant.
