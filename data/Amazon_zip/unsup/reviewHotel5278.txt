It is a good boutique hotel. Nothing special about it but you will definitely not be let down. The services are up to the mark and food too is good. What I loved about this hotel was their love for pets. Pets are not just allowed in the hotel but are pampered too. Then you have relaxing in-room spa services. To my surprise, Amalfi Hotel Chicago offers different packages. I should not forget to mention - Unique Packages - Refuel & Re-energize package, Home Run Package and Romance Package are the only ones I can recollect. Altogether, it was a nice experience with nothing to complain about.
