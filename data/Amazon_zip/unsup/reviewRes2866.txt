I visited Tru about 2 years ago with a friend of mine who was in from out of town. We are both young, he had just started his first job after law school and I was doing pretty well in my previous job, so we thought, let's get dressed up and go have a "fancy pants" dinner.  Well, this was just beyond a "fancy" dinner.  This was my first foray into "fine" dining, and so needless to say I was impressed if not a bit overwhelmed. The service was impeccable, I got a kick out of the "synchronized water pour".  We had one of their less expensive bottles of wine, and decided to go for the gold with the 9 course Chef's Market Collection. The only thing I didn't like the entire evening was the amuse bouche. I'm not sure what was in it, but it wasn't good. I even liked the crab cake, and I don't usually like crab cakes. The halibut dish I had was the most amazing thing I've ever eaten, I still think about it to this day. The squab with strawberries came in a close second. I sadly tried to replicate it with chicken and a strawberry sauce at home, and it was disgusting.  Now, the best part about this meal was I never felt full until it was time to go. And then I felt like absolute crap. But the good kind of "I just had an amazing meal and I will now sleep for 12 hours" kind of crap.  Our bill was around $400 before tip, but it was completely and utterly worth it.
