I LIVE NEXT DOOR. hahaha at least for the time being. and I'm so glad I do! My roommates and I frequently order carry out, and we're never disappointed! Our favorites are the avocado wontons and the shrimp spring rolls. The plum sauce with the shrimp spring rolls is a DO NOT MISS!!!! We always ask for extra and never have any left over after any meal. Half my roommates are vegetarian, and one a former vegetarian, and they never have any issues finding menu items that meet their high levels of approval. All in all, this is a cute BYOB with the nicest people working here! The owner especially is so considerate!!! (One time I was sitting in their 'lobby' area waiting for our order and he brought me out a cup of tea and shared a lovely convo!) I love simply it. It's a perfect impromptu dinner choice in Lincoln Park!
