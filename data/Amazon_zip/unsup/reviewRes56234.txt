OMG! This place was horrible. It's really loud, not just the customer but the owner as well. He was yelling and embarrassing his staff in front of customers. I felt sorry when I saw that. I know the food was great, but me seeing that was not acceptable. I hate when people do that.Oh yeah. And let the customer finish eating before you tell your employees to take the plate. Put your self in our place. I don't want someone just taking my plate. But the staff are really nice, I just saw the owner telling them to take the plates.I love the fact that it is BYOB and foods great, staff are great. But the noise coming from the owner's. Ugh. Make me sick.One more thing. I saw one of the staff saving the fruits from the dirty and nasty table. Oh my god!!! That was something.If I were you, do not take the fruits that they served you. Are fruits can be reusable? Of course not!!!
