Today was the first time I'd been there sober and before 1am. The Super Burrito was even bigger than I remembered. I was thinking that $7.50 was a little much for a burrito, but this thing was the size of a small baby. I had sweat dripping down my face by the time I finished it. The carne asada has always been great, and today I got the beef tongue and it was delicious. Their tostadas are ok and the super tacos are as big as Taco Bell burritos. I was disappointed that the Eater Wall of Fame you enter upon finishing an Ultimate Burrito was not a literal one, but the place is still solid.
