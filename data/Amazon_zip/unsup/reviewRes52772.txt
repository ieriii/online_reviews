Great place to sit outside and eat and drink with friends or a hot date. It's BYOB and the food is delicious for the price you pay. Our service was great and the vibes were rockin. Definitely sit on the patio if the weather is nice. Ropa vieja was the bomb. Empanadas were great too. Get your gilly on.
