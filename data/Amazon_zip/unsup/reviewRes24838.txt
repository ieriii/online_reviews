A tad bit unorthodox when you first arrive... Coming into Artopolis, it is quite beautiful inside and out but when I first arrived, the place looked a lot like a dine-in restaurant. I was standing there for 5 minutes confused, wondering if anyone was going to seat us. I later realized it was more of a contemporary seat yourself- this is NOT the seat for you restaurant. OHHH, I understand now. Sorry, I got confused by the lovely decor and nice pastries. My bad!..... Recent selections were the lemon drop chicken soup and the house sandwich as well as the greek chicken. I thought the chicken needed a little more flavor because it was lacking seasoning but everything else seems really good. Furthermore, I like my lemon drop soup sour and zesty! Pastries/Desserts: There's so many to choose from. It was like dessert porn for my eyes. I've always gotten the tiramisu which I love but I need to break out of my mold and try something else. I had my eye on this cute little number, her name was mango mousse. But ssshhhh( don't tell my tiramisu, she'll be mad) .........."Oh, no.... She heard us!"
