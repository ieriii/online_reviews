We went here for lunch on a Saturday. The service was excellent, atmosphere was casual and welcoming, and the beer selection others have mentioned was extensive. We had the cheese curds, ham sandwich, and the bad apple burger. The food was good - but it could've been so much better if it wasn't so greasy. Don't get me wrong, I expect a certain amount of grease with this type of food, but it really overwhelmed what were excellent flavors buried under there. I'd go back for beer and cheese curds but would probably forgo the rest (and head to Pockets across the street).
