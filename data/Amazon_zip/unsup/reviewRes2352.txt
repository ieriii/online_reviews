I couldn't decide which place I liked better- Hot Doug's or Portillo's. I would probably say the chicago dog at Portillo's was better, but the vibe and decor at Hot Doug's takes it all. There are daily specials and duck fat fries, they even name hot dogs after celebrities (one of them was named Britney Spears but due to her recent debauchery was changed to some other celebrity hahah). The guy at the counter was cool and he sounded like the moviefone guy. However, the fries (not the duck fat fries) were nasty and the hot dog was smaller than I expected. And why would you close before 4pm??? That's when people get off work!
