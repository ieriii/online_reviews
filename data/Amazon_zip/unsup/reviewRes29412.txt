Ok, so after months of feeling eh about Chicago's food scene (see my other reviews). I finally hit the jackpot this weekend and Frontera Grill was my first stop. It was pretty outstanding. We lucked out and headed there around 7pm on a Friday night expecting a long wait. It was crowded but not wall to wall and we got a table within 15 minutes near the bar. Yay! Everything was really yummy and the stand out was the Sopes Rancheros which was an app we shared. I had beef tacos which were great, my friend had the fish which was similarly delicious. Another favorite is this beer/bloody mary concoction that I would go back for in a heartbeat. So yummy. I am still dreaming of it.... The things I didn't love were more the ambiance/decor (random interior and bizarrely loud music that falls into the reggaeton category--wikipedia it). Also there was a bachelorette party (or something like it) behind us at the bar, whose screeches were highly annoying so that was kind of a bummer. The waitstaff was great though. Regardless, after expecting to be disappointed Frontera definitely exceeded all my expectations.
