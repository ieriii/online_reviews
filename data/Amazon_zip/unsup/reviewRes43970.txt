warning: breakfast ends promptly at noon, although i personally think breakfast should be served all day shared the grilled portabello and crabcake sandwiches. the ingredients in the portabello sandwich were really good and fresh. had a hard time keeping the sandwich together which was a little annoying, but still good overall. the crabcake was a let down. was on the dry side and felt like it would've been better just as a crabcake itself instead of stuck between two pieces of bread. i love my carbs, but that seemed like overkill. will definitely come back to try breakfast.
