Pizza is so damn over-priced! I paid $13 for a small (10') pizza with sausage. It's good though but nothing special. I think a lot of people go there because it's just a cool place to go. Pizza, beer, dark ambiance, and your mix of young hot professionals and hipsters. I went on Karaoke Thursday night...it was super swell. Unfortunately, I was the only one buzzed out of my group. So yeah, it's your choice if you want to pay for over-priced pizza just because it's in a hip neighborhood and the pizza is cooked a high-heat oven. Please, that's common in Europe and I wish Margherita pizzas would be common because that's what I would've ordered if they had it. Sorry for the cynicism, I just don't it when people say "OMG! Their pizza is awesome." The best pizza I've ever had was from small parlor that had no seating in Dusseldorf, Germany. Like always, the best comes from the most unlikely places.
