Living at Milwaukee & Western, Irazu is one of our go-to take out spots for lazy nights, and it's always reliably delicious. Unfortunately, we still haven't tried any of the real entrees, because the sandwiches, burritos, tacos, sides (anything related to a plantain = delicious), and shakes are all so awesome and so affordable. The steak sandwich and steak burrito are particularly good, especially with the "add-ons" of avocado and those great spicy peppers. Service is also always great and friendly, despite the fact that they're constantly slammed. Expect a wait for a table though -- last night (a Tuesday around 8pm) I could barely get in the door to get my take-out! If you live close enough for delivery/pick-up it's a good idea until the patio opens when it's warm out.
