YUMMY!!! Janet W. and I came here on a Friday night to celebrate my birthday a second time. I had already invited her to my birthday dinner on the actual day, but she wanted to treat me out again... Why wouldn't I say yes? I'm all for celebrating my birthday multiple times. Anyway, the reservation was made for 830pm. She had bought a Groupon and wanted to use it. I arrived earlier than she did, and I got seated right away. The room they seated us in was small, and I felt a little clusterphobic, but it was nice and intimate. The Groupon was for a four-course meal, and we asked our server if we may substitute the salad for a second appetizer. He said it was fine. So for our appetizers, we ordered the cozze scoppiate--mussels sauteed in a red sauce--and bruschetta. Both were delicious. We also started with a glass of red, but I can't remember the name of it to tell you what it was. For our entrees, we ordered the zuppa di pesce--Sapori's classic seafood linguini pasta in a light red sauce--and the vitello ossobuco alla pugliese--slow cooked veal shank in a rich red sauce atop a meat lasagna. The seafood pasta was delicious, but the show-stopper was the latter dish. The veal was so tender and juicy. We shared both entrees, and we both agreed that the latter was our favorite. Then for our fourth course, we shared a tiramisu, as our server said that they have the best tiramisu in Chicago. I'm not a big fan of desserts in general so I don't know if it's the best in Chicago, but I agree that it was delicious. At the end of the meal, I filled out a comment card for the restaurant. Several weeks later, I received a hand-written thank-you card from the chef/owner with a $14.00 gift certificate (but I forgot to use it before the expiration date). Wow! That was completely unexpected. I'd love to visit again.
