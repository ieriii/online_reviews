At first Publican felt like it belonged in the German section of Epcot. The theme is very reminiscent of a German beerhall that everyone would attend during Oktoberfest. I'll give kudos to the fact that it stays true to that mentality. The waiting area is in the middle of the space surrounded by the communal tables and booths that diners are eating at. While you wait at waist-high tables you can sample beers from all over the world each served in their specific glass. I wasn't a fan that your drink bill cannot be forwarded to your eating bill though. We were seated at one of the communal tables with high back chairs which ensure you sit at a 90 degree angle. Even though the tables are communal, I never felt like I was interrupting the diners next to us. The place is loud though. You will have to speak up. I was with a party of six and it got difficult to hear people at times. Our server was very intelligent and friendly. He answered all of our questions and gave excellent reasons behind his recommendations. The menu itself needs work as their is not explanation as to which dishes are smaller and which are larger. Price doesn't help as some smaller dishes were the same price as larger ones. The dining is family-style which can be fun but also difficult. You have to hope everyone enjoys what's being ordered and that enough is ordered to feed everyone but not too much that you require a bank loan to pay your bill. Our party had many items. The frites with egg, the shrimp, the brussel sprouts, the pork belly, and a couple other items I can't recall. Everything tasted very good with some things (the frites for sure) standing out. I'd be happy to visit The Publican again for either a couple of drinks and apps with friends. The portions are too large to just go with the wife and I'd rather do tapas with friends than family-style dining. Good time but not worth a second trip.
