I had some friends come visit me the weekend of my graduation. But I live in a box (more suitably known as a studio) so there merely wasn't enough room at my place. Enter the Hyatt. I cannot complain when I was able to get it so cheap using Priceline. My friends had never been to Chicago, so the location was ideal, close to the Mag Mile, Millenium Park, all that touristy stuff they like to do...and it has a bar, so that was saving on cover to get into an overrated night spot. All in all, it was a nice place. I think we'll look for another hotel next time, just to have experienced more than one.
