I'm not crazy about this hotel. I'd describe it as "not bad". Just had a stay over last weekend after getting it on travelocity top secret. The staff was accommodating and the beds/pillows/sheets were very comfortable. There are lots of options for getting a corner room for no up-charge or a room with two bathrooms which is unique. However, the hotel is in need of renovation. The carpeting looks and smells old. From the moment we walked into our room it smelled strong of bad cleaner as if they were trying to cover something up. The bathroom is in serious need of updating, you could tell the drywall above the shower was repaired a few times and a couple spots of mold were forming in this area. The shower head was awful, it was clogged up/didn't spray water at all evenly and was in need of replacement. Also when the room next to us used their shower the plumbing was extremely loud. The gold fixtures in the bathroom and overall decor in the room is outdated. If you are a huge fan of traditional outdated decor then maybe you'd fall in love with this place but I just think there are so many more contemporary recently updated hotels in Chicago that this one will be marked off my list. Also wasn't crazy about staying south of the loop, a little more north of this area would've been preferable. At least it's just 2 blocks from the Harrison red line. Overall we had a nice time but I most likely would not stay here again.
