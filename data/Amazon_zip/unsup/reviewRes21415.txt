My roommate and I were starving, and we wanted good Mexican food, but didn't want to drive all the over to La Pasadita. She suggested heading over to Mayan Palace. They served chips and salsa, so we munched along while trying to decide on dinner. I stuck with the tamales. The rice and beans were so-so. But the tamales were fairly dry, and the pork was really stringy. It was a dry dish, which didn't sit well with me. Most of the tamales I've enjoyed were soft, hot, and tender. The one I was served was not. My roommate enjoyed her meal, though. I hope to come back and try other dishes because I feel like mine was just an unlucky experience. But it's cheap, so it wasn't like I was ripped off or anything either.
