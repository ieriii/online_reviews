Jamaican Flower? What the heck is that? Well, I'm still not really sure but I can tell you the Jamaican Flower margarita here is excellent. Along with the mango, raspberry... you get my drift. Tuesdays and Thursdays are half-price margaritas and man are they yummy. The food and service are good too. The only problem is that the restaurant is very small so I highly recommend making reservations.
