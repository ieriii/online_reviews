I have been waiting to go to Fronera Grill for quite a while. I love Rick Bayless, and had high expectations. I was completely disappointed with both the food and the service. I had a hair in my food and I told my server. Next, Jennifer (one of the managers) came over and told me that it was my hair. First of all, I am blonde and the hair was dark black. She was extremly rude and I had to almost fight to get a meal without a hair. Finally they gave me a new meal and it was not what I had the first time. I gave up and ate it anyways. I was completely unhappy with my experience and would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.
