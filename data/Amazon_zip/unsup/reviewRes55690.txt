I came here for my birthday with 5 other people and let me tell you you need more than 20 mins to look at the menu to choose what you would want to eat. I am indecisive and there were so many good options to choose from! I got the phillip's crab cake. It was good but the corn that came with it was amazing! It was like their own spin of elotes (corn with mayo, cheese, butter, chile). The crab cakes was a little dry but my niece had the ribs and that was really good as well! My borfriend got the pork chop because he is allergic to seafood and I would not reccomend it. It was a little on the plain side. Did I mention that it's BYOB? They have a lot of fancy beers and wines on the back for $6+ on the back of the menu but it isn't worth it. I had a Delirium which was 10$. I came on a Wednesday night but I made reservations earlier that day so I didn't have much of a wait.I do highly recommend this place if you are too lazy to drive out to the suburbs for Bob Chin's. The staff is friendly and the service was good.
