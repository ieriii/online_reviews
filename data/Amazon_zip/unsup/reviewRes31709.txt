I was excited to try the Country Fried "Steak" ($12.99) to compare and contrast it with the one I love back home at the Vita Cafe ($8.50) in Portland, OR. Both come covered in gravy and with a side of mashed potatoes, while the Diner's comes also with pesto sauteed vegetables. Though the veggies appeared to have green flecks on them, they only tasted steamed and so got mixed straight into the gravy for added flavor. As for the "Steak" itself, it was much thinner and less flavored then my usual depending more fully on the gravy to excite one's buds which it did easily. I also managed to steal some of the Nachos that my table mates had ordered and I'm thrilled to find Daiya making its way around the country and onto the food here at the Chicago Diner. I look forward to returning on day to try some of the sammys that were being brought to other tables. They appeared to be piles of food that greatly exceeded the description provided in the menu.
