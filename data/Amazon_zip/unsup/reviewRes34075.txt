I have been to this place a few times.. The last time I went with a friend.. I had the Risotto with vegetables from the appetizer selection. It was fresh but not very well cooked. One would think that al dente would be the most common way of cooking pasta! Anyhow, my friend had pasta also.. same thing not very well cooked!! I will go back here cause it has fresh food.. just not impressed from this last time
