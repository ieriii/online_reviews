Guess the bar was set way too high from the great experience at Ruxbin Chicago, The Purple Pig didn't impress. The beets salad was good - the pistachio bites brought out the earthy flavors of the beets; but our braised pork shoulder was too salty and inedible (though well aclaimed by others). Chef Bannos need to go light on the salt! We weren't up to challenge the chef since the time constraint of going to catch the Grant Park Music Festival. For the love of cured meat, we got the Purple Pig Platter, which was a treat, yet the Sopressatta did not excel those of Faicco's (Brooklyn, NY) You should definitely get the Lomo, which is the part of the pork tenderloin that will find you a chewy texture but pack with flavors. The roasted bone marrow was fattening and got a garlic kick but not impressive. Rather, their wine list was finely chosen.
