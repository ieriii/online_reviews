Not to many places in the south loop area that has a good breakfast but yolk so far has been one of the only places i have checked out. The food has been consistently good I have tried a few things and enjoyed everything. The pancakes are as good as anywhere I have ever eaten or better! Skillets have been very tasty and filling if your in the mood for something to fill your stomach. My only complaint is that the service has not been what I expect at a good breakfast joint specially when you are paying higher than normal prices for eggs and pancakes. The last 3 times going in I waited to long for the waitress to come up to me and ask me what i care to drink. As its early in the morning I would love to get that first cup of coffee. I have sat at the bar once and booths the other times and always had to wait like 10 mins to get some service and one time had to ask the hostess to send me a server. I will continue going to this place cause the People are friendly just not as attentive as I think they should be to paying customers. The food is great and always fresh and tasty. However if somewhere else were to open I would prefer to move on to another greasy spoon that serves you a cup of coffee in a reasonable amount of time.
