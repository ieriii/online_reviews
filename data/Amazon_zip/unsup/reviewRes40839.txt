One word - WOW!!! One of the best Groupon deals EVER!!! I'm so glad I scored this deal, but sad that I used it! :( The atmosphere is very intimate with the brick walls, soft lighting, and warm dark wood. It is a very small space, but I must admit there are a couple of tables in awkward places. I've seen tables closer together in bigger restaurants (where you feel like you're literally having dinner with your date and the table next to you bc there are only 2 inches between the tables), so since there was more than 12 inches between tables, it was comfortable. As far as the food goes, the course just got better and better. The different elements on the plates tasted good separately and blew your mind when you tried it all together. I love that the chef changes the menu regularly so you feel like you want to constantly go back and try whatever creation he has up his sleeve. One of the best part is that they are BYOB and you can bring any bottle you want. Of course, I would suggest looking at the menu beforehand and decide what you want to bring. I can't wait for the next time I'm there!
