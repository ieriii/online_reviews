Amazing LATE NIGHT SNACK experience! I arrived around 8:30 on a Saturday night to get some dinner before a show. Unfortunately there was a 90-minute wait (they don't take reservations), so I went elsewhere. After my show got out (SBTRKT killed it !) I rushed back here by 12:50am. The kitchen closes at 1am on Saturday so all was well. There was still a decent crowd in there but plenty of open seating.  The first thing I noticed on the menu was razor clams. I'd had these years ago in Spain and never thought I'd see them again. For $12 we got 5 nice-sized clams (these aren't ordinary clams, google them!). These were delicious and well-spiced but quite chewy. I'd definitely recommend them if you've never had em before. Next was some burrata (mozzerella cheese thing) with fennel and peas and other stuff ($11). It was freaking excellent. Our fun friendly server chick convinced us to get the housemade salted caramel ice cream ($7). It was a decent sized bowl and the ice cream was super smooth, more of a soft-serve consistency, and very delicious. We had awesome service and the food came out super quick, which is really appreciated at 1am. Purple Pig rocks!
