"Whatever, whenever!" What a lovely motto for a hotel chain! I'm loving my stay here, it's one of the few bright spots of the week. At first I was incredibly nervous, I had booked this place for a dozen executives and lawyers and I was afraid that it would be a little too funky for them.  The lobby, while very cool, is like walking into a night club. It didn't make the greatest first impression on the people I needed to impress. But that was the only speed bump. From that moment on, the absolute attention to service and detail has been amazing. Literally, pick up a "whatever, whenever phone" and they'll "grant your wish" as soon as possible. The staff at this hotel has made all of our stays wonderful. They've taken a lot of stress out of my life, and I'm grateful for that. If you're a lawyer coming into the area, the W is also incredibly close to the Federal Court House, which is why I picked the hotel. We've been able to get back to our hotel, have lunch and a little breather during the short lunches and breaks that we've had throughout the week. Great location and excellent service, hands down. As for the lobby / nightclub. While my bosses may have thought it was "too distracting" I was very happy to stroll through there every evening. Made me feel like I was taking a short break from all the craziness. And the waitresses... (sigh)
