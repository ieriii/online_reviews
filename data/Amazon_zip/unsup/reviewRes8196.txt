Everything about Fogo de Chao is amazing- the salad bar (that I could have happily made an entire meal of) is top notch, including artichoke hearts, palm hearts, and fresh mozzarella. But when it comes to the meat (on swords!), I knew I was in heaven. So much variety, and all of it exceptionally delicious. I tried almost everything before I was stuffed too full to eat another bite. My particular favorite was the filet mignon wrapped in bacon, but everything was amazing. If you're on a budget, lunch prices are about half the dinner price, but it's still all-you-can-eat... I can't wait until I have an excuse to go back!
