My husband and I have a delicious anniversary dinner at Sprout. Their $60 pre-fixe for three course is really quite moderate because it also includes a sorbet and a cheese course. We also added on wine pairings for $25/person and that was well worth it. I had the scallop appetizer while my husband had the egg. Both were delicious. For the main course, I had the rabbit and my husband had the lamb. Both were so delicious and tasty. The entree sizings were just right. You are not taking home leftovers after this meal, but instead leave pleasantly full. For dessert, I had the corn and my husband had the banana. I just had to try the corn because I couldn't imagine how corn might be made to be sweet, but the chef accomplished that beautifully. Probably one of the most unique desserts I've had, yet so pleasant and sweet. The ambiance in the restaurant is contemporary. The restaurant isn't huge, but it was full of people when we were there. Bustling, but not overly loud. The spacing between courses was perfect. What a delicious meal! There isn't anything I would change.
