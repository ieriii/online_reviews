We had to wait over an hour for a table because we had a large party-they don't have many large tables. Looking in the food through the window made us want to wait though. Everything they serve looks amazing. The staff was very apologetic for the long wait and gave our table some complementary pancakes-lemon/blueberry and carrot-cake (without any prompting or complaints from us). I tried my husbands omelet which was really good and I had the berry white chocolate french toast which looks better than it tastes. Next time I'm going for some of those amazing pancakes! TIP-if you have a long wait, go a few doors down to the air conditioned coffee shop.
