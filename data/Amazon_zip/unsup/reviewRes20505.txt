We had a terrific experience at Gage last night primarily because of fantastic service. We made a reservation at around 8pm for an 8:45 table. We arrived, the table was still occupied and was told it would be a few minutes. After a few minutes pass, the manager comes over, apologizes profusely, and asks if he can get us a round of drinks on the house while we wait. Um, sure! The wait had hardly been an issue, but his immediate offer to get us drinks was both unexpected and appreciated. As we're drinking our gratis cocktails, we look around, recognize that most people are in suits, tuxedos or nice dresses. We are dressy, but definitely in jeans - and about 20 years younger than the average midori sour sipping clientele. This again is where the service at Gage stands out - many other places would have snubbed their nose at a group of younger, underdressed clients. As we finish our drinks, the manager escorts us to the table, letting us know that he's already ordered appetizers for us, which should be arriving shortly. Again - more stars in my book for making us feel appreciated. The food throughout was really terrific. The mushroom toast with a poached egg was out of this world. My quinoa lobster dish was some of the best quinoa I've ever had. Fiance was singing praises about the homemade sausages. Our wines were terrific and interesting. All in all, a really enjoyable meal, and a great spot to return to in Millennium Park.
