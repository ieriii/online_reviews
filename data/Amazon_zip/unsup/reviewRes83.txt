I've delayed, and delayed writing this review. Because once I write it, the journey truly comes to an end. Okay, I'm being overly dramatic. If you decide to dine here, I would recommend making a special weekend out of it. I realize my review hasn't even gotten to talking about the meal, but build up to it by doing the following: - Go to the Art Institute - Visit a modern furniture store - Have a light lunch of a small sandwich We built an entire weekend around an appreciation of art and its process, and that's really what Alinea is. I mean, the crazy amount of ingredients in each dish is enough to leave your head spinning. I'm very grateful for the waiters who I think really add to the experience. Have fun, keep guessing. No need to panic about remembering what you ate, they'll give you a menu at the end. And don't blink at the bill even though it was the most expensive meal I'd ever had in my life so far. My photos can do more of the talking. No flash though, so I'm glad I brought my DSLR but the macro lens doesn't handle low light that well.
