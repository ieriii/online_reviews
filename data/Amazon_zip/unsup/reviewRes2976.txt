Service is impeccable. I have never seen such amazing service anywhere. When it comes to food, it has been designed for the palate that is not adventurous. Food is pretty bland. I personally like flavor and spice with my food and that is the only reason why I would not give this place 5 stars. Else it is a wonderful place for a dinner date!
