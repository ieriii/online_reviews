I LOVE the Reuben sandwich. AMAZING. Delicious. It even warms up well as leftovers. The mac and cheese works as a perfect side. And totally box half the sandwich because you'll want room for dessert. The chai shake is bang-on and I never even knew I liked carrot cake until I had the Chicago Diner's. And all of it is vegan. Smile and smile and smile. Avoid the weekends if possible, there can be a line out the door. Weekdays around lunch the wait isn't bad at all.
