Pretty solid. We ordered a thin and a stuffed pizza. Thin was just cheese, stuffed was sausage. I thought the sauce was super fresh tasting, not at all overwhelming. The cheese to crust ratio (which many places fail) was just right. And for some reason I was really in love with the taste of the sausage they use. I would bump it up one more star if the crust had been more memorable.
