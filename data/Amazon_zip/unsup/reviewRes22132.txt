A-OK is a good review of this place. When it comes to Greek food (besides in Greece) I am more of a fan of their appetizers vs. main entries. We were here last week and the 4 of us shared about 7 apps + a Gyros. This was PLENTY of food for everyone, thank god that they forgot to bring us tzatziki.  Some highlights - roasted beets (not sure how greek it is, but it was good), saganaki, grilled octopus, shrimp and anchovies Lowlights - soggy zucchini, gyros Service started out good, but we weren't even given any opportunities to get more then the original drink that we ordered.  Coffee arrived cold and dessert was A-OK, but nothing I would order again.  Try the restaurant next door for better luck...
