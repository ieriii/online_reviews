I like most of the food . They use fresh ingredients and it is tasty except I hate that ginger tea. Unfortunately ,I am allergic to something in that great sauce they use on the side. I love it but it gives me a migraine.I t is an attractive place and they play very nice ,interesting music. It is a great alternative to heavier chinese food. The lunch specials are very reasonable. Try it . There is usually parking during the day but beware the parking police are out in force.
