I got the groupon here. IT WAS SOOOOO WORTH IT. My friend and I went on a Monday so the 25 $ was worth 60$!!! It was absolutely amazing. We got two servings of the chocolate and cheese fondue so, we actually got full! We first ate the cheese fondue which it was so rich. You could taste the alchole in the cheese and it just gave it this unique flavor. Our waiter was amazing and everyone was so thoughtful and kind there. The atmosphere it absolutely amazing. It is very dim but I really like it that way. People were complaining that it smelled like oil. I honestly barely noticed it and when I did smell it, it smelt like home which I really loved. The groupon doesn't cover tax so we made the most out of our 60$ and we bought the gourmet board and we got three fancy cheeses with assorted meats and some apple slices and grapes. Our evening was absolutely magical. I will be honest the groupon saved us ALOT of money so the food is actually quite pricey. It's totally worth every penny though and I totally recommend anyone who has the time and cash to go here.
