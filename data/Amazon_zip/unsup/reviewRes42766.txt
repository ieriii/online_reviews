I have worked at Giordano's & grew up with the Italians in Bridgeport, I think I know my pizza. There isn't much that the Northside beats the Southside on in my book, but as long as Art of Pizza is up there they will have us beat in pizza! They have this awesome buttery crust without the cornmeal flakes that end up all over you, your couch, & your rug. Its a hole in the wall place, not grand dining room or wine list, but I'd rather have a beer at home sitting on my living room floor with a good movie and kick ass pepperoni pizza on the coffee table. The ribs are decent there too, and the Sunday dinner special makes it totally affordable!
