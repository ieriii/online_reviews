Maybe I should give Crisp another try because so many rave about it. But honestly, their wings underwhelmed me. I tried two varieties, the Crisp BBQ and the Seoul Sassy. The Sassy was, for me, almost inedibly salty and overseasoned with ginger. I love the ginger, but it's a potent little root and if you overdo it, you're asking for trouble. The Crisp BBQ was like a bland hybrid of American and Korean BBQ sauces. As a side, I got the fried mushrooms, which were soggy and rubbery in a way that made me pine for the fried mushrooms from Brown's Chicken, and if you get people pining for Brown's Chicken, somewhere along the way you've gone off the rails. When I crave wings, I instantly think of the honey sesame wings from Joong Boo market, which I hold as the gold standard, and Crisp just didn't make the cut.
