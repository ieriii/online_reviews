Ok, I've been to this restraunt countless times over the years and really have enjoyed my experieces...however, my last several encounters have change my mind. I used to love the vegetarian specials they had, which are now no longer. Heck I still daydream about the veggie "meat"loaf they served. The menu was appealing to anyone I brought there. Now, the menu is more of a sanwich joint without any real selection of entrees. In a city as great as Chicago with all of the AMAZING restraunts...this just isn't one of them anymore.
