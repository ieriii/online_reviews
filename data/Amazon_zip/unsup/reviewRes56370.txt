I love this place. I have been there twice and the owner remembered me and greeted me like if I was a long term customer which I will become. As soon as my friends and I sat down, the waiting staff greeted us very pleasantly and enthusiastic. Not only were the dishes hot, large and delicious but the waiter brought us a dish on the house. I guess because the owner recognized us. At the end of the night we were very stuffed. The atmosphere of this restaurant made us feel very relax and enjoy our food even more.Not only the owner is passionate about the restaurant but also very adorable and friendly. The waiting staff was excellent. For anyone that has not tried Vietnamese cuisine I definitely recommend this restaurant so you could have a good first time experience. For those that have tried Vietnamese cuisine definitely check out this place and if this restaurant becomes one of your favorites which for us has become you might get a free dish which means great free food and you cant beat that. Overall this place is Fantastic
