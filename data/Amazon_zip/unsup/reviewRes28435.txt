I know so many people who love this place. Can't explain it. I think it's like eating a week old unsugary cake with a too sweet pizza sauce and too much cheese on top. The crust is as thick as your wrist and the cheese gets all burnt around the sides of the pan. The service blows.  Like a couple of other places I've eaten, they employ good looking entitled hipsters who seem to think they're 'above' the job they're doing but not so above it that they choose to eat from the dumpster in the back.
