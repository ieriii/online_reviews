If you look at all the reviews, they are mainly by non-asians/non-viets, which is completely fine because food is suppose to appeal to a vast audience. But Tank Noodle lacks the depth, taste, and flavors of a truly delicious Vietnamese meal. Noodles are overrated. I get sick of eating their pho after 2 bites. As another reviewer has said, Cafe Hoang is where to go for Bun Bo Hue. As for Pho, Pho Viet and Pho 777 are pretty decent. I've heard Pho Lily's broth is pretty good but I have to go try that for myself. Or head away from Argyle and experience great food and service from Simply It. Their rice dishes and appetizers are okay as well as their bubble tea. Service is obviously very lacking. If you're a Vietnamese food noob, yes, go try Tank Noodle, but then please go try the other restaurants that have more flavor for your noodles!!!
