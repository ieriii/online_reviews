I don't know if it was the time of day or cause I bought it by the slice but my experience wasn't as awesome of an experience as I was hoping it to be. I had a pizza in the afternoon and it was the only slice left on the rack. It was pretty good but unfortunately I wasn't as impressed by the pizza as most reviews have been.
