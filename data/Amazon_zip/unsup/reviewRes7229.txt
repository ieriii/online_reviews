It was kind of just ok. Great setting - love the decor more than the food. Friend aw it on "Check Please" and wanted to go check it out. Service was good - it was not crowded at all at lunch on a Tuesday,. I love pickles, so I loved the bread and butter pickles at the table and now I need to go home and make some. Also need to figure out the pickled onion served with the entre.. red wine vinegar, oregano and....??? The chips were ok. We had the hush puppy appetizer. May be it was an "off" day. They were very dray and fell apart. he chipotle sauce was way too spicy for me. I had chopped Kobe beef brisket with coleslaw. My friend ordered a side of mac-n-cheese to share. The chopped brisket just can not be eaten as a sandwich. The chunks fall out all over - and it is A LOT of meat on the bun. I just ate the meat. The meat is dry rubbed and you add your choice of sauce to it. I tried the 3 not spicy ones. Did not like the vinegar ones at all, although I do make my own pulled pork with a vinegar sauce. This was too tart for me - a person who can suck a lemon. I settled for the mild sauce. HUGE helping of coleslaw that I could not finish as much as I love coleslaw. It was a lot of food for a very good price. And they have a great fixed price lunch special. But it was just mediocre. Not having the meat cooked in the sauce just does not give the meat a full flavor. The mac-n-cheese was watery, and I am not a fan of mac-n-chese anyway. Too full to even try a dessert as tempting as derby pie was. So, it's decent food for a good price.
