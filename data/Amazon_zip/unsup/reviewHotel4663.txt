http://Hotels.com was $134/night. I called the hotel and asked them what a rate would be and I averaged $108/night. It always pays to call the hotel directly. The room was small but I really didn't care. I'm hear for business and a hotel is generally a place to relax and sleep after meetings. I'm not moving in! It was very clean, the vibe was young, hip and the front desk service, cleaning staff and guys out front were STELLAR. The young lady who I checked in with, Noemi(spelling?) was very cordial and VERY HOT! I'll be back in Chicago several times over the next 6 months and I plan to stay at Hotel Felix again. Oh yeah! FREE WIFI! That was awesome. What a great touch. So many hotels charge from $10 - 30/day which i ridiculous!! Free wifi is awesome!
