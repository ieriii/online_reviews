The staff was friendly and helped me make my choice between Masman and their Peanut Lovers dish. The nice waiter recommended since I was an out-of-towner that I should not leave Chicago without trying their signature Peanut Lovers dish with Beef. I openned my dinner with Peanut Lovers Springrolls and Pot Stickers. I only wish their sampler appetizer platter had more flexibility. Yelp reviews raved about the Crab Ragoon but 8 of them just seemed too many. Prices are excellent for all of their appetizers.
