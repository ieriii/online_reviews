Pizza with wonderbread dough... Not cool. Baguette style bread with Med. spreads... A little odd. Meditteranean salad... Suspicously like a plain iceburg lettuce American salad. Greek desserts... A little too moist and heavy instead of light and dry-ish. Individual parts were tasty, but when put together were not right. Am I just spoiled?
