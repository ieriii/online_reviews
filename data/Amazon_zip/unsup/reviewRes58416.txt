If I were to die tomorrow and asked what I wanted as a last meal,  I would go here and order their pork chop. The Best pork chops I've ever tasted in the city. First went here for my birthday as a gift from my little brother. I was curious about the place since I walked by it a thousand times. Once you walk in the atmosphere quickly changes. Very pleasant. The menu can slightly be compared to Sabor Y Cuba on Wilson and Wolcott but more upscale and expensive. This has become one of our parents-nite-out spots. scale: 1-10atmosphere: 9 (dining area tends to be too dark for my liking but eyes adjust after a while).Beverages:7 Great imports selection but mojitos are overrated and to expensive.Food: 9 Best pork chops in the world. Good Cuban selection.When coming here I highly advice you to make reservations.Can be nice for kids but I wouldnt recommend. Parking will be an issue.
