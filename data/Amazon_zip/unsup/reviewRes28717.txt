I really can't believe this place is rated 4 stars. It really, REALLY is not that good people. The only reason I might give it 2 stars, and not 1, is that it is pretty cheap and my waitress was cool. But I'm not. The food is just bad. It seriously tastes like frozen food... no joke. I don't think they actually prepare anything in the kitchen from fresh foods. There's just no way! I couldn't even eat half my meal, and I always clean my plate. I would rather have bought a Stouffers mac and cheese dinner and eaten it at home... it would have tasted better and been more satisfying. Maybe everyone rating this place comes from suburbia (or something) and has never had real, or even half-decent, Italian food before... and I feel bad for them. There is some damn good pasta in this city and this is not it. Update: Literally a couple hours after I post my review, someone comes along and gives it 5-stars, calling it the best Italian in Chicago and comparing it to Francesca's??? Unbelievable. Someone must be getting paid to write these laughable reviews because that just is NOT true. Trust me, Francesca's is on an entirely different level that the Pasta Bowl will never reach.
