Over all it was a nice hotel, but nothing special in my opinion. The hotel appears to be fairly classy with a swanky lobby. The hotel floors are reminiscent of a maze, having to pay close attention to signage in order to get to and fro. The rooms are nothing to write home about, at least the standard room. 2 beds, dresser, closet, tv, etc. The bathroom was exceptionally small, but it is an old building, so I'll over look it. During my stay I didn't try the either the bar or restaurant, but it is close to plenty of other options one can choose to eat and drink at.
