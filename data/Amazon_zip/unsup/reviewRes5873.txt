I'm really sad to be reading some of these bad reviews because I am in LOVE with this place and I cannot stop thinking about returning. I was a little annoyed when I walked in and asked to be seated for 6, but there were only 4 of us. I notified the hostess that the other 2 were walking down the street because they parked the car. She said that we had to wait until the entire party was here which would have been fine if it was busy, but it was Monday night and there were about 20 patrons total in the place....come on.... But I wasn't about to let her ruin the experience. I was captivated by the food.... We started off with prosciutto and some cheeses which were excellent and made me feel like I was in Italy at a local bar. Next, we had the bread with honey and ricotta...delicious My favorite dish was the toast with melted Fontina cheese, egg yolk, and asparagus....I have been dreaming about it. I was a little hesitant to try some of the dishes because a lot of them contain runny egg yolks which I hate. But I tried everything and it was still amazing. Then we had polenta with braised beef and it was delicious Lastly, we had spaghetti with sea urchin which was interesting, I think I would order it again...the raviola which I don't recommend because it is small and the flavor wasn't that amazing that I would recommend it....and the risotto carbonara. They charge a $7 corkage fee which is annoying.... Our hostess was super nice and honest about what she liked on the menu and recommendations. As someone else mentioned in another review, servers wear street clothes and it is quite weird. The atmosphere is really cute in there with candles in the mason jars, but the server in jeans, gym shoes, and a t shirt looked like she belonged at Applebee's. Anyhow, I will be returning VERY soon because I cannot stop thinking about the food and raving to everyone I know
