This is one of the best places I have ever went to in all of my travels! The food and service is top rate! It is not cheap but once you taste the filet mignon you won't care what it costs! This is the place to go for that great dinner celebration! They will give you a small round coaster and one side is green for MORE food and on the other side is red for I'M STUFFED PLEASE STOP! :) They offer you many meat choices and like Stephanie said STAY AWAY from the salad bar! Eat to your heart's content and then save a small amount of room for the dessert. You are going to want to have that brownie dessert it is out of this world! Even my boss who doesn't eat desserts took too much of it! LOL
