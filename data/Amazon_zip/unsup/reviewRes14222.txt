This place is incredible if you like fish. In fact, I would say it's about as good as it can get without catching it yourself. I've been here numerous times and regularly take guests there for dinner. I highly recommend the rainbow trout though everything I've had has been noteworthy. You cannot go wrong but make sure you have a reservation. The seating area is small.
