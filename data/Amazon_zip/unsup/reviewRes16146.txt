Mama Mendez' Arroz Con Mariscos (paella) garners practically all the stars for this review. Its like a seafood bomb went off in the dish. Also, the tuna ceviche (almost sashimi-esque in presentation) is great. If you're a big cured meat and cheese fan, start off with the appetizer platter..lots of salty goodness to wash down those mojitoes or horchatatinis. my grilled pork chop while good, probably would have tasted better if i didn't go all nutso on the appetizers/ceviches/paella/my dinner napkin beforehand.
