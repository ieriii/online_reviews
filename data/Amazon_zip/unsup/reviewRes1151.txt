As we waited in line for 20 minutes, nervously wondering if bringing Dan's mom here was a mistake, a car drove by. The passenger leaned out the window and yelled "hey morons, they're just hot dogs!" Um, no sir they are not. Well, okay maybe if you just ordered a hot dog it really would be "just a hot dog" but with the amazing daily specials, why on earth would you do that? Mother in law went from skeptism (I'll just have a Coke) to hope (well, maybe we could split something) to belief (the ostrich sounds good) to devotion - she loved every bite and said she'd definately like to come back. We all tried bites from each other - the ostrich was amazing, the brandy fig duck with goat cheese was awesome, the blue cheese pork sausage was excellent and cheesey. My greek with skordalia and cheese (I asked for no olive tapanade) was the only thing less than amazing. It was still very good, but I learned that you don't mess with Doug's creations - order them as is. Service was great - Doug charmed my mother in law - the line moves quickly, and drink refills are free. Yeah it's not all that cheap is you are thinking that they are "just hot dogs" but $7 for some gourmet encased meats is a deal.
