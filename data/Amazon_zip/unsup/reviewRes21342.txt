This is my FAVORITE Mexican restaurant!! All of the staff here are very nice. Tuesdays & Thursdays, they have 1/2 price house margaritas-amazing!! I always get the spinach quesadillas-they are sooo good! It looks small on the outside, but there is a back room with a bunch more tables. They also have a couple tv's back there that are usually have sports games on. I definitely recommend going here!
