Here's the rundown: You're going to wait for a really long time. And you're going to be glad you did. We ordered: - Duck sausage w/ black truffle aioli and foie gras - Chipotle Chicken sausage w/ pineapple-kiwi salsa and habanero jack cheese - Classic Chicago dogs - and of course, Duck Fat Fries All of it was amazing! And Doug is the sweetest guy ever and threw in free sodas for us, just because. The wait was somewhat grueling, but totally worth it. I can't wait to get back to Chicago again for another trip to Hot Doug's!
