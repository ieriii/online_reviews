Yummy!!! Love this place! Skillets, omelettes, french toast, pancakes, and juices are all good. Best breakfast in town in my opinion and they use a lot of organic ingredients which is thumbs up in my book! The service is pretty good too. Juice is fresh pressed/squeezed so is delish! A friend told me about this place and now it is my go to for breakfast. Never had lunch so can't comment on that, but love that they serve breakfast all day as it is my favorite meal. It is a little tight and they are usually pretty busy, but worth it.
