Not quite sure what people like about this place. There is nothing special about this hot dog. I actually went twice just to make sure I didnt catch them on a bad day but it was the same, very crappy food and overrated. See my other hot dog reviews to see what place to go to for a real Chicago style hot dog. Frank Campeglia (The Food Club)
