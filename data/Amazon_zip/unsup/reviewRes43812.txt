healthy + delicious + fresh! my girlfriend and i went to chicago for vacation last winter and we traveled in the snow from our hotel in rosemont to come here- a grand total of 3 visits! we love this place- we wanted to bring you home with us- you should expand and have a location in southern california! we went here for brunch during all 3 visit: here were what we ordered + strongly recommend you try! 1. stacks of peach pancakes 2. salmon + cucumber + cream cheese bagel 3. homemade granola yogurt + fresh fruits 4. the mexican omelette thing 5. cappuccino [they make the cute lil heart swirl for you, its so cute!] the only downside was the wait, we heard its always busy, but its worth the wait. wait time could range from 30-90mins, depends on your luck. but even though its busy, service is great and they make sure you get everything you need without rushing you out.
