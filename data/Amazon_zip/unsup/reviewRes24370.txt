First the good: Service was solid and attentive without being obtrusive. The live flamenco was a nice touch and it definitely was a romantic venue. BUT, the food was terrible. The cheese fondue course was not gruyere and ementhaler but rather tasted like cheese whiz and roux with the kirsch and white wine. The chocolate fondue tasted like warmed Hershey's syrup. The meat seafood course did not save the day reaching the oxymoronic pinnacle of mediocrity. Our theory, given the large number of tables that seemed to have a GroupOn, is that the kitchen decided to skimp on ingredients to make up for the lost leader, which in any case marks it as a restaurant on the decline. In this time of excellent, accessible fine cuisine, Geja's only proves that those unable to adapt deserve their extinction. I really hate to say this, given my aversion to chain restaurants, but the Melting Pot does a far, far better job when it comes to fondue.
