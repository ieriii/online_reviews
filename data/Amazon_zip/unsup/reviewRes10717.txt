4.7 This place is super yummy, but it can sometimes be hard to get to the yummy part with such a long wait. There are no reservations and the wait usually averages between 45 minutes and an hour and thirty minutes. I've tried pinning down the perfect time to get there, but have not yet succeeded. The vibe is warm and the staff is nice. My absolute favorite it the BLT Benedict. They also have a tremendous selection of pancakes (think Banana White Chocolate Macadamia Nut pancakes).  My suggestion? Put your name in and go wait at the Wormhole, a cafe next door with excellent drinks, Nintendo and all sorts of 80's memorabilia. Nintendo makes the wait less painful :)
