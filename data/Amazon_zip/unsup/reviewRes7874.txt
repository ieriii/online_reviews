What in the world can I add about this place that hasnt already been said? I am tired. Physically tired. My stomach is currently digesting so much meat it doesnt know what to do. I think I want to be sick, but then I think of how awesome the food tasted and how I would never waste such deliciousness. Apparently they have a salad bar somewhere in that place. It's supposed to be pretty good, if you eat that kind of stuff. Actually, I did try it. Had a small plate of some salad to put some padding in my stomach for the couple pounds of meat I was soon going to be devouring. The chicken salad I mistakenly picked up ( i thought it was potato salad) was incredible! Then the devouring began. They bring to your table the most delicious little rolls that taste like a piece of heaven (or a mini croissant) as well as fried bananas and polenta and some awesome mashed potatoes. And those sides rotate throughout the whole meal Literally, there were 10 of us at our table, and as soon as we sat down with our salad plates, we were MOBBED by guys with meat on sticks. Anything you can think of - lamb, pork, chicken, beef, more beef, even more beef. All cooked to the perfection you desire. The flavor was so intense there is no need for any type of additional seasoning in this place. Furthermore, It would be almost sacralige to taint the perfection that is this meat! Trust me, I know meat. I wasn't 300 pounds pounds back in the day because I lived at the salad bar. I know how to pack the good stuff in, and Fogo has it. This place is worth every cent you pay here and the service is extraordinary. They are very attentive to the needs at everyone at your table and go above and beyond to satisfy you. I will be back, oh yes, I will be back.
