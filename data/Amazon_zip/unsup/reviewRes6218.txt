Fantastic! I haven't reviewed anything in a long time, but i just had to for this place. we had the "whim" which was pork brined for 2 days, then chopped up and confit in duck fat, with fried brussel sprout leaves and truffle frites. wow! we also had one of the wood-fired pizzas with foraged mushrooms, cheese and fried leeks. amazing!  great service, great atmosphere, good weekly specials. go now!
