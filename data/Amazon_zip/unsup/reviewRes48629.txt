Returned to the Publican several weeks ago and was blown away. The beer list is truly amazing--and that compliment is coming from a self-professed beer snob. Menu highlights for me were the Boudin Blanc (extraordinarily delicious), Potee, and (believe it or not) a walleye fish special. I love fish but have gravitated away from most fresh water fish--this was a welcome surprise!  I am increasing my rating from 3/5 to 4/5 stars. Highly Recommended.
