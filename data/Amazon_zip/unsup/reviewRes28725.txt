Absolutely adore this spot - so perfect for brunch after a night out. My experiences have been varied on service, but not on food - it is great. It is nuevo-Mexican, and done very well. Excellent presentation, style and flavor. Even the variation on service is between very good and great, so I'm not complaining. One of the things I like the range of spice levels offered, multiple salsa options from mild to spicy, but all flavorful, and dishes prepared with spiciness matching the ingredients. It is rare, and appreciated. I just wish they had more tables - make a reservation! It can be tough to get in, but totally worth it. This is a must stop for me when in Chicago.
