okay i need to add that servers melissa c & irish kathy are kick ass! the winter menu is amazing. the breakfast is also amazing. i can't say enough GREAT things about this place. just go here! order what ever you want and know that you are helping the people of chicago and not city hall. Please go here a lot and order. 2 ppl with drinks for dinner will not go over $100 pre-tip. help out mark & his wife! they deserve so much more than what has been said about them. enjoy it yo! and please help single moms...make it rain! peace!
