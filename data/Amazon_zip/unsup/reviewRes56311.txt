WOW!!!we came in as a group of 17 people last weekend and it was just superb. I made reservations for my birthday a week in advance and as we came in our table was set and ready for my friends and I.BYOB is definitely a plus here, I love the option of bringing your own--for free! Onto the food, it was excellent. Lemongrass beef, avocado wontons, callamari salad and seafood eggrolls. With my personal entree I had a nice hot bowl of their Beef Noodle soup. Service was also excellent, very attentive, kept good care of us, and seemed very friendly. They also put birthday candles on my cake, turned off all the lights in the dining room and sang Happy Birthday to me, what other restaurant does that?!?! It was so fun!! The atmosphere of the restaurant was busy, but I love the decorations of the restaurant. This place is just awesome! first time being here and I love vietnamese food now. Simply It! --- is Simply Amazing.
