Choosing the right time to go is important if you want to soak in the atmosphere of this great place. I have gone around 10:45 to 11:15 and have enjoyed a no line wait. In order to compare HD's to other hot dog stands, you need to get the regular chicago dog. However, there is nothing wrong in getting one of the specials. I recently tried the Jack Daniel's dog which had pork and anchovy sauce. The dog was cooked perfectly, a tender meat inside surrounded by a crisp skin. It is covered in smoked swiss cheese, so it was a bit much. I would recommend the cheese fries if you don't mind feeling heavy afterwords. Skip the fountain soda's and get a Dr. Brown's Cream Soda. Remember to tip.
