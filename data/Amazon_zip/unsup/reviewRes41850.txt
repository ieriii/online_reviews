Came here on a Friday night and the place was buzzin'. We showed up at 7:45 for an 8pm reservation and they were able to seat us immediately, which was great. Would describe the ambience as swanky, romantic, with a bit of mystique since it's so dark. Based on other Yelper's recommendations we ordered the Truffle Pasta, the Pork Belly, and a side of Blackened Cauliflower. The Truffle Pasta was absolutely AMAAAAZING and to die-for, on the heavy side but that's what made it so heavenly! We were not as impressed by the pork belly, which was a bit overcooked and not very flavorful. The side of cauliflower was amazing, had just the right amount of texture and complimented nicely by red onions. From the cocktail menu, I had the Pimm's Cup which was very yummy and refreshing. Our waiter was super attentive and friendly. Overall a great dining experience, would highly recommend for both date nights or groups of friends.
