I just created a yelp account for the purposes of reviewing this place-- to contribute to the choir singing praises! Last night, my boyfriend and I got engaged and wanted to celebrate somewhere new, intimate and upscale but still affordable for us. (The BYOB option sealed the deal on Bonsoiree) We are new to Chicago so it was a crapshoot... and we couldn't have chosen a better place. Everything, from the food to the service, was absolutely impeccable. Our waiter knew we were there for a special occasion and offered us a tasting off the menu. Everything was made extra special for us-- we were treated like VIP guests the whole night. I recommend this place highly!
