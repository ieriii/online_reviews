Worst staff ever. I tried calling a guest there and was 1) transferred to the front desk, where no one picked up 2) told they didn't stay there 3) transferred to a Hyatt operator who wasn't even in the hotel 4) finally transferred to her room, without an apology I just lost 30 minutes to the incompentence of this staff.
