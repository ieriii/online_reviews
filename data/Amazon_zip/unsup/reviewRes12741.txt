Excellent experience!!! Salad bar is very good, the Brazillian vinagrette is too liquidy so use sparingly. Lobster bisque is top notch! Meat selection is better than Fogo. Includes Lamb (leg and chops) (mint sauce is on the salad bar). It is not cheap by any means. Good for a special occasion or if you have money to burn. Decor and atmosphere is very nice, high ceilings and large visible wine rack behind glass. They have a acrobatic girl on a trapeze to retrieve bottles (neat show)!
