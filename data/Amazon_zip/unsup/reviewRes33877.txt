This is another one of my favorite neighborhood places. I often take out of town guests here for dinner. This place has great drinks and good food. I've never had a bad meal here. In the summer I enjoy sitting outside on the back patio. The only draw back to this place is it's small and can get quite loud during peak times. If your looking for a great meal, look no further, you will not be disappointed.
