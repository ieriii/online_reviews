I have been to Wilde more than a dozen times, and it never fails to impress me. The space is absolutely gorgeous with dark wood and comfortable seating -- you'd never know this used to be a hardware store. The food is consistenty good (a step above basic pub grub, but not quite fine dining). And the service is tremendous! It almost seems like they are over-staffed. They don't hover over you, but when you need something, they're there. Keep it up ... I'll be back on a regular basis.
