I went to Sprout just before Christmas, when the whole wait staff was wearing cheesy Christmas sweaters. It was cute. Half of our party had been to Sprout before, and I was looking forward to our meal. And I wasn't disappointed. I started with the Licorice. Yummy and light. There was a light soup before I received my Onaga fish dish. Again, yum. The little grilled cheese in between was good. And my corn dessert was wonderful. My husband, who's vegetarian, started with the fennel. His vegetable main dish ended up being the favorite of the table. And he chose the lemon dessert, which he loved. The only thing I would say is that we went with the wine pairings for each course. And, to be honest, I wasn't impressed. I didn't feel the pairings really added to my meal. In the future I'd probably just choose my own wine. Sprout was a fun and delicious experience. Try it!
