Went to Chicago for my cousin's graduation last month. Never really been a fan of brunch places, but when my sister recommended Yolk, might as well try it if we have no where else to go... Yelped this place on my phone and saw the red velvet french toast on the menu. Can it be true? My two favorite sweet cravings mixed into one dish?! YES!!!!!!! Got a seat, didn't even need to look at the menu.. I ALREADY knew what I was going to order (but needed to wait for my sister and parents to decide while thinking to myself: *time's a wastin'... I want to try this amazing concoction NOW!*). I also ordered a raved about item on the menu: strawberry orange juice.. nothing too spectacular. It's orange juice... with a strawberry flavor.... Waited awhile... and ALAS, 3 red velvet french toast swirls with cream cheese frosting was served in front of me. How'd it taste you may ask? AS DELICIOUS AS IT SOUNDS... so delicious I don't remember what my parents and sister ordered.. but I'm pretty sure it was good too.... :/ Yolk, your red velvet french toast will be one of the reasons I'll come visit Chicago again! *swoons* *warning* if you are not a sweets person like myself, this dish might be TOO sweet for your liking (as my mom claims.... )
