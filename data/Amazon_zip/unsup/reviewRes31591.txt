I was looking forward to this place. The menu looked excellent. The food was ok. Great ideas, badly executed. The service was really good though and their drinks were decent. The food was rather bland...actually, very bland. The devil's wok was very badly executed. The softshell crab was tasteless and the pool of fried dried chillies were a waste. The crunchy sushi was blah, even though the chef is suppose to be known for this style of sushi. I don't think I'll be going back.
