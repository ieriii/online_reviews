Beer's equivalent to Metropolis. If you have never consumed a Kwak out of the beeker shaped glass, you haven't lived. The expensive beers should not turn you off. These are beers to be EXPERIENCED not just drunk. Oh and you will be drunk off of just one, with average alcohol content levels of 9%!Try the Ham sandwich, which will blow you mind. Even Mama Kass says Eat Up.
