New burger place, with a clear attempt to compete with that japanese named bear place? Had to check it out and see how it did. Thursday night, fast sit down, smiles all around from waitresses and bar. My fiancee thought that I got great customer service, but specifically me. Maybe it was the afterwork suit. Maybe Barney Stinson has got it right. Suit up. Got myself an Arson burger (which the waitress stated wasn't too hot). She was dead on. If you're a heat junkie, this is not going to satisfy you. If you just want some light heat to add a little *zing* to your burger, this will do it. And I'm talking just a tiny smidge of *zing*. Medium rare, made perfectly (pink in the middle, dark on the edges), the burger was tasty and enjoyable. Fiancee got a big house (which I would've gotten if she didn't), and we thought this one was definitely a better burger. Bacon, aged cheddar, some decent BBQ sauce... this is how I like my burgers. Ingredients tasted good alone, and worked well on the burger as a whole. Ordered well, no pink. But the ingredients of the burger made it excellent. The pretzel buns were dense and large, which is great if there's a lot of burger juice to absorb or a larger amount of sauce to get absorbed. And while the burgers were juicy, it was not to the point that it balanced out the density of the bun. Mac and cheese was tasty. Fries were standard. I have to admit, I do like places that read their Yelp reviews and make changes... on my visit, there was no fog machine, and no seizure inducing green laser lights. I'll hope they continue to improve by taking suggestions from their patrons. Verdict: A fine burger, and without the 3 hour wait, an excellent choice. But ultimately, the other place still has a better burger/build and likely a more memorable food experience. This ain't no slouch, but it's not the champion yet either... We'll be back when the craving for a burger hits!
