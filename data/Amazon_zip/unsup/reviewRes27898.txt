Went on a Saturday before noon and it was crowded! I had the carne asada, my GF had the asada de puerco and her daughter had the pollo en mole. My carne asada was very tasty and my GF loved her asada de puerco and said that this was now her favorite Mexican restaurant! Their tortillas seemed like they were either homemade or made at the tortillaria on the same block. The horchata was also good. Getting the complimentary appetizer in addition to salsa and chips is also a nice touch.
