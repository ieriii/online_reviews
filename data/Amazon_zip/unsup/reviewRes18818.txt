I went here last night, amidst the "blizzard" that struck Chicago, to meet a few friends for drinks and dinner. I'll hit on a few topics: Beer / drink list: Excellent, plenty to choose from (micros to belgians, etc.), and prices were very reasonable (2 micros on the menu were $3.50/pint!) Food: We ordered burgers and a PB&J; The Big Texan & The Slow Burn for the burgers. My buddy didn't love his PB&J; it had raspberry jam that was a bit too tart for his tastes. The burgers were both excellent - meat was great quality, thought out toppings, and size. Fries were golden, crispy, and well seasoned. Also - when I asked for hot sauce to add to my ketchup (try it!), I was provided with Tabasco, Cholula, and Tapatio - wonderful. Service: There weren't too many people around because of the snow, but our server was pleasant, chatty, and attentive. Ambiance: Cool lighting, decorations, VERY spacious, very neat little back room area, and AWESOME MUSIC. LOVE THE PLAYLIST! Overall a very solid 4 stars. I'll be back for sure.
