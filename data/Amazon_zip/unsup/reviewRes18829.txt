So my boyfriend and I were very excited to try this place and given the burger craving hit yesterday we went. Also given it has great reviews from Time Out Chicago and Chicago's Best we thought this place would be great. Meh. 1 star for the AWESOME bartender who went above and beyond to make our little one at home. Since it was lunch time and there were only a dozen or so patrons she had the time to do so and while we didn't expect it it totally made our day. 1 star for the extensive beer list. And we didn't even drink. Now for the bad. Our waitress...delivered the food and then never checked back in. Our burgers were raw in the middle ordered medium and we waited 10 minutes to try to find her and get things rectified, but given she was no where to be found we decided to eat. Both of us left a round bloody piece of meat on our plates and she didn't ask how things were or even notice this when clearing our plates. This is also the kitchen's fault for not knowing how to cook a burger. I mean come on, this is a burger place!! All being said I would rather spend my $$ at Riverview or Murphy's for burgers. I may be back to drink though when it is warmer out.
