My new favorite restaurant! Everything here was perfect. Amazing outdoor seating in the heart of the Gold Coast. Wonderful wine list and very helpful staff who actually suggested a more reasonable bottle of wine than the one we were considering. The food was just perfect and presentation was right on. I honestly adored everything that we ate, and we ate a lot! I have to say it was very reasonable as well. I will definitely be back a lot this summer...what a great place!!
