Hopleaf has a beer selection so large it could throw indecisive people into a choice stupor. They have a lot of Belgians, but I'm not so much into that sort of thing. I tend to order Jever, my overall favorite pilsener (I have other favorite pilseners depending on the circumstances and location of purchase), which is not that easy to find, but which possesses a flavor surpassing all others. The superb bartenders know their beers and if you look bewildered enough, or know nothing of beers beyond the additive-laden, American varieties of pale lager, they may let you taste one of the ones you're interested in before you commit to a full glass. If you are not interested in beer, they can accommodate you as well, with many liquors to choose from. I've never bothered hanging out in a any room but the one in front, and I've never eaten more than fries here (which are very good, but simply not what I like in fries, though I do like the garlic mayonnaise/aioli stuff), though I might some day. The lack of televisions is a nice touch, as is the absence of loud music (though it gets noisy enough without it). This brings me to my last point- the only reason I knocked off a star: jackass patrons. Don't come here just because a lot of the beers have a high alcohol content. Further, don't order the beer with the highest alcohol content just because it has the highest alcohol content (it's not that good). It just means you're going to be a lot louder than you need to be for the room size. And it shows your lack of taste and refinement. Not to mention you will end up spending more money, for no good reason.
