Really dig this place. Great wine selection, as a review noted, very reasonably priced. Food was good, also. Loved the atmosphere there.  We ordered flank steak and risotto. Both were delicious. The beet salad was not good, but I think perhaps I'm not a beet person. Be prepared for a long wait. We waited 2 hours on a Friday night, but didn't mind. You can have drinks in the neighborhood and the hostess will call you when your table is ready. Our male waiter was a drama queen, for no reason. Other than that, excellent experience.
