Over the Labour Day Weekend last year I was visiting Chicago and went to San Soo Gap San after a volleyball tournament. I recently moved to Chicago, and over THIS Labour Day Weekend my friends and I wanted to try out a different Korean BBQ joint after the tournament. I was looking up places within walking distance from my apartment and had completely forgotten where San Soo Gap San was, or even its name. So after walking two miles, fate would have it that we arrived at the crowded doorway of San Soo Gap San--again. But the second time around was just as good as the first time. The wait was long, but worthwhile, and the service got progressivly better throughout the night. I'm not going to comment too much on the food because it's simply good Korean food. It's not great--I've had better and much better (I would give it 3 1/2 stars, but since I can't, I don't think I could round up for this joint). But it's a good place for a fix if you live nearby. There's always a lot of Korean patrons, which is always a good sign that the food is at least 3/4 authentic. If you're looking, however, for fine dining and/or some place romantic, then keep looking.Cheers.
