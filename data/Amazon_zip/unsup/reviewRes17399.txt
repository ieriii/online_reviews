I would have to give this place a 4 based on the fun atmosphere in a cool space. Wen there with a group after work. It wasn't really that busy but it seemed to be picking up as the night went on. Service was great and we never had to wait for a drink. I would like to come back and check it out for a full sit down dinner since we were just in the bar.
