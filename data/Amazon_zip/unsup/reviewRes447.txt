What an unforgettable experience I had at Alinea.... Loved all sorts of unique approaches to food. It's like "Think outside the box". It was absolutely phenomenal. Food itself was not expensive, but it was the wine that really was pricey in my opinion. I'm not a wine connoisseur, so I can't really comment how good it was, but I know they paired with many rare wines that you don't see in other restaurants. Waitstaffs were overly attentive and nice. If you have special guests that you would like to treat, this is the place to go! But make sure you book in advance.
