I'm so happy I live a short walk away from here. Delicious food and great atmosphere. On Tuesdays and Thursdays their house margaritas are half off and I think they have daiquiri specials on Mondays and Wednesdays. Just beware that the margaritas are no joke! I had three of them one night and I think I stumbled home. The food is great and cheap! I love this place!
