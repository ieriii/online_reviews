Since this place has to many reviews I will keep it short n sweet. Go on Friday, the lines arent as bad as saturday. Especially in winter. Get the duckfat fries and some delicious encased meet that will blow your mind. Cash only!! I just wish it was closer to the el, its a bit hard to get to...then again I cant imagine what the lines would be like if it was.
