so this place was needless to say amazing. If you like meat and potatoes, you can' t go wrong. I've had a lot steaks from various restaurants, and Fogo de Chao had by far the best filet mignon of all of them. Besides great food, the service is impeccable. Fast, prompt and accurate. Pricey, but totally worth it. Don't stock up on the salad bar, no matter how tempted you are by all the delicious goodies, wait for the good stuff and try your best to close the place down.
