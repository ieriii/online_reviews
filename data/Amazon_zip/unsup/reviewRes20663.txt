Mmmmm, yum! I was at Coast last night for the umteenth time and it was absolutely sensational as it is every time I go. Last night my husband and I took his sister there for dinner and as it was a Monday, it was less busy than when we go later in the week although it did fill up a bit after 8. Its BYO and our server informed us that they will now open your wine (yay!) but it is limited to one bottle of wine or six pack of beer or bottle of sake per two people. They always have specials and they had a fatty salmon nigiri that was melt-in-your-mouth deliciousness and huge pieces to boot. The Coast Crab (one of their signature rolls), Fresh Philly and Spicy Salmon are our go-to favorites but we did try a Spicy Tako roll and the Spicy Creamy that were equally pleasant morsels. Edamame is a great start to the meal as it is served warm and salty and I recommend ending the meal with the chocolate chip mochi balls! Coast continues to be my favorite sushi joint in the city and is well worth the expense. *they also deliver - sushi at home!
