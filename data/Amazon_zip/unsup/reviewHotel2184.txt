I have two very embarrassing stories I could print here in relation to the Intercontinental but I will let your little Yelping minds wonder.... Lovely hotel with a lot of nostalgia. The beds are not so comfy in my opinion (stay at the Wyndham and you will agree) but the decor and the amenities are quite nice. I'd give the IC more star-power if it weren't for a few things: 1. Poopy internet in my room and even worse in the meeting rooms 2. Food that consistently gave me heart-scarring indigestion I hate i didn't get a chance to chillout in Eno, but I am sure I will be seeing the IC again.
