This place is really good and I highly recommend going there at least once. The menu is amazing. Do try their Ropa Vieja - it is absolutely delicious. I also had the Bistek Palomilla and if you're a meat lover, this is as good as it gets. The decor is so vibrant and happy that it is worth going to Carnivale just for the atmosphere. The only negative is that it is not easy on the wallet. I usually would not spend that much on a meal, but it was definitely worth trying.
