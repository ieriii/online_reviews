I have attended both Wine 101 and 102. Both classes were terrific. Brian Duncan is a terrific speaker and has a great ability to make wine approachable. The classes aren't full of snobby terms and condescending dialogue; rather, they really attempt to make it work for you. I anticipated that we would be handed some set of rigid rules (red wine with red meat, white wine with chicken, etc). However, Brian has encouraged a very "whatever you like best" attitude while still encouraging people to not limit themselves to the "I'm a white wine/ red wine person, I don't drink red wine/ white wine". The classes give you 8 different wines to sample. You get 20% off at the restaurants (A Mano and Bin 36) as well as a discount on merchandise. We ate at Bin 36 after Wine 102. The food was excellent. I had the lamb and my boyfriend had a light salad. The menu is very limited, which I would say is the only issue. It's definitely not for the picky eater. However, everything we prepared perfectly, including our fancy ice cream sandwich. I love everything about this place, and I will be back for Wine 103!
