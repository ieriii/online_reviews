Alliance was on my way home and I decided what the heck, let's give it a try since I pass it all the time.  First thing I noticed was they serve Intelligentsia coffee - big plus in my book. They have these adorable cakes displayed in the window and the decor inside is very warm and fuzzy. The staff was super friendly.  Tons of sugar rush options to choose from - cookies, cupcakes, pastries, etc. I decided to try their double chocolate cupcake as it is my decision making item of if a bakery has won my heart. I have one word for their cupcake - SCRUMPTIOUS! The cupcake was so moist that it melted in your hands and mouth. It was decadent with its oh so goodness perfect whipped chocolate frosting. The frosting was so light but carried the chocolate flavor through. I've experienced a lot of bakeries that whip their frosting, do not get the flavor through and it just tastes like plain whip cream. Great job Alliance! I will be coming back to try their Tiramisu and many more! I'll be back to review my second adventure. Stay tuned.
