Don't let the sign fool you. It may actually be the Best Food in the World! If you want seafood that's fresh and top quality. Try Glenn's Diner right now. Their "First Catch" special is the best deal in the house. For about $12 you get a nice piece of fish, vegetable, potato, soup and salad. Unreal. Plus the brunch items are all really great. Get there early on a Sunday or you gonna wait . I'd highly recommend this joint. Really.
