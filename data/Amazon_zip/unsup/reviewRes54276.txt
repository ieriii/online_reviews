I had never before been to a costa rican restaurant, and wasn't sure what to expect. But, my companion and I were new and town and decided to try something new. The restaurant is right off the blue line, and it's BYOB, which is great.If you like Mexican food, but you've never tried any other south American food, you should give Irazu a try. The portions were a good size, and everything tasted great. Their rice is very good. The beef is good as well. They have a nice menu of specials, another plus. chips and salsa were good as well.We sat outside b/c we went in late September and their patio was nice. The building is pretty small, so if you go on Friday/Sat. night, you might have to wait a bit for a table, but you can always have a beer or something while you wait.looking forward to going back.
