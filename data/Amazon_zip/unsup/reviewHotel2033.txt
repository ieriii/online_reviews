Great for business travel. I had a great room with a view of the river. I was worried because my room was right in front of the elevators, but it was not a problem I couldn't hear anything outside of my room. The woman that checked us into our rooms, was rather rude and unattentive to our needs. She didn't even tell us what elevator to take to get to our rooms, other than that we had a very good tray.
