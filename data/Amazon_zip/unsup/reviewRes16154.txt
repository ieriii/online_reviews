It's name says it all! I have never seen such fun artwork and photos at a restaurant, not to mention the high high ceilings and great private dining/cocktail rooms. This place has lots of spunk and a great menu that is just varied from one side to another. Starting off with apps they have a good variety--plus on Tuesdays, they give you guacamole for the price of what the temp is outside! We went when it was 45 degrees...therefore 45 cents! The shrimp ceviche was great and so was the beef/cheese appetizer- I forget what it was called. The food looks like a carnivale, too! The food really isn't that expensive and the entrees were HUGE. Note--I got the Pollo, and they gave me about 3/4 of a chicken, no joke. There were nice green beens and small potatoes with a tangy green sauce that was unique and delish and I def took a lot of it home. Apparently lots of celebrities go there like Joe Biden and Janet Jackson! hmm, crazay!! I will come back here again if I go to the west loop and feel like a good meal and a good drink. They also have wine flights all the time $10 for white wine, $12 for red!
