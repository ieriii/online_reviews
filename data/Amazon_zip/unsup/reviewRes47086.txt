Went there again for their Women's folk series - just want to say another amazing drink is the Moonshine Manhattan. I was looking for a Moscow Mule, they didn't have ginger beer, and this was a great light alternative. Garnished with fresh juicy non-maraschino cherries - this drink is another must.
