I've never actually eaten here, but we get delivery from here all the time. Their stuffed pizza is great, probably my second favorite in the city. Their sauce is a little sweeter than than I like, and sometimes the pizza seems like it is a little underdone, but other than that, this is some pretty good pizza.
