I had been here a few times for business lunches and once or twice for dinners. This review for for last week when I took my dad and step mom here. For me I think its reasonably priced for what you get. My dad looked a little nervous :-) We were at a booth in the bar area which in hindsight I should have asked to be moved to the back. The bar area is super noisy. So talking to my dad who's in his 70's was impossible. At first glance my dad commented that if I don't get the tofu (he pronounces it too-foo and I correct him every time) then I'm not eating but really there are options for non-meat eaters. I had the special pasta which was made with peas and carrots. Super yummy. I also had a Moscow Mule which was good. My boyfriend had the rabbit salad. It seemed to be 99.9% arugula with just a whisper of rabbit. Not worth it. We got the chocolate dessert which made up for any downfalls. It was so rich and chocolatey and good!!!! Do not miss. Also we got coffees since we were headed to the CSO. My dad was crazy for the coffee. That's a high accolade since he usually says that coffee is "too acidic" from sitting around too long. I will be back and if Dad is with us we will be sitting in the back.
