This is my favorite pizza place in Chicago. The pizza crusts are thin and crunchy, and provide the perfect contrast for the warm gooey cheese and toppings above. I also highly recommend their grilled whole chicken, and make sure to get the garlic mashed potatoes. It will kill your breath for an entire evening, but it's well worth it. The atmosphere is small but warm and inviting. And the guys and gals behind the counter have never been anything but pleasant and helpful. Make sure you give their coxinha a try, too. Wonderful on it's own, but I like a little sriracha with mine. This place does amazing work -- give it try.
