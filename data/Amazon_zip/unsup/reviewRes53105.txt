been here three times now, and each time keeps getting better than the last. most recently went here this past weekend. was going to order a different sandwich but our excellent server mentioned one of the specials that sounded awesome so went with that... forgot the name of it, but $12 got a huge meal of the marinated/deep fried chicken, rice/beans and fried plaintains. the meal - AMAZING. just great food. this winter they got an outside tent fort eating apparatus. which is awesome. windows on the top = lots of sunlight. very cozy eating area, and can't wait for warmer weather for actual outside eating. the indoor part is pretty cool too. other than that, cool drinks, great food all around (yet to be disappointed in anything), owner came by and made sure everything was cool. great place. great food. rock and roll.
