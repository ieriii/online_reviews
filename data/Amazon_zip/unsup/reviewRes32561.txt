Likes: starting off with the blushing geisha and continuing with the devil's basket -- delicious soft shell crabs; shaking beef; string beans with walnuts and chinese sausage; crispy cauliflower; mouthwatering kobe beef tartare sushi Dislikes: the "ridiculous" dessert was a bit too sweet for my taste buds and the sampler plate of cookie bites wasn't too exciting Sunda has great ambiance and wonderful service. Although on the pricey end, I would return to Sunda on a special occasion for the devil's basket and to also try the sea bass.
