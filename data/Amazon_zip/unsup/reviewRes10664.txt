I ordered the red pizza, and it was alright but not as amazing as people had claimed. The beer, on the other hand, was dynamite. The karaoke action was hilariously bad, and cute women were everywhere. Best of all, my server pretty much told me what to eat and drink. If you're a consumer who appreciates recommendations about what the bar REALLY does best, check out Piece. It's not as amazing as the legend says, but it's still better than your average bar or pizza joint.
