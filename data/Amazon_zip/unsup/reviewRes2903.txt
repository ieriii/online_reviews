Instead of dining with the riffraff downstairs.... you can rent the room upstairs for 50 of your closest friends. Our catering manager that made sure the room was arranged how we liked, coordinated the service of passed little bites of yummy food and of course all the wine glasses filled. They definitely have service with a capital S here.
