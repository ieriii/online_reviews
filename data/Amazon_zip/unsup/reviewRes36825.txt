I went here for my birthday last December, and I'm still thinking about how good it was. We had the veggie tempura, the pad thai, and the tofu green curry, all of which was absolutely delicious. The place is unbelievably nice, considering how cheap it was! Check out their site for amazing photos of the even better food. I hope to go back soon!
