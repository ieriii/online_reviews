Given all of the raving reviews, I went in here with high hopes for some really great food and drink.  The reality of my experience was that the food was good, but not really deserving of the hype surrounding the place. Duck Pate, Giardiniere, Sourdough Tartines - This was probably my favorite dish. The pate was delicious and I would definitely order this again, it seemed to have more substance than the pate's I have at wine bars. Roasted Marrow Bones - My first time here, how could I not order this? This is pretty intimidating stuff if you've never had it, but after the initial shock of the texture of it wears off, it's actually pretty good. Slightly sweet and glistening with artery clogging goodness. Seared Maine Scallops, Braised Oxtail, Black Truffle Gnocchi - The scallops were scallops. Not sure what I was expecting as every scallop seems to taste the same to me. The oxtail tasted basically like a family-style slow-cooked beef. The Gnocchi was actually very flavorful and rich, and what I considered to be the best part of this small plate. In hindsight I probably shouldn't have ordered such a safe dish on my first time here. The drinks were all solid as well. I had a very well made old fashioned. Overall, it's a very unique restaurant with a pretty cool atmosphere and a menu that is worth exploring. I would return, but the duck pate is probably the only thing I would order a second time.
