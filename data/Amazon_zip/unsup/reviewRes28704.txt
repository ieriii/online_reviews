Since moving to Chicago, I have been here more times than any other restaurant in my area. When I have friends in town to visit, they inevitably suggest we return to Pasta Bowl. I think the good food + cheap prices has my friends hooked. I have never been disappointed with the food. The cheesy garlic bread is great. I usually get the Cappellini Pomodoro because I love the fresh mozzarella chunks. And last night I tried their caesar salad and really liked it (note: I like my caesars super garlicky and this one came through). Also, last night I tried ordering in for the first time, and while the food wasn't as "fresh" as if I had ordered at the restaurant, overall I think it really stood up to the delivery.  Good stuff.
