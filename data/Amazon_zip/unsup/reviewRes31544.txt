Let's get something out of the way up front--It just opened so everybody wants to eat here and it's Flat Out Expensive!! That being said, don't be surprised when it's packed with "Convention People" & Tourists/or when you get your bill!! Mastro's hails from the West Coast with 3 in Scottsdale and a couple in Beverly Hills..The menu here is almost identical to what you would find at the other locations. Inside, it's rather "Gaudy"/DARK/Red Carpet/Etc..Liquor Dept--Obviously a Great Wine List with many options by the glass as well. They do a "9 ounce pour" so it's a pretty healthy glass of wine. The food here is Flat Out PHENOMENAL and everything is ala carte! The Bread/Butter alone is worth $20!! All steaks are prepared in 1800 degree broilers and served on 400 degree "Platter" with clarified butter..Amazing Steaks! Many sides to choose from and each one could literally feed like 4 people/everything portion is Huge so don't go nuts on the sides.. Great Apps/Salads as well, basically everythings done right... Some standout Sides are The Wasabi Mashed as well as The Lobster Mashed and the Gorgonzola Mac&Cheese...As busy as they are the Servers and Managers have the place running pretty well! Don't forget to order The Famed "Butter Cake" GTFJD
