I dined at Fogo de Chao based on a recommendation from my boss who lived in Chicago a few years ago. I was there on business, and took out a friend that lives there. We were both very impressed with the wide variety of meats and their succulent flavors. The cordiero and frango were both amazing, and the beef ancho tops the charts.  Service was impeccable, with the food coming to your tableside nonstop, and the bar stops at your table too if you're drinking top shelf! I was pleased to find there is a Fogo de Chao in Beverly Hills, I will have to try that again now that I am back home.
