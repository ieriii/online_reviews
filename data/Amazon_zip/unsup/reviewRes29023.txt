This is my least favorite deep dish pizza in Chicago. I was just reading some reviews on here and then realized someone has to come on and note that MANY people coming here dread the place and hate the pizza, including me. Deep dish has got to be excellent by my standards, if I am throwing down money to take on 1500 calories in one sitting, it better be delicious, Pequod's is not so special to be worth the calories or the money. Service was decent, atmosphere not too special.
