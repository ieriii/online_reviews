Ran in out of the rain into some serious air conditioning. Aren't sweet tea and Southern food only good when it's dripping hot outside and you get to sweat the grease out? Maybe. I thought Big Jones was just OK. Actually, 'OK' is just a statement of averages, because some things were great and some things were unacceptable. Let me enumerate: Great: - grits. One of the only times I liked grits. - desert cactus sweet tea. Sweetness came on the side so I didn't die of sugar poisoning. Instead, I was able to add the fructose-y syrup very sparingly, and maintain the cactus flavor. - eggs. Clearly fresh, bright orange yolks, just all around exactly what you want to see when you spear a fried egg. Unacceptable: - pork boudin. Way, way, way too much pepper, to the point where that was the only flavor there. - crab cakes. These were very nearly inedible, being not even close to fresh. I wouldn't be surprised to find that it was canned crab, and for an entree costing $16, that's just not OK. The check is a kick to the stomach for brunch. Almost $20 per person. Them's dinner prices!
