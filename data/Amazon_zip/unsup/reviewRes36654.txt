1.....yes a 1.....why you may ask? I refuse to wait nearly an hour to eat breakfast along halsted street. By the time your seated you have ingested more pollution for my taste. I've struggled with this one because the food is really made with fresh ingredients and tastes great! But the hostess will lie to you on the phone...lie to you at the resturaunt....and owners will sneak friends in before others which is completely unproffessional. However, this is not to be unexpected when bar owner of muses has stake in resturaunt. The bar owners are unprofessional and uneducated. If you ever spend time next door one owner will sit at a table and just watch people come in and out. Creepy....however, the only bad thing I can say about the food at Meli has too much sugar. I looked up Meli which means "honey". Meli should watch sugar content in everything they make....chefs old trick....but good!
