We've done Bonsoiree twice. The first time was fairly fantastic, except for the desert: a spin on an eggs, biscuit and gravy (the gravy being toffee) - much too sweet while the flavors didn't compliment each other. Nevertheless, the evening was far from spoiled. The BYOB policy is fabulous, plus props to their rabbit - It's the best I've ever had. However, we recently returned in February 2011 and were all somewhat disappointed with the service, ambiance, and even the food. It just seemed... off. The duck-duck-goose came highly recommended, though I found the goose rather salty and the duck bland. The first time round, the atmosphere had been lovely - small but cosy with dim lighting, candles, etc. Stark and cold nicely sums up our second experience. No candles with horridly bright lights, which magnified how cramped the space was. All this after receiving a Michelin star. I'm no longer impressed.
