Such a lovely place, great atmosphere and wonderful staff. The bar tender was such as welcoming warm person with the best of cocktails to present! Arturo was his name. The bar food was delicious as well, the mussels were quite big and yummy. The restaurant manager came to talk to us personally, Shawn and was such a lovely chap that made us feel welcome and at home. They even took 2 drinks off the menu to make us feel even more at home and welcome. Great service, good food, brilliant atmosphere and lovely decor.
