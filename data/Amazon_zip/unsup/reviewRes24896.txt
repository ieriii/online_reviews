Artopolis, you were so close to five stars, but having ONE waitress service the entire first floor during a busy Sunday brunch was regrettable. So were the little snack bar sized bottles of Coke you give instead of refillable sodas. I knew Chinese restaurants seem to do this, although at least most give out CANS instead of little glass bottles. On top of all that, the waitress became visibly miffed because we wanted to buy bakery items directly from the bakery counter to go instead of ordering them from her to increase her tab and tip. And then we saw her twice over an hour, never once asking us how everything was going. Otherwise, the food here is fabulous. Our table had a smattering of entrees including a Campagna pizza which was wonderful. Pricey, but superb. Then...a TOUR BUS pulled up, and our table was surrounded with people hanging around our seating area with babes in arms, teenagers yapping away at full volume and people taking photos with cellphones. Less than sterling service, pricey entrees ($91 for an appetizer, four entrees, two sodas and three coffees) and the tourist trap distraction threw some shade on an otherwise nice Sunday brunch. [Editorial comment: I am really getting tired of going to places that hand me a can or bottle of soda then have the audacity to charge $2 or even $3 for each of them.]
