I must agree with the majority of these reviews. Yeah, the food is awesome ..... well priced, the food, drinks & service was tops . This place does some great business. What more can you say . A bit on the ''hole in the walI '' style type restaurant but will only complain about the bathrooms. A bit more upkeep goes a long way, hence only four stars instead of five.  Thanks.
