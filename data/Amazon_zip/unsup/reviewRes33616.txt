This is my go-to Italian restaurant in the city. In my many, many visits I have always had great food and even better service. I recommend sitting downstairs if you're a party of less than four and don't mind the tight quarters and loud atmosphere. I kind of love that feel, but when we want a quieter experience, we move upstairs to the much quieter dining/bar area. It is a totally different feel than downstairs and great for parties larger than four or that prefer a more mellow dining experience. I love that the menu is always changing. In all of my visits, I try a different entree each time. The carpaccio is fantastic as is the blue cheese and tomato salad. The creme brulee is also a nice treat to top off the meal. My parents always love going here when in town, as well. Since they are borderline wine snobs (kidding...sort of), my mom emails the manager to request the option of bringing one bottle of wine for our table if we order one from the restaurant, too. He always waives the corkage byob fee for us. I think that attention to customer service is what keeps us coming back again and again. It is rare to find reasonably priced restaurants in the city that go that extra mile to keep their customers really happy (and that put up with requests like that)! I've always had great wait staff service and food to please everyone in our party. Will keep going again and again!
