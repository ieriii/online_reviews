So I've been finding out that I give nearly all my 5 star ratings to pizza places. Bias? Probably. It is my favorite food. However, I have learned to expect a lot. But also, you know what they say about pizza...it's like sex, even when it's bad, it's still pretty good. Enough rambling. Art of Pizza is phenomenal. EVERY slice is only $3.19 and they have TONS of options hot and ready to go, even deep dish. That's right, no more waiting 45 minutes for a famous Chicago stuffed slice. I went there on a Sunday afternoon and they had at least 7 different types of slices available immediately. They had 2 thin crust choices, one pan type, and about 4 deep dish/stuffed pies all hot and ready to go. I was incredibly impressed by the selection. I ordered a thin pepperoni and a stuffed sausage and pepperoni. I am a huge fan of both genres but I have to give the edge to the stuffed here - it stood out more than the thin. That said, if you are not on a diet, order both and you'll have the best of both worlds. Bottom line, excellent quality pizza, affordable, and slices available on demand. PLEASE don't change Art of Pizza and I will be back veryyyyyyyy often. So happy to find this place only a couple blocks from my place. OH! I almost forgot, they also have their own parking lot for about 10 cars. Bonus awesomeness.
