I live in the area and noticed this place one day walking home from a friend's house. It looked really cute from the outside and so I decided to try it out. So glad I did because it is really good!! I will agree with another "Yelp Post" that you must try the Crab Rangoon!! It's the best! I think I have ordered it every time, and the presentation is amazing! The staff has always been very friendly and helpful on the many occasions I have dined here (both for lunch and dinner). Along with the delicious food - I also like the interior of this place, and LOVE that they have REAL artwork on the walls (not generic posters), but really interesting and eclectic art! The food is always good and it is very easy to substitute items. It's in walking distance from my home which is perfect for me :) I also love that it is a BYOB! There is street parking (metered on Broadway), and parking on the side streets. There is also a Dominicks right around the block so in case you need to pick up a quick bottle of wine or beer, there is a store nearby (which I have seen many people do this)! Try it out and get the Crab Rangoon!!!
