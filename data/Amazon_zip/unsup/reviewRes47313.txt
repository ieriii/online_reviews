I had low expectations, I'm not sure why. Because its a themed restaurant? Because everyone compares it to Kumas? Well, I was blown away.  The burgers were delicious, crazy delicious, the mac and cheese was awesome, and the service was outstanding. I can't wait to go back - and they have awesome beer/food specials throughout the week.
