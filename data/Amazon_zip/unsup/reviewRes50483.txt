I like wishbones food a lot and would like to give them more stars, but dining in I've had some bad experiences. Similar to the review down below, Ive been in a few times, seated and ignored for a good 10 minutes. While there are only maybe 2 or 3 other tables in the restaurant. As a fellow server I atleast expect someone to come by and acknowledge my existence and let me know you'll be over shortly. Nope nothing. Finally we just get up and leave. Management needs to step it up. It's a shame because when I get carryout the food is great, and the portions are pretty big for the amount youre spending. Don't get delivery though because they tac on an extra $8 or something ridiculous
