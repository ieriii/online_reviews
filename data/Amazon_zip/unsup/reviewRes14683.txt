Never in my life have I had a moister ( is that a word?) piece of chicken. Chicken, onions, rice beans and plantains. I wobbled out of there. I love that it's a quick eat with the little bar stools.The guy ( owner?) who works the register is so sweet and patient with me when I stand there all indecisively going back and forth between the ropas vieja and the chicken...mmm. I think I may be feeling cuban tonight...
