Makes you forget your hunger, and what you were talking about... Now, choosing a great pizza place in Chicago is like choosing between a gorgeous brunette and a fiery redhead, you marry one and have a shot at a real life, or you gamble and chance landing in a trailer park with 2 kids that aren't yours, living off foodstamps and dance money. What were we talkin' about?  Pizza, oh yeah.  PIZZA - First, ONLY order the pan pizza. Thin? No. Thin is like, well, like the ugly cousin who just got out of prison. A Russian prison in Uzbekistan. The pan pizza is perfect. The seasoned, thick tomato gravy works its way into the thick, yet light crust. The cheese and sausage (which is nice and chunky and imparting a great flavor to the crust) are a perfect complement. THE CRUST - When you get the pizza, the edge of the crust looks dark, almost burnt, but really, it's CARMELIZED. Its probably a different cheese from mozzarella, but it's GOOD. This is one time you want to save the crust for last. Now, some people don't LIKE carmelized cheese, and that's okay. You can knock a star off the review in your head, but I keep it at 5. CAVEATS - Parking stinks. Almost everything else on the menu is just okay, so ONLY order the pan pizza. Yeah, one trick pony, but this pony can recite Shakespeare while juggling. Order in advance, and order more, cause this is a great next breakfast pizza. Especially if you chose the trailer park girl and her two kids.
