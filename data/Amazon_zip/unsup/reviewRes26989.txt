In town for a conference, a coworker all but begged to eat dinner here the first night. I am glad she twisted our arms! There was a short wait for a table so we all hit up the bar. I had a mango-basil mojito and my fiance had a margarita. Both delicious and refreshing. There were six of us so we started off with two guacamole appetizers, the Frontera and the bacon and chive. Both came with just-made chips (that, indeed, tasted just made) and were delicious. Thankfully I had enough room for dinner because it was ah-may-zing. I had the shrimp in spring green cream. I have no idea what the "shoots salad" is that was on top of the shrimp but I could eat it every day. It was a very generous portion which makes my fiance's order, the beef barbacoa enchiladas, even smaller. Thankfully he also ordered green rice, because the enchiladas were quite wee. My coworker and I also split the "venemous" pintos, which came with queso, chorizo and bacon ... yummmmmm. Thank goodness we had a bit of a walk back to the hotel, as my full tummy definitely needed time to settle!
