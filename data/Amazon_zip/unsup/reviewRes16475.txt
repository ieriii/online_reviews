Wow, this place has gone down hill very fast. I usually go there on a Wednesday or Thursday night to avoid the line. The last six times I took clients there I was very unimpressed with the cocktails. Not sure if they have the 2nd stringers working behind the bar during slow times, but my thinking is this: If you're charging $12+ a cocktail you need to be delivering A-game mixalogy every time. V-Hour, you've lost my expense account.
