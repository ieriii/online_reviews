Best Chinese restaurant I've ever been to. The hotpot is not to be missed, as well as the Szechuan green beans and the amazing Tony's chicken. I have no problem finding things for my 3 year old daughter to eat, either. She adores their dumplings (jiaozi) and the staff always lavishes attention on her. I love the vibe of Chinatown and Lao Sze Chuan is the crown jewel of all the restaurants in the area.
