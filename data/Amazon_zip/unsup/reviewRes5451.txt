Never had lunch or dinner here but definitely an excellent place to grab a drink after work and into the late night. They have a tented/heated outdoor seating and also nicely decorated inside. I've only sat at the bar, but the staff is very friendly and knowledgeable of the wines on their menu, down to knowing how it was made. I've had the squid appetizer before and it's beyond delicious! Definitely a place worth checking out and meeting some great people.
