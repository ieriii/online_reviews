A very palatable, vast menu and luxurious interior are probably the two main reasons Grand Lux has been characterized as being not unlike the Cheescake Factory. Dessert is ordered 30 minutes in advance as it is made fresh from the oven. Additionally, if you come in with enough luck and patience you may get one of the tables at the grand window overlooking Michigan Ave. With all this in mind, its great for a tourist anytime, and if you are a local I recommend hitting Grand Lux up for exceptionally wonderful brunch.
