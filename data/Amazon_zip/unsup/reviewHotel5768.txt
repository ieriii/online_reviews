This place is "ok." It's a little off the beaten path so not too crazy but yet you will see a few homeless people wondering around. I think their valet only option is ridiculous with ample spaces. The valet people were a tad rude a few times in the three days we stayed. The housekeeping didn't stock The coffee 2 out of 3 days. I did however love Rooks Lounge. Decent food and one of the best bloody Mary's I ever had. And I'm a complete Bloody Mary snob. Overall good stay.
