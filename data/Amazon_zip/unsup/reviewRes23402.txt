Were the crepes delicious? Yes, they were tasty. However, two crepes was not enough to even scratch the service on filling me up. I'm disappointed with this place. They weren't accepting credit card and the service was iffy. I'm not understanding how this place has such great reviews. You'll be paying $9 dollars for one crepe that will leave less satisfied than a drunk girl at a bar. I was considering walking to Ann Sathers after breakfast to purchase a cinnamon roll to hold me over. If you're a crepe person, this place might be for you. If you're a general breakfast person, you might want to eat a powerbar before going.
