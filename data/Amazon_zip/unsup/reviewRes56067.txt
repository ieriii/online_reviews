The existence of Superdawg proves that gimmicks sometimes works. Although, in my lonely opinion, the gigantic hotdogs are a bit cheeezy, Superdawg is the standard which I judge and compare all hotdogs to. Although I cannot explain what makes the hotdog so special -you have to try it for yourself- the french fries are just as awesome as the hotdogs. They are so crispy and so simple : salt + potato + oil = perfect french fry . Moreover the milkshakes are well balanced and tasty : they are not too sweet and heavy like most milkshakes yet it is satisfying; in other words, the milkshake doesn't overpower the hotdog, but complements it - I know this is an odd description, but this is true-. The decor is also good and I would highly recommend going at night when all the neon lights are on : it's like going back in time to the 50's.
