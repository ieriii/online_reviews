I must say that I was extremely disappointed with my stay at the Palmer House. Upon first entering the lobby of the hotel, I was very impressed. The ambiance is one of elegance and the presentation was amazing. I was very excited to complete the check-in process and make my way to my room. I knew that there was something strange upon check in - the representative said something about me being in a suite and how that was too large for one person. He then proceeded to downgrade my reservation to a standard room despite my assertion that I did not want to make that change. Dismayed with the check in process I made my way to my room which only increased my frustration with the hotel. The room was small, very small. Although the hotel had recently been renovated, the impression I got was that not much thought had been put into the design/layout of these rooms. The bathroom was terribly small. The toilet was the centerpiece of the room and from there you could adjust the water in the shower or do your hair in the mirror. Okay, so maybe that is a bit of an exaggeration but not much. The only redeeming quality about this room was that the bed was comfortable and clean. Of note - the hotel did not offer wireless internet, the elevators were very slow, and none of the staff seemed overly friendly or engaged. Furthermore, while dining at their main restaurant, I had to wait nearly an hour to get a check after our server went missing. In summary, this will be my first and my last stay at the hotel. If you're only requirement is an impressive lobby, this is the place. If you are looking for comfort and service, I'd recommend you book elsewhere.
