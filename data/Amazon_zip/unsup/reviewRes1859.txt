There's literally nothing I can add to the mountains of praise heaped upon Hot Doug's, except that a recent special-- the White Wine Rabbit Sausage with Sauce Moutarde, Goat Cheese and Spicy Calabrese Peppers-- was absolutely (and amazingly) one of the best things I've ever eaten there. And I already considered this pretty much the best place in the world to eat. If you come here and just get a Chicago dog and give the place three stars, you're doing it wrong.
