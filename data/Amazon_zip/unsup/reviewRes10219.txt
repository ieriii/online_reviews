I went to Piccolo Sogno for the first time last night. They have a wonderful outdoor seating area. It feels so secluded and serene that it's difficult to believe it's next to a busy intersection. My friend and I shared an appetizer, two entrees and dessert, and it was all delicious. The service was excellent as well - very attentive. Dining there was a great experience.
