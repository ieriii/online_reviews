I love the Bayless / Bourdain attitude that emphasizes foods that spring from a culture, which are often cheap foods, not foams and emulsions and potions. But Xoco is nothing special. We had a goat torta: the meat was not particularly distinctive, it could have been anything. Goat at birrerias is much better. The separately served sauce was good, and necessary to give the sandwich any character. The caldo was perfectly flavored but was mostly water with some meat scraps; true, this is how it is in Mexican market stalls as well, but there it doesn't cost $12 (or rather it does, given that in Mexico $ means pesos). The almond hot chocolate was strangely sour and left an aftertaste. The churros were fresh and authentic, which means we're now a step closer to diabetes. So our impressions were mixed; a commendable effort, but not worth all the hype. On a Saturday, the line was short when we arrived for lunch, and short when we left.
