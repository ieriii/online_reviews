Love this place. Finally a bar with great food, great craft beer list, and a great atmosphere. I went on a Saturday with a couple of friends around 8pm. The place was packed but it was easy to get a drink at the bar as the bartenders were on top of their game and alert. We were behind another group next to the bar and the bartender noticed that we needed drinks.If I can make one recommendation it is to get the mussels! So good! I also ended up getting french onion soup which was to die for and the tilapia sandwich, also good. Overall great time with my friends and the bill was reasonable as well. I will definitely be back.
