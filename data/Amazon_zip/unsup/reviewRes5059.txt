While I love working from home, I get sad sometimes because I am no longer within walking distance of this marvelous all-things-pig heaven. The Purple Pig is so good, I could easily drop $80 on wine and pig treats and not bat a lash about it. I'm by no means wealthy, but this place is JUST THAT GOOD. I love that you can do 1/3 bottles of wine, cheese, antipasti, and PORK NECK RILETTE. I never thought I would say this, but BRING ON THE PORK NECK!!!! We all need a little more pork neck in our lives. One bite and you will agree too. I could write sonnets about my love of the Purple Pig and maybe one day I will. Until then, I just hope you take the plunge and give it a try because it is realllllllllllllllllly good.
