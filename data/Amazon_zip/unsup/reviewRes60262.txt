I used to love this pizza, but they recently spread out the dough farther to make the pies bigger (allowing them to cut 8 slices instead of 6 per pie), which in turn made the pizza thinner. There are still great ingredients on top, don't get me wrong, but the consistency of the crust makes it much less tasty than it once was. I used to eat there every day, but now have returned to a semi-normal life of buying groceries. Maybe it's a good thing. Now I don't spend so much money on their reasonably priced food, and am learning how to cook once more.Thanks, Fogo.I give them 4 stars for the food (chicken is still a great deal) but take off a star for disappointing me so. The owner did indeed seem unsympathetic to my complaints.~bitterfogolover
