So much wanted to love this. Fan of the other Bayless outlets, and totally a Mexican street food junkee after years of working in Mexico and Grammas cooking growing up...BUT - Pozole was WAY salty. Could not believe it. Cold night in Chicago, so the warmth was welcoming, but not satisfying or up to the expectations of a Bayless joint Worse yet - with most of the soup uneaten - not even a remote blink from staff about whether the food was off mark... A clear warning sign that moving from quality eats next door to quasi fast food is leaving the service experience flat...I hope not.
