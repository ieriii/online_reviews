My wife and I went there on a friend's recommendation. In all honesty, we really didn't want to wait at Kuma's and this seemed like a pretty good alternative. Check that, this was a fantastic alternative. They have an elaborate beer selection, recommend beers to pair up with certain meals and have a large variety of burgers to choose from. My wife had the classic/basic Bad Apple burger and I had the Wagyu. Both burgers were delicious and it was an overall great experience. Wagyu was JUICY!!! Looking back I think of this place as a Kuma's, without the wait, tattoos, naked chicks on the walls, heavy metal blasting, and worst of all sitting on top of people, while others stare at you to get up and leave so they can sit and scarf their burger in record time. Just me though
