Can't believe I haven't been here sooner; since I moved into the Ravenswood neighborhood in May. Ambiance is small, quaint, romantically decorated and lit. Italian food served is wonderfully diverse and interesting; and, all seemed excellent. What more could ask for -- how about BYOB for an Italian Restaurant?? Believe it or not, it is (and, even harder to believe, with NO corkage fee). But, you doubters say, don't they just raise their prices to make up for it. Nope -- prices seemed average for fine Italian dining. ($15-17 for pasta dishes; and, 18-22 for chicken/meat/seafood dishes). How wonderful.
