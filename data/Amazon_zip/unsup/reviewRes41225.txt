I've been to Ruth's Chris a number of times over the years in various cities and I've always thought the steaks were good. This location in downtown Chicago is usually very lively and its a huge space inside. Its not necessarily a steakhouse I go out of my way to visit since you can always find one in almost any city. And I have had a couple steaks not cooked to my specifications that I've sent back over the years. But the service is great and they never hesitate to make sure I'm happy with my experience. The appetizers/salads/desserts are all good and standard as well. And the sizzling butter on the plate is a nice little novelty, but its nothing I would ever crave... Overall, I think this place is a pretty safe bet when it comes to steakhouses in Chicago. If you're a true aficianado, I'd prob recommend trying an original Chicago steakhouse like Gene & Georgetti's instead of a national chain, but I have to admit the food is great here and the restaurant has a good scene.
