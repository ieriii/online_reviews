this is my personal homage to doug sohn... the food is fantastic...when they have the linquica with saffron rouille and 2 year manchego i cry...it's some of the best food i've had...i bring all my buddies here from outta town to show them what the food in chicago is all about. and doug always remembers me (probably cause i bring him cookies...i dunno)... but i don't need to wax ecstatic. go eat there. now.
