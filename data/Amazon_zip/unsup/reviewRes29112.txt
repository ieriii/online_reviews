Have eaten there and ordered takeout a number of times. It's good! I like the deep dish and the thin crust. The deep dish is really unique. There is cheese cooked into the crust. It's also a bit "doughier" that Lou Malnati's, which has more cheese. It can also be a bit pricey for pizza. $2 per topping, which adds up. Especially for someone like me who prefers a lot of different toppings. My only complaint is the onions. I feel like other places cut them differently and cook them into the pizza better. But I still love this place!s 5 stars!
