I've always enjoyed La Villa! Over the years I've attended banquets, dined in the restaurant and ordered meals and pizza to go! All around great Italian food, fresh consistent. Pasta dishes and sauces are amazing! I love the Chicken Vesuvio and the pizza is great too (both thin crust and stuffed). The interior could prolly use a little updating, but still has that old school ambiance. No complaints about service and pleasant waitstaff which is really important to me.
