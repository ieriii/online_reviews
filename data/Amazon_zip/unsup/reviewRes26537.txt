Very nice service, very accommodating, and a large menu. We came in the day before Valentine's day with a group of 25 girls. Of course we did have a reservation but they were still very accommodating. Plus, it's a BYOB, which I favor.  The place is smaller so if it's a busier day of the week/year, get a reservation.
