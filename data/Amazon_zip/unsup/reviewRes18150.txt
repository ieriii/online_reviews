I had always wanted to try Rick Bayless' food to see what the hype's all about. How good could Mexican cuisine get? So when I landed at ORD last Saturday, I went straight to Xoco to grab a bite. When I walked in, it was hot inside and a little confusing. Then a hostess came to explain how things work. So basically you line up, order your food and the hostess gives you a number for your counter space/table. Then you are all confused when look for your table because she never places a number on your table. HOWEVER, the fact that I was sweating and all confused did not affect my opinions for the food served here! Xoco has the best horchata I have ever had! Far better than the ones I got in LA. Respect. So awesome that I had to order two. It had the rich rice flavor I always look for in a horchata, not purely sweet. I also had the special of the day which was the goat barbacoa. It was delicious! The intense flavor of goat burst into my mouth with every bite! My mouth waters even I am just thinking about it. Then I finished my late lunch with churros. The churros were made to order so it was hot and crispy when came out. They were less cinnamon-y but they came with chocolate. The combo with the high quality of chocolate was really paired well together. I would also like to try the tres leche cake, but I was really stuffed beyond imagination so I had to refrain myself. Frontera Grill was next door. It was nice to see Rick didn't neglect his little joint here. He came by running around and making sure everything was right. Nicely done, chef. Too bad they close on Sunday & Monday. I was flying back to LA on Tuesday at early hours. Otherwise, I would love to have one more meal there. Until next time, Xoco.
