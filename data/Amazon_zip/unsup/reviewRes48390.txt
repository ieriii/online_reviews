I wouldn't mind going back to try the dinner but probably not for brunch. The space seemed to amplify sound so it was very noisy in there, much noisier than any cafeteria I've been in. We had to strain our ears and raise our voices in order to maintain conversation. The red wine poached eggs were good, but there wasn't enough bearnaise sauce for the bread. The braised short ribs were a tad salty. The portion sizes were on the smaller side. The biggest disappointment were the frites and pork rinds. To be fair, I wasn't impressed with the trendy Belgian frites in NYC either, and this is supposed to be the same thing, without the fancy dipping sauces. It was just greasy, soggy, and the dipping sauce was bland like mayo. Fox and Obel's cafeteria serves up fries with truffle aioli, and that's actually worth the 5 bucks. The pork rinds are better not to mention cheaper at your local gas station. Service was fine.
