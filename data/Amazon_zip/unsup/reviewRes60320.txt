sushi is good and priced well for what you get but the service is horrible at best. The last time I was there, we were told an hour wait which turned into 2 hours. Once seated it turns out they had given our $25 bottle of wine which was in the fridge to another table and gave us a cheap bottle that was left in there. We received no comp for the mistake and no apology. After waiting for 2.5 hours, we were rushed through our meal b/c it was almost closing time. Shame on us for waiting that long. If i ever go back it will be for take out only.
