Sunday Brunch review: Awesome, classy buffet! For a moderately upscale place it was pretty comfortable and relaxed. The steamed King crab was amazing. I was told by my partner in gluttony that the oysters were the best part of the brunch but I was too chicken to try them. Don't bother with the sushi or the lobster penne as the later was dry and the former contained little, if any, lobster. Very fresh and tasty ceviche. And the dessert room was top notch. They even had homemade lollipops and cotton candy?!  Next time I go I will attempt the bloody mary bar and maybe one of those oysters!
