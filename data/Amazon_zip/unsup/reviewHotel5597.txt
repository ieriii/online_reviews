I believe this may have been my first time staying at a Westin hotel, and it was very nice. I was on the 3rd floor with a pleasant view of the river and the garden terrace below. The weather wasn't terrific the 3 days I spent in the Windy City, but it was still a nice view to have. The bed was really great, one of the most comfortable hotel beds I've ever had the pleasure to sleep in. The room was nicely laid out, with a spacious and well lit bathroom (I dig the lighted mirror). I also appreciated the inclusion of some nice teas with the coffee machine & not just coffee as I don't drink it. I was there for a conference, and the conference facilities on the lower levels were rather nice. They provided tables to sit at instead of just chairs, which I love since I tend to take a lot of notes on a laptop or, in this case, my new iPad.  I ordered room service for two meals, one lunch & one dinner, and I felt like the food was good, but it was priced a couple dollars too high in my personal opinion. I haven't had the best of luck ordering anything with avocados east of Nevada and getting good ripe ones, but the ones on my sandwich were perfect here, so kudos for that. I did have occasion to sit in the hotel bar awhile, which I felt, like most hotel bars, was overpriced a few bucks at least. I was also disappointed my last night there, while killing an hour before leaving for the airport, that my cheese platter took almost 30 mins to be brought to me... I know it doesn't take that long to cut cheese, half an apple, and put the apricot chutney in the little bowl!  Overall I'd stay here again without hesitation. I know the snack tricks now (get them at the gift shop & just ignore the mini bar) and the room was very comfy & relaxing during my conference down time.
