My first fondue experience was at Geja's Cafe in Lincoln Park. This place was definitely intimate and romantic. Almost ALL couples were there, including my boyfriend and myself out for our anniversary.This place is clearly geared for romance..soft music played by a violinist..dimly lit candles..small, intimate tables. Though the atmosphere was dreamy, the food was...eh. In essence you get a plate of raw veggies and meat that you skewer & fry in oil. And at $50+ bucks a pop..well, I wouldn't say this would be a regular joint for me. Save this place for the rare special occasion, or skip it for better food elsewhere. Chicago has too many awesome restaraunts with amazing food to waste so much $$ on a mediocre dinner. (though a romantic experience)I know my boyfriend would have much preferred a Gibson's steak (at the same price) over this meal.
