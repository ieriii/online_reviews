I love this place for a few reasons. 1) It's huge so even when there is a gigantic crowd (which there usually is), you get seated pretty quickly. 2) There is something for everyone. Whether you want breakfast, brunch, lunch, etc....you can find it. And ALL varieties of food. 3) I live in the South Loop where there isn't much and this is easily walkable/accessible from there. Anyway, the omelette's are good, pancakes are delish, etc. If you want brunch, DEFINITELY try Yolk first!
