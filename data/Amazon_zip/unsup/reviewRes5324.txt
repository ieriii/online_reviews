4.5 stars Le Cochon Violet!! NOM NOM NOM! I loved this place! I wish downtown had more restaurants/wine bars like this. The wine we had was really amazing, very very good! (and I'm often unimpressed by a lot of wines I order at restaurants.) Yes the Yelp community has declared that the milk braised pork shoulder is to die for! We ended up ordering another one after we tried the first one. Haha that's how delish it was. It was like so tender you could separate it with your fork! I also loved the bone marrow smear! Who knew bone marrow is so tasty? It comes in a bone which may be off-putting for some, but you spread it on bread with some salt and parsley(?). Savory buttery goodness my friend. Also we ordered the meat platter and another surprising find was the lengua (yes tongue).Try it!! All the cured meats were great with the wine. Other dishes I liked (but not like over the top love) were the beets with pistachios and goat cheese (and I'm not even much of a beet lover) and fried manchego. I also had the fried pig ears with kale which tasted like little crunchy salty snacks. Overall great selection of wines, innovative menu, and convenient location. They don't take reservations, so if you're going on the weekend... put your name down and go wander around or get a drink somewhere else and come back. Definitely crowded with communal seating.
