one of the best pizza place/brewpubs i've been to, i don't know how piece doesn't have a 5-star rating. what's not to absolutely love about this place? their thin-crust pizza is top-notch and their beer is ace. so is their merch! a growler cozy? hell yeah. get the pizza with white sauce, it is to die for. you can create your own pizza with tons of different fresh toppings. we had spinach, sauted mushrooms, and onions on ours and the medium left plenty of leftovers. olive oil on the crust with some garlic, the perfect amount of crunch, and all topped with mozzarella cheese. and, whatever you do, WHAT EVER. YOU. DO... get the chocolate pizza for dessert. i don't even need to describe its sheer awesomeness... just do yourself a favor and order one.
