My hubby and I went here last night with another couple that's never had Indian food before. The ambiance and service were great and I like to watch the chefs thru the glass wall into their kitchen, I think that's a neat attraction. The naan was warm and really good as was the dip they give you with it when you first arrive. Samosas were good as well but as for the main meals honestly nothing really was that outstanding. I'm not an Indian food expert so I don't recall the names of the dishes but I can tell you the lamb (tikka masala?) dish we got was so-so as the lamb was a bit dry. One of the dishes was a tandoori grill sampler with chicken, lamb and fish. Chicken was tender but lamb was tough and fish was fishy. We also got the aloo gobi (cauliflower and potato) which was ok. One consolation was our desserts. We got the kheer (rice pudding) which I loved and our friends got the mango ice cream which they said was really good. For the price I think I prefer Gaylord in Schaumburg much better than this place. I wanted to give it a 4 star but i decided to take off a star because the main dishes were a bit disappointing but I liked the service.
