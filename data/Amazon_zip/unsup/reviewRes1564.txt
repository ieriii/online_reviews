I will be completely honest in this posting. This is a fantastic find - except the lines are typically out the door (can you say 'New Location' please?). Their specialty dogs are the best - and they always have something new up their sleeve. On top of all this, the guy taking your money (cash only!) is Doug himself. And to show you the dedication that he has to the quality of service, he shut down the store when he broke his leg a few months back. This place is great, but I end up in the bathroom for an hour every time I eat here. Why doug? Why? Im not blaming you, Im blaming my celiac family. Damn wheat.
