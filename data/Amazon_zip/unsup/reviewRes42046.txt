This is by far my fav restaurant in Chgo. Any time I have clients or business partners in town I take them here and they leave with such a great impression of our city. The truffle pasta, the grilled cauliflower....all excellent.  What also makes this an exceptional place to go to is the fact that I don't have to worry if my guests are vegetarian. 'A' has not been here with me but I am looking forward to getting his input :)
