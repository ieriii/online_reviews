I've gone here for brunch on two separate occasions and I love it. The first time I got the peeky crab benedict, which was a little heavy on the hollandaise, but otherwise delicious. The second time I got the chicken and waffles, which had to be the best brunch entree I've ever had. OMG. The chicken was seriously the best fried chicken ever. It was so juicy and delicious. Cocktails seem a little pricey, and they didn't refill my coffee. But this has to be one of my new favorite brunch places in the city. I can't give it 5 stars until I try out their dinner menu.
