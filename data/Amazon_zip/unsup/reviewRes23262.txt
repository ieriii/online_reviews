Love it.  We arrived on a Saturday evening and there were a number of groups in front of us, but after getting a number from inside, the wait went by quickly.  Looking over the menu, I was amazed by the offerings-- from the mundane to unexpected and everywhere in between. This is a great find for foodies! You should BYOB if you feel so inclined, and don't shy away from bringing your entourage because Lao Sze Chuan seems to thrive on groups.
