We went here on Saturday at 12 noon to have group reunion. Once seated, we ordered the food. 2 kalbi, 1 baby octopus and many side dishes. Kalbi is tender but tingy for the amount. Baby octopus was soft and well marinate. We also order buck wheat noodle with sour sauce and vegetable. It was very sour, not recommended unless you're pregnant with an acquire taste for sour noodle. One bad thing, I requested hot water twice, but the waiter came out 2 times with tea and no hot water. She said the restaurant doesn't have hot water. How does she make hot tea then!
