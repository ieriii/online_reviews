Bin 36 is a total experience. I went there on Saturday evening and it was busy but loud or unpleasantly crowded. I ordered wine and cheese flights, in which you are served a set of cheeses that go well together and a set of accompanying wines that complement the cheeses. Not only was everything delicious, but the server brought little cards with detailed descriptions of every wine and cheese that was a part of the flight. I loved knowing more about my meal! Also, the staff is incredibly nice. I spilled red wine all over my dress and the server immediately brought over "wineaway," a citrus spray that took the stains right out. I was so grateful. Overall, Bin 36 was a fantastic experience.
