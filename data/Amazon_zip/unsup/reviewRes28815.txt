I would love to come back to this restaurant. It is known for the famous "RIck Bayless" from Top Chef. There weren't a lot of people or maybe because our reservation was for 9:30 p.m. so we just missed the crowd. We decided to order appetizers and an entree because -- hmm I don't know why but no complaints here. By the end of the night I was incredibly full good thing the kitchen was closed because we were about to order another round of Ceviche de Atun "Chamoy". I love it! It's sweet and has a tiny kick to it. Also, you have to try their Carne Asada a la Oaxaquena. It was cooked just the way we ordered. The meat was so good combined with plantains MMMMmmm!!!! I want some more!! We ordered a lot more but those two was my fav- I hope to come back here and try their other dishes. -1 for their melon mojito. It tasted more like juice to me
