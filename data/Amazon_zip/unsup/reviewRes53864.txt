After a day of sight seeing we decided to follow the reviews we'd seen at eat at The Purple Pig. It was very busy for a Monday night- even for a table for 2. The hostess first tried to sit us across from each other in the middle of a packed table. After waiting 5 more minutes we were sat next to each other. Even sitting next to each other, it was tough to hold a conversation due to the volume- even being on the patio. The server was very helpful explaining how the menu worked and made great recommendations. Everything we tasted was fabulous and really filling. The two of us shared 3 items (not the recommended 3 items per person!).
