I took 18 customers here after I had such a great experience and we had another awesome meal.  We ordered the full pork shoulder (305 dollars) and it was a very cool experience. The sous chef and manager came out w/ the full shoulder on a rolling cart, did a little talking, and pulled all the meat w/ bear claws in front of everyone for serving.  The only reason I dropped it from a 5 star to a 4 star was the service dragged... A lot.... By the end of the meal everyone was looking at their watches thinking... We have to get out of here. All in all, very good. Thanks, Joe
