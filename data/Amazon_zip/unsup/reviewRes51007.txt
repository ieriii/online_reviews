This place is pretty good, cool decor, healthy chow - creative and fun menu, very attentive staff, clean and priced well, I love their BIG window booths -However, I would avoid this place though on Weekend Brunch times as the trendy lakeview loudtalkers come and really pack the place...My recommendation is the corn flake battered french toast , trust me (I was skeptical too when I first heard about it), it's very good!~
