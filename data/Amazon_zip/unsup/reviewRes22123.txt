I'm in a quandary... Today started off normal as usual. Then lunch time came around and the whole earth shifted off it's axis the moment I scarfed down a giant spoonful of Irazu's CHICKEN SOUP. I sort of wish I never had it because I can't stop thinking about the next time I'll get to have it. I also worry if I squeezed enough lime juice into the most perfect chicken broth ever to grace my palate. Did I mention the chunks/shreds of chicken? The rice and carrots? Let me just state- chicken soup does NOT get me excited. Ever. Oh yeah I also sampled the potato taco's with the mole, the chile relleno, tostones- we got carry out for work so things we're not as fresh or crisp because of packaging but yet still had amazing flavors. I also have to say the coleslaw that came with the potato taco's is some of the BEST coleslaw I've ever experienced. What is going on?!?! I think Mercury is in retro grade because today I found the perfect two completely random, often over looked, never eaten together- food items ever. Amen!
