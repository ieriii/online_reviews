After a few neighbours exhorted us to try this place, which I drive past everyday on my commute. We did take out, wife picked it up. The folks working there were friendly, and there were some chatty folks hanging out there too who might be friends or relatives of the folks working there. We ordered a steak sandwich, cuban two-meat sandwich, and a ropa vieja meal. I liked the steak sandwich, wife thought her ropa vieja was okay. I thought the Cuban sandwich was just okay. The plantains that came with her meal were delicious. As an aside the leftover sandwich was great the next day, everything tasted even better. We will go again, and I'm probably being a wee bit picky, but I wouldn't go around pushing everyone to try it.  i will try it again and then see if I would rate them better.
