Some old friends and I wanted to catch up over dinner and one of the guys suggested Nana for dinner. Located on the south side of Chicago, Nana is an eloquently decorated restaurant. With that said, it's a little out of place in relation to the neighborhood. Location aside, one of the selling points is the staff. We were greeted promptly (consider it was empty on a Tuesday night at 7 PM). Regardless, we felt welcomed and were seated quickly. Food didn't take too long. But we were caught up in conversation, so time passed. Now...on to the food. We began the meal with the Hand-cut Nichols Farm & Orchard potato chips and the Queso Fundido. The potato chips were, well, potato chips. But they were burnt. So, yeah. The Queso Fundido a tortilla dish with a cheese, chorizo, and roasted peppers. Had the cheese been a little more melted, it would have been a good appetizer. At this point in the meal, I was a little hesitant on the entrees. I ordered the Classic Nana Burger and my girlfriend ordered a larger portion of the appetizer creamy macaroni and cheese. To my surprise, because of my initial view of the appetizers, the burger was cooked nicely and tasted pretty good. The mac and cheese was crazy peppery. It was not very good. I'm not sold on dinner here, but I'm willing to try brunch. Until next time, Nana.
