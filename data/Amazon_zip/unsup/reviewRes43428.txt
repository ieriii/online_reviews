Had late lunch here on sunny saturday (before it was rediculous hot) - and had the avocado sandwich but added turkey. DELISH! The wait wasn't too long - we realized we were here about half hour before closing, so maybe thats why? The lemonade was good and got an iced coffee to go. Got to spend some time on the patio, but there were a lot of pigeons on this random day, so it wasn't QUITE as enjoyable - but that definately wasn't their fault. I would come back for sammys for sure!
