NOT GOOD for Group dinners. FOOD: 4 star - i have a typical authentic Indian taste, and India house is not quite there anymore. Ambiance: 3 Star - This place is same as it was originally built, it's getting old. Staff: 2 Star - it seems like you have to know Spanish to get what you want here. This place needs to hire English Speaking staff. Indians can't communicate in Hindi, Americans can't communicate in English. Service: 2 Star - for a group of 9 i would assume our service person would come by at least every 30 minutes to check in on our group. We had to constantly go looking for our server - I don't recommend group dinner here. Also If you're seated in the back section by the bar side upstairs. It gets cold, it was 50 degrees outside and the AC was on. We understand constant change in weather, but we had to make almost 50 request before it was turned off.  Restaurant should be a fun and pleasant experience - India House is far from that.
