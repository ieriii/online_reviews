The Gage knocked my socks off. My fiance and I went to a wine tasting nearby and decided to grab dinner afterwards. We called the Gage and were able to get a table right away even though they were very busy. I was skeptical about the entire idea of The Gage given that it's on Michigan Avenue. Shouldn't a restaurant on Michigan Avenue either be geared for tourists, or overpriced, or both?! Let's just say I was happily proven to be oh so very wrong. The decor is dominated by dark wood and white and black ceramic tiles which gives it a 1920s steakhouse feel... kind of like Keen's in New York, but without the feeling that it hasn't been renovated since 1920. The drinks were fantastic. I ordered a gin gimlet, a simple drink but one that most bartenders screw up by making it simply a lime juice cocktail where you can barely taste the gin. The bartenders at The Gage would not sink to such levels, their gimlet was delicious. The service was attentive and knowledgeable and the waiter helped us navigate the menu to find dishes that he felt were special at The Gage and that would suite our tastes. So... now we get to the food. We ate WAY too much because it was so delicious. I can't remember the full menu, but our meal focused on the meats. We started with the Poutine with Elk Ragout and the Scotch Egg. I hadn't even heard of either of these dishes before this evening, but thanks to Yelp reviews that suggested both, we went for it. Thank goodness we did. I've never tasted anything like either before and have no idea where we could even get something similar. Both were unique and incredibly delicious. If you have to choose though, I'd go with Poutine... but plan a workout for the day after to work off the cheese/gravy/meat/french fry combination. I've already written too much so I'll stop here. But, bottom line, you must go to the Gage.
