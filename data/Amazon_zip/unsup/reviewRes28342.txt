I've not ordered deep dish pizza in a very long time. My experience was that there was more ingredients and cheese- this particular deep dish was more pizza dough- I mean way too much dough.  So it's definitely back to thin crust for me and I've found that the best thin comes from Johns pizzaria on western ave.
