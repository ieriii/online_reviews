We've tried Mastro's twice. Once with friends in the dining room and once the two of us at the bar. The steaks were better than fine and the sides were good, but nothing was great. The first time we were there, Friday night at 7:00 PM they were out of baked potatoes. Both times we started with oysters. Fine but not fantastic. We tried a variety of steaks, New York strip, porterhouse and once again everything was fine but not fantastic. Surprising but the steaks were a bit under-seasoned. First time we got creamed spinach, second time sauteed. Nice that they didn't overcook it, but once again a bit under-seasoned. The service was also good, not great. I guess I keep saying that because we expected "great" because of the name, reviews and the price. The first time we went to celebrate a couple of birthdays. The complimentary dessert was a nice touch! A few words about sitting at the bar. It depends what type of atmosphere you are looking for. If you want hip, crowded and a bit loud with several TVs, then you will like this place. If you're looking for something a bit quieter, try one of the other steak joints.
