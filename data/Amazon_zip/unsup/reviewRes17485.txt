The food at Carnival was amazing! The vibe was wonderful and lively. It is a bit pricey, however the food is so savory that it is absolutely worth every penny. The decor was like nothing I've ever seen in a restaurant, truly a feast for the eyes. Overall Carnival was an excellent dining experience and I would go back in a heartbeat.
