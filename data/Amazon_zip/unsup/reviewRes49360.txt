Bin36 is a great place for wine and a great place to end the week and start the night. architecturally, it's my favorite restaurant in the whole city, there's just something about the space and the way it's arranged...love it.  Great for groups or an intimate date, the wine list here is phenomenal. The flights are a great deal and excellent way for novices and snobs alike to try several new wines without breaking the bank. I've found several of my favorite wines that I buy bottles and cases of later by trying the flights (they switch them up throughout the year so many of the flights are not the same each time i visit). the list for wines by the bottle is very extensive and the wine people are super helpful and NOT pretentious at all, which i love.  the food is just alright, i suppose i was expecting more since so much care is given to the wine and cheese selections. i've had several dinners, lunches, and quick bites here and i must admit, the food just fades away. average. though the daily pizzas, DIVINE. a mixed crowd here; swaying a bit towards the 30+ crowd but still plenty of young rowdy pregamers. can't say i've ever been picked up here, but let's be honest, i've never been picked up anywhere :) love to come here with my girlfriends to unwind, catch up and gossip. service is spotty, must be aggressive when flagging down waiters.
