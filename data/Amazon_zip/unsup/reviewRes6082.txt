I love Wildfire. Anything I've ever had here was great. The spinach artichoke dip is wonderful, the filet trio is a favorite of mine, and the mashed potatoes are divine. This is a classic steakhouse and my favorite one. I also have to mention their excellent cocktails - they make a mean dirty vodka martini to go with that tasty filet.
