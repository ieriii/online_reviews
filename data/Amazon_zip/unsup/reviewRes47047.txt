Sweet potato fries are a must here, they come with this goat cheese dip thing. So good. I usually get the burger here, enough to be split by two people. Atmosphere is great, they usually have live bands on the weekends, not so sure about the weekdays. I would recommend this place to anyone, great for a group. If you have a band, try to get a gig here!
