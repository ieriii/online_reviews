As many of the other reviews have already stated, the food here is amazing. They have every kind of meat you could want, and all of them have a version that's wrapped in bacon! I won't repeat what's already been said about the food, so I'll add a couple observations about my experience. First is the staff seems to really care about your experience. My girlfriend and I went here on Valentine's Day. Even though we figured it was a long shot, we requested a quiet area when making the reservation through OpenTable. They seated us in quiet corner of the restaurant, which was great. Requests are also printed on the reservation slip that the waiter reads so everyone is on the same page. One request you might want to make is to not be seated at the bottom of the stair case. There is a table only a few feet from the stairs and the couple sitting there looked awkward because people were constantly walking up to them to get to/from the stairs. The other observation was our waiter was very inattentive. After bringing us our drinks, he came by only once to check up on us during the three hour meal. We could've used some clean plates because we were stacking all sorts of meats on our original salad plates. At the end of the meal, I had to wave him over to ask about desserts. He walked away to get them and didn't come back for 10 minutes! At first, I thought it was because it was a busy night, but I saw him just standing around talking to other waiters. However, overall it was a great experience, and I would've given it 5 stars if our waiter was a little bit more attentive.
