Butter cake. Butter cake. Butter cake...and some amazing beef. I have been there three times since it has opened--5 stars all around. This is as good as it gets in Chicago-- I've been everywhere (Gibson's, Morton's, Keefer's, Ruth's Chris, Fogo de Chao, etc.) and Mastro's takes their cake. From the moment you walk into the former Spago/Blue Water Grill building, you feel as if you have escaped the hustle and bustle of Chicago and are in a beautiful dining room with service I have seen at very few of the highest end Chicago restaurants (Avenues in the Peninsula comes to mine). From the waitstaff to the black napkins (ala Blackbird, Seasons, etc.), the service was nothing I had ever experienced in a steakhouse. But to the main reason why you are reading-- the food. The food was everything you have read about and more, just plain amazing, epic, terrific, any other adjectives needed? The first time I had the larger filet, the second time I shared the porterhouse for two, and the last time I ordered the 33 oz Wagyu beef ribeye. Each was the best steak I'd ever had in the United States (the beef in Argentina is superior, in my opinion). The appetizers are all excellent. Don't worry about the food- you'll love it. As much as the food is incredible-- save room for dessert-- BUTTER CAKE. I mean, there's a facebook group about a dessert?! Only the butter cake. On another topic, I've gone twice with people who are gluten-intolerant. Both times, the people with the allergy remarked that both (different) waiters were most excellent in working with them on getting everything cooked how they needed. So, Mastro's is very competent with allergies. I think that is it...booked dinner at Mastro's for later this week... can't wait.
