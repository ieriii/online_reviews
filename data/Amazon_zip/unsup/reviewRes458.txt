A restaurant from the future. From the elaborate entrance, to the way the kitchen is so quiet and well organized you'd think it was an advertisement come to life but when you see and taste the food, you'll be blown away. Various ways of eating things and tasting things in ways you'd think might never be acceptable considering how you're dressed. Downside: It will be hard to go back to eating regular food after experiencing so many sensations with your tongue.
