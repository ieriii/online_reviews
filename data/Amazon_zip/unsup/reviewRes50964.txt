Billed as down-home southern comfort food with an upscale presentation, Big Jones seems like a place that I would LOVE. Yet, for some reason I don't. I've eaten here a few times now and while I've always had good service (I've actually had the same waiter every time), the atmosphere is pleasant, and the food is what I expect from the menu, I always leave feeling like something was missing. I want to like this place, I really do, but I can't bring myself to give it more than three stars...maybe I need to try it just one more time.
