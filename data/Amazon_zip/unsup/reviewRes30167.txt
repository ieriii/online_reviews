Tasty food in a very nice location. Attentive service, nice atmosphere. The decor is very warm and comfortable. They play easy to listen to music here which fits the mood of the restaurant well. It's a nice place to get dessert and coffee or a glass of wine and read the paper. The food is altogether pretty solid. Not the best burger I've had, but I'm definitely happy with it. Well cooked breakfast food. Pretty satisfying Tex-Mex.  Going for brunch here on the weekend is one of the few times I'm not angry about going to brunch on the weekend. Waits are minimal. Nothing's trendy or scene-y. Nothing annoys me more than going to the Bongo Room. This is the antithesis of that. And the stuffed french toast is amazing. Definitely recommend.
