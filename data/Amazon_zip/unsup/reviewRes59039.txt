It's Saturday night and my friends and I are headed to Sunda for 8:30pm reservations that we made weeks in advance. Woohoo!! We all can't wait!! Our cabbie hits a little bit of traffic, so at 8:25pm I called the restaurant to notify them that we would be 5-10 minutes late. Nice thing to do, right? Wrong....when we arrive at 8:40pm, I learn that our table had been given away. So much for placing that curtosy call. The place is packed and no effort was made to reseat us.   There obviously was a misunderstanding so I tried to remedy it by speaking with the GM, Aeron Lancero. The hostess Abby informs me that Aeron is not in, but that I could take a business card and call him. I call, and have called for several days now, but there is only one problem....Aeron doesn't have voicemail and the messages that people write for him must have been misplaced. Believe me, if Aeron wanted to call and understand the situation, he has both my name and phone number.     Clearly I am an upset patron, however what you should glean from my less than glowing review is one simple, but accurate warning: "IF Sunda does not strive for great customer service THEN how do you think your overall dininig experience will be?"
