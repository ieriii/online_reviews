I give yolk a B-.  The wait was ridiculous, the restaurant was crowded, loud and hot and the food was just mediocre. Specifically, there's nothing to complain about, but nothing I would wait an hour to eat again. There are a lot better brunch options in the city, and in the neighborhood, especially if you wait that long to be seated.
