I never in a million years thought I could wake up craving Persian food. I mean, normally I wake up craving chocolate or cinnamon toast crunch. But Persian food? So that's why I knew something was up Sunday morning when I woke up with a distinct desire for more Persian food. And Monday morning too. In fact I think this desire is going to plague me until I get back to Noon O Kabab (or Noonzies Kababzoes, as the locals refer to it.) This restaurant is DELICIOUS. My favorites include the olovieh, the kash-ke-bademjam, and the combo filet/chicken skewer. My mouth is watering right now just thinking about it. Also, I was quite excited to try the stuffed pepper appetizers, but they had run out because it was a busy night, and the woman who makes them came to our table and apologized profusely and then insisted on making at least six of them for me to pick up another day at my convenience for no charge. And she said if I couldn't get in the next day, she would just freeze them for me. It's so nice to go to a restaurant where the owners actually care about having happy clientele.
