Food: Fantastic. Excellent naan and dipping sauce, piping hot tandoori chicken (still sizzling on the skillet when it is brought to the table), spicy crab curry, and flavorful lentils. Everything was delicious. With over 200 items on the menu, there should be something for everyone. Atmosphere/Service: A large waitstaff created a bustling, but not overbearing, atmosphere.  All of our needs and requests were graciously met and usually anticipated. The service and atmosphere enhanced the overall dining experience and were simultaneously upscale and relaxed.Price: Somewhat pricey, especially for the sides. Rice is not included with most dinners. An order of rice is $5; a half order of lentils runs almost $7. However, baby naan is brought to your table when you arrive (and is replaced if you want more) and is complimentary.Overall: One of the best dining experiences I have had in Chicago.
