I love this place. One of the best beer selections in the city and a food menu that stands up to it as well! Great service, great atmosphere, great beer and great food. Try Elvis' Last Supper. This burger comes topped with peanut butter and bacon! One of the best burgers I ever had. Went very well with my Innus & Gunn Rum Cask Aged Scotch Ale. Highly recommended.
