It's no secret that Chicago has fabulous food. However, I've really struggled with finding decent Mediterranean food in the city that lives up to the standards of Woody's in East Lansing, MI. *Moment of silence for Woody's* But then I found Sultan's Market and I was healed! Oh, wait. What? This place is great. Wide selection, amazing falafel, and cheap cheap cheap. The decorations are fun and I always leave full and satisfied. Now if they only had spicy hummus...*sigh*
