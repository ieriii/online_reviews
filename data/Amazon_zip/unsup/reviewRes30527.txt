The food is fine, but if you show up and the place looks fairly busy, I would highly recommend that you turn around and run, run away. Yes, today was Mother's Day brunch, and the place was near capacity, but still.  Even though we had a reservation for 11:30 in the morning, they were simply out of both the omelette I wanted and the appetizer our table wanted off of the specials list. (By the time I made my actual order, I half expected the waitress to say, "oh, sorry, we're actually out of eggs. And plates. I can bring you some wood, though. Do you want some wood?") Food additionally took exceptionally long to come out of the kitchen - it was definitely in the 45-60 minutes range. I get that a place gets busy and the kitchen gets swamped, but come on, man. You're a brunch place on one of the brunchiest days of the year. Game face, dude. Food was perfectly fine. I hear great things about their dinner menu, so despite the two stars I'd be perfectly willing to try this place again at a less busy time.
