Hopleaf has a serious CATALOG of bottled beers. Huge selection of Belgians on tap as well. Very impressive. I like to try unusual beers while I'm here, such as Kwak, which is served in a glass reminiscent of a chemistry set. The high alcohol content of a lot of these beers can certainly cause Jekyll-Hyde transformations if you go overboard, so enjoy in moderation. There can be an awful wait during prime hours. The upstairs is usually more open than the ground floor, and the bar up there still has a decent stock of beer. So if you're just coming for a few drinks, that might be the better option. Sadly, there are rarely dishes on the ever-changing menu that would be suitable for a vegan - especially a hungry one. The heirloom tomato salad - with smoked cucumbers and haricot verts - that they used to have was delicious, as was the gazpacho that was a special one day. Looking at a more recent menu, all that's left are the frites or onion rings (sans the aioli). But none of these items were enough for a good meal. I could try the cashew butter sandwich without the morbier cheese and mac & cheese, but then it wouldn't be worth $10. Same goes for the salads without the cheese or dressing.
