I think it was only ok, there is definitely better. I had a scramble, it was very fresh but under cooked. They do have a huge menu so maybe i have to try something else if i go back. The service is great, and the restaurant is spotless. All in all i would give it another shot but it won't be first on my list of breakfast spots.
