I came here with a party of 6 for dinner. Some of us were staying at the Blackstone hotel and we decided to check out Mercat a la Planxa. The food delicious, but the service was unfortunately far from the quality one would expect--hence the 2 stars.  Our waiter pushed the $58 ($78 with wine pairing) chef's tasting menu at least twice, if not three times, each time with more pressure, at one point saying things like "it's REEAAALLY YUUUMMMMYY!" And when we told him we would prefer to pick our own dishes, he was very visibly miffed and less attentive to us for the rest of the night.  When we did place our orders, he forgot 2 of the items. The food here is great, but the service is at best careless, at worst pushy and rude. Get your tapas fix elsewhere.
