As part of my efforts to try all 3 Brazilian Steakhouses in 2009 (Texas de Brazil, Brazzaz, and Fogo de Chao), I found myself in possession of a coupon for a two for one deal (which is basically the only way normal people can afford a place like this, and even then it's kind of expensive) and felt compelled to try it out. The basics of the concept are simple: you go to the expansive salad bar first, which includes items like proscuitto, ceviche, raw oysters, and sushi, and when you're ready for the waiters, called gauchos, to bring the meat around you flip over a chip from the side that says "No Thanks" to the side that says "Yes Please". The gauchos bring around as much meat as you want and load it onto your plate until you've had enough and are literally drunk on meat, and then you leave. Now, the lynchpin that divides a place like Brazzaz from Ponderosa is a combination of ambiance and excellence. The hosts and hostesses are there to serve your every meat-related whim. Whatever you want, they get, or have sent over. Because the concept of the churrascaria is pretty universal, it's fair to compare Brazzaz to it's competitors. It's certainly a great experience, and really an excellent time. The decor is very upscale. However, when it comes to meat, it's just a bit lacking compared to Texas de Brazil. There is more variety, of that there is no question. The shrimp in particular were excellent, as was the pineapple. However, if you're going to pitch yourself as an all you can eat meat extravaganza, then your meat had better be top notch. Brazzaz certainly had some high points; the pork tenderloin was excellent. But for every great meat we were served, it felt like there was one that wasn't so great. Moreover, the salad bar, although excellent, didn't compare to TdB's salad bar, sushi chef, and lobster bisque. As I said, Brazzaz was a great place to eat. It was a great experience. It just wasn't quite as good as it could have been.
