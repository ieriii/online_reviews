Top-notch neighborhood spot. It's VERY loud, so don't go with folks with whom you want to converse in depth. Waiter gave terrific recommendations, and all of the dishes were great. Especially loved the grilled calamari app and the halibut entree. Really neat and extensive Italian wine list, many of which have quartino (250 ml) option. Everything is relatively inexpensive considering the quality of food and service. Tight-knit quarters, but that's the scene here. Will go back for sure!
