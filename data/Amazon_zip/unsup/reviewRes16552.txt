What should I say that hasn't been said already? Nothing! Instead I'll just use this to brag about the awesome time I had with my partner in crime sitting in the best seats in the house- at the bar! Just Kidding! Not really... Its as if I just found a hidden gem in the city- and a hidden gem it is indeed! The building outside consists of a subtle yet artsy mural and a single light at the doorway with no signs indicating its identity. Upon walking in I could already feel the excitement as I enter the candlelit room. With the no cell phone policy and the speakeasy feel and atmosphere, it really lets you escape and enjoy the night away! My weapon of choice: The Etiquette-Sparkling, Tabernero Pisco Acholado, Raspberry Syrup & Aperol (in other words delish! ) Partner in Crime: Sao Paulo Jockey Club- Sparkling, Pineapple, Yellow Chartruese, Peychaud's Bitters (equally delish) Drinks will be $12 and up but they're not your typical mixed drinks! These babies are real cocktails and they mean business! The mixologists really take the art & science to another level.Watching them in action makes me appreciate the drink so much more. This is my 2nd visit but a first sitting at the bar. 600+ reviews and counting you're definitely no secret to Chicago, even still, I can't help but want to pretend that you are my own dirty little secret!
