I love you RB. But this didn't really hit the mark for me. I had the guac, cochinita pibil, and a churro. The churro was YUM but they are also YUM from Little Clown Pizza (reppin' Avondale). The cochinita pibil was ok, the bread was really good, but the habanero sauce...yikes! Inedible. However, the agua del dia, mine was papaya, was amazing. I will be back and hopefully it was just an off day.
