Sunday Night 10pm - July 4th - Everywhere else is closed but not Superdawg. It was actually our third choice because we were staying near the airport and didn't want to travel to far, but it was on our list of places to visit after having seen it on the food channel. Driving in, it doesn't seem like anything special, and the mascots seem a little creepy, but one look at the menu and you knew that your late night craving would be satisfied. We both had supercheesies with all the trimmings including the bright green picadilly or or picalilli. The were wonderful. The fries were just plain old crinkle cuts but the oil they were fried in definitely had some character. We finished up with a super sundae with hot fudge. I love that everyone puts those wafer cookies in their ice cream in chicago. The car hops were super nice and helpful, and it didn't take long at all to get the food. When we had late night ice cream cravings later in the week, superdawg was our first choice. If I didn't live in WV, I'd probably be going to Superdawg at least once a week.
