Tank is one place that seems to always be suggested among friends when it comes to getting Vietnamese food. I came in yesterday with the madre and shared a spring roll and each had the combination bowl of pho. The spring rolls came out within a minute or so which leads me to assume they have them pre made. After the 1st bite my mom said that she likes the spring rolls I make at home better! (thanks, mom lol) I think that was more of an attempt for motivating me to learn how to cook more, to be honest. Anyway, while I didn't have any complaints about the spring rolls, I know a place across the street that gives you an extra roll for the same price...just saying. The pho was not mind blowing but its pretty solid. You get what you would pretty much expect when thinking of pho. The bowls are pretty huge, massive in fact, so you can pretty much bet on leaving with a full stomach. I saw that they have vietnamese sandwiches which I am interested in trying sometime.
