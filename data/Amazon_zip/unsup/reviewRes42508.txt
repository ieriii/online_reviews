I went here last night in search of a good deep dish pizza and I guess that I am still on the quest for a good deep dish to be found in the city. The only thing that was good about their skimpy, tasteless sauced, white sausage pizza was the crust. The crust was a buttery, flakey crust that would have been better with just a dipping sauce. If you are craving a thin crust pizza - don't bother here either. I ordered a thin crust cheese pizza just to get a sense of whether it was good or not and even my 5yr old god daughter who is definately cheese-pizza savvy claimed it to be so-so.
