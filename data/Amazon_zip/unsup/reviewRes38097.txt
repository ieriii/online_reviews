My friends and I visited Hopleaf during my bachelor party in Chicago over this past weekend. As part of our dinner plans, we had a visit to Hopleaf followed by barhopping before taking our limo back to the hotel to recover. Our plans were changed, however, when we decided we didn't want to leave Hopleaf at all for the rest of the evening. To start with, the beer list is about as tall as I am, and impressively varied. They have a very large selection of beers on tap, and an equally large and more varied selection of bottled beers and ciders to choose from. Our discovery of the night was Clos Normand, a brut cider from France. The menu is equally impressive - Hopleaf is a place that chooses to focus on a smaller variety of amazingly executed dishes rather than trying to branch out at the expense of quality. My friends and I all ordered dishes and ended up sharing everything amidst an endless series of "oh my god this is amazing try it". We're already plotting our return trip from Ohio.
