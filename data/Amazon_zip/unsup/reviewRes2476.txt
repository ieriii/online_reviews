Duck fat fries: so good. Fois gras with truffle mustard dog: very good. Waiting in line for only 10 minutes: the best! The other sausages on the menu look really interesting, but this is a place you go to when you have a lot of time to kill to wait in line. By the way, Doug is impressive as a human calculator and super friendly.
