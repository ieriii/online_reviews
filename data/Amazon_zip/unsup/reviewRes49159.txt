I happily acted as my friend's date so she could cash in her bloomspot. Let me break down the food. Cheese-- Cow through the ages. Good. Would have liked more spreads or things to accompany the cheese. App-- Oysters. Pleasantly surprised here. I was unsure about getting these here but they were quite good. Only one type though, so not much flavor variety but I happily ate them all. Main-- Swordfish. AMAZING. I would come back just for this. The mashed potatoes were so creamy and the wine-type sauce around the plate was a wonderful complement to the dish. Dessert-- So sort of berry/nectarine pastry. Good. Not the best dessert but fine. I like berry flavors so it was refreshing in that sense. Wine-- The Bin 36 Flight. Awesome. One white, three reds. The first was the chardonnay. I never thought I liked chardonnay but this one was really good! The reds were smooth and robust. Great waiter and experience overall. Without the bloomspot, no way I would have done that. A bit overpriced, in my opinion but 4 stars so how great the wine was and the powerhouse swordfish dish.
