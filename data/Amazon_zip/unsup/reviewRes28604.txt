Fun food, delicious monk fish, garlic popcorn is brilliant. ANNOYING service - our waiter was pushy - wanting us to order a hot AND cold appetizer (who needs two appetizers before an entree) and urging us to get a salad in addition to our appetizers. But THE WORST was that he raved about this one cabernet by the glass - and I ordered it without checking the menu first, assuming it would be fairly priced ($12-16) and that they wouldn't be so tacky as to push their crazy expensive glass of wine. We had two glasses of the cabernet he recommended and when we got the bill we discovered it was $25/ glass. So a $100 food bill became $150. I was outraged and disgusted by what was otherwise a really good restaurant.
