What's not to love about a W? This Lakeshore location is close to the Navy Pier and Michigan Avenue shopping. The rooms are a good size with plenty of storage space for suitcases. They have bliss products and a well stocked bathroom. The only thing that was a little weird was the shutters on the bathroom. Other than that, the rooms are stylish and relaxing. You can have a city view with Sears Tower or the Navy Pier and Lake Michigan. They have complimentary cookies, water, and apples in the lobby and you can sign up to use an Acura if you need to get around town. The only drawback is it does get pretty packed at night with the bar/club or if there are events going on upstairs. The lobby can get crowded and the elevators can get pretty full. Other than that, a solid W that I would stay in again when in Chi-town.
