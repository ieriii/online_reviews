This place is a go to spot for us, especially since we live down the street. I'm not a huge fan of cuban food honestly, but my wife is. Her favorite things here are the empanadas and the ropa vieja, both of which are very good. The fact that it is BYOB and the prices are reasonable make this a pretty solid spot. The outstanding service combined with the atmosphere make this a Chicago spot to try!
