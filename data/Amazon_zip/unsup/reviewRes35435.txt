The Peking duck here is life-changing. By life-changing, I mean it taught me the meaning of the word "foodgasm".  Also, do not miss the "octopus whiskers" which is an absolutely outstanding salt-and-pepper fried baby octopus. Call in advance to reserve the Peking duck, which, at $30 for a whole succulent crispy duck, dumplings, toppings, duck soup, and duck fried rice or noodle, is not only one of the best meals in Chicago but also a great deal. Service speed can vary, but the people are extremely nice. I haven't tried it yet, but I hear they will cook you a Thanksgiving turkey Peking style for something like $1 or $2 a pound.
