Piece has a lot going for them. They make a great pizza and for a nice change of place it's a thin crust for all us east coast transplants. They have plenty of plasma's around which was good since I went with my buddies to watch the Celtics-Magic game 7.   The scene is very cool, nice place for some people watching and an overall cool, local-hipster-pizza place kinda vibe. Obviously the other thing their known for is their beer. We'll get to that in a second. The four of us (my three friends and myself) had a bit of a hard time deciding on the pizza but they had the option of splitting their huge rectangle shaped pizza into two sides that allowed us to all have ingredient combinations. We ended up going with a base of bbq sauce (not my first choice, but you gotta try new things) with one half topped with mashed potatoes, chicken and bananna peppers and the other half with spinach and steak. Sounds like a strange combination (and not necessarily in a good way) right? Delicious! The ingredients were all fresh and I was pleasantly surprised with the way the combination fit together. We topped the evening off with their chocolate pizza which is pretty much just a sweet crust with Nutella and some melted sugar and butter on top. SO delicious.  The only thing real knock that I have on Piece was that they were out of all of all their award winning beer. Granted they said they were remaking the back where all the beer is held, but still you would think with so much hype about your beer that you would think that they would have enough to get through the evening. I do understand that there are times though when running any restaurant that things will come up that you just can't help.  Nonetheless, I have to take a star away for that. Overall, this place is a refreshing change of pace from all the deep dish in this city. I love the vibe and will definitely be back.
