I arrived at midnight. Easy check in. Room was so small! Bathroom has bar sized sink. Yuck! Told front desk specifically that I was tired and did not want to be disturbed as I was vacating the room at 11 that day. Well, the first disturbance came at 12:30 am when some random worker knowed on my door. Next, I have now shooed away 3 cleaning people each time telling them I was leaving at 11:00. If you want a good nights sleep or some peace and quiet- do not stay here!
