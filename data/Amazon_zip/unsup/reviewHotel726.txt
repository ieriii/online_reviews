I stayed at this hotel for a conference this past weekend and was not impressed. In the interest of full disclosure, I just came back from a trip to Asia where I also stayed at three Starwood hotels (Sheraton Hong Kong, Sheraton Taipei, Le Meridien Taipei), all of which were far more superb, which may explain why I'm negatively biased in this case. First, the rooms are clean but BORING. White shower curtains, white sheets/comforter, and very bare walls. Two, there is a Starbucks downstairs which on their website says is open at 6AM, but no one was there when I went downstairs the first morning of my stay to grab coffee at 6:05AM. When I asked the concierge, he responded that it would be open shortly. A few minutes later, I see an employee hurry in preparing to open. When I asked her when they would be ready, she responded that they open at 7AM. WTF. Third, the hotel offers a "green choice" program where you receive either 500 Starwood points or a $5 voucher if you choose not to have your sheets/towels replaced for a day. I opted for this offer but didn't receiver EITHER points or a voucher when I checked out. Fourth, the room service charges are ABSURD:"$5 delivery charge, 24% service charge, and 11% sales tax." Despite having the luxury to expense my meals during my stay, I refuse to pay for such a rip-off.
