If this place was completely vegan I'd give them five stars.  I have been here twice now. Once during their anniversary week and once for breakfast. I had the same waiter both times (Aaron I believe) and he was fantastic both times!  Philly steak-amazing. Was full and had leftovers for lunch the next day. Can't beat that for $4.95 (not sure what regular price is). Breakfast bowl-AMAZING. Not only was I only able to eat a little over half of it (to be fair I'm a small lady, though I can eat), but I didn't eat again until 8pm that day because I was so full. AND had lunch the next day.  I think that was the best $9 I've spent in a very very long time. Also had dessert both times... cookies & cream and cocoa mousse cakes. Both delicious. I think the cocoa mousse was the best cake I've ever had though....  Definitely definitely worth going. Prices are very fair for portion size. I felt like it was a deal both times. But they should lose the eggs/dairy.
