I think this place is so neat. Love the atmosphere and all the details... so rich and warm; I can't believe it used to be the hardware store. They definitely did a great job with the interior. Even the washrooms are neat. The food is pretty good too. You have to try the Beer Battered Cod... yum! I also am a fan of the Chopped Salad (a bit different than the other places) with a great dressing. It does leave your mouth dry and stinky though. Staff is ok... could be better, but could definitely be worse.  I'm not a big bar person, but I love hanging out here, just so warm... I'm glad I have a hang out close to home. Welcome Wilde to the Neighborhood!
