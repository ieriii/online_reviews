As in some of my other reviews, if it were just about the food, this place would probably have a 4.5-5 star rating. I love Greek food and this place really did it for me. I'm not sure, but it seemed like everyone who worked there was Greek. The food tasted as authentic as my poor Asian American taste buds could tell. The service was pretty good. The waiter was very jovial, but for some odd reason, he always spoke to my boyfriend and ignored me. I don't know if it was some kind of cultural thing where men don't address women as directly, but it was odd. I didn't really care though. I was there to eat, not bond with strangers. I can't quite remember what we ordered anymore since it was over Christmas, but I do remember that EVERYTHING was amazingly delicious! Also, I was staying at a hotel downtown and decided to take a train there which was quite easy to do if you want public transportation.
