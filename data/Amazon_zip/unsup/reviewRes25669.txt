I would give Mercat a la Planxa five stars for food & decor and three stars for service - so I compromised on an overall four. The food is amazing. Every plate was delicious and worth every penny (it's pricey). The portions aren't huge, which we love for tapas. We were able to try lots of things without getting full. The drinks were great, although on the expensive side. It also has a modern, unique, and bright aesthetic. Lots of mirrors and colors. We really enjoyed it. I'm going to quote two other reviews in saying the staff was "too cool for school" and "amateur". The hostesses were downright rude. Our server - who seemed inexperienced but was also nice, friendly, and funny - put in our order wrong and we were served in odd courses, with our intended appetizer coming after dessert. We sent it back and they did not charge us for it, to their credit. Despite the flaws in the service, the food and overall experience were so great, we have recommended this restaurant to friends and plan to return ourselves.
