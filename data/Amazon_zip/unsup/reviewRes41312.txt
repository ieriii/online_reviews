Love nice BYOB restaurants! We came here for an anniversary dinner (last year was Tru and we decided to go for good food with a more chill atmosphere this year (and a slightly lower price point). The boyfriend and I both loved 6 of 8 courses. The quail starter (amazing), the motoyaki, the pork two ways (I wanted to lick the miso sake broth), and the chocolate hazelnut creme brulee were amazing!!!! Neither of us were fans of the loaded baked potato as it was far to smokey tasting (I was sad about this as the concept is so scrumptious), or the reverse cheese and crackers. I appreciate that with a wheat allergy, I could eat almost everything. The service was slow to start (i.e. no one came up to us for a good 10 mins), but was great by the end of the night. The restaurant could use a sign out front, or at least something to display that it's actually a restaurant. But I do love the simple decor and presentation. If you go to BonSoiree you're there for the food and not for any other distractions. I want to give 5 stars because those 6 of 8 were so good, but the baked potato was difficult to eat because the smoke flavor was so strong, and the initial lack of service was a bit odd. I wish I could do 4.5 stars yelp! That said, I can't wait to go back.
