This review boils down to a couple of low points that unfortunately took away from what could have been a really nice dinner out. 1) Hostess and Seating: We were a party of two with a reservation and yet had to wait a half an hour for our table. Once it was time to seat us, the hostess came out to the pool table in the Blackstone (that was nice) and said our table was ready....but, then it wasn't again... a very oops, just kidding moment, followed by some sort-of-awkward standing around in front of the hostess booth time. In a nice restaurant--as suggested by the prices, the celeb chef and the buzz --hostesses (once upon a time, I used to be one) should seat people who have reservations promptly, or quote an appropriate time that they will have to wait, do all of this while being accommodating, and actually HAVE a table when they retrieve the guests. Also, If you sit by the window in Mercat a la Planxa, it is freezing. Like, put-your-jacket-back-on freezing.2) Waitstaff: There are so many of you! But they breezed past our table with 1/2 second mumblings about what they were serving. This is foodie stuff! And as the selections came off of a tasting menu, I was curious about the dishes. That extra moment it takes to describe--briefly, I know you're busy-- what I'm eating makes the experience much more rich and enjoyable. Besides, I want to know if you've given me horseradish cream or a butter sauce; there's a huge difference in flavor.3) Food: It was nice, some of it outstanding, and delivered at varying temperatures, some of it much too cold. I wondered, if I can see the kitchen from here, why are my shrimps cold? The spinach dish is unbelievable. I could have eaten a pound of it.Everything else was nice...Alas, those low points sure were lame. The Gilt City deal made it a nice experience, albeit one that I am unlikely to repeat.
