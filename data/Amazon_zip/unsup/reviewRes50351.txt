It's a cute little place. We wanted some gumbo Friday night, and this placed turned up in our research. We walk in around 9:45PM, knowing that the kitchen stops at 10. We were greeted by a friendly Aussie hostess and were seated right away. The dining area was really nice, but we ended up sitting by the window. It was definitely chilly by the window, and could have used some heat. We ordered andouille sausage as an appetizer. A toasted galrlic baguette, a piece of sausage with some mustard, it hit the spot. Next was the crab cakes. They were creamy and delicious. Something about it in the crabcakes that kept us guessing what it was. They also brought us some corn bread that were above average. After all that, the main entree gumbo ya ya came out. I was surprised to see how dark it was at first. It had layers and layers of flavor every bite, and it had interesting textures here and there. It was a little saltier than I would like, and it seemed like it had too many flavors packed in there. It's one of those things you could have a little, but you'd get sick of it fast.  But overall, the experience was good. The menu had very interesting teas, and dinner items that I'd like to come back and try out. I doubt I'll try the gumbo again as I much prefer the traditional gumbo. Service was exceptional.
