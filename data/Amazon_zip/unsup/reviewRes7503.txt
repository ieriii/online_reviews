Great place - delicious BBQ, beautiful space (upscale southern), and for now BYO. Very reasonably priced considering the quality and quantity of food. My fiance and I split the combo which was plenty for us, and then got the souffle for dessert, so delicious! All in all this was a really unique, classy place, great great customer service!
