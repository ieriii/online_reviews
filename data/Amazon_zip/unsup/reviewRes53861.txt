Hmmmm ... how do you rate a place where food was very good, service very attentive, but the music and volume level made your ears bleed? The place was packed with plenty of lively conversation providing natural ambiance but the place felt compelled to keep increasing the music volume so it could still be heard. Even our server apologized for the volume level. (The restaurant patrons were all my age and older -- 40+ -- with plenty of discretionary income and I'm sure the same tolerance to volume).I doubt my friends and I will return. Sad.
