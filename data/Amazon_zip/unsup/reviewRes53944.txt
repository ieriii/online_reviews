I used to live across the street from this place, and I had no idea how spoiled I was! I miss it so much, especially being able to get the cafe con leche before going to work! It's great for any meal, they have amazing pastries, the sandwiches are great, my favorite was the cubano, and the dinners are great too! I still come here when I'm in the area, but I wish they would open one close to my new house!
