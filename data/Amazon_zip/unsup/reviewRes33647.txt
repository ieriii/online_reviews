Mia Francesca's is always a good time. I've never had a bad dish here and the service is always lovely and the ambiance fun. I have to say, though, my favorite part of Mia Francesca's is the carriage house in the back. I had my birthday party here last year and it's fantastic. It's a private little room out back with its own bar and everything. The staff was so helpful, both before the party guiding me on menu choices and at the party itself. I would highly highly recommend Mia Francesca's to throw a party or at least a great night out!
