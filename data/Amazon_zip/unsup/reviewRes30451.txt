Discovered this little gem while in the need for sushi. This place was perfect. The decor is beautiful! My friend and I were dressed casually; however you can also dress to the nines and not feel out of place. It was quite pricey...definitely a place you would go for a special occasion. However, I cannot wait to be able to go again!
