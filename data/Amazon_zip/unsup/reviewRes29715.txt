The Pasta Bowl is one of my favorite spots in Chicago. My first venture to P.B. was serendipitous. My friend and I headed in the snow and frigid cold to eat at a Lincoln Park pizza place called, Chicago Pizza & Oven Grinder Co. However after arriving, the place was closed. It didn't open until 4pm. We got there at 3pm. FAIL. Starving and stranded we walked a few blocks and found a small restaurant called, The Pasta Bowl. Upon entering we were in love. By accident, because one establishment was closed, we got to enjoy a wonderful bruschetta appetizer and the Chicken Farfalle pasta. My next venture here was a second date 2 years later. I was so excited to return! Not only was my date awesome, but the service was quick, friendly and most importantly the food was as delicious as I remembered. I forget the pasta dish I ordered (because the date was more interesting) but I can say it was delicious. Good specials (1/2 off bottles of wine on Tuesdays!) and awesome eats means everyone should go to The Pasta Bowl for an inexpensive and flavorful meal. Hint: Order the Frutti Di Mare....you won't regret it.
