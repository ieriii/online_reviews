Did I say that close conversation was possible? My mistake--it is loud as hell in here. "Not cacophonous"? No sir, it is indeed quite cacophonous. Or I am just getting older and crankier. Either way, do not expect to hear what your tablemates are saying, unless maybe you all smell like flowers and can lean in really close. This establishment is not nearly so mobbed on a Saturday night as it used to be, but the place was still full. Not sixty-minute-wait full, but very bustling well into the 9 o'clock hour. For a place of this size, they really should have multi-guest restrooms. Having just one single for each gender seems inconsiderate if not downright terroristic. But most importantly, I suppose, they still make pretty solid sushi of all kinds. Maybe just come to eat it at 5pm so that you can hear your friends talking, and can then leave in time to take your Metamucil and have your night-shirt on by 9pm.
