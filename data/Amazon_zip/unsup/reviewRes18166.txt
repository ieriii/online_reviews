As a food product developer, I know what certain things taste like....including MSG and other flavor enhancers (like disodium inosonate and disodium guanylate). This place uses either MSG as an ingredient or commercial sauce mixes or bases which include these ingredients. I think that is cheating. I will say that the calamari salad was super good though! After that I just tasted that familiar taste that one finds in cheetos, doritos or boxed mac and cheese mix......which really does make everything taste better, but its just not right for a restaurant to rely on something so easy. Just think of that pleasant salivation and mild buffered saltiness you are left with. And an $8 fee to split an entree?! Stupid, especially when the portions are monstrous. Won't go back.
