Awesome. Vegan cheesecake - are you serious? Yes, they are and it's kicka$$. So is just about everything else. Their raw food plates are crazy good, and filling.  I mean, they're a vegetarian restaurant that's been in biz for 20+ years in one of the busiest, popular 'hoods in the city - they've got to be doing something right, cuz it can be that easy to compete with the likes of all the other stuff around there. Staff is chill, laid back. Most vegetarians are. Outdoor seating in the summer, just a cool vibe when you walk in. Go there! Get the Mexican Cradle and have a Peanut Butter and Soy Vanilla Shake! Try and have one...just try.
