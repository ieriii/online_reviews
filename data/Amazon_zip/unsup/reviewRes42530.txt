Came here on a random Wednesday night, had a larger group, that they had to split up (yeah, apparently 10 is the max at a table), so they split us into two groups on total opposite ends of the place...and waiting an additional 20 minutes before getting seated didnt really make us feel like we were getting off to the right start. We asked if we could add one person to our table (just getting an extra chair), and we were snapped at by the male host saying, "that's not even possible". Yikes! The waiter also snapped at us at some point when one of my friends asked for bread...still can't understand whats with the pretentious vibe here. LOVE that they have a separate vegetarian and vegan menu. bonus points for that... Food actually was pretty damn good. The pasta with truffle oil is amazing, and the ravioli (butternut squash) was actually really good too. The chocolate pie dessert was to die for! They have a extensive drink menu, but the dark and stormy was not among my favorites (a bit too syrupy for me). The downstairs lounge was pretty cool, live music, chill vibe, but it is Cash only.  I may come back just for the lounge...or maybe for dinner with a smaller group...i just can't get over the rude service we encountered that day.
