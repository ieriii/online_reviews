I went back for a second AND third time and loved it just as much as the first. The second time I had the roasted beet pizza which was great. Crispy crust too! My date had a burger, which was also good. The third time I was there with a large group for a friend's bday celebration. They don't take reservations but had a little space we could sit at while waiting for a table to open up. It took less than an hour for that, I was impressed. They handled our group pretty well. I got the chorizo pizza with mango and red pepper. It was good, but the next time I come I will get something other than pizza :) The only complaint I have is that each time I've been there I decided on a beer from their guest taps and it was "out" or hadn't been tapped yet. That's a big annoyance for me. Either don't put it on the menu or have the servers inform me when I sit down what you're "out of".
