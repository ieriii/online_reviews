My girlfriends and I have been on a "best breakfast burrito in Chicago" mission, and thus far Milk & Honey is at the top of the list. To be honest, I haven't tried much else here, but I'm not really interested in trying anything else because their breakfast burrito is so darn good! The ambiance in this place is great - it's casual and comfortable, and the coffee is bottomless...which is always a huge plus. The food is fast, and the burrito always comes with homemade potato fries. Yummm. I will be a regular visitor as long as they continue to make those burritos!
