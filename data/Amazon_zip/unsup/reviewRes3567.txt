Best fried chicken, hands down.  LIke a lot of people have been saying..the Seoul Sassy is the best. If you're going with other people, I would recommend just getting a bunch of different things and just splitting it b/c everything on the menu is worth trying. The sauce for the fries is pretty good as well.
