Good foodDont sell beer or wine but the cool thing is that they let you bring in your own drinks off the street. I brought in my own six pack of beer,The meat sampler was very juicy and flavorful.The hummus was yummy. The bread was good .The outside patio and great view of the street and the weather was great.
