This place is by far the best Brazilian food i've ever had. For $19 lunch you can enjoy all sorts of meets brought and sliced right on your table. Also lunch includes extensive salad bar that has lots of choices, including smoked salmon and so forth. Some of the meat I had here qualifies as some of the best beef and lamb i've ever had also... great place, great atmosphere.
