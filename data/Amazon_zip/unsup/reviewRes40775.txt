This used to be my go to place for years...years ago. Before it got famous. The food was always fresh and we managed to get our favorite sever most of the time. We would go at least twice a month and sometimes more. Till the day I found insects in my soup. But hey it happens. I mean the veggies are fresh so a worm or bug here and there will happen. So I went back again and again. Then, I found insects it my food...Hey Its okay, like I said it happens. So I went back again...and again. THEN the insects showed up in my food AGAIN!!! I have not been back since. I did quietly bring it to the attention of my server all three times. He was a cool cat and I didnt wanna make trouble for him or make a scene. He did apologize. He was aware that it happened to me before.  Admittedly, I have not been back in a few years. I mean a bug in my food once every 5, 10 years, no biggie. But bugs in my food, three times from one place....Hell naw said the Tica...Hell naw.
