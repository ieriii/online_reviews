Great service and a great selection of wine. Everything we tried on the menu was pretty good. We ended up sharing a bunch of the small plates, since we did not find anything on the entree section too appealing. That is not a problem though, because there are plenty of small plates options on the menu that are pretty good. Many of the small plates were more than enough for the two of us to share. We started with the cheddar cheese plate, marinated olives and parmesan puffs. The parmesan puffs were small, cheesy bread puffs and were really good. They give you a big order of them, so be prepared. The olives were good, but not outstanding, same for the mixed salad. The cheddar cheese plate was pretty tasty. A nice touch that Bin 36 adds are small cards with information about the cheese and wine that you are eating. They are nice references for a few days after when you are asking yourself, "What was that cheese again?" We were pretty full, but we also managed to try the mini grilled cheese plate. It came with 3 different grilled cheese combos which were again, good but not great. During the meal, our server suggested some wines to try with our food. All the wine was good and reasonably priced. service, cheese, wine=great other food options=good
