This is in regards to Rooftop @ the Wit. Wow! Go there! Such a cool place to party, have drinks and socialize. I've been there a number of times with friends, and they're always blown away by its awesomeness. It feels like you're in LA or Miami when you're in there (unfortunately the drink prices make you feel that way too). It gets crowded on weekends, so go early and have a ball!
