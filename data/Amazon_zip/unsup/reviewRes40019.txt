Really cool way to dine. each booth or table gets their own grill and you get to grill your own combination of meat. Each person can create their own meal. Do not go alone, the bigger the group the better. The only complaint I have is that as this place continues to grow in popularity, the prices keep going up. Also, it used to be that you could get as many, or as few dishes for your table as you wanted, now they have a mandatory one plate per person minimum.
