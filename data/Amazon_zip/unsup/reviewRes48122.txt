Outstanding food, take all the suggestion that the staff gives you cause everything they suggested was phenomenal except for the pork rind, while it was nice and crunchy the cheese dust wasn't giving the kick it needed it. Do order the maple braised bacon and the red wine poached egg super yum! My boyfriend is not a pork fan so he order the waffle with a side order of hash brown , but he regrets not ordering the more "adventurous" dishes as it arrived on our neighbors table he wished he had and wanted to trade my poach eggs cause it was that good. I'll def make a trip to come back here when we visit Chicago again.
