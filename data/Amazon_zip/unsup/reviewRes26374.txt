We went to this place for our anniversary. The ambiance is lovely, very romantic! The service was very attentive, without being overbearing. The food was good. The meat and fish were very good quality, the veggies fresh. My only complaint is that they cook the meat in oil! I've been to other fondue places which use broth - much prefer that! For one it adds more flavor, and two it is healthier. They did offer a bunch of dipping sauces. I also was not a fan of the cheese fondue, it had a very sharp flavor. But my boyfriend loved it so that is just individual tastes. Overall we definitely enjoyed our experience here. Not sure I'd come back, because of the oil. But the ambiance and service may trump that and bring me back.
