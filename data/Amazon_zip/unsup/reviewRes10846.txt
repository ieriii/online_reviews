i finally made it to the Bongo Room. and it was well worth the [unnecessary] wait. went in on a weekday at about 11, and didn't have to wait in any lines, or for a table. my friend and i were seated promptly, which is awesome, because i've heard so much about the weekend brunch waits, and wasn't sure what to expect on a weekday. i don't normally like sweet stuff for breakfast, i'm more of a bacon, sausage, potatoes, eggs, kind of breakfast girl. so i went with one of the special omelets, that had braised leeks, goat cheese, pesto, tenderloin and butternut squash. it basically had everything great in the world, inside of an omelet. but i knew i had to try one of the pancakes, because they are so well spoken of. so my friend and i decided to split the banana bacon pancakes, because, um, hi, bacon. our food arrived in a timely manner, and first look at the food, and i was just like..DAMN. that is a helluva lot of food, and it looks mighty tasty. oh, and it was. all of it. every single bite. the omelet was full of flavor, and the goat cheese definitely put it all together. as for the pancakes. holy shitballs. explosions in my mouth, forreal. the bacon, the banana, and the praline topping. dear god. i'm salivating thinking about it. soo much food, and all insanely good. i ordered the white chocolate caramel pretzel pancakes to go, to bring to my bf. and those were just insane. my bf was extremely pleased, as was i, and i couldn't believe i was eating again, when i had gotten home. i couldn't resist my leftovers, and i had to try my bf's pancakes. the prices i felt were very fitting, for how amazing and good quality the food was. i will DEFINITELY be back.
