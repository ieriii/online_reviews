Loved this place! The restaurant itself is extremely inviting! You feel like you're walking into some cozy, artsy kitchen where you are seated at wooden tables and chairs that feel like they could tell stories from 100's of years ago. Upon first sight, I knew I could go to Gilt simply for that decor and for a cocktail at the bar at the very least. This night, however, a friend and I chose it to catch up over drinks, dinner and dessert. Our server was extremely friendly (can't remember his name... dark hair, glasses), explained everything and didn't rush as at all even when we forgot to look at our menus because we had so much to catch up on. The cocktails we had were ok. I had the Moscow Mule and while I didn't dislike it, I'd prefer something sweeter. My friend had the Pimm's, which was actually really good. I'd like to try the other specialty cocktails they had on the menu. My friend had the fish special of the night - crusted whitefish - and I had the pork belly entree. We got a side of smashed potatoes as well. The fish entree was delicious, and a huge portion too! My pork belly dish was divine... perfectly cooked pork belly that melts in your mouth but has crispy, fatty edges isn't easy to do, but Gilt does it very well! For dessert we shared the toasted coconut and mocha pie. YUM. I'd go back JUST for that dessert! Divine. We left 3hrs later, having drank good cocktails, been fed delicious food and been served by an awesome guy who never rushed us through any portion of our meal. I will definitely go back! ... would love to check out the bar downstairs as well.
