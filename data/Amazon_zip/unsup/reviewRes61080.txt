It was fantastic, it comes with two generous pieces of chicken, you should specify white or dark meat, plenty of crunchy vegetables, and a really tasty broth. I recommend it. And, it is not expensive and, it is a meal.The chips and dips are also very good.Another time I tried the chicken flautas. hard, rolled tortillas filled with the meat of your choice. Comes with sour cream, guacamole in which to dip your flautas, fried beans, etc. Probably the best flautas I have ever had in Chicago.Maybe I've just beenlucky as I found the service to be very good even when crowded. The noise level is pretty high when they are crowded, poor acoustics.I've been there about ten times thus far and I have found it to be consistently good and with good service, and the prices reasonable. For dessert, their flan is out of this world, filling but really, really, good. I had it with a cup of coffee.Makes me hungry to go there just writing about it.If I have a bad experience at Garcia's, I'll let you know.Try the soup or flautas, my favorites. Not both at one meal, it'd be too much. Or, skip both and have their flan which is a good size wedge like a piece of pie.
