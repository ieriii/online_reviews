I came here with a friend who sang praises about the place. The unusual offerings you can find in the exhaustive menu (although most of them are similarly prepared, just different meat) and even more unusual specials (frogs cooked in a dozen different ways, anyone?) can certainly dazzle the eyes. The food was admittedly pretty good. We had the orange beef (crispy with strong orange rind flavors), chinese broccoli (seasoned just right -- salt and garlic) and dry-chili chicken (not my favorite, a tad too salty, but okay), and they were definitely above average / pretty good. Service, however, leaves much to be desired. The vegetables didn't arrive with the rest of the dishes, and when prompted, the server told us that he'll check on it.  Then 15 minutes later, it shows up -- he definitely didn't put in the order first. As typical of most restaurants in this area, we did find less-than-sparkly-clean water glasses and even found a speck of chili powder in our rice bowl. Well, some might gag at the sight, but if you frequent any of the area establishments, you probably won't bat an eye.  I'd go back again to try their different dishes, but will probably move on once the initial romance passes away.
