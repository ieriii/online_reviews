Though I live like 5 blocks away, I've had the great pleasure of staying at the James Hotel 3 times (wink, wink, just kidding, I'm not a hooker, it was for work). I highly, highly recommend this hotel to anyone coming to town or anyone having guests come to town. It is absolutely fantastic design-wise. The first time I stayed there I had a corner room with two flat screen tv's and a huge bathroom. The smaller rooms were not as decked out but still amazing. Be sure to check out the alarm clocks that project the time on the ceiling. They have 24 hour room service which is awesome, their mini-bars are incredible (they even have intimacy kits - hilarious) and their James Martini's are AMAZING!!
