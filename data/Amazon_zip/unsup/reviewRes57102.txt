The staff is too cool for school. The food is average($11 burgers that taste like the $7 burgers you can get down the street at Logan Bar). The Brewery is a complete novelty, If it was bottled and sold at a liquor store, You would never buy it. Overall this place would fit in much better on Division street, hype, attitude and more hype.
