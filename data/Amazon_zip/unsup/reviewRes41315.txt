I know that Chicago is famous for their many awesome steakhouses AND that Ruth's Chris is not necessarily a Chicago-based establishment BUT honestly I don't care if I'm turning back on Chicago by saying that..... Hands down, Ruth's Chris is my number one "expensive" steakhouse! As a die-hard steak lover, I've tried steaks from several other steakhouses (including Kinzie Chophouse, Keefer's, N9NE, Morton's, Capital Grille, etc.) and nobody even comes close to the flavor that Ruth's Chris steaks have. I mean, how can you say no to a perfectly portioned filet drenched in butter served on a 500 degree hot plate? How?!!! The seafood gumbo is absolutely amazing (highly recommended) and one of the best I've tasted anywhere. The mashed potatoes and mushrooms are good (taste-wise probably the same as you would get any other place) but they definitely don't steal the show from the steaks. Some of their desserts are hit or miss but I really enjoyed the bread pudding. Tip: the 3-course prix fixe menu (app, entree, dessert) is an awesome deal! Lunch prix fixe is $22, dinner prix fixe is $40.
