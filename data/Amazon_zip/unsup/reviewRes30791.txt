3rd time at Sunda and it's still knockin my socks off. Yeah...that was corny but it's sooooo good! I always start off in the bar with a glass of wine. The people watching is quite hilarious and the usual crowd in this trendy restaurant are your business types, your girls in 'showing-off style' cocktail dresses and your pre-going out crowd. All in all- makes for a fun environment. With menu in hand, don't be intimidated by the prices. While they are indeed quite steep, each bite is pretty much worth the $2.50 you paid for. I can't go to Sunda without ordering the 'Toast & Jam'! (and I would be extremely upset with you if you did not order this as well). Shrimp cakes with a tuna spread- oh yeah! I usually then move on to the rolls and I cannot say I have had one even remotely mediocre. They are very big too so you can probably get away with ordering one and an appetizer. (Definitely do the dynamite, the firecracker, the number 10- if you want a few favorites). I would eat there way more often if I had the scrilla but rest assured I will find a way to get back!
