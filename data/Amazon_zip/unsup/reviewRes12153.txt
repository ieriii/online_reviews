When you are looking for great beer and great pizza you must go to Piece. They don't force for you to pick a pizza from a list of 10 options, you have the chance to pick and choose exactly what you want (toppings, sauce, and cheese) without judgment or an annoyed server. The wait staff is young and eclectic, the epitome of who you might think a Wicker Park spot. I just wish they took reservations! The popularity of this places can cause extremely long waits. But while you wait you can try their home-brewed beer!
