The choices of things to dip are pretty good, though not enough given for the price. On top of it the waiter was a bit rude to us, and we were in a dark corner. However cheese plate was yummy, as was all of the fruit for dipping. The chocolate fondue was delicious as well. The boyfriend enjoyed his seafood fondue but wanted more. All in all, not for food lovers but good for a desert place or a snack.
