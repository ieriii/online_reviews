This was my first time trying Vietnamese food. I love asian food but this was different. My friend recommended I'd try Simply It for my niece's birthday party, and so i did.I ordered catering for about 50 people sometime last week. The food was incredible. It was fresh and just delicious to look at. We had ordered Spring Rolls, Dumplings, Eggrolls, Calamari Salad, and I believe it was the Papaya Salad. For main courses I ordered Lemongrass Chicken, Coconut Mango Beef, Sate Shrimp, Beef & Asparagus, and some Vegetarian Noodles.EVERYONE LOVED IT! I might just have to come in one of these days. I heard the place got really great ambiance and really nice staff members. My friend told me that I should try the pho. Wouldn't mind having some soup in this type of weather.Care to join me?
