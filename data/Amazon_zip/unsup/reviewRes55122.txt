We went here for a specila occassion, my 40th birthday and everyone loved it. The meal was excellent. We started with a garbage sald that had a tangy delicious dressing. I also ordered a green apple martini that was very good. I ordered the macadamian nut crusted halibut that was the best I ever had. I LOVED the dessert tray. The waitress comes around with the tray and shows yopu all the desserts. It was definitely hard to choose. It was well worth the price. There wasn't a single thing we didn't like about this restaurant.
