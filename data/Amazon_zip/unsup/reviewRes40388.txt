Carne asada, carne asada, carne asada. Salsa verde. This place is the burrito love of my life. When I lived in Indiana, in college, we used to drive up 35 miles just to eat here. Back in the early nineties when this neighborhood was plenty scary. When I moved to Chicago, I did stray a bit. There are other decent burrito places to love but there's nothing like your first. And REALLY, there's nothing like it. Some places come close but these burritos, delicious in their simplicity, are the best. I try to explain to my Florida friends why the refried bean, cheese, crap and ground or re-hashed steak or ground beef burritos are gross but they just don't get it and unless they come eat here, they never will. I feel bad for them. Can't wait for my next trip back to Chicago.
