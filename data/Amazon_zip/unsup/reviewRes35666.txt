I would highly recommend Sun Wah to everyone in Chicago! Having authentic peking duck was a new experience for me, especially the way Sun Wah does it. Make a reservation for the duck feast and then show up with your BYOB booze and prepare to feast! They won't let your duck go to waste. Our feast included sliced duck (carved beautifully tableside) with steamed bao and veggies, duck fried rice, a duck broth and a not-made-from-duck sorbet, all for $10/person. The only drawbacks I can think of were the location (pretty far north of where I normally spend my time, although close enough to the train to still be considered convenient) and the corkage charges for BYOBing. Neither of these things are going to stop me from going back though, and soon.
