i've found sultan's market to be the best falafel that i've tried in chicago based on taste and price... $4 for a falafel sandwich and it's always fresh because this place is crazy busy. the salad bar is impressive and looks amazing, but i can never pass up my usual order. if you know somewhere better, holla at me... i want to know.
