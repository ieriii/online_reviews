This was the first stop for my wife and I on our visit to the Chi. I had heard that it was along the lines of the Cheesecake Factory and we love that place, so since it was around the corner of our hotel, we decided to try it for lunch. We were not disappointed. I tried the bbq sandwich with slaw and veggies instead of fries and it was delicious. My wife had a teriyaki chicken and steak dish that she also enjoyed. The ambiance is a little classier than the Cheesecake Factory. We got there at 11a when they opened and by noon, when we left, the place was packed. The have a huge variety of foods to choose from and the desserts are made fresh daily. I, definitely, would patron the Grand Lux Cafe the next time I'm in the Chi.
