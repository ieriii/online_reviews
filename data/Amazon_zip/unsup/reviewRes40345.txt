Had lunch midday, they offer an brunch menu which has plenty to choose from. I had a nice cup of coffee and the egg Benedict with Peeky toe crab which was amazing. The bacon served with it has a sweetness with a crunch that is absolutely delic.. as are the potatoes served with it . Also tried the pear and frissee salad, which was very good as well, nice choice of mixed greens. Tried my guys wild boar sloppy joy and that was also very tasty. The service was prompt and polite...overall very good experience....would definitely go back.
