Wow. Just, wow. Everything about this place is simply stellar, from the decor to the menu to the sushi bar. It's chic and modern but accented with old, historic pieces that are influenced by Asian design--I loved the whole concept. And as for the food--I think "yum" sums it up. We went for brunch, which has quite the reputation, and it lived up to all the hype. The bloody mary bar alone took our breath away; every garnish you could ever imagine! My girlfriend got the "Hangover Cure" and I got the Oxtail Smash. Both were probably the most unattractive combination of foods--eggs, rice, potatoes, hamburger patty--but platted oh-so-nicely. And we weren't complaining because we were too busy shoveling the goodness into our mouths. Then cookie bites for dessert. Love. The service was fantastic. Very genuine and not snobby at all; I won't lie, we were worried about how intimidating this place might be. Not at all. We didn't even get to the sushi portion of the menu. You can bet we'll be sampling that on our second visit. Highly recommend.
