It's all about the Oyster Bar! I love going here after work and meeting a friend for wine and oysters! The bartenders are very friendly and helpful. The seafood salad is amazing as well as the sushi (very fresh, even though you don't automatically think of this as a sushi place). The dining room is great for power lunches and a nice dinner.
