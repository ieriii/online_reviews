I really love this place. I have been here 2 times and both times the food/service/wine was incredible. Starting with the delicious bread they put on the table and the great ambiance of the restaurant I knew that this would be a place I would frequent. I had the egg plant parm and it was probably one of the best I have ever had. The next time I came here was when my mother was in town, and she loved it as much as I did, which is saying a lot because she lived in Italy for a number of years. She ordered the ceaser salad as an appetizer and then a stuffed chicken and both were cooked to perfection. I highly recommend this place.
