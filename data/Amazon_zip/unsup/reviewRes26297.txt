You're simply the best...better than all the rest!!!! Sorry, couldn't help the pun. But on to my review! Clearly I like this place. But I don't. I LOVE IT. Scuba Steve and I were being lazy and decided to order in. Like a good boyfriend of an avid Yelper, he consulted Yelp to figure out our dinner options. Thinking he would get something relatively healthy, he headed over to the Asian cuisine section - then decided upon Vietnamese. Simply It had great reviews as a BYOB, but how about delivery? The food was delivered within an hour, and it was well worth waiting for. We ordered the Chicken Avocado, the Sticky Rice with Chicken, and the Coconut Mango Beef. All three I will HIGHLY recommend...so delicious, and not greasy at all! Chicken Avocado is an entire chicken breast stuffed with avocado - it comes with some side greens, etc, and has the crispiest, most delicious crust. Sticky Rice with Chicken is pretty straightforward, although I have to say the best part of it is that you can tast the scallion they put in it (and that's a good thing!) Saving the best for last...the Coconut Mango Beef was simply delicious - it also has carrots, snow peas, cauliflower, broccoli, and spinach. I put it on top of a bed of brown rice and gobbled it up. We were also intrigued by a nice letter that was inclued with our receipt and menu that thanked their diners for their patronage (you are SO welcome, thank YOU!) and also requested that if they liked it they write a review on Yelp (done and done). The delivery guy was very sweet, and they included a bunch of these little rice cakes that are slightly sweet and sooooo tasty! Can't wait to actually go TO the restaurant! :)
