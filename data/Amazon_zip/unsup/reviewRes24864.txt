Gave Irazu another try. Pulled menu up online and ordered takeout. Prices we were charged different from what was listed on menu. Asked for steak tacos with lettuce and cheese only. Seems simple to me, but nooo, got tomatoes, jalapenos, and avocado. Probably why we were charged extra, but I didn't want any of it anyway. Other big problem, our food was ice cold. We live a block away and were still waiting on food when we picked up - so really don't understand. Some of our friends swear by this place, but we are officially done trying here. Too many other options with consistency.
