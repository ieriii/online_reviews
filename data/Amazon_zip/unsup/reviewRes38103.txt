This was my first trip to Hopleaf and I wasn't really sure what to expect. At first a was a little upset about the 2 hour wait for a table for 5 people... what I meant to say was, I was upset about the 2 hour wait for a table for 5 people until I saw the beer list and very reasonable prices. In the slightly less than two hours we waited for our table I tried a few exotic beers that were all good (thank you bartender for your suggestions) and they were all only $5 a piece! Once we were actually seated the service was pretty good, we tried the "signature muscles" ( I feel a bit sacrilege saying this but...)and they were pretty good, I don't know if they were the best I had ever had or anything.. but that being said my entree was amazing! I sampled 2 of the other plates on the table and they were great as well. I will definitely be back!! Ps. The food had good portions & better prices!
