I had never heard of Nana Organic when my friend suggested we try it but I was all in because I love brunch spots! The wait time was manageable and the staff was awesome. Omar was at the bar (and I later found out he was the man in charge). We ordered cocktails while we waited and upon his recommendation we tried the Prince of Winter. He literally took out a blow torch and "flamed" the fresh rosemary to put in our drinks! I was impressed and the drink was tasty. Becky took care of use at the table and was super nice and helpful. My friends and I had particular dietary restrictions and preferences and she took her time explaining everything and making suggestions. Believe it or not I had never eaten a poached egg before but their specialty on the menu - the Nanadict - was delicious. I was hesitant about the runniness of the egg but she had the chefs cook it a little longer JUST FOR ME (and anyone else who asked I'm sure)! ;-) It was delicious and I'm definitely adding Nana Organic to my list of go-to brunch spots. The white sangria was also good... and strong... Becky made it herself!
