I had a habit of going here every Friday for delicious Pho. Its definitely better when its winter... The soup will fill you up.. some of the bowls they sever it in are HUGE. They serve it traditionally by letting the broth speak for itself.. You can tell its been stewing all day... mixures of oyster sauce and beef broth and other spices make it special... its not your typical beef broth. They have a ton of stuff on the menu, alot of traditional Vietnamese food.. LIke the Sandwhices ( Banh).. etc... but i mostly go for their Pho. I choose between either chicken or beef....You can order double noodles or double meat if yer up for the it.. They also serve it with the fresh Basil mint and lime... All of the ingredients mixed together in the soup, make for a unique taste.... the noodles and the meat in the soup make it a perfect dish.. The menu has ALOT of items on it.. if you dont know what to get, they are unfortunately not very helpful in that depatment.. This place isnt about service.. its about the Pho.. end of story.  Pricing is good and reasonable.. less than $20 per person on average. I also recommend the egg rolls and they have a good Curry soup too. Place is average in size and it gets busy on the weekends.. and you might have to wait for a table... closed on Tues i believe....also, its byob
