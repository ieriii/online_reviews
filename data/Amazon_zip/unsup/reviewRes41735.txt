This bar is an amazing space, and if I had someone trendy I wanted to impress with my style, I'd definitely take them here. By 9, it was buzzing with beautiful people who had plenty of room to show off their sexiness. I love that it's not small -- it's a big-enough loft space with room for everyone to mingle. A classy singles event could definitely happen here. The food was good. Just good. I liked it -- I just didn't like paying $16 for a medium lump of mozzarella and three tomato slices. It made it hard to swallow, you know? It's not small plates for entrees, but you definitely won't take any home. Our waiter was consistent about coming over and very perfectly chill to match the vibe. I didn't have a cocktail, but the next time I'm in the mood for a cocktail and I want to show someone from grad school how successful and amazing I am, I'll bring them here.
