We decided to swing by on our way to the Davis to catch a movie; it started pouring so we ducked into Garcia's for a quick bite and a margarita, got a table by the window in their open air dining room, ordered some dinner, a couple pitchers of margaritas and forgot all about the movie. ...which would have been a fantastic night, had it not been for the service. Water was never refilled, getting our waitress to take our dinner order took a half-hour, getting her to take away the plates took an hour, and she forgot someone's dessert order altogether. To make matters worse, when it started downpouring, the wind picked up the rain and blew it into the restaurant, and no-one ever came by to close the windows. Luckily, we voluntarily decided to forgo the movie, otherwise the review might be much worse. It was still a pretty fantastic night, as the company was right... but it still put it damper on things.
