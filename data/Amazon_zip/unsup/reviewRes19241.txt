I wish I could give it four or five stars... Bad Apple has one of the best beer lists in the city and some great burgers. This place is doing a terrific job in that respect. However, the service needs a little work. For starters the wait staff makes their drinks and pours their own beers. It's a complete cluster f!*% behind the bar. I've been in the business for years and this is not an ideal situation for both the restaurant owners and the servers. There should be a bartender which would help alleviate the time the server is spending behind the bar and allow them to spend more time with their tables. Our server was great and very knowledgeable about the beers but he was sat numerous tables and had to run behind the bar and pour all his own drinks which left us with empty glasses. At the end of our meal we were in the process of paying our bill when the manager/owner swooped in out of nowhere before we were done figuring out the bill. Where was she when we had empty glasses??? It just felt like all they cared about was getting our the money. I will continue to visit Bad Apple because of the great beer and burgers but what holds me back is the service.
