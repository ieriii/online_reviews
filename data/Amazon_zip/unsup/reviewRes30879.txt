I finally had the ever-so-popular- organic restaurant in Bridegport, Nana. My first impression of the place, very well decorated simple but it feels up-scale, and clean! I attended a friend's special event, and we had the Sunday Family dinner meal, where you get a set menu with vegetables, mac and cheese, butter milk battered fried chicken and some really nice desserts. Okay, Nana had great presentation for the food. However, didn't care for the fried chicken, I did like their mac n cheese, and I liked their desserts. I only tried one of their desserts, which was the chiffon cake with Crme anglaise which was very yummy. And total cost per meal was about $22, without tax and tip, which is a good value for a Sunday dinner party. I took a looked at the rest of their menu, wow they do have some expensive menu items. I felt that were priced fairly for some of the items, but for the area it is in, maybe not so much. I know Bridgeport is still up and coming but it is very expensive. And a lot of customers with big pocket books can afford this fine eating establishment, but I don't plan on eating that too often because it will burn a whole in my wallet. I can learn to eat here more often if I were rich. However, I know the neighborhood is changing and Nana brings about a newness to Bridgeport it never has before, and I guess this is the beginning of better eating establishments.
