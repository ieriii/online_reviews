I took my dad to Fogo de Chao for a surprise birthday dinner with some of his friends.... though I must insert a disclaimer here: I do not eat red meat. So how the hell does a girl like me review a Brazilian steakhouse, you ask? Because the look on my dad's face said it all as he bit into his Filet Mignon. Basically, he won't quit raving about the place. As for my own personal feelings on what I had (salad bar & side dishes)... oh, & I had the Tropical Caipirinha from the bar before we started (HOLY crap, i think my taste buds died & went to heaven!)... I admit I was expecting a little more from this salad bar after everyone I know kept raving about it, but either way, I ate my face off. I was a big fan of the polenta & potatoes they serve on the table, also. The other highlight of the evening? There were 3 birthdays being celebrated at our table, and they gave us 3 free desserts, something I was definitely not expecting! If you drink, be prepared to drop some serious buckage, but it's worth it. The great service we received (those servers are like freakin' meat snipers... the minute your card gets flipped over, they're all over you!) definitely makes this worthy of a 4-star review.
