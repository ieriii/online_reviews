Irazu is by far my favorite little place to eat. I love all the veggie options, and it is right across from the teacher store I frequent. The soy oatmeal shake, plantanos, veggie tacos, egg sandwich...all make my list of tops. It is great to eat in or carry out. They have a nice outdoor seating section that is a wonderful place to unwind after work or to grab a bite on a summer day.Service is a little slow, but always friendly. If you haven't experienced Irazu, get on it!
