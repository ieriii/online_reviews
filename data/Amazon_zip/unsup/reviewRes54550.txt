Absolutely fan-friggin-tastic! The food is cheap and fast. It is made right in front of you from fresh ingredients. I was there last night for the first time with my new roommate, and I am in love with Sultan's Market! It fills you up, but doesn't leave you feeling weighed down or gross. It is a real find! I love the crazy lamps, too!
