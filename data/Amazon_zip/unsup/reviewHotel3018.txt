There are some pretty harsh reviews on this hotel. I've come to realize that not all the rooms in the hotel are the same bc I can't say I have some of the same complaints. PROS: convenient location views of navy pier/lake michigan friendly/helpful staff Bliss products!!! car service to local attractions (must reserve in advance) CONS: crowded elevators in the evenings due to the bar upstairs thin walls (I'm a heavy enough sleeper not to hear anything, but the bf said otherwise) All in all, I had a good experience and would stay here again.
