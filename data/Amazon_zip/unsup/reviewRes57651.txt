Love Nuevo Leon! My family and I have been going there since I was a kid. Their food is great and their prices are low. As others have said, they're cash-only, but there is an ATM in the restaurant. Also, it's BYOB and they don't have an alcohol on the menu. Their tacos are great and we love their Queso Panela and Quesadillas Raul. Also, their fajitas are awesome. Definitely recommended! They have a small parking lot down the block, which is exclusive to the restaurant. All you have to do is taking the card the parking attendant gives you and have them sign it when you're paying the bill. However, if the lot is full, it's street parking only, which can be a pain in that area. Also, beware going there on the weekends because it can get crazy busy! We've been there when the line of people waiting for tables has literally been out the door. But the good thing is that they're pretty quick, so you never really have to wait long!
