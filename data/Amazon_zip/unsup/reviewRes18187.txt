BYOB Italian. Come with an appetite...a large one. The portions are giant, so you'll eat for a couple of days. My dad said that they have the best lasagna he's ever eaten. I loved the chicken picatta. The homemade pasta is delightful and perfectly al dente. Just don't go here when you need to watch your carb or caloric itake.  The ambiance is quaint and intimate, so I imagine it'd make for a great date. I have nothing but glowing things to say about Caro Mio.
