I've been dying to try Bayless' cuisine ever since watching him on "Mexico, One Plate at a Time". I'm Mexican and I'm very hard to impress with 'authentic' Mexican food so my expectations were quite high. We got lucky and made a reservation for the next day at 1 PM and we were seated right away. The decor was very funky with bright colors and huge paintings depicting Mexican culture. We ordered the ceviche trio - absolutely amazing! Margaritas and mojitos were strong and yummy! My boyfriend had never tried mole so I knew I had to have him try the Mole Enchiladas - they were amazing! We both love spicy food and this mole definitely made us sweat! Truly delicious. I ordered the fish with green mole and it was perfectly cooked. Honestly, can't complain about the food! I wish we had tried their Tres Leches cake but we were completely stuffed. The service was also very attentive and professional. I knew he would appreciate me speaking to him in Spanish but out of respect for my boyfriend he also repeated everything in English just to make sure everyone understood. Great experience over all.
