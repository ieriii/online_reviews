This place is very American, and I was expecting Italian so there's why I didn't like it as much. They serve a LOT of food for the price. Not my thing, but a lot of people like that. For about $15 you get a soup, a salad (from salad bar) and an entre. The whole check for 2 including, 2 beers and 1 coffee was $23, so there. The good -- The bread! Delicious and warm!           Service is good. They're fast and friendly.
