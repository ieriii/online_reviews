Four stars is a great score considering I'm not vegetarian/vegan. I got the Chilaquiles and the wife got the Huevos a la Mexicana (egg whites). Lots of flavor on both of our dishes and very plentiful.  It's a smaller setting, and we saw a few larger groups waiting for a while outside at a non-peak hour. Our party of two was seated immediately and we were in and out in 30 minutes PROMPTLY. We got sweet potato fries as an appetizer and they were done perfectly, just needed to add a bit of salt. Will be back whenever the wife is craving a purely vegetarian venue.
