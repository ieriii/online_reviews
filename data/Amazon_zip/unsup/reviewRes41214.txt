Although I'm from DC, my family and I used to visit Chicago every year (for more than 10 years) to see my grandparents -- it was almost like a second home. Despite going for several years, it wasn't until 2007 that my cousins suggested we get pho here. Since I wasn't really from the area, I had no expectations and was subsequently blown away. I got my usual pho tai gan and it was the best pho I've had, still to this day 3 years later... and just for 5 bucks?! I'm not sure if its still that cheap, but it was such a deal then. We now make it a point to stop by Tank Noodle every time we go back. Note: I just now decided to write a review 3 years after the fact because I saw that Tank made it onto Poor Taste Mag's Top 100 Greatest Cult Restaurants. It's #22! http://www.poortastemag.
