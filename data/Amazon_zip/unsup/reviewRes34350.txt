I keep coming back for a reason... Falafel sandwich, spicy please. Also the basmati rice is awesome. Far better than the lentils and rice. Everything is pretty damn cheap. I haven't been to many other places in the city for middle eastern because of them. The lentil soup is a bit lackluster. Beverage assortment leaves me always wishing I would have tried that tamarind soda, or something equally as crazy to my narrow mind...
