It's ridiculous that I haven't reviewed this place yet, as Irazu is one of my favorite places in Chicago. I've been here dozens of times and have never been disappointed. The complimentary chips and salsa are fantastic, and I firmly believe that the vegetarian burrito here is the best you will get in all of Chicago. That, along with an oatmeal milkshake, may well be the perfect meal, especially if you add hot peppers to the burrito (after a couple of times, I decided that the addition of mushrooms wasn't really necessary or desirable). If you're looking for something less enormously filling, you can get an order of black beans and rice, which actually makes an excellent light dinner, especially with a side of plantains. Great restaurant, great food, great prices.
