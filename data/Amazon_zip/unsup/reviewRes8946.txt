Every now and then, I have to remind myself that some of my favorite dining destinations in Chicago are indeed more than a short walk or a cab ride away! Noon O Kabab made it to such a list recently. Situated in the the largely ethnic section of Albany Park, flanked by dollar laundry and grocery stores, it was in every way a complete contrast to the typical downtown dining scene. The restaurant does not have a wine list but warmth and genuine hospitality flowed in abundance. From the cute and flirtatious young waiter that gave us great food recommendations (even though he needed a few reminders to get those to the table), to our gorgeous Middle Eastern hostesses that sat down to talk to us and graciously accommodated unplanned guests - everyone aimed to please and did so with a rare authenticity that was immensely appealing. I saved the best for the last - the food. We started with the hard to pronounce, but easy to gobble down appetizer - Kash-Ke-Bademjan. Think Bhaba-ganouj with a different better twist. I had a Shirin Polo for my main course - a very colorful, sweet and sour rice based dish with was as fascinating for the eye as it was for the palate. Thrown in with a minty yogurt salad, and several cups of Persian tea, it was a perfect ethnic dinner. I wish Noon O Kabab was easier to get to, but for authentic Persian fare a trip is here is certainly worth making.
