Put me in the I-don't-get-it category. I was there for brunch. They are militant about the everyone-from-the-party-must-be-present-for-visual-inspection routine restaurants have sometimes. Our waitress was inattentive, the food unrefined and oversized. My chicken and waffles was good - all dark meat, not a problem, but I think they get away with the appearance of value by serving really cheap ingredients - marrow, fries, pork belly, etc. The gf got a pork belly sandwich she found inedible, because it was a huge, fatty round of pork belly, which is one of those ingredients that should be used sparingly and well-seared. Afterwards we went indoors and met some friends for drinks. Got ignored sitting, so I went up to the bar, and was ignored by no less than 3 bartenders, although the place was fairly empty. After 10 minutes or so, one of them finally noticed me, and they still took another 20 minutes to make their precious drinks. I don't have a problem with that if they're busy, but some girl sitting at the bar was chatting away with them and offering to buy them drinks. The aforementioned waitress was hanging out up there too, which explained why she was never around to serve us. Drinks were good, but light on booze and overpriced. Upon returning to the table, one of the staff overheard our conversation about the long wait, and brought us some huckleberry coffeecake or something. Having just eaten, i would have preferred timely service to free food. In short, I can't imagine being in Logan Square and going to this place with Lula right around the corner. I can't believe they got a Michelin star for their stab at farm-chic food! Definitely better options with less hype here in Chicago.
