Definitely interesting decor, and definitely owned by CCF. I like that there's an escalator to the dining area bc you have a better view for everyone. I don't like the circle room bc the booths are tiny. When I went there with a friend I had an awesome pineapple mojito ...I mean it had liquor in it but it was still sweet and perfect. I had a salad, I don't remember what kind, and I assumed that the dressing would be on the side... so a few minutes after i ordered I stopped the waitress to ask if it would be on the side, she said no... so I asked if I could get it on the side, and she said that the order had already been put in so no.. but they could add extra lettuce in it to make it not a dressing-ie. I didn't like that so I left it as it. Ok there was a lot of dressing on there! I don't know why you have to order dressing on the side now-a-days, I feel like that should be a given.. whatever... I think that food is fine, I actually like some at CCF better, and there is the cheesecake at CCF that is lacking at GLC. I think its a little to touristy and like I just arrived from the burbs-ish place but I had a fine time overall,
