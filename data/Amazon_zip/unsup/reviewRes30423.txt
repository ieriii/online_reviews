3 stars based on food, wait time and service got there at 5:30 in hopes of reducing the wait but didn't make the first round in. ended up waiting just under two hours. any restaurant that makes you wait for 2 hours better be good. perhaps that's where the trouble started. the food was good, not great, probably 3.5 or 4 stars. i think my expectations were too high after all the hype. my favorite was the guacamole and the fresh tortillas. guac was super creamy and had just the right amount of lime and cilantro. i think there's sumthin else in there, but i couldn't put my finger on it. i'm a sucker for fresh tortillas and these def satisfied. the ceviche Yucateco was very fresh but a little too much radish for my taste. the Carne Asada a la Oaxaquen was good. meat was well seasoned. not super impressed, but maybe that's cuz i usually eat my steak medium rare. the Enchiladas de Mole Poblano were okay. a bit on the dry side and i was not really impressed with the mole sauce. once my friend said it tasted like peking duck sauce, that was all i could think of. the duck tacos weren't bad but didn't knock my socks off. our server was never around. only came by to take our orders and give us our check. huge deduction there. was overall disappointed so had to get churros with chocolate sauce at xoco and was super happy after that. overall, i'd rather go to fonda.
