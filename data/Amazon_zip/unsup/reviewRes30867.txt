It should be a crime to enjoy food and drinks this much...that pretty much sums up how I feel about Mastro's. I loved... Bone in Filet, crab stuffed mushrooms, Lord the creamed corn and the friggin brussel sprouts with pancetta. Drinks were really good..expensive but good. I should mention that they came in their own shaker which had an additional full drink after my 1st one was served. Last but not least... The Butter Cake and the Creme Brulee was to die for. Just polished off the rest of the Butter cake a few minutes ago. Romantic dinner for two accomodated graciously by the staff in a very quiet area. Greatly appreciated that!! We will be back!
