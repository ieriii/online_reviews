This place has gone downhill; I used to really enjoy the food here. The pizza was burned the last time I came here and it's just not very good anymore. The service is spotty. Sometimes it's good....sometimes not so good. Ambiance is okay if you like loud sports. The restroom always seems kinda dirty. I don't think I'll come back.
