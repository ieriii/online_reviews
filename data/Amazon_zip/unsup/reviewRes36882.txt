This place is really good. I have ordered out several times and finally ate in this weekend. The food presentation is really good. I love the spicy sake roll and seaweed salad. Their sushi is just perfect. I tried one of their curry dishes and the chicken was a little tough and there weren't as many veggies as I'm used to. Stick with the Japanese fare and you won't be disappointed!
