Delicious! Great atmosphere! Extremely knowledgeable staff! To memorize their extensive wine list and cheeses, plus the pairings with their very unique menu, is a very daunting task but our waitress was most helpful. Every review we read seemed to praise the bone marrow spread and it lived up to its hype. It was like the most decatent parts of the pork were condensed into this salty gelatin and smeared over toast. And if you are a lover of cheese, then there is no doubt you need to stop by this weekend!
