Billy Dec's new spot and already extremely successful after being behind Rockit Bar & Grill and The Underground. The restaurant's name is a nod to the Sunda Shelf, a Southest Asian landmass, and incorporates modern takes on dishes from throughout the region. A large chunk of the lineup is devoted to China and Japan, but fare from other countries, including Cambodia, Vietnam and Thailand, makes an appearance too. There are new Asian dishes such as Malay-style Chilean sea bass, crab-crusted ahi tuna with Japanese hot mustard-soy glaze, pork shank confit with garlic-foie gras gravy and watercress salad, and a couple of Asian-inspired noodle dishes. There's also a full sushi bar. The establishment is divided into 3 dining areas: a long communal seating area next to the sushi bar is first come-first serve, the seats in this area are back-less and not very comfortable for extended dining; the bar area is in the front and seats are relaxed with plush cushions and there are couches to relax on whilst setting your amuse-bouche on low, wooden, southeast asian coffee tables; the true dining area is set along the back wall of the interior, the seating is relaxed and are partitioned with Taoist and Buddhist accents. The decor is the high point.
