Let me start by saying that I loved it. It was like being on the set of a Top Chef episode. I wish fifty more restaurants would open with this concept. It felt like you were eating at Chef Shin's home. I also love that I get to play sommelier.  I first saw this restaurant on Check Please and all three reviewers loved it. Even with this high expectation, the restaurant delivered. It's hard to believe that it was three chefs and a waiter running the restaurant. I thought that was odd, in a good way.  Two things that were note-worthy: Chef Shin was working the room. He had his quality control hat on and is very charming and nice. You can tell that the restaurant is his baby. Second, they sneaked in a 6 course that was awesome. It was a rabbit stew in a large spoon. Very unexpected and tasty.  Two notes: they should leave your wine on the table. When it gets busy your glass can sit empty for a few minutes. Don't sit at a table by the door. I watched a couple sitting by the door and make faces every time a burst of cold air swept through. I felt bad for them.
