This restaurant was truly excellent. LOVE IT!! My wife and I brought our three kids and her parents for dinner. The waiter and service staff could not have been nicer, more polite, and helpful. Very warm and welcoming - even with the kids. The food was truly excellent. We had a wonderful organic tomato and cheese pie. The vegan lentil taco plate was truly outstanding - as were the salmon, the burger, an soft-shell crab. Highly, highly recommended.
