Let's start by saying that I go out pretty frequently and enjoy a good sports bar with great food and a friendly staff. The Fifty/50 offers all the above and more. Living in the suburbs I don't make it to the 50 nearly as much as I would like to. Every time I have been there the service has been great, the food excellent, (HUGE wings) and very reasonably priced for the area. The bar seating is comfortable and the decor is upscale and modern with lots of individuality.Great place. I look forward to going back very soon!
