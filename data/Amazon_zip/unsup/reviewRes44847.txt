We ordered a cheese garlic bread which was AWESOME & it didn't take long either. Everybody enjoyed it! So, i highly recommend it while waiting for the pizza. The Veggie pizza was not so fascinating though. I felt full after just one slice. So we had the rest of it for to go. Surprisingly, when i reheated the pizza in the microwave the day after, it tastes much more delicious than when we ate it at the pizzeria! I have no idea how, but my friends and sister feel the same too. So next time i'll know i'll have the pizza for to go, and save the awfully long wait!
