Yolk is a pretty good place to get brunch, but it doesn't hold a candle to Walker Brothers. I was here for brunch in June and had the butcher shop omelette, the cakes, eggs, and meat, and some french toast. The french toast was pretty good, as was the pancakes, while the meat in the omelet, the bacon, and the sausage seemed slightly oversalted. The portions are pretty sizable (and they better be for the money you're paying), but the quality of food was somewhat lacking for the price. Service was pretty good. They were attentive and I never felt like I was being ignored.
