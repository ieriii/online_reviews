I've been wanting to try this place for sometime, but like most people around here, with all the other options, I just hadn't gotten around to it. First, let me just start out by saying that the ambiance is incredible - vibrant and loud, yet still classy - even on a Sunday night the place seemed to resonate with people enjoying themselves. We got a drink at the swanky little bar - my fiance had a mojita and I had a glass of sangria - they were both wonderful and the bartender was extremely friendly. We were meeting my fiance's mother and some family friends - all with a different exposure to creative cooking. Our server was colorful and professional and guided us to items which we all ended up loving. I recommend doing a ceviche sampler and ordering a side of the Mac and the Four Cheeses with whatever entree you choose. The desserts were equally excellent - I would try the cherry bread pudding - it's amazing. We look forward to going back on a weekend night, just the two of us, to stay a little later and enjoy the flavor of carnivale.
