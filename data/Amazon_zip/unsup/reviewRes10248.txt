I've driven by this place many times but came here for the first time last week. GORGEOUS patio but unfortunately, we had reservations for a night with rain. I must come back to sit out there soon. Food was hit or miss. We started with the beet salad and the mixed grill seafood platter. Beet salad with riccotta was amazing (yay!) but some of the seafood could be better quality (octopus not very tender, calamari was ok; nay). Asked the waiter for some wine recommendations. We got a bottle of rose and a white and they were perfect and very affordable - in the $30 range - that we proceeded to continue buying more bottles of the same throughout the night (yay!). My entree was the lamb meatball with eggplant and pappardelle noodles which was fabulous (yay!). I tried my table mates' dishes - short ribs (yay!), seafood stew (avg), fettuccine with shrimp (avg), and the soft shell crab entree (the special of the day; yay!). For dessert, we got the flan (too eggy for my taste with an interesting sauce that I didn't care for; nay), the puff pastry with custard dish (yay!) and the chocolate hazelnut cake (yay!) All in all, I was very happy with dinner and would definitely come back again!
