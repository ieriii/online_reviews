Best place ever to get a dog! I went with three friends and we ordered about 8-10 sausages. They were all great. I liked some better than the other, like the linguia with saffron and manchego. We also, went for the duck and foie sausage because you have to! The corn dog melted in my mouth. I don't even like corn dogs- i think i am hooked for life, and only for $1.50. The line wasn't to bad- right to the edge of the door.  The line moves quickly, and its well worth it.
