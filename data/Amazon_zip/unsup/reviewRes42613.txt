There's a great deal of hype surrounding this place and I think its popularity exceeds the product. My experience was with delivery only. I ordered a stuffed pepperoni. The pizza came hot, within about an hour, so no complaints there. I just felt the actual pizza wasn't quite deserving of all the praise I've seen for it.. In my opinion the seasoning could be a bit stronger, and a bit more tang (if that makes sense) Don't get me wrong, it's a perfectly good pizza. Is it the best pizza in the city? No.
