if u love lively beautiful social european cafes whether you're out on a friday night or just wanting to sit with a friend and enjoy delicious appetizers and coffee, GO TO ARTOPOLIS.it's very nice and makes me feel like im in greece. I always get ice frappe and nescafe. going out on a weekend is nice, the windows are open and you hear the lively music for 9muses from across the street. everything about this cafe is amazing. the view, the people, the food, the coffee, and the interior, HIGHLY RECOMMEND
