How do you like them apples? Well for those who like an extensive beer list and some solid burger choices, come here. Add in a great waitress and the fact that you can carry on a conversation because you are not on top of other people is just gravy (and I think there was a burger that had gravy speaking of). Really, was I the first to use the apples line? I'm too lazy to scroll through the others...I'll just pretend that's the case. But really, good place.
