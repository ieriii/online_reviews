Alliance lounge is great. Saves me a 2.5 hour commute to the office on the days I need to upload large files. The people who work there are friendly. You can come and go as you please. I also like how they don't make you feel bad for being there for a long time. Think their food is okay. Have only tried their chocolate croissant. Tasted very good. Chocolate was rich but not too sweet, how I like it. Croissant flaky and buttery. Size could be larger. Turkey sandwich - bread is hard. The healthiest option they have for lunch. The only gripe i have is that sometimes i cannot sign onto their network. I've heard other customers complain at the cafe as well. I was still able to find a different network to sign onto, but it didn't have the same upload speed that i needed.
