I don't usually do fondue, but here it was fondue well done. :) This definitely rates above a 4. I'm always hesitant to give out 5's though. Came here last night with my sister for our usual date night and was pleasantly surprised by the wonderful service, very nice atmosphere (we had reservations and they gave us a comfortable booth), and the abundance of food. We did the premier dinners, the vegetable dinner and the beef tenderloin & scallops dinner which came with a cheese appetizer course and a dessert course. More expensive, but worth it. Also comes with coffee too. I enjoyed my experience and i would come back. Just to note, if you do a full course selection, dinner will take longer. We sat down at 8:20PM and finished around 10pm. Valet costs $10.
