Falafals are flavorful and not heavily fried making a sandwich with these or appetizer dish certainly worth Chicken schwarama is excellent with the lamb next on my to try.  Only problem is that they don't have spicier dishes available for those who's tastebuds are in a perpetual state of capsaicin shock Overall...you will not be disappointed by this place. Yes, it does live up to the high star rating on yelp. Actually a 4.5 for me, so about as good as it gets.
