I have eaten three times at this place. First time, I was up for a Beef soup which it is really a Soup for two! It is a meal itself. Second time, it was packed inside so we decided to take some food home which was good stir fried meat and curry chicken. But the third time is what got me to white this review, because we had a shrimp roll which was healthy and refreshing for an appetizer. Then, we had sea food skillet which was abundant, perfectly cooked and very light fish tasting. This place has 250+ plates on the Menu, so if you are not familiar with the food... take a Menu home and study it for next time!
