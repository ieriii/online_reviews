Before I get crucified for the low rating, let me start with saying that I'm writing based on my experience as one of the many people with food allergies in this city.  In Short... DO NOT EAT HERE IF YOU HAVE ANY FOOD ALLERGIES! Food is PRE-MADE and there are no substitutions or changes to what's on the menu.  In Detail... I've been wanting to go here for a long time and finally made it over there this Saturday with my sister. I am allergic to both wheat and milk, so before waiting in the 40 minute line I checked the menu posted in the window to see if there's anything I could order... Huevos Rancheros, perfect!  When we got up to the register, they informed us that everything was pre-made and only heated up, so there are no special requests (ie. no cheese or milk). It turns out the only thing I could have on the menu was a plate of Spinach with two quarter-sized dollops of goat cheese and 3 dried figs... yeah, that's exactly what my hungover stomach was wanting... NOT!!! (Forgive me for the early 90s reference, it's Monday and I'm still pissed.) On one hand, the yummy looking casserole style Huevos Rancheros looked divine... but on the other, knowing it's PRE-MADE and not fresh makes it very disappointingly average. Three words of advise to Milk & Honey... 1) Make a note on your menu that there are no changes allowed. 2) At least keep a couple eggs on stock so that someone with food allergies doesn't have to eat spinach for breakfast. 3) Your Intelligensia blend is fabulous, so please don't ever get rid of it! (That's why you at least got the 1 star.)
