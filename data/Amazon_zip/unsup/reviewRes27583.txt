We went for my girlfriends birthday and we couldn't be happier. The Service was fantastic, the cocktails were innovative and delicious, and the food... oh the food. We started off with oyster flight and the potato soup. The oysters were fresh and topped with fancy things like champagne foam, and the potato soup was wonderful. She had the skate wing and I had the swordfish. Normally I'm wary of things like swordfish because the tend to be overpriced and not enough food. That was not the case here. It was just enough food and the price fully fit the quality. For dessert I recommend the deconstructed snickers bar.   All and all I highly recommend Graham Elliot. Whether you're dressed up of dressed down you'll fit right in with the beautiful presentations, the excellent service and the phenomenal food.
