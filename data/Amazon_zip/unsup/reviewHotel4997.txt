If you're looking for a good price, decent location and terrible customer service, the essex is the place for you. Room was decent and clean. Everyone who worked there went out of that extra mile to be as rude as possible. The shuttle they advertise wasn't running almost the entire time we were there and they were absolutely unapologetic about it. Also there was a #$%^&%^& jackhammer running directly over our heads at ten in the morning which would have been nice to know about before we made our reservations. But, if it's the best deal in town for the location I would think of staying there again.
