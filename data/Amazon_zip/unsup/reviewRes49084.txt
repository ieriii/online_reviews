I know I'm supposed to love this place, but I really couldn't get into the food at all. I've been hearing so much about it and everything was just ok at best. The pig ear salad didn't taste like much, the squid tasted like char and nothing else, and the pork rinds that everyone raves about were just....pork rinds. I had a real problem with the sweetbreads-- I've had them maybe 4 or 5 times before at other restaurants, and every other time they were small fried nuggets with a crispy outside. The Publican's sweetbreads were a fist-sized hunk with no texture, not at all crispy, just soft and jiggly. Very unappetizing, especially when I apparently cut into a vein and blood came out onto the plate. No thanks. I ordered a creamy limoncello for dessert and they served it to me almost room temperature in a 1/4 filled juice glass... it was all fairly disappointing to be honest. And our server's snotty attitude didn't help. Also, what is up with communal dining? I don't care if it's trendy- I don't want to sit elbow to elbow with strangers. We won't be back, and it's a shame because I've been looking forward to trying this place for a long time.
