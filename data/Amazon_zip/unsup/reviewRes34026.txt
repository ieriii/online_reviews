Yum yum yum. This review is for both Sultan's locations, and both are equally delicious. Please try the lamb shawerma sandwich (it's a filled pita), but be prepared with lots of napkins, as the sauce willlll drip a lot. I also typically get a falafel ball or two to eat on their own with tahini. That said, I haven't tasted anything on the menu that wasn't really fresh yet filling. Side note: the Wicker Park location is much more crowded than the Lincoln Park one, but the boys are much friendlier... so it's a draw.
