The owner is a rude crab that has no customer service skills and yells at his customers. I presented a debit card for payment and he verbally harassed me. I will never return. Most businesses that like to get repeat customers charge much lower prices than his over-priced hot dogs. Businesses that respect their customers have a sign at the entrance to the effect of 'cash only, please' not Doug, he's too arraogant for polite customer interaction.
