Calo is the most romantic restaurant in Andersonville. It has a beautiful bar area and great drinks. It can get crowded on weekends and isn't open late but they have a wide selection of reasonably priced classic Italian dishes and delicious desserts. In summer the front bay windows are open and in winter the booths are very cozy.
