Despite a losing effort from the United States vs Ghana in the World Cup, I hoped to up my spirits by taking in an evening of wonderful Italian food.  The GF and I, on a whim, called Piccolo Sogno without a reservation at 8pm on a Saturday night... and to our surprise, they said they could get us on the famed back patio for 9pm. GLORIOUS!  The meal was great - the people watching was great - the light Chianti was great - the whole atmosphere was great. From the apps to the salads to the entrees, everything was wonderful. You can't go wrong with a salad of arugula, peaches, goat cheese and olive oil. Simply perfect.  I did feel that my duck was a bit over cooked, but that was probably my fault for not specifying that I like duck rare. The flavors were spot on, though.
