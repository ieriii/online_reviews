this place makes a drinker out of a "non-drinker" like me. good music, great / creative drinks, pleasant bar tenders, nice ambiance...it does not feel pub-ish/joint-ish...it feels like a nice bar in a good neighborhood in tokyo. i have been there a few times, and each time i talked to the person next to me, i enjoyed meeting them too. they have some munchies...i can not say i enjoy them but why not...good to bite on, and fun. i think chef paul kahan, eduard, and other partners are doing a lot of good for chicago through their establishments.
