KOREAN...MEXICAN....BURRITO!!!! I have never seen one Korean person serving or cooking anything. I know there's one hiding somewhere. How else would the meat taste so amazing? Sometimes I have dreams where I'm swimming in a vat of the sauce that they spread on those chicken wings. I have actually seen and heard friends make foodgasm noises that would rival anything you could hear from the thin walls of a seedy motel. Highly recommended.
