I just adored this place. Everything from the amazing photographs, the cute bar, the waitstaff, the food, the drinks, the price... I couldn't get enough. And come on - pickles that don't taste like pickles anymore but still have that awesome crunch?! The meat was fantastic. I got pulled pork shoulder (which was just as good leftover the next day) and a bite of my date's kobe. Melt in your mouth goodness there and I love being able to sauce it up the way I want it since the 3 options all come on the side. Mac and cheese was great, although I will say the cornbread was just meh. But Chicago q, I will come eat your pickles and chips any day of the week. You rock.
