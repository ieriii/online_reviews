great food, went there tonight with my friend. He insisted on coming to this place to eat Alergian/ Moroccan crepes..I ordered the Chicago Crepe, and he ordered the icosium crepe ( his with lamb)..both good..But to be honest, the soup, the vegetable soup was to me the highlight of the meal..sooo yummy and I dont usually like soup...its was like a mouth orgasm..not kidding..so much so, that my friend ordered another serving....Anyway, the ambiance is ok, the service was friendly, but the soup..yummy..
