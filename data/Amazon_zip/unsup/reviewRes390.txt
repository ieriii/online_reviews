A wonderful dining experience that really plays with all your senses and throws you for a loop occasionally as soon as you find the building and enter the door (you have to been there to understand). I enjoyed every one of our 23 courses, the presentation of each is a highlight as is the taste. Meet Grant Achatz "plating" our desert at the table was a nice surprise, but after 22 courses, this one is too overpowering. Great concept, probably most memorable dish from a visual impression, but just too much at the end. With having said all that, a definite must for anyone who likes avantgarde cooking and couldn't make it to El Bulli while it was still open ;-) Anthony Bourdain's review of Alinea in his book Medium Raw is great, a bit tough, but closes out fairly.
