It's kind of nuts to me that L&E's average rating is 4 stars, when everyone I know (and everyone everyone I know knows) absolutely loves this place. It's hands-down my favorite place for brunch in the neighborhood, even though coming in close to the end pretty much guarantees they will already be out of almost everything. Who cares -- it's forced me to try spectacular entrees that I normally would have overlooked. I'm thinking specifically of the crabcake eggs benedict. Holy sh*t, it's like a nonstop barrage of heaven in your mouth. And oh my god the butternut squash soup. I dare you to find one single squash-soup fanatic who would not love to drink gallons of the stuff. Loves it!
