I'll start by saying that the food at L&E is legit. They have one of the best burgers I've ever had, and an incredible whiskey menu. That being said I have a serious issue with how they run their business. I have a 16 month old child and I don't go out to eat very much anymore but ate at L&E a few months ago while out with a friend for his birthday. Since that night I have been telling my wife about the burger at L&E. Today I stopped in around 4:15 PM to order a couple of burgers to take home. The hostess told me that the kitchen didn't open until 5 PM and I should be able to order my food then, I took a menu and came back at 5. When we returned we were told that they were too busy to make an order for take out at that time. I don't have a problem with them not offering take out (even if it is silly to deny business to people who can't or won't eat in), I have a problem with them making the rules up as they go. I was there 5 minutes after the kitchen opened and they were too busy to make a couple of burgers? Really? So we took our money to Dunlay's on the Square located a block away who offer a killer turkey burger, and it was delicious. Maybe I'll go back to L&E in 6 or 7 years when the kids are grown up and I can actually sit down and enjoy a meal uninterrupted. The hipster pretentiousness is obnoxious.
