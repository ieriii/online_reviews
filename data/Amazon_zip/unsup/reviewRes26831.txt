While lots of my peeps come to this hotspot for deep dish, I actually crave the thin crust pizza. (Sorry! Lou M's has my heart forever for deep dish). Pequod's thin crust isn't actually NY style thin crust - it's a medium thickness between NY style and deepdish and they pack in the toppings beneath gooey cheese set on a comforting crispy warm carmelized crust. It's a crust you actually want to eat, not leave on your plate! No recommendations on toppings - just pile on whatever you like! I've had pineapple/ham, sausage/mushroom, spinach/mushroom, i mean it doesn't MATTER what you put on your pizza here! it's just AWESOME! Thank goodness they expanded this place to 2 floors! The wait was getting unbearable. This past time I sat upstairs - great sports bar setting! Go for the craft brews!
