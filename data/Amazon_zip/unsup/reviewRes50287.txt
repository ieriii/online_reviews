After running the Nike Human Race on Sunday, I was in the mood for a "chill" bar. I met up with some friends here and we really had a fun time. It was our waitress's first night so we could have been in for a disaster. However, the Corona's kept flowing and she did a really great job. The place was a lot of fun and the people watching never got old (but in a good, non-Barleycorn kind of way). I have yet to try to food but I am looking forward to it next time.
