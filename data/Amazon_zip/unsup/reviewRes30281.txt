This is a great place for dessert Veggies! I am in love with the vegan carrot cake, and 'yes' it comes complete with the white cream-cheese like frosting. All Vegan! Yummy! You can get slices of cake to go, or sit at the counter and enjoy a strong cup of Joe with your tasty morsel. I have to admit that I haven't eaten anything but the cake from the menu for years, but after reading the other reviews, I know that I need to go back.
