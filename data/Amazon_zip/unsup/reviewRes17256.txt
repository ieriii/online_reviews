I chose this restaurant to take my Wife for her birthday based of the reviews and pictures. When we arrived the ambiance was great exactly what I had invisioned. At the bar we ordered Mojito's they were very good. After that everything went downhill the food was not good at all ,we started of with the ceviche it was ok then we ordered the steak it was. Horrible no taste at all rice tasted like it came out of a box.
