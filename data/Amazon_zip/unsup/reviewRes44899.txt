Don't waste your time.  I knew better--going to a touristy restaurant in any city is almost always a huge disappointment. But, a friend insisted it was good food and so we went. We waited over 40 minutes to be seated. First, we waited in line to put our names on the waiting list, and then were provided with a menu to come back and place our order so it was ready when we knew what we wanted. So, we went to order and they made us wait in line again to place that, despite telling us to come back up to the counter.  We were finally seated and brought to a TINY table in the bar that could barely fit 2 drinks, let alone any food. The seats were uncomfortable and people walked by us and bumped us constantly. At one point, a server dropped some spinach on the floor, a manager almost fell on his ass after stepping on it, and nobody even cleaned it up after that. In addition, there was someone's old hamburger in a corner of the bar that sat there for the duration of our meal. One server on break even sat down next to it and ate, but never cleaned it up. I got the caesar salad, which was edible, but the dressing was watery and they sure piled it on. I also had a stuffed pizza with spinach and mozzarella. It was disgusting. It literally tasted like cardboard. Gross. And, of course, after one huge serving, I was full and there was all this food left that I felt badly discarding, but sure didn't want to eat.  Shortly after we were served, they announced that they had run out of dough, which is just ridiculous given that they are a well-established restaurant and should know how much dough they need for a weekend night. They turned away everyone who arrived after that point--unprofessional. The worst part was that, in the end, I paid $30 for one crap piece of pizza and a watery salad.
