They make well above average omelets and the potato pancakes are a relatively unique and good thing. They have a really fresh taste and great quality which rounds out the brunch dishes better than your typical place that serves hash browns. One thing is it's kind of expensive. An omelet with 3 fillings--and who could have any less--will run you pretty high. Another thing is it can be hard to sit down, and the outdoor seating can get fairly hot.
