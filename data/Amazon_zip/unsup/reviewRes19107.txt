Heard a lot of great things about this site. Burger wasn't terrible, but for the price I felt cheated. Most burgers on the menu went for somewhere around nine dollars. Nine Dollars for a burger from a bar? How do you @#$**#@! justify that!?!  Yes food is not bad, but there is no way I'd return to pay for a burger at this price.
