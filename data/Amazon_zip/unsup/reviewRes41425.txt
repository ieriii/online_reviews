Aside from being the worst, and most expensive, date I have ever been on, Bonsoiree was one of the best dining experiences I have had... which I guess isn't saying too much because I am a big supporter of places that are under 20 bucks a person. However, once upon a time Groupon had a coupon to this place and I thought I would give it a shot. I think people have given enough descriptions to prove that this chef is very talented so instead of going into detail I just wanted to support what other lovers of this place have said. If I had the money, I would come here for every major menu change... but for now I will continue to dream about that soup that was touched by the divine.
