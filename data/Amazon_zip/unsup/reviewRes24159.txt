Incredible food, amazing milkshakes (try the soy- much more rich), very home-y atmosphere overall. I've had the chicken tacos, chicken sandwiches, vegetarian selections, plantains (so fresh), and the guacamole is amazing. The staff is quick, very friendly, and helpful.  Affordable dining experience at a longstanding Bucktown staple. Get take out if you'd like- it's quick, but make sure to remember that they don't take credit. They do have an ATM in the restaurant though.
