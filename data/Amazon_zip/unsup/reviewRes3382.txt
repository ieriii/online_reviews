The picnic bench like tables make for a cozy atmosphere and encourages random talks with strangers.  Hopefully this stranger is one of the owners who overhears you telling your friend that he cannot consume both a bibimbap and 5 of Crisp's mutant wings.  He tells us to wait, and comes back 5 minutes later with a hefty basket of mutant wings. Talk about a nice guy! The task was completed: 1 big bowl of bibimbap and 5 wings gone. Never underestimate the power of hunger. Jerry Z., I will never bet against you when it comes to food. People claim that it's not authentic Korean; they don't claim to be, so stop accusing. Things I learned from speaking with one of the owners: -the chicken's fresh, not frozen -they're looking to open more locations -they're working on the liquor license and lengthening hours -the wings don't travel well. If you want crisp wings, eat in Go and get your Crisp on.
