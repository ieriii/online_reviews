Fox and Obel leaves much to be desired. The selection is kind of strange. They have a wide variety of something but not others. The layout of the store is quite confusing and I'll admit to getting turned around once or twice. In the area, it is a step up from Walgreen's. However, if you're looking to buy some actual groceries, there are many other places that a better selection and better prices (including the Dominick's right down the street).
