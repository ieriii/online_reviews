A friend and I stopped here for lunch. I wasn't too hungry and feeling under the weather, so I opted for their mushroom soup. It was a pureed soup so it was thick and creamy. I also got one of their teas. I noticed some more stuff as we were leaving and saw they have interesting italian sodas. I love italian sodas, but I didn't really like the one I got. It was something with ginger in it, and it was not real ginger that they used. That was disappointing. The girl at the counter taking orders was not very friendly as well. It's a cute place and I would give it another try.
