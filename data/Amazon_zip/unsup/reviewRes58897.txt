My sister had an event for work at Sunda last night. I have never heard her so upset so I was compelled to write about how horrible it was. Tenia was the name of the girl she worked with and she was so rude and unaccommodating. Neither my sister or I would ever come back here based on the service she was given during her event as my sister who does events often said you can find better sushi and better customer service at Shaw's, Japonais, Hub 51 or Union Sushi. Take your money someplace else Sunda doesn't appreciate it.
