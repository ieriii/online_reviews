UPDATE 2/19/08: So I think I've come here enough times to finally give this restaurant the 5 star that it deserves! I've had a chance to try so many Latin American restaurants in the city, and I find myself comparing them all to Carnivale. I cannot rave enough about their guacamole and their chips. Its something so simple, but you'll be surprised HOW GOOD it can be when done right. I've managed to try a lot of their dishes and I have got to say their ceviche is still the best, and their beef dishes are out of this world. I would suggest ordering any of their steak/ribeye dishes or even their braise short ribs. I had my birthday dinner here with 20 other guests and they all loved it. My mom was impressed with their service, which says a lot because she likes to complain. I've had many wonderful meals here and will continue to do so!! I had dinner at Topolobampo this past weekend and seriously..DISAPPOINTING. Come here instead. You'll pay less...WAY less and have much better food. Even Frontera can not compare. **************************************** I really really love the decor of this restaurant. I think I stared more at the restaurant's decor than my boyfriend. Haha... but seriously, super high ceilings, fun and festive decor, great place for group dinners, and they even have private rooms. While we were waiting for our table (which, was my fault, since i had made reservations and somehow thought it was one hour later than it was, stupid me) they had live jazz playing with a live singer. We were even able to order appetizers at the bar, which was also another plus cuz we hadn't eaten all day. We ordered the guac and ceviche, which were both soo good. Highly suggest getting their ceviche, i hear its their specialty, and now i know why. Its better than the ceviche i've had in Central America! I know, you are like "what? get out!" but its true. I ordered the seared ahi tuna and the bf ordered the bistek steak. He absolutely loved his, that he licked his plate, but in a really sophisticated manner. Ok so he didn't lick it, but he did clean off his plate. My entree on the other hand, was disappointing (the reason for the 4 stars). The ahi tuna was flavorless. It was accompanied with guacamole and tomatoes on the side. The tuna wasn't that fresh, and I had to rely heavily on the tomatoes (which was tossed in a salad kind of way) for flavor. We had the chocolate cake for dessert, which was fabulous, served with a side of strawberry ice cream, drizzled with strawberry syrup. I would come here again (rare for me to say!) because I need to try their other dishes so i can give it a complete 5 stars (or maybe I just want to stare more at their decor, not sure). Valet is only $5 but I think street parking is available if you try hard enough. People really get dressed up to come here, so don't ever feel like you are overdressed...just under-dressed.
