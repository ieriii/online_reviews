The menu here is so inventive. A real culinary adventure. I would recommend the Shaved Brussel Sprouts with Pecorino & Parmigiano as a nice refreshing and light dish to go with all the yummy pork-laden dishes that you'll want gorge on. I'll admit that i didn't pig-out but fortunately, if you're not a huge bacon-eater, you can still find lots of swine-free dishes that won't leave you disappointed. I can recommend the Mortadella, Balsamico & Pistachio smear, which was heavenly, and the fried Prosciutto Bread Balls. Yummy and not greasy. I was also pleasantly surprised at how delicious the Farro with Roasted Rutebega & Feta was. Who knew?
