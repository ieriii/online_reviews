HUGE disappointment. We had a late Saturday night dinner at Mercat. Parking was hard to find and we missed the little red door couple of times.  We were allowed to go ahead and sit although two of our party had not arrived. The lounge area was small and we wondered how big the restaurant will be. Walking upstairs into the restaurant we were surprised at how large it was. High ceilings, cute interior decorations.. our hopes were high. Then our waiter arrives. He mumbled all night and the food runners were more helpful in describing our food. (they also seemed more than happy to explain what our dishes were. Do people not talk to them??) The food: Octopus Fritters: We wanted the other octopus dish but they were out of it. The server instead recommended the special of the night, the octopus fritters. Wanting some more info, we asked what it was.  His reply. "Fritters." Nonetheless, it was good. Flash fried peppers = HORRIBLE. Limp peppers in what seems like Japanese Mayo. We all picked at one pepper each and the rest remained untouched.  (seafood) Paella Negra: Black SUPER buttery rice with tomato slices and less than 5 seafood sprinkled on top. And the portions are tiny. I've never eaten paella the size of creme brulee before. No one fought for the remains after couple spoonful. Brussels Sprouts: Good Cauliflower- Excellent. A bit creamy but it was really good.  Scallop over short-rbis: Scallops were ok, the short-ribs were disgustingly salty. I took a bite of it and literally gagged. Slow-cooked Pork Belly: Very very good. Beef short-rib flatbread: ok. The pitcher of red wine sangria we ordered tasted like watered down cranberry juice. All in all, it was a huge disappointment and a waste of money.  Back to Cafe Iberico I go. Oh and being harrassed by a toothless homeless man all the way back to my car was the cherry on top of my evening.
