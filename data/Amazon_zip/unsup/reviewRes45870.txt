Standing for a 50 minute wait, I was just waiting on bad food or service so I could call the manager, but thank goodness, no need for that. Visiting from STL, had to see what they hype was about. The place is very close to Cheesecake Factory, but it does stand alone. I enjoyed the Pot Roast entree w/loaded baked potato and a carrot/broccoli medley. Pot Roast was tender and everything was seasoned perfectly. I had the horseradish sauce on the side and used is sparingly to as not to drown out the flavor of the meat. Perfect! My BF had the BBQ Cedar Salmon, very nice. Perfectly cooked and very flavorful. The Mango Passionfruit Mojito was excellent and we had the Peach Cobbler to go (loved it as the late night snack). Be prepared for a long wait if you decide to try it, you won't be disappointed.
