A fine dining experience with a theatrical flare equipped with entertaining and informative staff. The food will have you trying to secure another reservation to experience it all again!   I agree with another reviewer - you get back what you give out in terms of personality. The staff are very professional! I can go back just to laugh with them again.  The food is ridiculously amazing without getting technical; captivating and taste absolutely divine!
