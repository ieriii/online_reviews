The food was ok. Nothing amazing to me. This place is crowded and doesn't have much elbow room. The reason I have 2 stars though is because of the service. I couldn't believe how long we had to wait for a menu, the food, the water, and the 4 pieces of toasts we requested (for the bone marrow spread)!!! We were notified over and over it would only take a minute. I took 15 minutes! Then it took forever for the server to let us know if we could eat our cupcakes at the table... We almost ate it there because it took so long but thank goodness we didn't because we would have been charged $2 a cupcake. The worst is when it took them forever to get us the bill. The wait time is ridiculous and we were only a party of 2. I can't believe I was still in a good enough mood to tip her well over 20%.
