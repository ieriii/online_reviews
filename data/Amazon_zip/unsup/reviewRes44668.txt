So everyone told me this is the first place you gotta hit up when you get into town. When we arrived the wait was 45 minutes for a group of 2 and then the pizza would take an additional 35 minutes to make. We were pressed for time as we had show tickets on the other side of time so we opted to order it to go at the counter in the back. We ordered a small special stuffed crust. It was plenty to share between 2 people. The 35 minutes was legit and the pie was ready for us when we stepped back inside. It cost 15 for the pizza. The pizza was good, def nice to try a real chicago deep dish. I wasn't totally blown away though.
