Went there on a recommendation from a local in town and thought, "I'll get there nice and early so I don't have to wait." We arrived at 5:30 pm. There's a line around the block. Then I find out that this chef went up against Bobby Flay in Iron Chef and won, so every tourist just has to try the food that bested Bobby. Bobby Flay ain't all that. Go read my review of Mesa Grill in Vegas. The wait scared us off and we went back for brunch. I was warned that brunch was only a shadow of the greatness that's available for dinner, but I'm impatient, so perhaps this place is five stars if I did go for dinner. I had the Tacos al Carbon and you know, I was told to compare this place to the food I've had in Mexico and sure enough, I'd say this is the closest I've had to authentic Mexican cuisine without being in Mexico. However, in Mexico, I pay $2 for a plate of tacos. Here, it's $15. My wife had the huevos and it was good, but slightly unseasoned and bland. No one else jumped up and did cartwheels. The meal was really good, but I'm not certain it scores at the top of my list. It definitely beats Mesa Grill hands down, but then again, I think Taco Bell beats Mesa Grill, so that's not saying much. P.S. This review was not tainted at all by the fact that Rick Bayless made some disparaging remarks about Yelpers. He wasn't calling out Yelpers as a whole, but those that are jerks about it saying they're going to write about the place to the waiter. To the Yelpers that do that: Don't spoil it for the rest of us.
