Food was 5 stars. The amount of time I had to wait for the waiter to come around everytime was just plain ridiculous. It was not a one time occurrence, it happened at least 3-5 tiems each of 3 visits. After talking about the restaurant with a few other Indian friends, they all experienced the same crappy service. It was not till later that we all had realized that this restaurant is ironically racist against Indians. (I am Indian) The placement of seatings for Indians as always for from the high traffic areas. The way the servers even speak is with a rude arrogance... We once had 3 different people take our order... 2 servers and then a manager who was walking by when we had to stop him. After that, the servers' rude arrogant attitude only increased to an unbearable amount. That is why this place with decent and ridiculously overpriced food gets only one star. I will NEVER step inside that place again.
