LOVE LOVE LOVE Can't get enough. Thank god we live just around the corner. Some people may say this place is not a good value, but the food is oh so fresh and the portions are HUGE so it's totally worth it. I brought a friend there a few weeks back who lives out in the burbs, she still is raving about their fabulous baby red potatoes. Great selection to suit any taste. Their hot chocolate is to die for as well. Like the marmalade they serve with their toast? No problem, you can take a jar home for $5.95! I just took some of their blackberry marmalade home today. Get there early on the weekends because they get busy fast and have nearly no waiting space.
