We decided to give Anteprima a second chance after a very shaky first visit. Our first server was beyond pretentious and was dismayed when we shared an entree....little did we know that it was an "in" place and made it into Chicago Magazine....so, we drove up to Andersonville once again and decided that wherever we found parking, that's where we will dine...well, lucky us that our second visit was wonderful and our server was fun, personable, efficient and let us linger.  This is true Italian food and is what you might find in the heart of Tuscany. Super fresh ingredients, a yummy bread basket and not your run of the mill Italian menu options at all. The portions are appropriate to European standards which is fine because the quality is there. We are happy that we returned and would definitely recommend.
