We stayed here for two days and it was alright. We had to upgrade to the club level because they were not going to give us a room with a king sized bed. Even though we called ahead of time to re-confirm they said they just had a handicap room or double beds. We've been stuck in both before and now we know better. We upgraded to club level, and while I enjoyed the extra breakfast and cocktail hour snacks, it's didn't quite make up for the extra $75 price increase.  Also, shockingly, when I woke up after my first night in the Sheraton bed I found my legs covered with an unsightly poison-oak-like rash. VERY MYSTERIOUS! I had been on a plane all day the day before, not frolicking in the woods, so I can't say where I picked up this uncomfortable affliction. Do they use weird laundry prodcuts? Allow pets in the rooms? I don't know, but it has made my legs red and bumpy and not too attractive in my skirts and dresses. Boo. That and the bathroom in the room is sketchy. The light hums LOUDLY and the shower has no water pressure. The sink taps are strangely designed and difficult to turn on and off. Bad design in there. Otherwise it was an ok hotel. Close to Navy Pier and the art museum.
