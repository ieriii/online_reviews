So. Guys. Hi Guys. You have to go to this place for it's lunch buffet. $15 for all the indian food you can stuff in your face. I promise you, you won't be disappointed. Samosas, currys, paneers, oh my! They even have desserts. The little donut holes in sweet sauce...rice pudding...and a type of "ice cream", I would describe it to taste like an Orange Flinstones Push Pop. Remember those? How can you go wrong with those? Go. NOW. The only downfall of this place is that you may fall into a food coma after lunch from stuffing your face.
