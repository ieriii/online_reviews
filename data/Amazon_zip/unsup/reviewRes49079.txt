This place is not for everyone and the other reviews reflect it. It's large Bavarian style communal seating which would put a lot of people off right away. The place is loud too. There is no bar and you even share communal bar tables. The prices are a bit high as well and it's not hard to get a shock when the tab comes...so why I am I fan? For the right occasion and the right group, this place is a really good time. The beer list is crazy awesome and a lot of the food is great. Is a bit hit or miss like others have noted. I grew up in N.C. and as a kid we would drive out to tobacco field country where you could buy fresh fried pork skins on the side of the road and Publican's have 'em beat. No one else at my table like pork rines and I couldn't convince them to try them so I ordered two rounds. their oysters were some of the best as well. It's different enough and it's a good addition to the great restaurants in Chicago. The staff is great and it just has a good vibe overall
