From the moment I sat down to the moment I left everything was so wonderful. The Publican came highly recommended by a trusted yelper friend and it did not disappoint! This is one of the best restaurants I have ever been to - the flavors were wonderful, unexpected and really unique. The Publican has the most friendly staff, which is surpassed only by the quality and craft of their food. Perfectly prepared and beautifully presented, the Publican gets it right- every single time. Started out with the spicey pork rinds....what a piggy delight thank God I am not Islamic if I was the publican could convert me with this special seaoned mixed basket of pork in your mouth orgasmic rinds. it was crowded, yes it was indeed and our food came out a little slower then expected (not complaining) because the atmoshpere was wonderful and wine and beer exceeded our expectations our server sent out some complinetery house pickles and Fries... Ok the fries, This was the best deep fried potato strip I have ever consumed. I was suprisingly shocked that a common french fry could make my palate pop. Deep fried in Lard and vegtable oil. This is food science. this is deep fried love. The Publican ruined any other french fry tastings for me. then here comes the succulant pig..............Another job well done. The flavors matched perfectly this is defiently something I will be craving and thinking about for a long time. booking my flight now to go back for some passioniate pig.
