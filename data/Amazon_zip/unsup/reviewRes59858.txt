I am an avid foodie and can say I have eaten at most of the cities steak houses and have yet to find a place that has it all, like Kinzie. From the minute you walk in the door until the minute you leave, you feel like you have hit all the reasons one goes out to eat. Service is exceptional, there is not a moment that you feel over attended nor unattended. The food is prepared exactly the way you like, whether it is the temperature of the steaks or asking for little to no oil in cooking your fish. The risotto is as good as you get in Italy. As for the desserts, they are to die for, especially the buttered rum cheesecake and the flour less chocolate cake. Definitely a place you want to go to time and again!
