Cool place! We went late morning after our 5k for some fries and beer. Apprx arrival was around 10:30. We got a few plates of fries and a few beers each. Fries are $2 (assuming $1 during the weekday since that's what my friend told us). Beer was awesome! It's a brewing co. so they have a variety. They have pretty cool taps too. Beer ranges from $5-$10. Obviously the rarer the brew, the more pricier they are. I also tried the beermosa which is like a mimosa except BEER! Orange juice and a brew mixed together. It was pretty good! I'd come back for the dishes since they looked so good. This is a good place to chill w/ friends and grab some beers.
