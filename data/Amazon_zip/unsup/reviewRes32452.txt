This is the place for an excellent Ethiopian experience - make sure to set aside some time to enjoy. For two, sitting at the low, colorful tables is an intimate dining setting. You can order a combination meal that will come as generous portions laid out between you on a table sized piece of injera, an bread similar in texture to a thick crepe, and tangy in taste. Every dish is colorful, full of flavor, and just plain delicious. The best part is that the plate, which you are dying to lick, is edible. Just remember that sharing is caring. If you are in a hurry, you might try another place, as the place is often understaffed by western standards. Nevertheless, the staff are kind, generous to newcomers, and consistent. The buffet might be a good option for groups, but I prefer to order individual combination of Ethiopian goodness. The decor is more natural than fancy, and you will often see Ethiopian families and cab drivers here. The only surprise when you get the check is the value.
