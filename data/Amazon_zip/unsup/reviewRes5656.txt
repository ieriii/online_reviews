I love this place and left feeling giddy, it was so good. The most delicious food, awesome service, and super-chill atmosphere. My friend and I ate milk-braised pork, brussel sprouts with Peccorino, fried Risotto balls with goat cheese, fried sardines with lemon and fennel, a cheese plate, and, the best food I've ever tasted, roasted bone marrow with herbs. Not only does everything taste amazing, but the service is spectacular. Eat here if you love food and you appreciate a fun, easy dining experience. Also, it was SUPER affordable, considering the level of gourmet we ate and the attention we got.
