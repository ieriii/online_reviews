Food is great--seats very uncomfortable--wooden chairs.Bartenders not friendly and the blonde was a witch with a B. Restaurant is filled with 20-something hipsters. Very loud. The drinks were average. Beautiful location room overloking Michigan Ave. and Grant Park. Service abysmal. If they can fix that, they'll do ok.
