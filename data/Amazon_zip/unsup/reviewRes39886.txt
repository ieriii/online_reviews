I'm giving San Soo Gab San 3 stars, which I think is generous, but I'm also comparing it to the Korean BBQ I'm used to in Korea Town LA. This may be good Korean BBQ for Chicago. The good: The dumpling appetizers were good, but we kinda jumped the gun because there were about 15 bowls of different kimchi's, bean sprouts, noodles, etc. to start. The varieties of kimchi and other appetizer bowls were very good and a nice beginning to the meal. They took up the whole table. The grill was charcoal, which I have never experienced at a Korean BBQ before, so that was a huge plus. The miso soup was very good. We ordered the ribeye. Next time that's all I'm ordering. The bad: The marinated beef was sliced way too thin and slopped on the serving plate. No care to presentation. The pork belly was frozed, thin, and tasted like cardboard. I would go back, but I would take care not to order like I normally do when at Korean BBQ.
