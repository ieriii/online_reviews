Before moving to Chicago I spent 4 years in San Diego, and you could say that really set the bar all future sushi restaurants. It took over a year to find a joint that has really, really good quality sushi, but when we did it happened to be right in our new neighborhood. My fiance (who is a vegetarian) and I love Coast, not only for the quality of their food but for the BYOB aspect and it's proximity. It can be REALLY busy on Fri & Sat nights, so we tend to go during the week nights but in the end this is the best all-around sushi experience I've found in Chicago so far.
