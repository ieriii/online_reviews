We had heard good things, but we were nervous about a long wait. Great surprise. We were seated immediately. Great server, plenty of attention. It is noisy, but if you sit next to your friends instead of across it is OK. On to the food. The Pork Neck Bone Rillette with Mostarda was excellent. I would order it again and again, The chicken thigh kebabs with fried smashed potatoes & tzatziki was the best chicken we have EVER had. I am not a big chicken fan, but my wife is. DO NOT miss this. The octopus with acini di pepe & swiss chard was one of the best I have had, but the portion was so small, I was irritated and this one item cost them their 4th star. I don't think it was a mistake, in fact the server made a point of saying that the items in the "a la plancha" section were larger portions. Our serving was two small bites. Still, I would order again, We also had the endive and arugula with Covadonga bleu cheese & orange. Complete failure. Everything soft and wilted. No crunch and not very tasty. Deserts were strangely uninteresting so we didn't try anything. Prices for food reasonable, but wine a little pricy. We will definitely return.
