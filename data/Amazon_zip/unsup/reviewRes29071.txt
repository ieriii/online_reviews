Came here with six friends for dinner to start out a birthday get-together. The menu is huge. Two of my friends had never had Thai before, and they had a ton of options to try. The beef satay, egg rolls, crab rangoon, curry with sweet potatoes, and pad thai were all outstanding. The dining rooms are beautifully painted and decorated with Thai artwork for a really nice ambiance. The total bill for seven of us was less than $80. Great Thai food, really cheap. What else could anyone ask for? You could ask for BYOB with no corking fee. They have that here too-- we polished off a few bottles of wine and beer. Now you have no excuse not to try this place.
