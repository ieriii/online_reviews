I LOVE LOVE LOVE Bin 36! It's the perfect spot to take your friends for a night to chill, catch-up, and talk forever! I agree with others that this place isn't very "date-friendly", but that doesn't mean you can't have a nice relaxing date here. I just wouldn't come here for a first, second, or third date. Maybe after a year or so ;-). I'm not a big cheese fan, but my friends are, and I can tell you that every cheese flight purchased (nearly all of them) have been thoroughly enjoyed. Same goes for the wine flights. If you're on a budget, go on a Sunday where ALL wine flights are just $10, all day and night! The most expensive flight, bubbles, is $16, so its a pretty good deal. I personally enjoy white wine, and have had the bubbles, express yourself, well-traveled whites, and the chardonnay flights. But if you like reds, then I recommend the wines of spain. But don't think this place is only about wine and cheee! Their dinners here and delicious and the desserts are heavenly!  So if you're like me and my friends, you'll enjoy a cheese flight, a wine flight, dinner, dessert, and maybe a dessert wine, all of which can leave a pretty penny on your bill. I like to cheat use my wine flight to carry me through the meal. They are typically arranged such that the last wine in the flight is the sweetest, so I use the first glass for cheese, the middle two for dinner, and the last for dessert. But that still means I'll end-up paying around $50-$60. Bin 36 is a great place, but be prepared to spend, spend, spend!
