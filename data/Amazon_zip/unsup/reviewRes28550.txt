I can't say everything was perfect...but it was close enough that I'd probably eat here 7 days a week if I could. The Mezcal Margarita was wonderfully smoky and spicy...just right. A dining companion said the Blue Agave Margarita was better than anything she'd had in Mexico. For an appetizer, I had trouble choosing, so I ordered the ceviche trio. Tasting them wasn't much help, as they were all wonderful, but I suppose if I were only allowed one, I'd choose the Coctel de Atun Tropical, a raw tuna with dressed avocado and mango. While the raw tuna and avocado is nothing new, the seasoning for the mango (salsa?) and avocado (guac-like) was perfect. I'll admit, I could have done without the pork flautas; the wrapping was thicker and tougher than I would have liked, and while the meat was good, it wasn't great. But all was forgiven when I tried my Queso Fundido de Costilla. The cheese tasted incredibly fresh, and was well supported by the pork and vegetables. I would be happy with just that dish for every meal for a week (if I thought I could survive eating like that). Oh, and parents take note: they will do a plain cheese quesadilla for unadventurous/cautious diners.
