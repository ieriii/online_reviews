After being here a dozen times, I have to say that this place is one of my favorite bars in the city! Why? Cause the beer selection is exceptional, and the bar tenders are friendly, attentive, and more than willing to share their knowledge with you. This place makes me feel at home every time. The food is ridiculously delicious and everything is moderately priced. I have never had a bad night at this place, never! Now the parking...good luck! Oh and it's always busy, but you'll get a seat, I promise!
