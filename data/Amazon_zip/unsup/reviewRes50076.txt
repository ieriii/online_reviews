We know the guys that own this place from their days at Joe's Stonecrab so we made a point of visiting the Fifty/50 during their opening weekend. Although I'm not a sports bar guy per-se, I quickly learned this isn't your average sports bar. Once you walk in you can quickly tell it's so much more. When was the last time you visited a sports bar with a host? The vibe is awesome... chic decor, unobtrusive TVs everywhere you look and a staff that's pleasant and well trained. These aren't your average servers that throw beers at you... instead, they bring you hot towels after you finish your wings. There's a lot on the menu and we wanted to try a bunch of things. Fortunately for us, they serve sliders! That's right, mini versions of a bunch of different burgers. We had the triple secret (damn awesome!) and the pulled pork (love that bbq sauce). In addition to the sliders we had the skirt steak sandwich which I definitely recommend. Mac and cheese was smoky and yummy... definitely not kraft from a box. We found out they have a smoker on site. The wings were great too... huge pieces, not too hot but full of flavor- and smoky. Looking towards cocktails, the beer infused margarita was awesome and the table next to us took advantage of the half bottle service. They brought out the cutest half bottle of Maker's Mark and a bunch of mixers... a fun way to go if you're with a group. This is going to be our favorite place for Saturday afternoon snacks and cocktails. Rumor has it they'll have a patio when it warms up. Tell your friends.
