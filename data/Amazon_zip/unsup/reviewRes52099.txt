I'm from California and got back from vacation in Chicago a few days ago (fun trip) --only places I can compare deep dish pies are Pizza Chicago and Patxi's (sp?)..both were pretty yummy, with pizza chicago being better of the two imho --this pizza was pretty good..very filling, full of toppings...some people don't like the corn style based crust but I had no problem with it --deep dish does take at least 40 min so order ahead if you can --overall, good place to eat..also like the laid back atmosphere with all the different writings on the walls
