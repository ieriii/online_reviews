HOLY CRAP. That's good. We got the Top Chef Torta which is braised beef tongue with chorizo, potatoes, and avocado. The beef tongue was very flavorful and tender that you would not miss eating a "regular" cut of meat. However, I do think that the amount of potatoes could be lessened because it already is starchy enough with the bread itself.  We also got the Ahogada, a pork sandwich that comes in a tomato-based soup, where you eat it similarly if you were to eat a French Dip. This a dine-in only sandwich that was totally worth eating in the scorching heat.  I do want to applaud Xoco's efficiency in getting people in line, taking their orders, and ensuring enough tables to sit and eat.
