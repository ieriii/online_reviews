TThis clean and comfortable family owned restaurant is a Chicago gem. It's fresh menu and wood fired pizzas are wonderful. We ordered and ap off the menu and a special. Kennel fritters were tasty and incredibly fresh. The mussels were tasty and also fresh. We also ordered a special pizza with prosciutto, caramelized onions and red sauce. It was the table favorite. We also had the Italian Sausage, Basil and Moz pizza. Delicious! It is not our tradition bust a gut American pizza. It is fresh, lighter and delicious. The owner was there to greet on the way I'm and out.  They gave us all mini canolis on our way out the door that were little pieces of heaven. Our waiter was also very helpful and skilled. For 5 of us with two rounds of beer, our bill was only $100. It is a more intimate setting, so I would call ahead and arrange for anything larger than a party of 4. And, don't wait too late in the evening! They can get very busy, and you don't want to miss the specials of the day!!!!
