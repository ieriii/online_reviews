Never did I expect to have such an exceptional experience at the Hotel Allegro. I found the hotel online and booked it because it had the most reasonable rate at the time.I arrived at the hotel before 9:00 AM due to my early morning flight from CT. I asked the front desk staff about early check in. Within two hours, I received a call informing me they had a room prepared. This friendly, professional customer service continued throughout my entire four-day stay - from front desk staff, concierge, restaurant, and housekeeping. Clearly, there is a commitment to exceed hotel guests' expectations. One of the front desk staff, Gianna, was exceptional in her responsiveness, knowledge of Chicago, and willingness to assist me with my check-out requests. Tim was also very helpful with travel arrangements to the airport. The hotel provides coffee, including iced coffee, in the morning and then offers beer and wine each afternoon at 5:00 PM. Besides enjoying the beverages, it's so nice to see the lobby full of hotel guests and have an opportunity to talk to other people about the city. This was probably one of the most enjoyable hotel stays I've ever had, all because the employees were clearly committed to making it that way for all guests.While the actual stay was positive enough, upon completing the hotel's online survey (after I got home) I received a personal email from the general manager, Ryan Kunzer, who thanked me for my survey comments and offered to assist with my future reservations. I will gladly return to this hotel the next time I am in Chicago, all because people made an effort to let me know they cared about my stay.
