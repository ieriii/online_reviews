Finally tried this new bistro-style spot in Andersonville. This place is Chalkboard meets M Henry with the countryside decor and the window panes hanging to separate spots in the room. I went here on a Wednesday night and this place was busy. Our waitress was nice and offered some good selections for wine. My friend Susan ordered the Cornish hens and I ordered the halibut. While we waited, we were given a basket of delicious freshly cooked breads. The wines that were suggested were very tasty. Susan and I split our food so that we could both taste different entrees. Both the fish and the Cornish hens were delicious, but for $25 the halibut should have had some veggies to compliment the plate. The halibut came with lentils underneath, but I could have used some broccoli or a couple asparagus or something. Then with Susan's Cornish hens...they came with veggies, but no starch. It would have been really easy...and cheap...to throw a little rice on the side. The food was delicious, but for the price I would have expected a little more.  Another component of this place was that it was REALLY loud. So, a good place to go with friends and eat some delicious fare, but be prepared to have to talk loudly. So, I would have given it 3 1/2 stars. Good food and a beautiful space, but a few things I would improve upon.
