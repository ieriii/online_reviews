This place is not a diner. The food is pretty good, but it's a seafood bar and grill. Diners don't serve marlin or barramundi. And diners are kitschy not tacky, like this place covered in blackboards and cereal boxes. It feels like you're inside a pantry, but not in a good way. There's not a jovial atmosphere as conveyed by all the tacky signs. It's just a mediocre place with overpriced fish. I'm from Florida and paying $30 for a plate of grilled fish is just asinine to me. The service is well...awkward. I went with a group for a birthday party and the waiter stood at the far end of the table practically whispering the specials and when he passed by and I asked if he'd repeat them he said "weren't you listening?" For me, that's enough to drop the tip from 20% to 15%, but it was a friend's birthday so I just went with it. At the end of the meal he walked right up beside me and started listing their desserts. I smiled and said, "thanks, but I'm good." His response? "I'm sure you're good. I'm just talkin' about some awesome desserts." It's not exactly rude, but it didn't really make me want to order anything. The whole time I just wanted everyone to finish eating so we could leave and go to the pub down the street...where we had great drinks and a fun wait staff made our evening great. Also, all the tacky banners they put up during the mayoral election were kind of annoying. When I go out I want good food, not a sales pitch for Rahm Emmanuel. And, no, I'm not just disgruntled because I didn't vote for him. To conclude, I won't be back to Glenn's, which is a shame because I live nearby and thought it might become a regular place for me.
