Some people scoff at the ducks hanging in the window, but it shouts out to you that they're all about the food. Plus, Chinese people really don't get grossed out by stuff like that. Go inside you won't regret it.  The food is phenomenal. Of course my favorite is the duck, but some other notable dishes are the shrimp and walnut special and the hot and sour soup. I was also impressed by the staff. When I ordered the medium soup for two people, the waitress actually shook her head and said, "you want the small." And she was right, the small was big. Normally restaurants would just let you buy too much food, but she was looking out for us.
