Hot Doug's is a legit five-star encased meat establishment. I have been wanting to visit Hot Doug's since moving to Chicago at the beginning of 2010. I finally had the opportunity to visit, and I am so glad that I did. First off, expect a line! I chose to visit Hot Doug's on a Friday for lunch to ensure that I could splurge on the duck fat fries (yes...fries cooked in duck fat are available on Fri and Sat only). Needless to say, I thoroughly enjoyed them and likely shaved at least a few minutes off of my life expectancy. Now for the "encased meats..." My wife and I ordered 4 different items so we could try a wide array. We tried two regular menu items: The Salma Hayek (andouille sausage) was delicious, but a bit greasy. The Keira Knightley (red hot) was excellent. We also tried two specials: An antelope sausage and a crawfish sausage. I really wish I could remember all of the ingredients and the official names. In the end, they were all very tasty. Hot Doug's rocks! Again...expect a line, be adventurous when ordering, and bring cash (no CCs accepted). I look forward to my next visit to Hot Doug's.
