Pizza here is so good. Deep dish and full of flavor. I even brought a pizza back to my fiancee in L.A. (I picked it up right before leaving to the airport).  We microwaved it and ate it several hours later. It definitely wasn't the same. Still good, but not the same. Gotta eat it fresh and hot off the dish. Best pizza I've had.
