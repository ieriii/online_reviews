Oh Fogo...you are a cruel mistress. Luring me in with your promises of endless pork and beef but leaving me hours later with a painful "meat hangover".  I saw "meat orgy" in a review below and I think that sums it up perfectly. This is how Roman's ate, right before they started the other kind of orgy. I can't really go here more than once a year and feel good about myself but while I'm there...oh MAN is it good! If they also served seafood I could safely say it was the one place on earth where if trapped inside, I would eat myself to death.
