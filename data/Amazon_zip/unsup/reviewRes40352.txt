OK.HERES THE DEAL Pasadita isnt about fine dinning, it isnt about being a place that makes you feel like your in Mexico. Its all about having some meaty good tacos period!! Good meat, right off the grill! cheese, cilantro onion and tomatillo hot sauce that is awesome. come one people dont hate because they dont serve latte or expresso here. this is strictly a taco joint. Ive been coming here since I started drinking at 16t, never lets me down! Dont hate! this is tacos at its best. Haters......go to taco bell! Shake & bake seal of approval!
