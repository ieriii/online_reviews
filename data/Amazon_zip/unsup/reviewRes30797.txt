Today was a great day to have breakfast and it was, usually on a sunny day Nana has a line out the door but today it was raining and was not as crowded as it is usually. Upon entering into the establishment I hear Micheal Jackson music, weird for breakfast music but found out that the theme of the day was the best of Micheal Jackson. We were politely asked to sit by the window and even though there were many open seats near the rear. The window seat is the best seats on a sunny day but since it was rainy and cautiously looking at three flies swarming on the window making sure they won't land on my food was part of why I gave them three stars. We took our time combing through the menu, The prices were average for breakfast so I ordered the "two eggs with biscuit in duck gravy". I was glad I chosen the sunny-side eggs because the duck gravy was on the salty side and mixing the yolk up in the gravy made it more enjoyable. There were small slivers of duck meat mixed with the biscuit with added more flavor to the meal. Overall my dish was made well and enjoyable but not spectacular. Would I order this dish again? Probably not. Would I come back for breakfast? Definitely Yes.
