The Church of Brunch - Bongo Room. Why? These are pancakes from the gods. Red Velvet, Cornmeal, Oatmeal, Whole Grain it matters not. They are all delicious. If you don't like the pancakes here, you must be a hardcore IHOP acolyte. I can't name something on the menu that is terrible. It's all made well and with plenty of flavor. From the breakfast burrito to their scrambles to their benedicts you truly cannot go wrong. I don't think my family will truly know brunch until they come here.  I think the biggest problem with coming to the Bongo Room is trying not to order more than you can eat.
