gorgeous display cakes, even more scrumptious desserts (personally tried the keylime bars, choco cookie, carrot cupcake, and bread pudding) with good portions, and of course free wifi with functional electrical outlets to work/study! good studying place as room on the side usually quiet. what more can i ask for? oh yeah, and their coffee is good. only weird part is that their room for people to hang out is COMPLETELY separate from where they sell their goodies... maybe consider putting a door in the wall to connect the two??
