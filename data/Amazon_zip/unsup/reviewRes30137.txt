Don't Waste Your Time...and you will need to waste a lot of it. After the two hour wait my fiance and I sat down to what was good, but not great, food. The accompanying flies all throughout the restaurant gave it an authentic feel. Still, the biggest problem is the staff, and their general "we work for Frontera, so we don't really need your business attitude." The entire staff, highlighted by the somalier, are arrogant and condescening. This was best exemplified by the gum stuck under the table which got stuck to my fiance's dress. When I brought it to the host's attention he simply said, "that mosu have happened right before you sat down." When I replied, "if we have two hours to wait for a table, you have two minutes to clean it off" he simply shrugged and turned away.  Save yourself the time, the money and most importantly the aggravation and go elsewhere, this place is not what it used to be nor it is what it thinks it is.
