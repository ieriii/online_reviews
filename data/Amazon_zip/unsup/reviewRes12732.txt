I've found it very difficult to pick my favorite between Fogo and Brazzaz and a a lazy lunch with friends at TdB didn't help either. Overall, the meats here aren't my favorite from these three places, the garlic steak does make me wish that steaks were rubbed with garlic. Expect the usual salad bar and meat selection, though they don't serve all of them during lunch. Be happily surprised by lobster bisque at the salad bar - not the rich bisque that I enjoy but still has terrific flavor. Be warned that the ultra rich passionfruit mousse is ENORMOUS and you should probably find a few people to share this with if you have room for dessert. The service was incredible. A friend somehow managed to make friends with one of the gauchos who kept bringing meat to our table directly after being cooked and even going as far to make each of us a lamb chop (not normally served during lunch) that he seasoned himself with garlic and other deliciousness (mint maybe?). I'll still probably choose Fogo or Brazzaz lunch as they are served throughout the week (TdB only does lunch on Fridays) but highly recommend this to those who want to try a churrascaria dining experience.
