Fine Dining in North Lincoln Park... My work gave me a $100 Gift Cert for Sapori's so we had to make a special night of it. Wow, we were so glad that we did! I'm glad I made reservations even for a Monday night every table except for our reservation and one extra were full. With a Bottle of Belgian Nuevo, Grilled Calamari, Asparagus Salad to split, Gnocchi in Pesto, and Filet Mignon, the total came to just under $103. The perfect meal for two kings celebrating a 28th birthday. I could tell that my Gnocchi was homemade because it was soft and pasty, not like their harder frozen counterparts that fall apart when chewed. The Filet Mignon was complimented with a thyme gravy and mashed potatoes. On our way out the hostess suggested to us to come back with a group of three or more to take advantage of the Fixed Menu that serves large potions to split with a group. Can't wait to bring my friends back with me.
