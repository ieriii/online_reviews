I enjoyed my first Cuban dining experience at 90 mile. My friend and I were prepared to order a nice fruity alcoholic beverage when we read that they were BYOB. Our fault for not checking into it beforehand, but I just thought I'd let you know. I got the shredded beef dish with plantains, rice, and beans. It was good, but I had to dock a star because it was a little too salty for me. The food was, however, very comforting. Our server was spectacular, and everything was quick. I would have to say it's a little expensive for my taste and for what ingredients are really used in the entrees, but that is just me.
