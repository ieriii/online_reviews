Sushi-X is my go to sushi place. I will openly admit, I'm mostly a fan of rolls. If you are too - this place is for you. They have a great array of really interesting combinations. Some of my favorites are the honey roll, the lava rolls, and the red dragon (super spicy). My parents even LOVE this place - and that's a tough sell on sushi.  The place is really small, so we try to get there early - around 7 or 7:30 to get a seat. Would definitely be hard to head here with a really large group. Service is hit or miss - sometimes the server is there in 5 minutes, sometimes 20 minutes. Sometimes the food your ordered gets forgotten (i.e. edamame).  But, the rolls are so worth it. And the fact that its BYOB saves us a ton of money usually, so I'll forgive the bad service.  I've been meaning to try the amazing happy hour deal - will update this when I do!
