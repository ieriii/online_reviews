I work in the area, so I stop in pretty regularly (once a week or so) for lunch. My experiences at lunchtime have brought me back for quite a few dinners as well. The service is fantastic. Everyone is friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. The tee shirt and jeans crowd is treated the same as those in business attire; you won't find any air of snobbery here. The lunch menu is a good value. Ask to get your burger/sandwich on a pretzel roll, as it is basically heaven on a plate. I've also eaten a few of the non-steak entrees for lunch. The rock shrimp risotto is amazing, and sans shrimp, it doubles as the wild mushroom risotto side item. It has a creamy texture and is a satisfying substitute for a side of baked/mashed potatoes. I've only had steak for dinner. Yes, they're not as good as Morton's, but I'd argue they're as good as Gene and Georgetti's and at a cheaper price. And if the ribeye is on special, do yourself a favor and order it. You will not be disappointed. Go for the service, stay for the food and be ready to have a great time.
