I've been to Irazu countless times, so I guess I started to take it for granted. I went last week for the first time in awhile and was reminded of how great it is. Seems as though they've added some new items to the menu, one of which was a garlic shrimp and veggie plate. The shrimp was perfectly cooked and seasoned, and they included all the best vegetables (including their fabulous plantains, which I never miss). I've never been disappointed at Irazu. The customer service was incredible as always, and they have both vegetarian and carnivore options. Now I just need to find them a location in Andersonville so they can open up a second spot. Tee hee.
