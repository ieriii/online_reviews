Went for my birthday with two of my gal friends and my 1 1/2 year old date. They carded me at the door which made me feel cool, and we were seated right away by a super cool friendly who I would like to poach to be my babysitter. He was nice to my dude when at a lot of restaurants seem to hate children even if you come early and are the most considerate of parents. The server was also cool and most of staff didnt seem to care that said child was a loud mouth. The restaurant was busy and super loud but still comfy, pizza arrived quickly and it and our beers were great. Not a place for dates but super good for families (give them a break and come early) or a group of friends.
