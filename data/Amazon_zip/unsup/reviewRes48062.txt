Went here last weekend with my husband and another couple. The food was really delish. We started with oysters which were fantastic, then got a sampling of plates to share including the suckling pig, striped bass, house made sausage with roasted turkey, and sides of beets and turnips. Overall really good. The bass was a little bland and unmemorable, if I'm being picky. We also got 2 desserts for the table. Do yourself a favor- if they have carrot cake on the menu, get it. I don't even like carrot cake that much and it was one of the best desserts I've ever had. The candied ginger is bomb. The service was spotty- our waitress was quite flighty and forgot when someone ordered another glass of wine, more than once. I thought it was expensive for what we got. Our bill for 4 people with everyone having 2 cocktails was $350. It was really good but not sure it was worthy of that price.
