this popped up in my old neighborhood so we checked it out for lunch one day. Very reasonably priced food, and all sorts of people in the place. The soy chicken was excellent, and the lunch special is $9.95 and comes with 2 mini egg rolls and kind of a small salad but it is a perfect portion. I had the basil noodles, spicy with the soy chicken. They deliver all the way to Kedzie so I will order from them for delivery soon!
