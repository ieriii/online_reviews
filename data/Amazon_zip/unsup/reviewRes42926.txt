love Love LOVE gilt bar. Every visit has resulted in "to die for" creative, original, memorable, yet incredibly reasonably priced food. Portions not huge, but that's OK, price is right and there are lots of menu items that must be sampled. The $4 glass of red table wine is amazing! (that's right, only $4.00). Staff friendly, efficient, and fun. and the desserts......yum. The homemade ice cream is just incredible, and it only gets better from there.
