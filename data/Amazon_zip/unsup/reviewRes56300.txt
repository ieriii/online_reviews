Quickly becoming one of my favorite neighborhood casual restaurants. Been for dinner twice and lunch twice and it's been excellent. The flavors are very expansive, so it's a good idea to order entrees to share so you can sample several things. The catfish and mango beef are highlights, but it's all been good.For lunch you can do a sandwich combo for 7 bucks, which also includes soup, salad, egg roll, drink, and fruit for desert. Great deal, and the sandwiches are quite generous, not to mention tasty. Give it a try.
