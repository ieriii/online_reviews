A local friend recommended I check this place out while in town and I'm glad I took his advice. I arrived on a late night Thursday. The place was packed and the smell of good food was heavy in the air. However, I had not come for food. I was just in town and was ready to enjoy the start of my vacation with something liquid. Happily, I was able to find a spot at the bar which is where I prefer to sit. I'd had just enough time to grab the menu before one of the bartenders was there ready to take my order.  Now the reason I was here was because my friend had been telling me about their vast whiskey menu for a few months now and I was there to explore it. I'm more a scotch or irish guy and these were well represented on the menu. Where the whiskey menu went insane was in their huge selection of bourbons and ryes. Something to note here is they have a selection of these last two whiskey types for $3 a shot. That's right, $3. The point of which is not to obliterate your sobriety as well as your liver. These are priced for you to have a low risk shot of something new to sip on. I've never been a fan of bourbon and I thought I didn't like ryes either. But after a chat with 2 of the bartenders that night, I may have to change my mind about rye whiskey. The rye recommended to me was delicious.  Things to note here: they offer whiskey flights (which kind of makes me giddy in a good way), a full bar, some good draught beers to choose from, and a menu that goes well beyond average pub fare. Add to this, friendly and great service. Thanks Jim and An(n)a! It was a fantastic start to my trip and made such a good impression that I went back once more before I left. Given the chance, I'll be back again.
