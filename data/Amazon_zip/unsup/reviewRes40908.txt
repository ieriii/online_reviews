We went on a Tuesday night for the $30 prix fixe.  The owner/waiter greeted us and asked us if we had ever been there before. We said "no." He said, " there are two options tonight...you can order off the menu or we can just bring things out to you." We were like, "sure just bring whatever out to us," thinking that we were getting the prix fixe. However, they just kept bringing us dishes until we said, " how many dishes are we getting."  The owner/waiter said, "didn't we go over this already, seven." We were like WTF we didn't order this. We get the bill and it's $70 each for the 7 courses.  I'm not cheap but this was a totally jack*ss thing to do to people who have never been to your restaurant.  With tip my boyfriend and I spent $180 and instead of feeling happy we felt robbed and I wanted to rip that waiter/owner dude a new *ss hole.
