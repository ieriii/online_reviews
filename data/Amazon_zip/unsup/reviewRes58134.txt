I have trouble giving this place any stars because it really deserves zero. The waiter basically disappeared after taking our orders so for most of the night no one had any drinks at the table. They also forgot to bring the main course of our tasting to the table and skipped right over to dessert (the dessert also left something to be desired - a small chocolate square that tasted like nothing more than a fudge popsicle). Then when it came time for the check, the waiter was once again missing so we had to go up to the hostess. We even had to ask her for it twice! For a high end restaurant, the service was one of the worst I've seen in Chicago. If you are going to spend $100 per person, you expect to get some service. Save your money and go somewhere else!
