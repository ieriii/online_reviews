These people make some really good food. The pizza is fantastic and geuninely Italian (even gets a thumbs up from the girl, who is, like the pizza, fantastic and genuinely Italian). It's not deep dish and it's not Domino's, it's thin crust and good ingredients. Don't gloss over the appetizers. The eggplant is simple and delicious. The mozzarella cheese - out of this world. The service never fails, either. It's good all around, but you can tell quality service by how they handle it when shit goes south. Our second time there, the girl clearing our pizza (half-eaten and headed for a box) got viciously stripped by some idiot inexplicably coming out of the bathroom at a full sprint. Pizza everywhere. We told her not to worry, she had the kitchen cook us a new pizza. Lightnin quick too. Our next time there, the girl knocked her wine over. They brought her a new glass, on the house. That's quality. Good tiramisu, good grappa to boot. Seriously, eat here.
