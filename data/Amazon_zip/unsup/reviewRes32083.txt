SO THRILLED to live across the street from a vegetarian restaurant! I have a feeling we'll be going here a lot. :) Managed to score a free hot chocolate because it got made on accident, and was so excited to find it was vegan and also delicious. Even Mister liked it, and he's not a fan of hot chocolate. He had a veggie burger and potatoes, which were both tasty, and I had mac & cheeze, sweet potato fries, and steamed veg. All very nice. Can't wait to try their brunch! :)
