I'm not changing my star rating, but we stopped by on Friday night and my former fantasy vegan sandwich, the lovely Tempeh Rueben now has a slice of swiss cheese on it, which I wasn't expecting, having been absent from the first one I had (actually, my husband got it, so it was fine, but my vegan friends were quick to let me know that what I told them was wrong.) The rueben also shrunk noticeably in the past few weeks. This time I opted for the grilled tofu, which was a little bland, but the frites were so much crispier and tastier than the first time! Best of all, we had virtually no waiting time.
