I can't think of any reason why someone would give this place less than 4 stars. Candlelit cave + flamenco guitar + wine and fondue = 4 stars in itself. As for the food, the premier dinners ($45-50 per person) are the way to go if its your first time because you'll get a taste of everything. Appetizer: cheese fondue w/ a basket of bread cubes, grapes and apples. Main: (whatever premier dinner you select with a side of vegetables) and 8 different dipping sauces. Dessert: melted chocolate fondue pot with a generous plate of pound cake/apples/pineapple/grapes/melon/toasted marshmellows  If there is anything overrated about this place, it is probably the portions. The appetizer and dessert are well sized for you to feel that you got your fill and money's worth....the main, not so...I did expect them to serve more lobster and steak, sadly, half the plate was filled with veggies. Nevertheless, if you're a small to normal-sized eater, i'm sure you'll be very satisfied. Guys, you'll probably still have room for a cheeseburger after the meal. Most definitely a charming and romantic little cave. Tip#1: most tourist magazines have $25-off coupons floating around for this place, which brings the bill down by quite a bit! Tip#2: if you're big and clumsy, you might want to request for a booth to avoid invading the space of other diners.
