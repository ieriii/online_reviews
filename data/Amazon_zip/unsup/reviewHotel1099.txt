Pros: Staff was very pleasant.  Beds were comfortable. Cons: $10 per day per person to use the fitness center. The coffee shop in the lobby is absurdly expensive ($3.50 for a medium drip coffee, $5 for a scone) and the coffee isn't great. I would have vastly preferred Starbucks. All around, not as nice as I expected for a Fairmont.
