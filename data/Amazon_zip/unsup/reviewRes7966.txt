Haven't been there recently in the last year, but have gone a few times a year since I read about its grand opening. Went to Italy in '98 and was never satisfied with pizza state-side until Spacca Napoli. Trust me, they 99% nail it. And that's close enough for me. The reason we go so rarely is because it's inconvenient, being south siders. I love it, but sometimes it really disagrees with my husband. Sorry hun, I gotta get this fix on. Be prepared for a way simplified pizza experience, but I bet you and your buds won't forget it.
