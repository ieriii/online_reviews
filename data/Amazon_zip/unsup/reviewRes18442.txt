Really good place for breakfast with a bit of energy and latin feel, and the food is very plentiful. We wanted to try a few things and walked out stuffed. The Choriso sandwich was awesome. I really like the Churros with chocolate sauce, but wish they would have brought it last instead of first. The Open face was OK, but the the egg whites were a bit runny.
