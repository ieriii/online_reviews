Okay, so I went to Cafe 28 last Sunday by myself for brunch. Obviously the reviews here are pretty good for the place and it's about four blocks from where I live so I figured it was about time for me to try this place out. The space is cozy.  I ordered the stuffed french toast and potatoes - nothing too crazy. I loved the french toast and the potatoes were good as well. However, they were both cold - well, cold may be an overstatement, but both were less than hot! The place was busy, but not so busy that I would expect my food to be sitting around in the kitchen for a while. My server was also a bit strange - looked at me weird a couple times and was rather slow, which could be related to the busy-ness of the restaurant (I also think he was the only server working the room I was in). I don't really complain much about restaraunts service or food and the things I've mentioned are rather minor. I'll definitely be back for dinner (or lunch). I'm certainly not going to let a couple less than perfect aspects of my experience keep me from giving this place another chance. I am pretty sure they'll redeem themselves. Afterall, the stuffed french toast was pretty damn good even though it wasn't quite at temperature. There were a lot of items on the menu I'd like to try and I will certainly be back to give this place another go.
