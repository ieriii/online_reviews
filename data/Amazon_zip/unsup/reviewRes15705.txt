Darling Violet Hour. Why have I waited 15 months? She asks, "Do you think about me now and again? Do you think about me now and again?" Yes, I do. I summoned every shred of patience and focused on the lure of delayed gratification... all in anticipation of 'that' magical opportunity. Finally the occasion presented itself. My friend Devan, who lives in L.A., has probably been to Violet Hour a dozen times. Dev's friend, resident mixologist Kyle, was working the bar so after an impromptu phone call enticing us with the promise of bar seats and no wait in line, off we were.  As the 250+ other reviews detail, the feel is definitely vintage. Speakeasy-esque. Dark, intimate, just lovely. The music serves as purely backseat and creates a backdrop which highlights the big three--the cocktails, the ambiance and your own conversation. Expect a clean, brooding Indie sound-- think Leonard Cohen, Portishead, maybe a pick off of 'Garden State' and then a 'Pulp Fiction' track... deliberate juxtaposition. Follow the same rules when dining out: order the specials. So, there are no 'specials' at Violet Hour, which translates to mixologist's choice. Easy decision, he knows best. We talked with Kyle about our preferences and with that insight he created our cocktails. Between the surprises among us, we were courted with rye, house-made bitters, rum, campari, absinthe, gin, honey syrup, egg whites, pineapple, lime and more. The cocktail-crafting process itself is very methodical, unhurried, and personal, from precise eyedropper-rationed measurements, to letting the drink sit and breathe to choosing the proper cut of ice. Really, it was riveting to watch and get the history of each cocktail along the way. Violet Hour may be a bit too intense, too intimate for a first date. I think this experience is better shared with someone you really... know. And yes, though pricey, you won't mind it. There's no standing, no cell phones: all specialness. And a world far away from where you are.
