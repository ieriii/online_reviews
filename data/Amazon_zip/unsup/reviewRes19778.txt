I thought that I'd found the best cup o chocolate at mindy's, but Xoco offers an Aztec hot chocolate that gives cocoa sippers a cup of authentic grittiness accompanied with a spicy kick. Instead of saving the drink 'n churro for last (which you can do when you order, just save your receipt and go up when you're ready), my friend and I had them first while our chips 'n guac and tortas were in the midst of preparation. The wait wasn't terrible when we came in around 11:30am and the hostess told us 25 minutes. Despite the line, the hostess came around to update us and apologized for the wait. For once, it felt nice that we were taken care of while in line. Once we were seated, we had our churros. I was regretting that I'd only ordered one (since we got a bunch of other stuff). The chips 'n guac was pretty good and I couldn't get enough of my Milanesa dipped in the cilantro crema. This was just me, but I would've liked shredded chicken over the gunthorp, which was like of a breaded consistency. All in all, best torta I've had and I can't wait to eat through their entire menu!
