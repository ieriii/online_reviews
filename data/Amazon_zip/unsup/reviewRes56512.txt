I've been here in the past and remember loving it... But don't know what happened to just common politeness. Why have a hostess that is soooooo unwelcoming? Seriously... we expected to wait... but not be forgotten... when you tell someone 1 hour... Don't change it to 2 after we'd already waited an hour...rude and snooty... your food is just not that good... Definitely not a 2-hour wait good!
