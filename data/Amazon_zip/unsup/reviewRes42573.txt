The review is for the thin-crust pizza. I would give it a one star, but maybe it was my fault for getting a thin-crust in a place known for their deep dish. But, assuming the basic ingredients are a constant between both versions (thin-crust and deep dish), I can't see why this place is rated so highly. In short, my experience with the plain cheese thin crust pizza is as follows: Terrible. Fo2Go is much, MUCH better. My search for good thin-crust pizza continues.
