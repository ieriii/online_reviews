Glenn's has yet to disappoint, whether for brunch or dinner.  The seafood is great, the BYOB option is great (note, however, that there is a per bottle corkage fee).  It's impressive how the vibe of the place changes from brunch (cheery, raucous) to dinner (calm, more upscale). Just goes to show you where smart lighting can take you. This weekend, Glenn even made room for a group of 14 of us (with a reservation, of course). If you've been to Glenn's, you'll know that there's not a lot of room to spare, but they took care of our large party very well, and our server handled the big group superbly. Pricing is really good for the quality of the food. With 20% gratuity (at our discretion) and $35 worth of corkage fees, the bill came to $45/each. That included a bunch of appetizers, salads, a few desserts, plus everyone's excellent entrees. There is a small amount of outdoor seating. It looks decent, though you'd probably have to contend with noise from the El overhead.
