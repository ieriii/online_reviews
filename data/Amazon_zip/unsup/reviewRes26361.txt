This place is amazing!!!! This is hands down the best pizza in Chicago. Anytime visitors come into town and are looking for great Chicago pizza, this is where I send them. I wish they had more locations! The crust on their pan pizza is phenomenal and I highly recommend the deep dish. Thin crust is good as well, but if you're there, you might as well harness your chi and go for the real thing. You only live once, right? Prices are reasonable too and the pizza makes fantastic leftovers.
