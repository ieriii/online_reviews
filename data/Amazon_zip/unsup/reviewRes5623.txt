Mixed review. The cuke with feta, delish--the salad with hazelnuts wonderful. The server came after we'd had our first round and asked, "Dessert?" We had to say, no, first we wanted our meal. Given the person who takes the order, doesn't deliver--she had NO idea. When the pork appeared in a small plate before us, I thought I'd died. My stomach did a 180 and I passed on this rather slimy appearing selection.
