Not the finest meat in town, but definitely worth a try. A trip to fogo is almost like a mental challenge, or one of self contyrol. The trick is to try a little of each meant until you know which is your favorite. Then don't be shy to ask the gaucho to load you up on that meat. Don't feel obligated to finish it all either. There's plenty to go around, and you're paying dearly. It's hard not to load up on the salad bar and plantains, but try to keep your eye on the prize.
