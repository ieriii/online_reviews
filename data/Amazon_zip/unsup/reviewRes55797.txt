Skip the delivery. My friends & I ordered an extra large deep dish pizza (Calo's special) last night. We patiently waited over the hour for the pizza to be made & delivered. Once the pizza man arrived, we tipped him generously because we were so excited for our pizza & thankful he delivered it to us on a cold winter's night. HOWEVER, it was completely the wrong pizza. We immediately called the delivery man & he said that it was the correct ticket on the box. So we called the restaurant & the restaurant asked us what ticket number was on the box. Again, they came to the conclusion that the right ticket was on the box, but the WRONG pizza!!!! The young lady was really nice on the phone, but her manager was horrible. We felt that he did not want to remedy the situation and he just wanted us to eat the wrong pizza. I asked if we could get a credit towards our next pizza & he said $5 dollars. HMM.... we paid $35 for this pizza including tip. I asked if they could do a little better since again we did not get what we ordered. No, the manager would not budge. He said take the credit or wait another hour & a half for the right pizza. But they could not guarantee that it would get there on time because they were so busy. So I just suggest skipping this place for delivery
