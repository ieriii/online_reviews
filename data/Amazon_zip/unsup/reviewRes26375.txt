Great for a special occasion. Just be prepared to spend $$$$. Overall, the food was excellent. Each dish was prepared and presented exquisitely and carried some unique twist that marked a departure from similar dishes had elsewhere. A couple of the ten or twelve dishes we shared we just so-so. The rest were each stellar and very unique. The scallops should probably be avoided, IMO. I found them rubbery and bland.  Highlights: Service, Food, Presentation, Atmosphere - In that order, all four fantastic. Low light: Portions are TINY, even for tapas. I mean this in all sincerity: if you are hungry, eat before you go or be prepared to spend heartily to match your appetite. Extreme Low Light: The wine list is fairly boring and overpriced. Most of the bottles can be found browsing even a modest Spanish wine section for $15 or so and sell at Mercat in the $50 range. If it's a special occasion and you don't care about such things, then have at it and enjoy the meal. It's a shame to let that get in the way of what is otherwise a pretty artful experience. I had a hard time getting past it. But then, I'm kind of a cheap ass (insert grain of salt). I knocked a star off for the wine list and another for the portion size.
