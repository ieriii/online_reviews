I am always on the lookout for decent options for curry in my area, so I was excited to give India House a first try recently. I was not disappointed. A word of warning though, if you are the type of person that gets easily flustered or scared off by exotic "smells", you may feel that you are getting assaulted by a powerful aroma once you walk through the door. For me? It was a good sign of the tasty deliciousness to follow. We had the Palak Paneer (one of my favorites) and the Dal Makhani. We had asked them to dial down the "heat" level of the Dal Makhani to mild, but it still came out with a little bit of a kick. If need be, order some Raita to cool it down. The mango lassi was okay, not as large as I was hoping, but still a decent amount of beverage. The ambiance of the restaurant is nice, but the environment is enough is casual enough to allow you to bring friends, office mates or dates here quite interchangeably. They also have a lunch buffet, which I heard is quite bountiful.
