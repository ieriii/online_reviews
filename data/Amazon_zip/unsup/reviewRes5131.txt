Tourist trap, 'nuff said. Doesn't accept reservations and always a huge wait. There's also typically a line. If you consider where it is located, it is what it is. If you truly want to indulge in the new trend of pork fat worship and beer, I strongly recommend the Publican as an alternative that takes reservations, has a more robust menu and knowledgeable staff. That said, you certainly won't be disappointed if you get in and get a seat here; I'm just sayin' it's not worth all the hype.
