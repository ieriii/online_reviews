I don't even like Korean food, but I really enjoyed the Korean American fusion here! I got the Bulgogi Steak Sandwich. The bread was really soft and the Bulgogi meat was so juicy! The rest of the sandwich was similar to any other hamburger add-ons (lettuce, tomatoes, mayo, etc). I also tried my friend's Yum Yum Chicken, which is a very tender and sweet fried chicken. They checked in with Yelp and received an offer for a whole chicken, two sides, and two drinks for $20. Awesome deal for food in Lincoln Park. Seating gets crowded and you may need to share a table with a stranger. I guess it would be a good time to make a friend if you're not too busy chowing down. They also have authentic Korean sodas.
