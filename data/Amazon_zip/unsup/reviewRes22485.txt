The food here is good, but nothing amazing. My favorite dish is the dry chili chicken and the mapo tofu. The Mongolian beef is okay, had better paying half the price of this dish in Chinatown. My only complain about this place is the service, which completely sucks. Servers are rude and seems completely unhelpful. Our whole table had no water for about 10 mins when I finally found a server, only to be given a weird look. Lastly, we asked for our check only to never received one.
