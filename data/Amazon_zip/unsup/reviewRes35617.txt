I haven't been to Wah Sun in a few years , but last time I was there they were really good. I have been frequenting Hon Kee which is a block down the street since I was a tot , but this place does have better food, not by leaps and bounds , but better. I really like the bbq chicken wings here , the duck is pretty straight forward but good. The soy sauce chicken is really good. The bbq pork is very good as well. You have to love the Asian gentleman casually whacking away with an enormous cleaver , disassembling any number of gods creatures with ease. ... After a return visit , the outside looks new , the inside still as "classic" as ever. BBQ pork is still really good , the leanest I've had. The roast pork is good , but the skin isn't as crispy as I like. Duck's the same as it was , and thats just fine with me.
