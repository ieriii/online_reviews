I just came back from a terrific culinary experience at this Cuban restaurant, and I wanted to express my sincerest appreciation for a delicious meal in a wonderful atmosphere. Upon entering I was immediately greeted and was offered seating both indoors and outside. The ambiance is 100% Cuban, with ethnic music being played in a perfect manner (not to loud, not too soft). My waitress, Sarah, was both professional and down-to-earth, and we had great conversations throughout our visit. The owner, Alberto, was present, and he made his rounds, checking to see if everything was satisfactory. I thought it was an excellent touch, because he was very humble and appreciative. Naturally, the food itself was amazing! It is prepared with care, and it is served proudly. My sandwich and appetizers were not only delicious, they contained no grease at all. The food was crisp, fresh, hot and very tasty. Oh yeah, I must mention that I did not see one entree priced over $10 in this B.Y.O.B. establishment. I cannot wait to go back.
