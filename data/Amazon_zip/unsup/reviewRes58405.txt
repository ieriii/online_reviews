Piccolo Sogno - Little DreamWe attended the soft opening a Friday evening and absolutely loved it. When we arrived we were escorted to our table on a beautiful patio surrounded by lush vegetation. The garden is wonderful -- it's hard to believe you are still in the city. The decor is also very tasteful.There were four of us, and we had 2 appetizers; the burrata with prosciutto, and the zucchini blossoms with tomato sauce. Both were very good, but the zucchini was incredible. Even the tomato sauce had a distinct flavor! We each had an entree (pastas can be served as appetizers as well). I had the gnocchi made from spinach and ricotta, served with mushrooms. I've never been a fan of mushrooms, but these mushrooms were delectable! My mom had the duck, which was quite good. My aunt had the four cheese ravioli, and the flavors pulled together very nicely. But, saving best for last, my cousin had a white pizza with mushrooms (again, excellent), rosemary, and truffle oil. Hands down, this was everyone's favorite (although everything else was great!) The vegetables served at Piccolo Sogno are from Green Acres Farm and are very fresh. The service was great and the atmosphere and food were even better. Take my advice and go while you can still sit outside - it's beautiful! I wish Piccolo Sogno all the best.
