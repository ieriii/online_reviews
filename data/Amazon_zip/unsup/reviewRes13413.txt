We LOVE LOVE LOVE Revolution. We first came here a few months for breakfast and have been back multiple times since. My fianc immediately purchased the membership card and it's paid for itself already between the introductory free growler and the large glass he gets to drink all of his beer out of. We've tried the mussels, the bacon fat popcorn (of course), burgers, breakfast pizza, pretzels, wings... well, a lot. Everything was top notch! Plus, the great thing about this place is their veg options. Most breweries don't make it a priority but they have plenty. I've never had a bad time, bad food, or bad beer at Revolution and I look forward to going back every time.
