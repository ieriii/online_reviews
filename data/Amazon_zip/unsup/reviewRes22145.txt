Great place to dine for lunch! Complimentary Valet service, this place is constantly busy!  Here are my recommendations: *Come with more than 3 people, dishes are to be shared FAMILY STYLE! *Love the Beet Salad, so fresh, and so delicious (pour on the olive oil, and squeeze some lemons! *The fried zucchini and garlic sauce! Yummy garlic sauce-Beware, only for the strong!  *For seafood, there is this pink spread, made from fish roe, so yummy! *Dandelion weeds are so good for you high in anti-oxident, so not only do you feel good eating, you will look good after eating :) *CANNOT miss on the Grilled Octopus appetizer, highly recommend the large plate!!! I love this place! It's always quick, thorough, and promises to deliver. My favorite Greek Restaurant.
