Okay, okay, so the decor is a little lackluster and the location is out of the way (at least for Chicago visitors like me), none of that matters when the pizza is spot on perfect and you can get it by the slice in 5 minutes. No need to stand around like a dope waiting in line for a taste of deep dish downtown if you can make it out to this gem. The crust was perfect, the sauce was pure magic and you should go.
