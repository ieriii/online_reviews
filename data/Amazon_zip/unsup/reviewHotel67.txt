If you like a hotel that you spend almost $200 to be comfortable DO NOT STAY HERE! Just stayed for one night Sept. 11. Most of the hotels in town were booked and we thought for $200 and discovering a new neighborhood for us in Lincoln par would be fun. I have never dreaded going back to a hotel to sleep for the night. Yes it's old, but apparently that also means dumpy. Postage stamp for an elevator, narrow dark hallways, and dark old rooms with an old TV and an outdated bathroom that really needs some bleach! Our room was a smoking (tried to save $10) and boy did it stink! Our air conditioner didn't actually cool very well, and made a funny noise ALL night. The only thing I felt was clean were the sheets and I was still thinking about the possibility of bed bugs. The staff were not friendly, saw them give attitude to another guest who did not want to stay once he actually saw the rooms. Next time, stay at the Club Quarters in the loop for the same price.
