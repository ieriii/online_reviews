GLORIOUS BURGERS !!! *Vegetarian Burger too! I've had great burgers throughout Chicago while growing up here. But this place takes the cake. It's one thing that the menu has a vast selection, but the fact that they get the meat from a select NYC butcher brings everything to another level. At $9-11 each, it's well worth the spiritual experience. Staff is helpful and friendly even when it's slammed on a Friday night. Only great management can create that kind of energy and dining. Their Great Lakes "Conway" Irish Red is my new favorite beer and their veggie burger is the best I've had in my life. You may have to wait at the bar for 20-30 minutes before getting a table, but you can't blame people for being there too (I can't justify knocking it down to a 4 stars rating because of it anyway). Besides, it's a pleasantly-hip stylized atmosphere and seems to draw in comfortable personalities. Look for their menu online and if that doesn't tempt you, something is wrong with your palate.
