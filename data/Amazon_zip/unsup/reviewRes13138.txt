This is my second time here and I can't wait to go back. Rarely ever do you find a self proclaimed diner that does fish so well. I had a soft shell crab and rice dish and Ryan had a seafood fettuccine. Sure fettuccine can be plain, but who would have known it can be so tasty when you throw in scallops....mmmm. The scallops just melted in your mouth. I'm usually not one to order soft shell crab, but the draw of the additional crawfish in the dish called my name. It did not disappoint. The portion sizes are humongous as well. Ryan, who usually finishes his meal had maybe half of the dish. What?!!! That's a big dish! The only drawback, but it speaks volumes of the restuarants popularity, is the ability to just walk in without reservations. Make reservations people! On an impromptu Friday night I called to make reservations just in case and still ended up with 9pm reservations. Although at times it seemed that we could have been seated when we walked in to see if we can get seated earlier, they really do stick to their reservations list. I get it, it's not like you won't be disappointed.
