The food was excellent! I ordered the taco dinner and it was quite tasty. On Tuesdays and Thursdays they have half priced margarita specials, including pitchers, and their flavored margaritas hit our taste buds in all the right spots. The service was fantastic. Our server was charming and our water nor margarita glasses had a chance of dropping below half full before it was refilled for us.
