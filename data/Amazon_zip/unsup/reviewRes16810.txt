This is one of the best Indian restaurants around! I have only dined during dinner time when we ordered off the full menu and not the buffet. I enjoyed everything I ordered, but my favorites include chicken palak (spicy spinach sauce), dal makhani, and the cauliflower with tomatoes and spices. YUM! It's a bit pricy, but worth it. Go with a group so everyone can order a different dish and share.  Service was also good when I went (and I've been there a number of times!) Enjoy!!
