This place is one of the most popular spots in Argyle/Uptown. Let's just say they can talk the talk AND walk the walk. The pho at Tank isn't the best. There are places in Uptown and around the rest of the city the are tastier. BUT...Tank has a ginormous menu that is full of other delicious treats. Here are a few of my favorites in no particular order: Grilled pork chops: The best Viet-style pork chops I've had in the city. The sauce is a key element in it's tastiness. Vermicelli noodles with all-things-pork: That's not exactly what it's called, but you get the picture. It's got grilled pork chops, pulled pork, pork egg rolls, veggies, and peanuts on a bed of vermicelli noodles. Oh, and it's got that same sauce as the grilled pork chops mentioned above. Lemongrass chicken: Curry-based Viet-style chicken dish with amazing lemongrass flavor. Service isn't the greatest, but they get the job done. The place gets packed at all hours of the day and night. Be prepared to wait a few minutes, double digit if you're a party of four or more. Easily one of my favorite eateries in Chicago, especially for its less-than-$10/person price tag.
