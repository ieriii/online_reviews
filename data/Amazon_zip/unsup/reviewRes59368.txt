This grocery store has the worst customer service in Chicago. The manager thinks he or she can get away with outrageous prices and terrible service because it is a "destination" grocery store. Employees have bad attitudes and never know how to help customers. This place will go downhill fast without a change in management and complete overhaul of the employees.
