Great place to catch some really good jazz. The jazz varies from big band to free jazz, as well, so you never know quite what you are in for if you just stop by without checking who is on the bill. It is a Chicago legend and worth checking out if you are looking to entertain friends from out of town or just looking to break the routine on the weekend. Usually very packed.
