I LOVE this place! I'm not from Chicago but whenever my husband and I are in the area we HAVE TO stop by Pho tank to eat before we hit the road. I absolutely love the beef pho they have there. Its delicious. My husband always order the vermicelli with beef and eggrolls dish, he loves it! Best ever! and because the food is so good, I always order the rice dish to go so I can have it at home, even after a 4 hours drive the food was still delicious. I HIGHLY recommend this place! Although I don't like the space they have, its too small for such a busy restaurant.
