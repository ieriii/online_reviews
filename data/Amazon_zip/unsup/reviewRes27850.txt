A Mexican friend raved about NL. I finally weaved my way down there and was generally disappointed. The restaurant was described to me as authentic Mexican. Well I guess I don't like authentic Mexican then, if it is indeed. Then again I've been to upscale joints a lot: Frontera (40 times), Salpicon (15), Adobo Grill (5), Nacional 27 (2) and others. NL is BYOB (I think) which I didn't know. No margarita, no happy. Miscellaneous: Glad they had a little parking lot. First impression of "dining room" is cafeteria. We were seated quickly but the line in the "dining room" snaked adjacent to our table: "Nice to meet you and you and you...." Guacamole was nothing more than ground avocado. Bland. I like Guac girls w/ cart and spice! Red Snapper was dry as the Bonneville Salt Flats. Service good but server(s) knew little English and I know little Spanish (4 years). I can say Dios Mio este food es terrible. Not terrible but not good. Beef and Chicken fajita was a hearty portion at a small price but it really lacked any substantive flavor: Bland. Tortillas are good. Chips are good but were not "steaming"as they say. Amuse buche, whatever it was was spicy and a little bit better than good. Diet Coke was delicious. Queso fundido was a heap of chihuahua cheese and a little spicy sausage on top. No big deal. It was my idea to make the unusual trek to 18th street and overall the rating from all was just okay. But only one visit. Wish it was muy delicioso.
