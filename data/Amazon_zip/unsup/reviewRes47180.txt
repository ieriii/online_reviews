Wow. I was very impressed. Came here for a yelp elite event and they showered us with appetizers (not literally) on their back porch. Excellent fried goods (pickles, chips, onion rings) with delicious sauces. Flavorful mussels, huge pulled pork sliders. Wings I didn't try but man they looked good. By the way.. LOVE porches. Then we tried the lockdown warden burger -- MASSIVE, cheese-filled, sheer umami satisfaction. With perfectly crisp fries. WHAT?! We had to take half of this baby home. We also had the shockingly good billy kid salad, which converted my carnivore boyfriend to a salad-lover with its unique citrus vinaigrette. And it's always nice to have a salad big enough to actually be a meal. Only negatives.. the burger was overdone (but it's hard to do med-rare on a stuffed burger) and the mac n cheese was disappointing was runny bland cheese sauce. Staff was freaking amazing, running around refilling apps, speedily clearing tables, accommodating our shifting tables, while still being friendly and approachable. THANKS GUYS!
