Having just had a great time with friends here last night, I felt the need to share how wonderful this place is. Last night was a typically great night at The Violet Hour. The hostess for the night did our routine ID checks and when she saw mine, she wished me a happy b-lated bday. Then, I remembered how I should have reviewed the night of my 30th birthday on Saturday Dec. 18th at this wonderful establishment:I showed up early as I had been here before and knew I had to be here at open if I had a chance of sitting in the back area with a decent sized group. I showed up with 10 people and with 6 more on the way to meet me. The hostess for the night was completely amazing. She offered to split our group and knowing this was a special night she made sure all my friends knew where I was seated so I could greet them when they came in. I had 16 people in my party and I was able to mingle and catch up with everyone. The hostess came back to make sure my whole party was seated and asked before she removed one of the seating stools from one of the tables that wasn't being used. Then made sure there wasn't anything else I needed. She was completely friendly, accommodating and professional. The waitress for our table was amazing at describing drinks for the newbies and recommending drinks for the ones that had been here before. SUPERB SERVICE.Everyone left thoroughly impressed with the atmosphere, service and quality of drinks/food. I made sure to thank the hostess of the end of the night for the wonderful experience (I wish I remembered her name!). I was one happy birthday girl. Thank you Violet Hour.
