Call me a sucker for wine and cheese... I find myself longing for Bin 36 every time I am in Chicago. This is my reprieve from all the sports watching drunken boys and girls in all the surround bars. I love coming here alone or with a close friend... as they don't bump up their music and the lighting is good enough to indulge in a good book. Reasons why I come: - Cheese flights: anything you want really. Personally I prefer the Goat, Sheep, Cow and Buffalo combo. Lightly delicious! - Wine flights: I always discover something new here. This is where I actually want to venture out of my comfort zone of bodily reds - Farm Fresh Salad: just the right touch of balsamic, citrus, creamy and nuttinesssss Needless to say, this place will stay my little get away.
