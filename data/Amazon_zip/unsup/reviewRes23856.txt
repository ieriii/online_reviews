Oatmeal shakes are great! (I had no idea.) Unlike a lot of eateries in the Bucktown/Wicker Park area Irazu knows itself (and knows what NOT to do). It's completely unpretentious and honest. Good food, family atmosphere, friendly sevice. There's nothing lacking.  Great prices, too. I'd rather eat at Irazu than anywhere else in the area. I've been there about 5 times and each visit is just as good as the last. I haven't yet met a menu item that wasn't great.   For what it is - it's as good as it gets.
