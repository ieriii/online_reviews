XOCO was definitely a highlight during our visit to Chicago. what we had: Tuesday special of carnitas tortas a bowl of pozole an order of the churros and a hot chocolate this makes a perfect meal in my eyes. so much flavor in every dish, it makes me happy reliving it in this review. the Carnitas torta was phenomenal, the meat was moist and tender. it was served in a toasted loaf with guacamole, black beans, red onions and pickled chiles . the chiles had a nice kick to them that had me reach for my water cup a few times. the pozole was a hearty soup. my first time having this dish and i wouldn't mind having it again! get the Churros, with or without the chocolate dipping sauce, they were delicious. not overly sweet, it was a tasty pastry. the classic hot chocolate was thick, not too sweet, and was a perfect way to end the meal.
