So I'm big on communal situations but not shabby! I actually had a great time getting our dishes confused with our neighbors & sparking conversation with cute boys! lol I had a blast with my 6 girls...lots of beer & laughter! The food not bad either...fresh, unique & damn tasty! My fav...the fried clams & tomatoes. Chicken & fries... wonderful....juicy & seasoned to perfection! Mussels....yum! Great desserts...we had them all! lol The best was the bread pudding! Good job & well done for a total man cave! lol
