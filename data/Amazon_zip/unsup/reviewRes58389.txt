We had a nice dinner at Fogo de Chao. The food and service were very good. Since we're not particularly big eaters, Brazilian steakhouses have never really been our thing and this one is no different. For people who like to eat lots of meat, this is a very good choice. The only real caution I would offer to people assuming that they know what they're getting into with a big bill in exchange for lots of quality meat is that it's not a particularly downtown Chicago kind of restaurant. If you're looking for something that will remind you you're in Chicago, this probably isn't it.
