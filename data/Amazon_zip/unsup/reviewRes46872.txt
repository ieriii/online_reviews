We walked in and surprisingly there are plenty of open tables. I was really hoping to get the croque madam but their menu is not as extensive as the one in Clark. I did notice that their bloody mary was more on the smaller side but not complaining. One cool thing about this place is they are apparently the first in the country to be certified for organic rooftop farm =) This restaurant is pretty much earth friendly. One last thing to add they have planted well over 5,000 trees whenever you drink "TreeTini" --organically produced vodka! *thought that was really cool* I know too much fun facts about this restaurant but I have to come back here at night and see how it is I know they have some type of events going on. One last thing to add is they have their own parking lot!
