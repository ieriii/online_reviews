Got last minute reservations for my mother's birthday and it was better than expected! Sure, there were good reviews on Yelp but you never know until you try it out for yourself. We had a table for 8 and it was a little cramped and stuffy but it was more cozy living room than hot sweatshop. Anyways, we started off with warm, homemade, crusty bread. We are a carb-loving family so that was very much appreciated. For appetizers, we ordered the fried calamari, mussels in red sauce, and avocado bruschetta. Everything was made well. The calamari was lightly breaded, not oily, and perfectly crunchy. The mussels were fresh and flavorful. Although the avocado bruschetta was not tasty or interesting, the avocado was very fresh.We all loved our entrees. The white clam sauce linguine was a little on the salty side but the homemade pastas were great! They lacked a little texture (boiled too long), but the flavor was great. I also got to try the black cod, milk and honey ribs, lobster ravioli, and some scallop pasta dish. Everything was made nicely and fresh, fresh! The fish was melt in your mouth good!Since it was my mother's birthday, they gave us a nice piece of tiramisu with candle even though we were all so full from the meal! The waiter was attentive the whole time and the atmosphere was nice. Seemed like everyone enjoyed their dinner so we will be back. Added plus? The prices are reasonable!
