Nothing like pancakes covered with bananas, chocolate chips, and white chocolate syrup for breakfast!! The Bongo Room is truly the best place to go if you want dessert for breakfast or if you're looking for somewhere fun to take guests. The ONLY downside to this place is that there's nowhere for people to wait for their table, so they wait at the front and the back crowding the aisle and staring at you as you eat. The other "downside" is that there's so many amazing sounding breakfast meals that it takes a half hour to decide what you want.  I highly recommend sharing meals - get one "traditional" salty meal of eggs and another dessert pancake breakfast and get a taste of both!
