My review deals only with the restaurant in the hotel. I stopped here with a friend who wanted to visit the hotel that sponsors Oprah. The restaurant was quite attractive, informal but with an upscale atmosphere. The menu selection was good but I expected more from such a supposedly outstanding Hotel and restaurant. The dessert selection, my highest interest, was also lacking in variety. No doubt it was good. But it wasn't that creative and not one of my "favorite things". The service was great, the staff pleasant and the views from the windows were great. It was a good time. I'm not sure Oprah, given her status, would dine here. But she probably thought it good enough for her audience. :-)
