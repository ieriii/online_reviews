We came twice for the churros, YUM!!! We came early in the morning and again late in the afternoon.  Because of this we missed the crazy long lines. We also sampled the chicken, mushroom empanadas: AMAZING! I wish they would've been open on Sunday so we could've tried their breakfast menu. It looked great. I would eat here again and endure a long line to eat here. Try the churros, they are delicious.
