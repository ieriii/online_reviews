I never leave disappointed! All you need to know is below: 1.) They are very vegetarian-friendly. There are wonderful choices whether you eat meat or not, and both my husband (the meat-eater) & I have always been very happy with everything we've tried. Personal (veg) faves include the zucchini plate & dolmeh fehfel (which the husband also loved). 2.) The complimentary feta is amazing. 3.) The dill rice is absolutely phenomenal, and I could eat a bucket of it all by itself. 4.) The service it attentive & unobtrusive. 5.) The ambiance is there. It isn't super lavish, it's just a nice place to go to dinner. 6.) Take-out is a great option. I swear they give you twice the rice they do when you dine in (not that it's a stingy amount), which is great because I love it, but bad because my backside is proof it doesn't go to waste. 7.) Reasonable prices. 8.) Full bar.
