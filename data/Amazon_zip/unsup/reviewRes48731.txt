I really enjoyed the mussels! It's a fair portion worth $18, and the broth is extremely memorable. The mussels are served with a terrific crusty bread, perfect for soaking up the broth. Flavor-wise: buttery, lightly musky, with the right amount of chewiness. There were 3 unopened mussels in the batch. I come from the old-school of thought, that says all unopened clams or mussels should be removed before serving - The Publican does not. We will agree to disagree. After reading reviews here, I tried the Spicy Pork Rinds. They were OK, though I'm not the best person to judge spicy food because I prefer extra-spicy heat. The rinds have very little heat. Other things I enjoyed: Frites (with an awesome mayo for dipping), brussel sprouts (sweet, not bitter), a simple salad (LOVED the dressing), and Bollito misto (cotechino sausage, smoked turkey & pork shoulder stew). I shared all of these things with one other person, and we had too much food. In retrospect, we wished we held off on the Bollito misto until next time. For dessert I enjoyed the blood orange pu' ehr (tea). Loved the brown sugar cubes on the side. I'm craving that tea today. Mmmm... Many other servers were assisting our main server, so there is no lack of assistance. Everyone was efficient and personable, though our main server seemed a bit off. He mistakenly gave us something we did not order, and forgot to serve our friends something they definitely ordered. It is unfortunate, but these things happen on busy Saturday evenings. Be prepared for it if you go.
