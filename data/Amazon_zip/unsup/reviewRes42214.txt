I was really disappointed with this entire experience. My friend and I ordered the 16" pan pizza, and since I'm on a mission to taste every deep dish/stuffed pizza in the city, I ordered a single slice of mushroom/spinach deep dish to try. I do enjoy the fact that they deliver single slices. Why only 2 stars? 3 stars for the mediocre pizza. The quality and taste just weren't there Minus 1 star for taking 2 hours to deliver...Seriously? Two hours?
