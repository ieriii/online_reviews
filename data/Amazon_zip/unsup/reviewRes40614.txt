Disappointment is the name of the game folks. This place has been trumped up by most everyone as the bees' knees, and since it's my neighborhood, I believed the hype. The menu is very adventurous, don't get me wrong, but the bouillabaisse I had was very bland. I didn't ding the place on serving sizes, but do go with a fat wallet or un-hungry. Come to think of it, the best thing I tasted that evening (I had snippets of food from my friends' microscopic plates of scallops) was the couscous muse (I hope they add that to the menu). Besides the food, I had a small issue with the service. 1) We waited 30-40 minutes for our food; mistakes happen, but a little communication between the staff and the diner would've saved the day on this one. 2) To make up for the wait, we were served complimentary whiskey after our meal; besides the fact that two of our party hadn't ordered drinks (one person in our party doesn't drink and the other was staying away from alcohol for personal reasons), how on Earth does whiskey satiate a hungry belly?! Despite all this, I still give the wait staff (that includes you water guys) their propers; their efforts to make the experience bearable were remarkable.
