I was at this hotel for a conference and I wasn't very impressed. The lobby was very nice and the view from our room of the river was great, but the room itself was not impressive. The bathroom in particular needed an update. It wasn't dirty, but it didn't match what we paid for it. Overall, not a good value and I wouldn't stay here again if it wasn't so convenient for the conference.
