I have no issue waiting over an hour for a derishuz meal - but my parents do. Good thing they're very good natured (& that there were 3 very rowdy and slightly tipsy Giants fans providing entertainment behind us!). We patiently waited just under an hour in the 16 degree Chicago weather for some famous Hot Doug's! (We did get here smack in the middle of lunch time so try to get here a little early. Coming right before they close doesn't seem like a good idea bc the line will just build up). Their seating system actually makes a LOT of sense. You can't go in and reserve a table before you order. Miraculously the minute after you order with Doug (he's friggen awesomesauce btdubs), a table will open up for you! Mind blown. We ordered 3 items off the special menu & a Chicago dog. Got the foie gras duck sausage (obvs), the pesto sun dried tomato pork sausage, and then one who's name escapes me. We also had an order of duck fat fries (only available on Fri & Sat). TBH I don't exactly recall what anything tastes like because I was legit ravenous after my long trek over here from NYC, but I do recall being pleasantly happy afterwards :) P.S. Agua is freeeee!
