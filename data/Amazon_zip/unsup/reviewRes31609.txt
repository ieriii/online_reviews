I really wanted to give this place five stars . . . and I promise I will be back to try more items on the menu (anyplace where I can order ANYTHING on the menu is A-OK by me!) but here are my gripes: Food seemed undercooked. I had the enchiladas and the tortillas were too tough and leathery . . . being from Texas I am something of a Mexican food snob . . . so the idea of crisp tortillas in an enchilada dish is like sacrilege. The tortilla is supposed to be the mushiest part! The refried black beans were a treat (really hard to find for some reason) but a bit spicy and dry for my tastes. My friends complained about the sweet potato fries . . . again we were all so excited by the menu items but a little disappointed by the execution/flavor/taste/texture. Kudos on the Santa Fe salad and mango margaritas (more like mango/tequila smoothie but I'm not going to hate on real fruit chunks in any blended drink) . . . also my carrot cake was divine . . . I had a bite of the jerk chicken sandwich which was also amazing. Again, we will be back, very soon!
