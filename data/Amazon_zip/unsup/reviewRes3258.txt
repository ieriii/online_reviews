i'm a lover of Chicken Wings and decided after reading reviews of crisp that i'd finally give it a try. I am SOOOO glad i did. Had 5 jumbo Seoul Sassy wings and let me say. These were the best wings that i've ever had!! I've been dreaming about them ever since. next time, i'll skip the fries and get 10 wings and also will try the Crisp BBQ sauce. if they are as good as the Seoul Sassy, i'm hooked on this place!!
