My girlfriend took me here for my birthday. She knew they combined many of my favorite things ... interesting burgers and other entrees, craft beers, and a large whiskey list. We were slightly skeptical going in dressed a little on the nice side, especially since we are totally not hipsters, but we found that we were dressed at the upper end of fashion of the clientele without being overdressed. The waitress was friendly and very helpful in selecting dishes and made the whole experience go off very smoothly. We started with the bacon fat popcorn appetizer with parmesan and sage ... OMG!! ... it was sinfully outstanding. One critique - I wished there was more of the fried sage mixed through the popcorn, but crumbling it myself did the job. My dinner was their pork chop served with corn cakes, grilled peaches and collards ... again, OMG ... the pork was cooked perfectly and the flavor combination of sweet, tangy and savory was very well balanced. My girlfriend got the duck confit salad with spinach, frisee, mandarin slices and goat cheese ... do I need to keep repeating OMG? ... the confit was reason enough to come back here in the future, and the rest of the plate an intelligent mix of crunchy and creamy goodness. Now ... the beers ... I was torn between the Eugene Porter since that's my typical go-to beer style, and the Pablo Picasso Belgian-style dark ale. The lady went for the porter, which I tried and was outstanding. However I went out on a limb and tried the Belgian dark ale and ended up having to have two because it was so good!! They age it in oak Cab Sauv barrels with sour cherries ... seriously?! ... the flavor of the ale itself is still at the forefront, but the back notes of wine and lingering flavor of cherry was surprisingly delectable. I would probably order this by the schooner if they permitted it, alas it only comes in 8oz goblets. All around ... a surprising gem of a food find and a definite return destination even if only for a tasty beverage.
