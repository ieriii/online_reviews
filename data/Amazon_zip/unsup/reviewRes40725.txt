I've been going here for quite some time, just have not had a chance to write a review. Used to love this place and would have given it 4 stars. BUT on my most recent visit a few things changed that COMPLETELY changed my dining experience: 1. The salsa (cut up tomatos in sauce and onions, cilantro, etc) that used to come out with the chips is no longer free, they charge $2!!!! So now they give you some chips, the green and dark sauce, no salsa. WTH are you supposed to do without any salsa? What is the point of giving the chips? 2. The prices. Everything went up, for example, the torta was 3.35 before, now 4 I'm just super bummed that a place I used to love so much changed these things, ESPECIALLY the salsa. It threw my whole meal off. I don't know if I'l be coming back here.
