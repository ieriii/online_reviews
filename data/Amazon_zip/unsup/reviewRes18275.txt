Once you walk in to this cozy restaurant, the smell of garlicky goodness is overwhelming. Vampires, first daters and garlic haters stay away! Caro Mio has never sent me home disappointed. The menu selection is fantastic, but I have to say, I keep coming back for the Gorgonzola risotto. It is rich & creamy and excellent with chicken added. The portion is large enough for 3 meals. A server once energetically suggested a pumpkin risotto that wasn't on the menu and it was just as tasty. The kitchen is adaptable to any taste buds. The fried calamari is some of the best I've had, but the fresh calamari salad is outstanding. It is enormous, so share with your friends. The balsamic dressing is very flavorful and complements the ingredients well. The service isn't especially quick, but they make up for it in personality. Bring more wine than you expect to drink as you might have to wait for your meal. If you are empty handed, there is a deli across the street that sells bottles of wine and a liquor store about 3 blocks away. No corkage fee! The prices can be a little higher than comparable restaurants, but keep in mind that the potions are very generous. Enjoy your time at Caro Mio and bring some breath mints!
