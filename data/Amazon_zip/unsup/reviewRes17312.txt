I've been looking for quality Indian food since I moved from Pittsburgh last year and at last, I found it. I've only been here once and tried the lunch buffet. You can't go wrong with the buffet. The quality and flavors were spot on. I'm looking forward to ordering off their menu next time I go. The servers were prompt and the atmosphere is bright and vivant. Overall, my experience was fabulous.
