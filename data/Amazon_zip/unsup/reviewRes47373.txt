Do the members of korn own this bar? are you kidding me!!?? We seriously heard 3 tool songs, korn, and marilyn manson. Who opens a bar in a tuff puerto rican neighborhood which also happens to be littered with hipsters....and molds the bar after the 1996 family values tour. Did fred durst design the menu.Btw My balsamic dressing looked like chocolate pudding i swear to god, and isnt the decedent meat angle a little played out by now??!?!The vegetarian options blew ass.....which i understand its a burger joint, but have a little class and open a place like celtic crown or map room or something like that. Anyone who thinks the music here rocks is a poser, and the only person who would be satisfied by the meal just stepped off a plane from a vacation at a 3rd world country. Never goin back, unless its a goin out of business party!
