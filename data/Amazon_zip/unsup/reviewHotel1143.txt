The Fairmont is a very nice hotel. The decor of the lobby gives it a romantic sexy vibe. The only problem with the lobby is that the Eno wine bar is located smack dab in the middle of it. Therefore the lobby area is actually pretty small. Lovely, but small. My sister ate at Aria and really enjoyed her meal. She especially liked the ambiance.  The rooms are spacious and luxurious. The large flat screen tv was a nice surprise. The beds were comfortable and the decor was lovely. The room featured a coffee pot which came in handy after walking around in the cold on Michigan Ave. The rooms were plush. I generally couldn't hear people in the rooms next to us except when they were blow drying their hair. The bathrooms were quite large. The separate shower and tub was a nice surprise. The rain head shower was nice, but I found that it lacked good water pressure. All of the fixtures in the bathroom were quite nice.  While the hotel was nice I'm not sure if I would stay here again. I might try finding a hotel closer to Michigan Ave. While this isn't far from Michigan Ave it isn't exactly as convenient some other hotels.
