Here's my issue with Sunda. I don't own a pair of stripper heels - so apparently i don't a) fit in and b) look like the type of person the hostess wants to waste her breath on. The food.... is... eh.... we had bao buns, which were fine (Chef Takashi's are MUCH better), the caterpillar roll which was nothing to write home about and i could have gotten elsewhere for $10 cheaper, and lo mein which tasted like old fryer grease. I will say the spicy tuna roll was spectacular. But certainly not worth waiting 2hrs on a set of steps (because there was no where else to wait). The scene is just... not... chicago. New York, sure. But I don't live in New York for a reason. This place wasn't for us and is NOT worth the money.
