I really like Cafe 28, and have been there multiple times over the past couple years. I went there only once for brunch and found it pretty dull, with a pretty high price-tag for what we received. Other than that, I mostly go there for dinner, mainly during the week and not on the weekends. I love their outdoor patio, and although our server was overwhelmed when we went there recently and we were ignored for multiple 15 - 25 minute stretches on end (when we needed to order something), the food makes up for that inconsistency. The Bistec a la Cubana with the plantains is unbelievable and full of flavor, and I admittedly barely ever move away from that dish when I go there. We had the "Taste of Cuba" when we went there recently, a mix of Croquetas, Empanadas, and Mariquitas - heaven on a plate. We stuffed our faces with the platter in 2 seconds. The mojitos here have always been strong and wonderful and, did I say strong?!
