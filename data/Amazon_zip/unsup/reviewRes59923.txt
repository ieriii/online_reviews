This is by far one of the best establishments I've been to since I came to the city. I initially came inside in search of coffee and wi-fi, but within no time have become a regular of not only their coffee, but their amazing baked goods. And even outside of the great tasting foods and beverages, the staff is unlike any other. Not only are they EXTREMELY accommodating and pleasant to deal with, but they don't judge me when I come in hungover on a weekday. On the contrary, they offer anecdotes and quite possibly one of the best hang over cures I've ever had--their patented cinnamon roll. I love this place.
