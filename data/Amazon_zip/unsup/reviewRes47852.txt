Fantastic brunch!!! Brought a large group of my girlfriends in here Sunday and had an amazing brunch. The staff was super friendly. The food was AMAZING. Crab cake eggs benedict- OK! Maple and cajun bacon- to die! The entire buffet table selection was heavenly. The cinnamon rolls were delicious. No complaints!! oh and did I mention $3 mimosas!! Great deal and great ambiance. We will be repeat brunchers.
