I stayed at this place (Nov. 10-13) and I initially had to change rooms twice before finally settling on the last room. The first two only provided heating and the wireless internet did not work at all, both located in their main building. The receptionist said she would try and reset the router the first couple of times, but that never worked and I also noticed that the refrigerator did not work in the second room. The room I did stay in was located in a separate bldg across the way overlooking the pool, which was emptied, full of leaves and I'm assuming because it was off-season and temperatures were close to freezing at night. The room wasn't as dated as the rooms in the main building, but the exterior walls were a bit worn and a chipped. With that said, I decided to give it a try anyways because the room had wireless internet that worked, the fridge worked and it had both a.c. and heating available. I should point out, that the refrigerator in the room worked well for beverages only. The walls were extremely thin, but I did not notice that until my 2nd night there, since it was practically empty when I initially arrived here, but you will hear door slams from the other rooms next door if it is fully booked. On the plus side: Access to the #6 bus into downtown Chicago was easily accessible (about 3 blocks away).  Overall, I received a fair rate on Priceline and would only recommend staying here if you are a deep sleeper, on a budget and don't need a fast internet connection(as I mentioned, it's spotty). FYI, There is however a small computer room with a printer in the lobby guests can use.
