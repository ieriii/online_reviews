I had to change from a 4 star to a 5 star review. The food continues to be excellent. They keep producing new, interesting and good quality beers. The bartenders are super friendly and knowledgeable.  They have finished the upstairs lounge and it is now open on weekends and for special events. Same food and drinks available up there. This is my favorite spot in the neighborhood and on my top 5 list in the city.
