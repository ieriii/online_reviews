I think Noon O Kabab is a tad overrated--at least in my experience so far. The kababs I have ordered came with dry meat and little of it, and way, way, way too much parsley (I'm guessing it's parsley; if it's not, I'm an idiot, but there's still way too much of whatever it is). The Caspian eggplant appetizer is really delicious. I could eat it with a spoon, or just make a meal out of it with some pita. All this said, the owner is a really genuinely nice person. On my first visit, he hooked my wife and me up with extra hummus, several pitas, and tea at no extra charge. All because we said we were new to the neighborhood! The menu is huge, so I'll definitely be back to try other things and perhaps (I hope) revise my review and add a star.
