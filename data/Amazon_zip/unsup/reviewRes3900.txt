Crisp is right across the street from Soup Box which in the summer makes the perfect combo - grab some food at Crisp and then pick up an icy fruit at Soup Box for dessert. Korean food isn't usually something I'm on the look out for but something about Crisp pulled me in. The place was pretty busy when I walked in and I took that as a good sign. I ordered the original buddha bowl. You can add meat or tofu for an extra $1. I decide to skip it. Also wanting to the try the kimchi so I got a side of it. The buddha bowl, kimchi and water came out to $14. Seemed a tad on the high side but then I saw the amount of food that came out it was a deal. The bowls are huge! And the side of kimchi is also big, it was way more kimchi then I wanted, even if it was really good. The buddha bowl was a solid choice and I'm glad I shared it with my fiance since it was a lot of food. Crisp is a pretty good choice for some eats and I can seen myself hitting it up again soon.
