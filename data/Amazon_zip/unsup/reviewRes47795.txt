I like the way zed went with their venue but to be honest I wasn't as impressed as I thought I would be. Maybe it was all the build up but to be frank, when I am paying a set price for unlimited food, it usually means that I'm going to overwhelmed by it. Instead I found myself constantly looking around for someone to bring the next dish to try. Maybe i'm in the minority but when I pay the good chunk of change that Zed is, I don't want to have to literally be hunting down my food.  However, once the food was located and subsequently ingested, it was pretty darn good. Nothing seemed to be overdone and the servers were great at explaining each new thing that came to the table. This place is somewhere I would come with a group to have fun, and definitely when it's warmer I'd love to try their roof deck. All in all - I think I'm going to have to repeat here to know exactly how I feel...
