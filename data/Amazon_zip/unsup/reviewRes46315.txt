This is a great place to go if shopping on the mag mile and need to eat. Usually they seat fast when I go there and the food is reasonably priced for the mile. If you have a sweet tooth, order the chocolate molten cake before you order your meal because it takes 20-30min to make. You'll be craving it for a few days afterword, so expect withdrawals.
