Sushi X is a really good place to order from if you're craving basic maki and nothing else and you're too lazy to leave you house. No frills and pretty fast delivery, I just wish they had some sashimi selections. Unfortunately for them Naniwa delivers to most of their coverage area and is leaps and bounds ahead in quality... although quite a bit more expensive.
