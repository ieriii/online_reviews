Stayed at this hotel for 3 nights. It was a very nice modern hotel and the employees were nice. Overall, I was not impressed with this hotel. The standard room was one of the smallest rooms I have stayed in. They do not have mini refrigerator in the standard room, which would have been quite useful to bring home leftovers. We had to waste food because there was not a place to store the food. Also the maid service was not great. They knocked on our door at 8:30am one morning, which was a little too early after a night of going out. After using the washcloths, we were instructed to leave it on the floor if we wanted a new one for the next day. After that was done, they failed to pick them. They also did not replace the soap as well. Not a place I would return to in the future
