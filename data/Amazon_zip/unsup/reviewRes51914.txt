My bad. I went against my better judgment because it's a Chicago staple. 45 minutes in line outside, another hour after ordered for our pizza to arrive. The tomato sauce has no taste, soooo bland, the crust is like stale cornbread, and the beer selection is meh to say the least. There are plenty of other pizza places in Chicago, and you're not going to wait just top get in. Look elsewhere.
