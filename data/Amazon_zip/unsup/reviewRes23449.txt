7 out of 7 enjoyed our meals at Irazu! Their guacamole and salsas were nice, but where they really shine is their dinner plates. I wound up getting the Steak and Onions which came with fried plaintains with a spoonful of minced, sauteed garlic, a little mixed salad and costa rican rice (white rice, spices, black beans). It was soooooo delicious and flavorful. A little too much oil and a little too much salt is what holds back Irazu from a 5-star review. I'm for sure coming here again, though!
