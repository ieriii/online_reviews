I work steps away from Indie and it's always my first choice for lunch! I love the spring rolls, crab rangoon, miso soup, fried rice, seaweed salad... The Santa Fe roll is my favorite of the less expensive sushi items. The lunch specials are great and reasonably priced. The staff is wonderful and sweet. They remember me by name and there's never a wait. I have yet to actually dine-in yet, but I'm looking forward to sipping drinks and eating some of my favorite food among the fabulous artwork and relaxed atmosphere of the place. Love it!
