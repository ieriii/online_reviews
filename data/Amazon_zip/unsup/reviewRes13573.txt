This place was so good I went here twice in one night. Seriously. We stopped by to grab beer before a show at the Congress Theater. Four delicious craft brews and some bacon fat popcorn later we had to leave - but we vowed to return. You can't get enough bacon fat popcorn - it's sprinkled with hearty chunks of smoky bacon and slices of Parmesan shaved so thin you can see through them. I enjoyed two of their palest ales (Anti Hero IPA and the Triple Fist - both hop-licious) and the wifey loved the Bottom Up Belgian Wit wheat beer.  On our second trip of the night we sat down to eat dinner. The place was still packed at 10:30 PM (there was a 2 hour wait when we came in for a drink earlier), but we got a two-top pretty quickly. We started round two with the chicken wings which were perfect (a little spicy, but good spicy) and come with some delicious blue cheese potato salad.  Next up were the main courses: the Chorizo (a mexican style thin crust pizza) and the Hombre burger. This was by far the best "bar" food I have ever had. The burger had a giant whole smoked poblamo pepper that was unbelievable. The pizza was light but perfect with chunks of mango and Chihuahua cheese sprinkled on top.  The place is comfortable, modern, and decorated with some interesting anti-war art - all centered around a huge bar offering RevBrew as well several guest beers on tap and bottled. Great atmosphere, great food, and great beer - you really can't go wrong here.
