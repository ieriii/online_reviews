Dollars-per-deliciousness, Wildfire is rather difficult to beat in the Chicago steakhouse arena. Most others are twice as expensive, but are they really two times as good? I think it's a safe "no" to that question. I'd put Wildfire on the same page as Morton's and Gibson's; both of which are substantially more expensive (and pretentious, to boot). A steak here won't change your life, but it will leave you (and your wallet) satisfied.
