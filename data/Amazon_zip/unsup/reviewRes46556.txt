This is my all-time favorite Lettuce Entertain You restaurant and probably my all-time favorite restaurant period if I ignore my commitment phobia. I am biased, being a Lettuce Entertain You kid, but I'm cool with that. It was the first restaurant LEYE ever opened and has almost closed at least twice, but the legions of screaming fans, threats of flooding due to too many tears shed, and the soft spot that Rich Melman has in his heart for his first creation, has, thankfully, kept Grunts open. The food is the traditional American burgers and sandwiches, which come with thick cut chips instead of fries, and which are delicious. Grunt's' real claim to fame though, are the malts and shakes, and the salad bar. If you're a chocolate malt person, Grunt's is the place to be. The best part is they give you the metal cup to re-fill your glass. The Grunt's salad bar is unrivaled in, I'm pretty sure, any dimension, and was, I've been told, the first salad bar ever in Chicago. It is always brimming with fresh fruit and vegetables and several awesome salad dressings, and I always hit it up when I'm at the restaurant even though I know it will cause me to be forced to bring half my giant burger home. What else makes Grunt's so great? It being a creation of and for the children of the sixties. There's always great 60s and 70s rock playing (some of the dishes are named after 60s icons, too), and tie-dye shirts, psychedelic art, and pictures of all the waitresses that have worked there cover the walls. Some people aren't into the time-warp feel, but they can go to Panera. Give me my quirky hippie burger joint any day. Perfect place to stop for lunch or dinner after a day at Lincoln Park Zoo.
