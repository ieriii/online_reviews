This place has so many beers! Over 150! And a good amount of Belgian beers (my favorite). They have a double sided, laminated beer menu that seems to go on forever! If you feel lost on what to order, you might try asking the waitress for a suggestion. Hopleaf is darkly lit with wooden tables and candles. They have a large back room with high ceilings and exposed brick. Overall Hopleaf has a great atmosphere and a lot of great beers. Also check out their tasty Belgian style pub eats.
