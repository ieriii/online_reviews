This place is right down the street from my friend's place but it looks really tool-y from the outside so we waited a while to check it out. I've been there twice now, it's always super loud. It was pretty packed on a Saturday night but the service was still decent. The time we eat it was completely dead, but they still had concert DVDs blasting. It's hard to have a conversation. The food is all named really stupid things and it wasn't attention grabbing. I had a chicken sandwich with avocado, but the best part of the sandwich was the bun, which was really good. The mac and cheese was nothing special and the fries weren't salted right. The prices are low and they give you pretzels and mustard as the table snack. It's a decent place but I'm not sure I would come if it required any effort at all.
