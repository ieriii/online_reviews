Went there on my birthday last year. Amazing experience....and the only reason why it is getting a 4 star instead of 5 is because it is currently not one of my top 3 restaurants. The presentation was amazing and the food was refreshing, innovating and extravagant. The wine pairing was generous and diverse. But some of the dishes's taste did not match how it looks, I remember one dish being extremely salty and it numbed my taste bud. but other than that, I love everything about the place and can't wait to go back again!
