Stopped in at around 10:40pm on a Sunday night after hitting a couple of bars with some friends to meet a friend. If you're still with me, here's my review. Kitchen closes at 11pm so we quickly ordered our pizza and prayed the cooks werent going to add an extra topping of spit. The waiter was still pretty nice about this as well. We got the large bbq chicken pizza with onions which was a great size for 4 people. Its pretty damn big in size and the amount of toppings placed on it was sufficient. It was also ~$20 which the 4 of us didnt mind paying for what we got. The place looks like a big bar ski lodge that serves pizza. There are these huge wood rafters in the cieling and skylights (I guess this reminds me of being in a ski lodge). Very large place I'd say. They've got tables, booths, bar seats, everything. They also brew their own beer according to the official spoken word of Mike F. I was fortunate enough to have a "Golden Arm" pint on this night and would have another (not just if peer pressured, on my own accord!). I'm interested in trying out some more of their beers and more of their interesting pizza selections.
