After reading the reviews, maybe my expectations were too high. What I found was as a vegetarian, there was pretty much no options on the menu. They made us some special enchilada item and we were told that the only vegetarian option was the mole sauce. I HATE mole sauce. For my friend and I, we totally did not think it was worth the high price with the limited options. It's not like there are only 2 vegetarians out in a city like Chicago. Wake up and smell the veggies!!
