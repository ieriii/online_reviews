Oh Mastro's... If the "established" men with jaw-drop outside the door, was an indication of what was to come, we would have ran as fast as we could in our 4 inch heels! All was ignored and we continued in. Girls night out for Cappuccino and butter cake, I am officially a diabetic now. The mix of cake and the fourty-somethings looking for a night cap, I had my fill of sweet-and-sour. The atmosphere is fantastic as long as you can get past the pick-up lines; if you have chosen the wrong time of night to saunter in. The bar is exquisitely done in an upscale manner, and previous experiences were not like this. The patrons are definitely not your run-of-the-mill type, there is a presence of class in this establishment... unless you arrive late:) Check it out, bring your insulin and your armour.
