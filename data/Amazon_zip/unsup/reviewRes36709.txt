I used to adore Indie, but my visits as of late have been subpar. My first issue is the lack of accuracy when ordering take out. They used to carry the best green tea ice cream in the city and I used to stop in and grab it after work. One time I was given green tea mochi instead of ice cream and didn't know it until I got home. When I called the restaurant to clarify and see why this happened the person I spoke with was argumentative and offered no recourse for the mistake. I hung up the phone bewildered. They called me back about 5 minuted later and explained that on my next visit they would include an order of green tea ICE CREAM at no charge. Next time I order I didn't even have to mention that this was on my account, they saw it and asked if I would like to redeem it on this order and I did. However when got home with my order it was not in the bag. Now, they carry a green tea ice cream that is sub par and not worth stopping in for. I also used to love that they were BYOB, now they have a corkage fee and we were charged $5 PER PERSON to open a bottle of wine on our last vist. The fee to open the wine was more than we paid for the bottle. Also, our food came out a such a rapid pace we only had time to enjoy one glass of wine with our meal before the check came. The whole experience felt rushed and unenjoyable. Part of the reason I loved going there so much was for the ambiance and the ability to enjoy a meal at your own pace. It feels as if they have so many people wanting to dine there and they don't quite know how to handle the volume. I think it will be awhile before I return to Indie, I'm going to have to look for a new Sushi place on the Northside.
