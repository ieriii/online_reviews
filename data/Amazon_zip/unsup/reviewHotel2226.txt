I stayed in this hotel for a week. I thought overall the hotel was good. I was irked that they have the balls to charge $12 PER COMPUTER, PER DAY for Internet. I consume lots of ice, and I was disappointed that the ice is only on the 7th floor. The room was a decent size, and they have a good plasma TV. Actually you should bring your media players because they have all kinds of connections including HDMI!!! Whoohoo! The place has a Starbucks in the building, and a nearby Walgreen's. You have to pay for the gym, but the pool/sauna is free. Not bad.
