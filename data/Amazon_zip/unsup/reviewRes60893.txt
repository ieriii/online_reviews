I first came to Zed 451 shortly after it had opened on a date. I loved the food then and I continue to love the food and service.What I particularly want to comment on is my experience of having my wedding and reception there. My husband and I were consistently impressed and happy to find that not only did Zed have wonderful food to serve our guests and a gorgeous event room for the wedding and reception to take place in, but also provided wonderful and thoughtful service. We felt like Sammy, the event coordinator, viewed our special day as being important to her and the staff. I can't say how much it meant to us to feel that the people we were working with cared that the event went off smoothly and nicely. Everyone at the wedding raved about the food, of course. The pricing for using the room for our event was more than fair and likely one of the best deals one can find in downtown Chicago for an event. We had a smaller wedding (about 50 people) and the space was perfect for this size, although it could fit more. I'm glad we can look back at our wedding and have such great memories about the people who helped us pull it off! I know a lot of people don't feel that way. Today was our one month anniversary and we went to Zed's for brunch. Imagine our surprise to have a couple of the staff recognize us and congratulate us. This further drove home our impression that the staff at Zed's cared about our special day and our business. Most people know the food is good at this restaurant, but to have amazing service on top of that, particularly around an event, is quite an accomplishment.
