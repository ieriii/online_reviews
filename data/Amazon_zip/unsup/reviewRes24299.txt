I haven't seen another place like this in all of Chicago! The menu is very unique, as is the decor, which makes it a great place to take someone who is visiting Chicago. I can usually find parking only a couple blocks away, or you can take the 92 bus. The girls who work there have always been very sweet and attentive, without being annoying. Yay from me!
