Giving this place 6 stars if I could. It takes fine dining to a new level by adding elements of theatre and wild creativity. We went two years ago and had something that sounded ridiculous(18 courses?) but it was just right. You're in master hands here - just trust them. Everything was delicious and the experience of anticipating all the strange and beautiful courses transported us. Last year we weren't able to get a reservation so we went to Charlie Trotters and were horribly disappointed. We booked our reservation for October on August and it was already filling up(I think they'd just started taking Oct reservations on Aug 1?) Get organized and get in here - you'll be glad that you did!
