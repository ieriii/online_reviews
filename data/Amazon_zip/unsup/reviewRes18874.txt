I discovered this place by watching Chicago's Best. My first time there, I was impressed with the interior space. They have a very nice bar area as well as seating area in the back. I enjoyed the massive beer selection as well as the interesting burger toppings. I was also equally impressed with the fresh french fries with your choice of oil. I asked for my burger medium which it came back more medium rare but it was still good. My second time there I ordered a burger medium and it came back cooked perfectly. Both the friends that I have taken there were equally impressed with the food. I like this place and it does beat most burger joints in the area. This is a place that I will definitely come back to when I am having a burger craving.
