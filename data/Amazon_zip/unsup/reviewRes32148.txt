Came to Demera with a group of six last night and enjoyed it, mostly. Seating for groups larger than six would be difficult, as this place is best for groups of 2-6 people. Feeling a touch of the flu I didn't want to stick my spongy Injera-hands into everyone's communal dishes, so I ordered my own dish of Ye-Dnichena Carrot Alicha, a potato-carrot dish with onions, ginger, garlic and turmeric. It was excellent, and came with a side of steamed spinach and yellow lentils. Unfortunately, it came out 5 minutes before my group's communal dishes! I'm not sure if they've heard of the rudeness of starting to eat before everyone has been served in American culture. Service here is done with a smile, but slightly off. My group raved about the family style messob platter. Specifically the Ye-Siba prime beef tibs and the Kik Alicha lentils. On a Thursday night Demera was out of my first choice of a Two Brothers beer that I ordered, and also out of my group's first choice of homemade honey wine. A few hiccups and a big hiccup about the bill leads me to recommend going to other BYOB Ethiopian restaurants nearby to keep your group costs down if the Honey Wine is going to flow! Still, the food was good and Demera is a good quaint pick for Ethiopian in Uptown.
