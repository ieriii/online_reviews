The owner of this establishment is crazy!!! I was dining there last night and watched him scream and swear at diners at the table next to mine. Evidently he felt it was too much work to split the bill and gave them a very hard time about it, even following them out side to continue his rant. Honestly I thought he was going to hit them, all over the very simple request to divide the bill. If I hadn't of witnessed it I would have never believed it Suffice it to say I will never return. The crepes were just ok, the service meh and the owner completely insane! Diners beware!!!
