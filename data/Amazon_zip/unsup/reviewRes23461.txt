Chef special dry chili chicken is the boooooooooooooooomb. Seriously. If you like spicy and you like chicken, this one's for you. Like nothing you've ever had before. This place is just great. I've been back many times. The mood is just right and the food is awesome. If you're in Chinatown, go there.
