Unrivaled beer selection, surprisingly awesome food. Service was a little hit or miss, but all was forgiven by the time we got our phenomenal Belgian beer-steamed mussels. Next was the charcuterie plate-- best rillettes I've had in a long time. My entree was lamb chops, cooked to perfection at a precise medium rare, with tender spring vegetables and a subtle sauce. I tried a few others at the table, including the brisket and mac and cheese-- they were all scrumptious. It's obvious that someone at this homey beer-centric hotspot cares deeply about food. Being from Madison, WI, we were tickled to see some of our region's organic fare touted on the menu. And the prices were fairly reasonable, especially for the Windy City. All in all, a great way to spend an evening in Chicago with friends. At some point during the meal, I was inspired to use my Yelp account for the first time as a reviewer solely to give this place a good review. So I did! though I see it hardly needs it.
