Compelled to write a review after my dinner there this past Sunday night. Couldn't decide where to go, ended up going here. Short walk from the California stop, seated promptly at a booth on the elevated right side (girlfriend and I). Definitely dig big wooden booths. Tried a gin cocktail, boozy and good. She is vegan so we had the Roasted Cauliflower Bruschetta which was awesome, always good to see veg options on the menu. I sampled 5 of their beers for $2 each which is very reasonable. Good beer, one of the stouts was the best. She had the Smoked/Grilled Tofu Sandwich which was "one of the best sandwiches she's had," and I had a big pizza with arugula on it for only $12. Great food, great atmosphere (maybe a little too dark), solid place. Bar area looked cool, other local beers on tap too.
