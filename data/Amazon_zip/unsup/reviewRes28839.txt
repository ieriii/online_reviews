I have been going to Pequod's regularly now for almost 13 years and have nothing but good things to say about their pizza. I'm not sure in all of that time I have even tried anything there BUT their pizza! The thin is always great and the deep dish is fantastic. I liked the place better before they remodeled (it had more personality) but it's still nice to eat there. Hands down still the best pizza I've had in Chicago.
