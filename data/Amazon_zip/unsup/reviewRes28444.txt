Hands down the best pizza in Chicago. Try a pan pizza with pepperoni and pineapple and add an order of jalapeo poppers. Their lunch special ($4.95 7" inch pan cheese plus single topping with a soda - Mon thru Fri 11 am to 3 pm) is one of the best deals in the city. Plus the logo is a whale with panties on it's head. What's not to love?
