This is the flagship Giordano's - one of the main competitors in the race for the title of the best Chicago deep dish pizza. Welps, I do have to say that the pizza here is really good - it's ginormous and super thick! Unlike your standard pizza, authentic deep dish comes stuffed with a generous amount of cheese, toppings of your choice, and is smothered with loads of tomato sauce on top. On its own, this place is great, but when you compare it to Lou Malnati's...the tomato sauce just doesn't stand up or taste nearly as fresh. Also, the crust is kind of TOO thick here. I couldn't even eat the ends of my slices because they were way too hard and crusty! We also got an authentic Italian salad, which was just okay here - it came with some garlic bread, but the bread lacked garlic flavor altogether (it still was decent and tasted buttery) and I personally didn't love the slimy little anchovies. Personally, I've even found a really awesome Chicago deep dish pizza in OC that I still liked better, but I still think this place is pretty good :)
