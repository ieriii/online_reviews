If only they'd work on delivering a hearty meal to the proletariat of Logan Square at a good price (instead of foodies from near the lake willing to pay a lot for hype), then this revolution would be complete! As it stands, sadly, I don't think this revolution deserves to be televised. I've been all up and down the menu trying this place multiple times trying to figure out what the hype is about. Every time I'd get in an argument about how this place was changing the culinary world in Logan Square for the better, I would rush back and try something else. And it was always the same mediocre result. Veggie chili? Good, but far better at Small Bar. Tempeh Reuben? Amazing idea, but flawed in its execution. The fake meat was kind of bland. Same with the Margherita Pizza. Nothing revolutionary here. Plus, until they recently replaced their Black Power Stout with a newly formulated Paddy Wagon Stout, there was nothing on the craft beer menu I truly loved either. And if I can't dance to the taste, it's not my revolution. Their desserts are the one thing worth getting out into the streets for. They serve huge slices of yummy, constantly rotating, cakes (Marie Antoinette might still have a head if the French people really did have this to eat). And ice creams that are also constantly changing. It's not on the menu, but if they have Bailey's Ice Cream on a certain day, get the Irish Car Bomb float! Now that's a general strike to the tastebuds! I really do want this place to succeed. Their mission really is true to their name and their branding. While they're not reactionary socialists or anything, they did host the Miguel del Valle election party, so they do work for change. And the fact that they're so vegetarian friendly makes my heart sing The Internationale! Not that I'd ever do that. Now that I'm looking for a government job in Washington D.C. and all.
