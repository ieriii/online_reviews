I wanted to try this place after going unconditionally to Giordano's for deep dish pizza but was really disappointed. The pizza is watery and really mushy - the toppings and the insides fall apart all over the pan once you cut out the first slice. Nothing actually stays on the breading, which was additionally very doughy.  I'll stick with Giordano's, which is actually just down the street, and probably never go back again.
