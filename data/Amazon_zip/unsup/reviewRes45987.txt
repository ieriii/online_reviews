Great food, great decor, great location, ok service. To celebrate a birthday, I took 12 people their for an early dinner on a Thursday night.  Thanks to manager, Michael Baer who worked with me to book a table for my group. We arrived and were seated immediately. Our waiter and his trainee were pleasant if not particularly friendly. Unfortunately, as they were serving our drinks, a third waiter bumped ours and the drinks spilled on two of our party. The trainee hid after that according to our waiter (??) and the bus person was slow to clean up the mess. After waiting & standing over 5 minutes, I had to get a dry chair from another table for myself. Eventually the manager came out and offered to pay for dry cleaning. The food was served and was delicious as always! Everyone was happy with their order. We finished with coffee, beignets (a must!) and warm chocolate chip cookies.  In all, we had a great time and the food was wonderful. I'll definitely go back whenever I'm in Chicago.
