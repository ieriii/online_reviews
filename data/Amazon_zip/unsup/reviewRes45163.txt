The food is bland. The cocktails were good - using different italian aperitifs and digestivos in an intersting way - but cocktails aren't dinner. Polenta was nothing but filler - not cheesy, buttery, salty, or even "corny" - just bland mass of mush. The stuffed fish - they shouldn't have bothered stuffing it. I don't know what else to say. If you try a lot of flavor and it doesn't work out, I will give you points for trying. Everything I ate needed more flavor.
