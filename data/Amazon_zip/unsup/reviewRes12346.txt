One of my favorite brunch spots (though the dinner is equally amazing). Cafe 28 has the best bloody mary that I have ever known. It's spicy and pretty (yes, pretty) and strong.  Every single time I go to brunch at Cafe 28, I say that I'm going to order something new, but usually order the Asparagus and serano benedict. It's that good. The pancakes are fluffy and delicious. You want the honey jalepeno pork chops and the lemon & ricotta pancakes and the crab cake benedict and much, much more.  So, like I said, I usually come here for the brunch; but dinner is also so good. Try it...for brunch and for dinner...and for lunch.
