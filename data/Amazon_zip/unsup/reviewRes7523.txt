Went here the other night with a friend. Definitely a nice little Italian place on the inside. I was a little disappointed with the menu. I had looked online at their website and it stated they had carpaccio though it was not on the menu there. So to remedy this immediately some alcohol was needed. I went with a Cabernet Sauvignon and it was great. I ordered the rack of lamb with smashed potatoes. Definitely was a good choice. By then end of it nothing was left, not even the bread on the table. The food was great. Still had hoped the carpaccio would have been available though, so I'll continue that quest somewhere else.
