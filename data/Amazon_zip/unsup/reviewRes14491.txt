i've been wanting to try this place for a long time. today was the day. and i was delighted on many levels. it is super friendly. the selections are vast and a little bit pricey (cafe marinao sells a superior cuban sammie for half the price i'm afraid). for $27 we got 2 small cafe de leches which were surprisingly awesome-the ropa vieja sammie-a little bland, but meat heavy, use the sauces on the table, the cubano sammie-most excellent, a guava & cream cheese empanada (!!! kind of like a gourmet pop-tart) & the chroizo empanada-delicious smoky spanish sausage with cheese & one tamal (on the dry side). they open at 8 & have interesting breakast sammie omelets . the coffee here is seriously outstanding. i will be return for the fruit shakes when the weather warms up. i would have given it 5 stars if not for the existence of cafe marianao, which is the same distance away from my home. i know it's not fair to compare, but i can't help it.  still, 90 miles is pretty darn good.
