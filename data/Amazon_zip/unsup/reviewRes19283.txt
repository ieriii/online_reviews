ok, here we go........ awesome lil hammies! solid ham, solid cheese, solid mustard- pretzel roll, enough said. Fried cheese curds. awesome app, find them in orange cheese, i know its only food color, but it makes a difference. breading awesome, i would still order them. Burgers- way above average, had the big texas and ole english or something- too many strong beers to remember- but both great!...with exception, had to order them- they were out of pretzel rolls (dont ask how the apps had them- guessing mini-rolls)- seriously, minus 1.5 stars. cant happen in a burger/ sandwhich place. beers great and great price. our server rocked. first person we saw, totally rude - almost ruined it for us.......i will find my way back.
