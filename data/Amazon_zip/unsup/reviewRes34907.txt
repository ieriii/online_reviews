Oh hey Sushi X. Heyyyy. I'm a huge fan of the food here (I do mostly take-out), especially the Honey roll and Godzilla roll. They're two of the most delicious food items I've ever eaten of any cuisine. Major love. I also enjoyed the Buddha roll and Alaska roll, though to a slightly smaller degree. Still fabulous, just not extraordinary like Honey and Godzilla. The restaurant does not have a lot of seating so you may want to plan ahead and shoot for a reservation. They also play anime movies on one the of the walls so dont be alarmed if you walk in and see a cartoon in your face. The staff have always been very friendly and I think the prices are about average for sushi in the city, though the quality and tastiness far exceed any other establishment. Even their to-go packaging is cute and durable.
