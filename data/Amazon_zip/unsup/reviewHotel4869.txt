I had the worst hotel experience ever in the Congress Plaza Hotel. Despite of all the inconvenience I experienced during my stay, including the strike was going on, the toilet was not working and there was no wireless internet access, I was not planning to write a yelp review until The Congress Plaza Hotel Security lied to me:11:45am on Dec 22, 2011, 45 minutes after we checked the hotel, my daughter found out she left her retainer on nightstand in the hotel room. I called the front desk and I was transferred to Hotel Security. The gentleman on the phone took down my information and asked me to call back one hour later. I called the Security at 12:45pm, the person on the phone told me that they could not find my daughter's retainer. I asked if housing keeping had cleaned the room, the person emphasized that the house keeping was in the room while the security checked out the retainer for me. The person even said that the security also checked house keeping's garbage bag to make sure no retainer was there.My daughter was very sure that she left her retainer in the hotel, so we decided to go back the hotel to check out the room ourselves (around 3:00pm). We found out the room was not even been cleaned yet, and surely my daughter's retainer was still on the nightstand.As a frequent traveler, I left stuffs in hotel many times. The hotel staff and the house keeping were always very helpful. I could not believe that the Congress Plaza Hotel could not hold up the basic hotel standard to help it's customers to locate stuff they left in their hotel room. This instance is a reflection of poor hotel management which leads bad customer experience.
