I wish we had pizza like this down south!! Before Chicago, pizza was just pizza...I would squeal with delight over Papa John's ultra-thin crust, mushroom....little did I know. Tsk tsk tsk. Pie Hole had to be replaced when I moved to the Blue Line, since they don't deliver. There are a few factors that make Piece I feel like besides the pizza. Dine-in & bar experience: Ultra crowded and some of the patrons are a little rude since the new age Wicker Park/Bucktown crowd frequents this place. I'm no hipster, and I guess you could call me a yuppie but people are a little snobby here. As for the actual restaurant, the service is what it is, and I've never had problem waiting for a table or a drink. The staff is always pleasant. The noise level is high...with all this, I prefer to eat my pizza at home. Delivery: Pizza is a little cold by the time it gets to me, but it does not take away from deliciousness. Piece Out: The wait is atrocious, so come ready to be patient or to have a couple of beers next door. I do this only so I can get one of those really cool pitchers of beer...and yes, to the guys, this would be ideal for that jug of spare change you probably have in your apartment. I am! Ok, so with a ton of reviews about this place, all I can say is the pizza is great. My staples are white pizza with spinach, mushroom (fresh!), sausage, and red pizza with pepperoni and black olives...totally delicious. Pizzas are pretty big too tho I feel like they come out larger when you dine in and kind of shrink when you get delivery...someone tell me if I'm wrong. Little pricey but it's mostly worth it. Never had it cold for breakfast bc there's never anything left....
