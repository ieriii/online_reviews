We had the worst experience ever. We never got to the point where we could be seated. The manager was the rudest restaurant manager I have met. We waited for more than an hour and they kept seating people who came after us. We were 6 people and they could have easily made some seating adjustments to accodate us. It really blew us off when they seated a party of 7 which came 30 min after us. We told the manager that she should have given the table to us but she said this is how the system works there. We came out at this point as there was no point in arguing.
