First-ever authentic Chicago deep-dish, and was very pleased. I've had Pizzeria Uno's (the chain version, not the Chicago original) and never liked it, and this beat that out of the park.My only reasons for not going five-star were the wait and the amount of food. The wait was expected, as this is the top-rated pizza joint in Chicago, but any longer than our hour and fifteen minute wait would've had me walking away, and that didn't include the fifteen or so minutes' wait after we got to the table (in spite of pre-ordering our pizza). That said, the staff was very friendly and prompt about getting to us and getting our drinks.Giordano's is definitely affordable, but the amount of food can be a bit deceiving - we ordered the smallest pie available that wasn't personal, and between two people couldn't finish it. They offer take-out, but unless you're a) a resident of Chicago or b) have a hotel room with a microwave, that pizza does NOT keep well as a late-night or early-morning snack of cold pizza.Overall, I recommend, but bring a group, and make sure you don't over-order. One or two pieces of deep dish will fill you up quick, and as I said, leftovers aren't as stellar as most thin-crusts can be.
