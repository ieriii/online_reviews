Superbowl Sunday, looking for a place for a great burger, tvs and did not want to wait in line for an hour.  Score - Lockdown.  They have great beer selections but the winner was the Fat Elvis.  I read the description and thought, yuck.  Never.  Then found out it was on the flight risk of 3 burgers and thought, what the heck.  Turned out that this is now my new favorite burger combination.  I cannot wait to come back and get the Fat Elvis again, not to mention some of the best fries I have ever put in my mouth.
