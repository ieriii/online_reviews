Everyone loves this place. I do not know why. We went on a Sunday afternoon after attending the Bears game. It was crowded and noisy. We got seated at a bar stool table that was not comfortable setting up a bad experience. We ordered the mushroom pizza, it was lukewarm and mushy. My date ordered soup and after a few bits, left it. We did not order wine since had enough to drink already, but we would not go back or recommend it
