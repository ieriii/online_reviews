for the ratings and attention this place gets it tastes like reg mexican food to me the only thing that was exceptional here was the guacamole, and this pork app i had with a spicy sauce along with their blood orange margarita another plus was that rick bayless was there its always nice to see the celebrity chef or owner their representing his or her own place however i believe that this place is just a-ok and nothing more
