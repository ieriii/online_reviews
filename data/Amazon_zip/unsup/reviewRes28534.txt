Rules on how to eat at Frontera Grill: 1. Arrive around 5pm to put your name down 2. Go back in an hour to pick up your buzzer 3. Wait another hour and a half to be seated (you can have some drinks at the bar) 4. Try to get a seat near the back kitchen, you can maybe be lucky and get a glimpse of Rick Bayless himself! I saw him but wasn't able to get a photo with him :( 5. Suggestion on ordering for 2 people: get 3 small plates, one entree, and a side dish. Perfect amount of food for 2 hungry people! Sopas= So good and flavorful! Shrimp, Scallop, Hicama Ceviche was my favorite! These "Quesadilla" things that look like turnovers= so cheesy and yummy  Special of the Day ribs= Licking my fingers for more, 2 huge slabs of rib  Plantains= shocking worse dish we had, it was still hard in the middle  not nice and soft like it should be. 6. Rinse it all down with a Pacifico or Margarita in hand. 7. All Done! Burp, excuse me.
