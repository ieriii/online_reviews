One of the perks of living on the NW side is close proximity to Superdawg. We love this place. Old-school yumminess. Can't say I've had a dawg. I always go for the Supercheezie.  One day a few weeks ago my kids suckered me into going here for lunch. Ok ok it didn't take much arm-twisting... We enjoyed our meal, it came time to go, and I decided to start up the car seeing as it is January. Car wouldn't start. Oy.  Our server informed me the gas station wouldn't be of any help. I found out our AAA membership was not "ours" but my husband's. Time to update that membership! She (our awesome server) enlisted the help of a fellow Superdawg employee and the ever so kind and courteous Army reservemen that had parked right next to me. Bazinga! Thank you thank you for getting my car started :) It's been a few weeks, almost time for a return trip!
