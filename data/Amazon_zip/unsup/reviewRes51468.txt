The interior is seriously lacking. Looks very cheesy and dingy. I'm confused why this place was so crowded. Food was fine. The waitress/bartender on the other hand was not. We ordered 1 horchata and the waitress brought us 2 and we told her we only ordered one and she accusingly shouted "NO YOU ORDERED 2." Uhh, nice. I don't think I want to pay money for someone to yell at me.
