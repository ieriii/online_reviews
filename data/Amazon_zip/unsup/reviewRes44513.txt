Excellent quality, excellent selection, modern and fun decor, the only thing I would change is their BYO charge! I've been eating sushi for 12 years and this place always serves great quality grade raw sashimi items and fun, inventive and delicious rolls! Great for a date or a dinner with the girls. HIghly recommend and not kick you in the ass expensive.
