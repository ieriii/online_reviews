I started eating at the location on Lawrence about 15 years ago (eek, I'm telling my age). I became a fan all that time ago, mainly, for 2 reasons: I love there salsa and there tacos, especially the al pastor. They are so generous with the meat that I have to eat some of it before I can properly pick it up. I don't know that I can claim that they are the best tacos in the city or the best Mexican restaurant or whatever. Chicago is fortunate to have many great options. I just know that over the years they have provided consistently delicious food at what I consider to be a reasonable cost. This past weekend was no exception.
