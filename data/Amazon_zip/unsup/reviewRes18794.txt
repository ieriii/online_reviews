Decent Beer List Underwhelming Food Mixed Decor Upon walking in, the main bar and dining area are pretty nice and very spacious. The place they sat us in, on the other hand, was a weird, poorly-lit afterthought of a seating area. Still, the rest of the bar would be a great place to grab a beer. However, the main draw was the fact that they had poutine and "special" burgers. I have to say I was QUITE disappointed with the food. The salad was DRENCHED with dressing. My spicy burger was remarkably unspicy and uninspired. The poutine tasted like they poured a powder packet of mushroom gravy over french fries and cheese curds. The upside is that service was pretty good. Friendly waitress who seemed knowledgeable about the menu and beer list. But yeah, unless I lived in the neighborhood, it's not something I'd go out of my way for.
