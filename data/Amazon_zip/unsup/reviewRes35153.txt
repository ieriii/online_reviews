i love sushi x! happy hour rolls are the best sushi deal in the city. rolls are always great. they don't really specialize in "authentic traditional sushi" but what they do focus on is their modern rolls which they've perfected!!! godzilla, red dragon, omega, and crab rangoon rolls do the trick for me!!!
