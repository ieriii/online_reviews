Any time. Night or day. The side dishes alone are well worth the trip way up north! I was with my boyfriend but wished we had invited all of our friends. I dream of the day I can chow with a party of ten in this place! Bbq'd squid and thin-sliced beef are delicious and the big fresh crunchy leaf lettuce make for juicy wraps around your meat of choice. Definitely a casual spot, nothing fancy, all the better to focus on food, foreign beers and fabulous company! Go hungry and adventurous and walk out stuffed plump and pleased.
