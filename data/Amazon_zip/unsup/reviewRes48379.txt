Wow! wow. Yumyumyumyumyum! Even on a Monday night, this place was hopping! We got to sit in one of the booths, or "pens" as we called it...you'll see why! The beer menu is longer than the food menu and the draft beers we tried were all great! We all split the chef's selection of mussels, the pork rinds, the roasted chicken, three hams, duck ravioli, and country ribs. Not one thing disappointed (though I don't care one way or the other for pork rinds...just doesn't do it for me). The mussels were so good and were served with a delicious vinaigrette. The summer sausage that came with the chicken was amazing. This a really fun place to come. It's sort of like a modern version of a German beer hall. The ceilings are very high (it is pretty loud in there), there is a long, long bar, and lots of communal tables. Oh, and I loved the communal sink at the bathrooms!
