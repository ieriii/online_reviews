COCKROACHES. That sums up my experience at Nuevo Leon. Since this place was so highly rated on Yelp, my husband and I decided to make the long, long trip down to Pilsen and try it. We sat down and my husband decided to run across the street to get some beers, since it's BYOB. The chips came and I started eating them. My husband came back, looked into the chip bowl and stopped dead in his tracks. THERE WAS A FUCKING DEAD COCKROACH IN OUR BOWL OF CHIPS. OH MY GOD I couldn't see it because I was sitting and not standing over it, but he moved a chip and there it was. Obviously we left immediately. I've never been so appalled and absolutely disgusted with a restaurant experience until now. Congratulations, Nuevo Leon.
