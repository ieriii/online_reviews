Fantastic meal, worth the wait. Apps: trio, trio, trio and guacamole. Drinks: blue agave margaritas Entrees: Halibut and Swordfish with Shrimp Dessert: Chocolate pecan pie with kahlua cream We waited for about 1h45 minutes on a Saturday night; not a bad wait, especially because the hostesses are super-competent, take your name, and tell you when to check back in. With all the bars in the area, there are tons of places to have pre-dinner drinks while waiting for your Frontera table. The food was phenomenal. Margaritas went down very easy - and, as promised, were sour. The guacamole was creamy and delicious. Entrees were fantastic, and the service was great. I can't wait to return.
