Excellent Happy Hour Spot! Half off appetizers from 5-7pm including the sushi rolls for you sushi lovers! On average $6-7 a roll which is an EXCELLENT price for downtown sushi in my opinion. My personal favorites on the Happy Hour menu were the Caterpillar roll, Firecracker roll, Spicy "Tail of Two Tunas" roll, and Brussels Sprout Salad (Yes, you may wonder why a salad can be good but you've got to try it to find out! Be forewarned though it's a tad bit spicy with jalapenos :)) The Divine Lychee martini isn't on the Happy Hour menu but was very yummy as well. Sunda also has a very lovely atmosphere for that wining and dining experience. And cute staff! which is always a plus! :)
