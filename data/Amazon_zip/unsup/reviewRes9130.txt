My 2nd time here. Food and service both times were great. Server available, but not intrusive. He was quick to offer suggestions when we asked, and I appreciated the stir-fry dish he recommended to me. Good wine selection. Atmosphere is very tasteful and comfortable. Noise level pretty good too. I'm sure we'll be back plenty more times. It's a nice change of pace in the Viagra Triangle.
