Delicious sushi, but a tad overpriced as the rolls are small compared to other places that charge less or the same for much more. Be prepared to wait forever for a table! Highly reccomend the Po Boy and White Dragon if you like very decadent rolls full of tempura, sauce, cream cheese, etc. Heavenly! Sexy atmosphere, dark, good music and BYOB
