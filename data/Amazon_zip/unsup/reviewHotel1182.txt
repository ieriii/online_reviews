On Sept 4, I made a reservation for 2 nights at the Hyatt McCormick Place in Chicago. I usually stay at The Wit (a Hilton hotel that always provides excellent service) when I am in Chicago on business. However, the rate was very high, so I decided to stay at the Hyatt since I had a conference at the McCormick Place anyway and the rate was about $100 less per night. I ended up not needing both nights, so I cancelled the second night more than 24 hours in advance in compliance with the cancellation policy. In fact, I was assured I would not be penalized. They did not put the bill under my door. So, as I was reviewing my e-mails today, I discovered that Hyatt cancelled and did not charge me for the 2nd night. However, to my surprise, Hyatt charged $464.85 to my American Express card. Yes, a small portion of that was for parking and taxes. But you increased my rate for the first night pretty significantly! The original reservation was $259 per night. The rep said when I cancelled one night, Hyatt had to charge me the going rate for that day. I was not informed of that rate change when I cancelled the 2nd night. The customer service rep (whose name I should have gotten but I hung up because I was so mad) was incredibly rude, telling me "It is what it is." Since I am a Hyatt Gold Passport member, I decided to try my luck with that department. At least that rep was more professional, but she still said there was nothing she could do. I have stayed in hotels hundreds of times, and there have been occasions when I've had to shorten my stay and cancelled a night. Never was I charged more for the nights I kept! I talked to our fiscal office, and they never heard of such a thing either. I could understand if I cancelled both nights and booked an entirely different date, but the rate should not have increased for the original night I booked. Sticking with the Hilton chain from now on.
