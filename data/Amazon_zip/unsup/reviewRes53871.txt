I'll keep this short and simple. Too much going on in all the dishes. I want to taste my PIG, not have it hiding in flavors. Everything we ordered looked better than it tasted. This only means one thing, they are trying to hard to be somebody there not. The pig is my favorite animal to eat and they ruined it for me. If your materialistic and want to be fooled, go here. If your smart and you know your pig, you'll know where to go. Simplicity is the best and The Purple Pig is not. Two stars because the staff was nice, otherwise one star for the food.
