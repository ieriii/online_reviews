I have been to the hotel, but have not stayed overnight. I set up an initial appointment to meet with the catering manager regarding my wedding. My mom and I were waiting for 35 minutes and he never showed! I was shocked to experience this from what is supposed to be a nice hotel. He didn't even respond to me until 2 days later and said he had another appointment!!! I think he should have found me or had someone let me know while I was sitting there. I would never stay overnight or do any kind of business with the hotel. If this is how they represent themselves in initial meetings, I wouldn't even want to know what the wedding would be like--I am sure a disaster!
