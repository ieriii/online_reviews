Mastro's is simply great. I was a bit skeptical of a chain steak house, but after dining here 5 or 6 times I have become a true believer. The service is impeccable. Unmatched at any other steakhouse in the city.  The appetizer selection is mostly seafood (as it should be.) Mastro's always seems to have a great selection of oysters and other shellfish. Try the tuna tartare.  The truffle gnocchi with crab meat is quite possibly the best side dish I've had at any restaurant ever. And the warm butter cake for desert is divine. A few things to note: Mastro's is NOT cheap. Probably 15-20% more expensive than the other Chicago steakhouses. It is best enjoyed on an expense account. If you're paying out of your own pocket you can bring your own wine and only pay a $25 corkage fee. Totally worth it.
