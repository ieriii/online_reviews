This was good food but I felt a little let down. After weeks of planning to go here, I was a little disappointed at the food. The BLT was great!, but every thing else we had was just ok-Pork Shoulder, Salami/ Meat slices, Bone Marrow, and a decent Turkey Leg. I would recommend it to someone to try for themselves, but still a little disappointed.
