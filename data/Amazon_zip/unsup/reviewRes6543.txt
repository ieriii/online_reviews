Great food at an unbeatable price. - Ricotta and honey comb: a must order. Comes with tuscan toast. the honey makes this dish - Truffle egg toast: love the earthiness of the dish, though I would have loved the egg to be a bit more runny - Mascarpone polenta with pork cheek ragu: must order. Served tableside which is a nice touch. - Paccheri: nicely al dente. Fennel seeds in the sausage a nice touch. All this great food, perfectly portioned for 2 people, with 2 glasses of wine came in at $30 a person!! If I lived in Chicago, I'd be here all the time.
