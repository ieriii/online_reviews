The only bad thing about this is that it's too popular! And it makes you fat far too easily! Luckily enough I was a bartender in one if the chefs locals, so I got the VIP treatment, and also a pen to write my name on the wall with, I'm really immature, especially around pizza!!! The pizza in this place is amazing! Especially the deep dish pizza. the deep dish is so big, my lunch became my dinner and next days breakfast (i'm a poor student after all). Do not come here for fast food, do not come here if your anorexic, do not come here if your a celiac either, come here if you love doughy, cheesy, pizzay pizza. Whata' place. A little pricey however, but the size of the portions do amount to good value. I'm without doubt a fan, but get there early so you're not waiting in the street all day!
