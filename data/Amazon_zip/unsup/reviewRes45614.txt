I went here last night with my friend and must say I had good time. I ordered Seafood soup and burger. Seafood soup is probably the best soup I've ever had. It just tastes really delicious. After that my burger came in. It doesn't look anything spectacular but it's really tasty and juicy. Great place. I'll be coming back for sure.
