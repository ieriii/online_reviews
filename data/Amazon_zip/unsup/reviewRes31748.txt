Hubby and I came here for breakfast today and were somewhat disappointed. My entree came out first and a computer glitch prevented his entree from being ordered. After this was remedied, my french toast was lukewarm. The special, corned beef hash and eggs, was just okay (fatty corned beef). I was hoping to have had a price adjustment for the error in the timing of our meal, but none was offered. A rather expensive breakfast, on top of it. Too bad...I did like the ambiance.
