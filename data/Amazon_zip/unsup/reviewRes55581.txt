the food is definately delicious. i had the blueberry cheesecake pancakes and was hooked.the only downside is that it's incredibly expensive for breakfast food, probably due to it's hipster atmosphere. while you get fresher and fancier meals than just a regular diner, you will pay for it. my entre was a little over $8.00, and the sides aren't that cheap either.if price is no issue, then you can't go wrong. just make sure you call ahead, the last time i was there i think there were about 15 people waiting outside for a table.
