wowzers. this place is delicious! my husband and i went there for lunch today on a whim since we were in the area, and i am glad that we did! they are little on the moderately pricey side [$12-$15 lunch dishes] but they did not disappoint! i also enjoyed their selection of local brews. we will definitely be back!
