Is it just me, or have pork-centric restaurants become Chicago's new(ish) big thing? Purple Pig... The Publican... The Bristol... all have a similar vibe and all are delish. My hubby and I tried The Publican this past weekend and I think this one takes the cake. First off: ambience. Yes, it is truly loud in there. Not a place to take your hard-of-hearing parents, unless they don't care about conversing and just want to enjoy some good food. But the vibe is fun, young, and fits the casual atmosphere and attitude of the restaurant, so I think it's acceptable. We were glad to be seated at one of the 'private' 2-tops by the windows so the noise level was totally manageable, but the communal seating probably got a lot louder as it's closer to the center of the room's "waiting for your table while you drink really good beer and wine" area. But more importantly: THE FOOD. We had: - Spicy pork rinds (which normally I would never eat, but my husband wanted them, and then I ended up scarfing a few too, they're just that good) - Potted rillettes (pulled-pork texture, deliciously-spiced, with sour cherries, spreadable on crusty bread) - Scallops (omg, perfectly cooked with a wonderful sauce and accompaniments) - Morel mushrooms (strangely I think I have cooked fresh morels better at home, but I did love the accompanying pea puree and sauce) - Pork belly (perfectly accompanied with pea shoots and a bit of spicy chorizo) - Rhubarb crumble dessert (biiiig chunks of rhubarb, just the way I like it - but wish it were topped with a bit of ice cream instead of just whipped cream) We really enjoyed our meal although I wish they had spaced it out a little more - it seemed like as soon as we finished (or even before we finished) one dish, they had brought out another, so we were out of there pretty quickly. It felt a little rushed to me. But not enough to deter me from visiting again, especially with a group so we can try more from the menu!
