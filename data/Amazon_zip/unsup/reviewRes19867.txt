Coast was delicious. Period. Ordered the White Dragon roll, which we liked so much we ordered two!! Probably the best roll I have ever eaten. Also ordered the special of the day which was a Tuna on Top. It was very good, had a piece of jalepino for a good kick. Also got the Po' Boy, which was good, but too big to eat in one bite (which I dislike, what am I supposed to do with that?)!! 4 stars because the prices are a bit high for my sushi liking. Most of thier special rolls are around $15. If they were closer to $10 this would become a once a week thing. BYOB and no cork fee. major plus.
