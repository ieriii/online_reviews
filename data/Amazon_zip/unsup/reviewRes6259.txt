I love Wildfire. Excellent food, excellent service, excellent atmosphere--everything is simply, well, excellent. I don't eat beef, pork or lamb myself, so I am proof that Wildfire is great for more than steaks! I swear by the soy-glazed cedar plank salmon, which is always delish. Sides are huge and wonderful, especially the mashed potatoes and broccoli. Appetizers are always good, especially all the seafood options, and desserts are always huge and outstanding! I love the warm and cozy interior, with the sort of swing-era feel, dark wood, old cocktail bar feel, and rock wall with chickens roasting. However, for me, the service always meant the most. Since I was a teenager, my family has been extremely devoted to LEYE restaurants, most notably Wildfire and Joe's. I had some serious medical issues when I was a teenager and for some time had to have fat/calorie/protein figures for everything I ate. While I rarely ate out at the time, we did want to go out for a meal. After having several Chicago restaurants tell us they were unable to provide us with all ingredients and nutritional facts, Wildfire faxed us the figures within 24 hours, and we had a marvelous meal. Our family grew to know the manager by name, and that example grew to be a perfect example of why we have always been loyal Wildfire patrons.
