Shaw's Sunday brunch is a little pricey, but when you see what you get for the money, it's the best deal in town. Food is all delicious and fresh, fresh, fresh. Raw oysters, crab knuckles smoked salmon, sushi and salads are some of the great cold items. I didn't make it to the hot items because the cold ones were so wonderful. But they have make your own omelets, french toast, waffles, pasta, seafood, bacon and more, more, more. The dessert room (yes, an entire room) has great items, all but one are homemade, and gummy worms and M&Ms for kids too! Really a wonderful experience. There is also a $5 Bloody Mary and mimosa bar. GREAT condiments. You have to get there and enjoy this fabulous Chicago treat.
