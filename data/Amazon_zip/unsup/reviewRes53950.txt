I always enjoy a good cuban sandwich and this is my new favorite spot. I sat outside in the outdoor patio last week and enjoyed a great meal. The staff was very friendly and most important my sandwich tasted great!My one complaint, soda was served in a can. I won't knock any stars off because of it, but I wish they had fountain soda instead!I highly recommend this restaurant.
