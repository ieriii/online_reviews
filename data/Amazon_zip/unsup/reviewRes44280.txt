I've never actually eaten at the restaurant because it's always so busy; It's really cute though, and I would love to actually find time to go there. This is definitely the best place I have ever had sushi delivered from or that I've picked it up from. It's so fresh & completely worth it.  The Emerald Roll is a little bit of heaven.
