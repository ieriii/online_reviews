I have been here a couple times, mostly when I was younger. I can't remember the last time i came but nothing has really changed. I ordered the leg of lamb which was a little too chewy but i did try the butterfly lamb chops which were really tender and well seasoned. The grilled octopus was everything i expected it to be (delicious) as well as the avgolemano soup! The rice was Awesome and the desert was not bad either. As far as the food goes this place is great but its the service that made me take one star away. The waiter was nice but hardly ever came to our table. The bus boy rushed to take our plates away. So four stars for this restaurant.
