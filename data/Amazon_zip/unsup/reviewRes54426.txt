Looking for vegetarian/vegan comfort food? This is your restaurant.I've been here a good number of times, and typically I get the Reuben or the Dagwood sandwich, although I've also had the Half-Pipe and the Titanic Burger. I'm also a big fan of the buffalo wings, and the chocolate peanut butter shake is to die for (the shakes cost nearly double what you might expect a typical shake to cost, but are well worth it, especially if you can't/don't eat dairy). As for sides, I usually get the sweet potato fries, the mac and cheeze, or the kale - very different options, but each delightful. I've also been for brunch once: what I remember most was the biscuit and gravy, which was delicious.As far as I can tell, it's less busy during the week than it is on weekends (natch), and you probably wouldn't want to come with a large group regardless (although I've never eaten on their patio, so it may be a bit more spacious). The food's a little on the pricey side - I don't think I've seen an entree for under $7.99 - but well worth it, and comes up faster than you may expect, even when it's busy.Why not a perfect 5/5? The food's a little inconsistent. Sometimes the mac and cheeze is dynamite, sometimes it's bland. Sometimes the buffalo wings are cooked to perfection, sometimes they're a little on the tough/dry side. I've never had a problem with the Reuben or Dagwood, but the crispy onion straws on the Titanic Burger were cold when I ordered it. I'm not sure what causes the variance, but overall, I've had great experiences here.
