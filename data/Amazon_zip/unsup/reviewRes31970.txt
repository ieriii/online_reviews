This was my favorite restaurant in town before I even stopped eating animal secretions, and still remains my fave. Every time I go there I find a new favorite dish. The menu changes frequently, and always for the better. Love the "diner feel," too. It would be nice if something could be done about the hallway between the bathroom and seating area (it's a tight squeeze and there's nowhere to stand in line) but that's just a minor complaint.
