I LOVE Carnivale, and I consider myself not easy to please when it comes to restaurants. Both times I have been here were great. We had reservations for Sunday night on a long weekend, and had to wait for another couple at the bar for a while. The atmosphere at the bar was as great as in the dining room. The bartender was great, and the drinks were fabulous! It only kept getting better from there - the food again was great, and I was even more happy with my selection than the first time. Top notch for food, flavor combinations, presentation, and pretty good on the value factor!!! What more could one ask for?! I highly recommend their camarones for an appetizer - a spicy shrimp ceviche thats fires up your appetite, and their pork shoulder entree is delicious on a very mellow bed of rice and beans served with plantains. Mmmmmm...cant wait to come back.
