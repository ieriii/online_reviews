This place is seriously overrated. Probably because Chicago's a meat packing town, so every vegetarian/vegan restaurant seems like an oasis of health and vitality. Chicago Diner gets two stars instead of one just for being brave enough to be hella close to Wrigleyville, which is a meat-eating, beer-swilling hive of nutritional (and cultural) insensitivity. Wrigleyville is like one big frat house in Alabama. But anyway. I was looking for a such a haven when I had the misfortune to be caught hungry in Wrigleyville. I decided to head to the Diner, as I hadn't tried it and it's gotten such mixed reviews. As I was heading into the restaurant, these two guys come out griping about how bad it was; that should have been an indication of something. The food's overpriced and not nearly as good as Soul Veg, and the service-yikes! They'll keep you waiting, man, they don't care. And whoever said the soy milkshakes were good-I challenge you to a duel. Tonight. At the clock tower.
