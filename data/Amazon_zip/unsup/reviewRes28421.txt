Its a Tuesday and I am turning 26; not a big milestone in my young life but enough of a reason for my amazing girlfriend to surprise me with Graham Elliot. We both ordered the "Experience" 10 course tasting menu (sans wine pairing) due to the fact that our server was a little aloof and failed to mention it during our menu selection. It was a Tuesday night and a great ambiance was in the air filled with Weezer, Hot Chip, MGMT and Sade throughout the evening. We had the tuna sashimi, deconstructed caesar, as cold apps first. The tuna was fresh, citrus infused and had clean, distinct flavors. The caesar was a great attempt at reinvention but the pea soup app stole the show with its creme freche marshmallow and warm, sweet broth. Then onto the curried duck satay and fish courses of halibut and sturgeon; a mix of sweet and salty fish with great morel mushroom and demi glace. The chicken was a precursor to the wagu beef and truffle puree..which was fantastic. The strawberry and lavender dessert topped the chocolate and salt caramel offering and to say the least we were not disappointed with anything. The bill is tough to get over but for great wine and 2 tastings and as a special event/dinner it lived up to the Top Chef hype. Graham even signed and personalized the menu for my birthday..a sentimental touch. Overall, a great place for a whimsical and special evening.
