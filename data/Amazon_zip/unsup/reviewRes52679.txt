Of the guacho steak places in Chicago I like this one best. I've been to all of them and I'll give it slight edge. For one I just like the atmosphere. Its open with a lot of windows and that makes the difference for some reason. Second the mushroom rissoto is SO good. Wow . I mean really good. Probably the best thing they make. If your tossing the Brazillian steakhouse idea around skip the rest and head on down to Brazzaz.
