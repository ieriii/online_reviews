Definitely a great option for an authentic Greek meal, both in terms of the relaxed pace as well as the freshness of the food. While the entrees are good (most things made with fish are excellent), I find it's best to treat Greek Islands as a small plates restaurant; order some saganaki, a couple of the dips (skordalia and taramosalata stand out), some other appetizers, maybe a big salad, and share. Service is laid-back yet very friendly, which I am a big fan of; I've had too many meals spoiled rotten by invasive servers. Valet parking is also clutch, as finding a spot in the area is typically a bloodbath. PS This place makes for a very nice yet inexpensive date - ordering the way I recommended above on a date ~1 year ago, I spent around $35 for the two of us (including tip, sans alcohol).
