i think Big Jones deserves four stars. I am reserving one star because the service was pretty slow to start, but our waitress made up for it. A girlfriend and I decided on Big Jones for lunch last Sunday, as we were roaming around Andersonville and everywhere else was packed. We were able to be seated immediately at Big Jones and were quickly led through velvet curtains (a little weird, yes).  The host sat us at the very last table in the very back of the restaurant and we felt a little like leppers. We passed at least five open tables on the way back to the tiny corner. Oh well. It took a while for anyone to bring us waters and our server didn't show her face for at least 10 minutes. We asked for waters. I was getting grumpy and prepared for a shit meal and a shit experience.  Thankfully, waitress showed up and saved herself from the wrath of hungry Alaina. She took our drink orders and had the drinks in a flash. Momentarily, she returned with an appetizer-type thing that we didn't order - so assumed they were complimentary or what they offer instead of bread. They were the most delicious deep-fried donut-type things. I cannot remember for the life of me what they were called, but they were damn good. Anyways, my girlfriend and I both ordered the tall grass burger which came with fontina cheese, grilled onions and mushrooms and a garlic aioli. We got the aioli on the side, per the server's recommendation, and the burgers were fabulous.  Next time I will try the breakfast, as I was staring at other people's dishes and they looked quite good. I would definitely recommend this place - but make sure to be adamant about service. I got the feel that we may have been forgotten back in our corner if we didn't speak up.
