Blarney cheeseburgers, seafood chowder , potato apps(not sure what they are called ) are must tries. it is a bar, so going beyond simple things on the menu isn't something me and my girlfriend do. friendly staff, good beers and wine. always stay for a few extra because of the comfy feel we get when we go there. bathrooms are nice too
