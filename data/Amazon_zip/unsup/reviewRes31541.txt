I cannot sing enough praises for this place. They are super accommodating to vegans and you know that you are getting quality food when you bite into their dishes. So flavorful. So scrumptious. So decadent! My favorites are the Radical Reuben and the seitain carnitas tacos I had. This is a vegetarian's paradise! Even if you aren't a veggie, you'll love the food! Ok. I know you'll be stuffed and many people skip the deserts but the cake slices and vegan shakes are just too. awesome. too. pass. up. Last time I went, we shared a chocolate moose cake slice AND a chocolate chip slice. Both were as decadent and moist as you would expect. They truly are a wonder. If I lived next to this place, I don't know how I would keep away. If you are a vegetarian and have not dined here, what are you waiting for? Expect to spend $8-$12 (without drinks) here. Well worth it when it comes to the food quality and the service. They also have rotating special dishes, so please DO ask for the specials menu! I've been wanting to go here for breakfast, but I've never woken early to catch it, haha. It sounds good though! I also appreciate that the owner (I think?) walked around and checked on how our dinner was. I also hear that they try to incorporate local foods and local ingredients into their dishes! DUDE. That totally earns another star and a half in my book. Support sustainable food and support local businesses as I always preach :) Btw, expect at least a 30-45 min wait if you coming for dinner on the weekends.
