My second time coming here was not as good as the first. DO NOT COME HERE ON VALENTINE'S DAY WEEKEND! they can't handle large crowds. My bf and I had reservations and they were still like 15 minutes. We got seated but had to wait another 15 minutes before meat started coming our way. There was like 10 minutes between each meat.. and the freaking pineapple and chicken would come by every minute! Definitely wasted money on an "all you can eat" when all I did eat was the same piece of meat every 15-30 minutes lol. horrible. But on a brighter note: I remember coming here last year for dinner on a random weekday and the service was better. not sure if it's the same from what I recently experienced but I'm not sure I want to spend more money to find out.
