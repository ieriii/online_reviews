I'd been here once before for evening drinks on the upstairs patio. It was fun. Brunch...brunch is where it is at for this place. O.M.G. First, there are several stations to visit; fruit, salads, confit, meats, cheeses, (THERE ARE PEPPA DEWS!!!), desserts...if they serve the New Orleans french toast EAT IT. Amazing. Second, they deliver hot cinnamon buns to your table in a skillet.  Third, they deliver quiche and a deconstructed eggs benedict to your table. Fourth, they deliver meet to your table. Fifth, great drink specials! Sixth, you will walk out of there like a bloated, but very satisfied, pig. The service was great. Everyone was very friendly. And for the price, it really can't be beat. Go. Eat. Drink. Be Happy.
