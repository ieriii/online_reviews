I really like Le Colonial...the whole French Vietnamese concept appeals to me and they do it well. The flavors are unique and delicious and the atmosphere is inviting. It's a great date spot or a cool place to take out-of-towners (esp the non-city dwellers)...they certainly don't have restaurants like this in the 'burbs. I have been to the NYC spot and it is good, but I like Chicago better.
