Our waitress Sally was fabulous We ordered the seasonal sangria with the strawberries and time and thought it was delicious Our favorite courses were the tocino con cidra (phenomenal) and the pintxos muranos. The setas and espinacas were wonderful as well. Our review for the mixto croquetas and the patatas bravas are that they're good but our least favorite of the 6 tapas we had. Also, the focacia bread they bring out at the beginning is awesome (and I'm not a fan of tomatoes) I had the chocolate y avellana for dessert. Awesome for a chocolate/hazelnut lover and a perfect size to share. My boyfriend liked his dessert (had the orange-carrot jam - sorry can't remember the name) but he didn't love it as much. Overall, pleasant first time experience and hope to go back soon.
