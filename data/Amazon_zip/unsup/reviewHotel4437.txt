During of Stay: 4 days, 3 nights (Thurs 2/11 - Sun 2/14, 2010) Room Type: One King Bed I took my sweetheart here for an extended Valentine's Day weekend earlier this year and must say, this hotel is fantastic. The interior is aesthetically gorgeous, our upper-floor corner room modern (with the exception of the TV from the 90's), the location is excellent (just a few blocks from Millennium Park), the service is fantastic (from doormen, concierge, to maids and room service), and the Lockwood Restaurant inside is fantastic (we were given a complimentary 20% off coupon upon check-in to try "the most romantic restaurant in Chicago"). The girlfriend enjoyed the stay as well. Only downsides: - The business center is small, computers outdated, and charges for internet and printing. - The pool is small and the stench of chlorine was overwhelming. Even so, I am giving this four-star hotel five-stars. Would definitely return again.
