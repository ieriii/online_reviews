Friday night around 7:00pm, 45 minute wait...but drinks at the bar made time fly. Food: 1. Pumpkin with foie gras - favorite out of everything 2. Tete du Cochon (pig head meat) 3. Bone marrow - delicious. Not sure why they provided salt...not necessary. 4. Scallops - I think the gnocci was my favorite part 5. Steak and eggs - it was pretty good but not amazing Drinks: whiskaaaay. Tons of selection. Service: Probably the best I've experienced. I swear they have ESP...we never had to ask for anything...the waiter knew when we wanted to order more drinks/food, the busboy knew when we wanted fresh plates and utensils.
