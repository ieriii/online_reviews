I usually come here for lunch with a few co-workers. Their sandwiches, artopitas and seafood salad are all really good. They also have some good soups.  It can get very busy in here, so make sure you have plenty of time in order to sit after you get your food. The only thing I don't like is that it is a tad too expensive to do lunch here all of the time. I may make it here once a month, but it is always good when I'm there.
