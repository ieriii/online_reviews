I had a great time when I stayed here in 2006 with three friends. Located right outside the Loop and directly across from Grant Park, and within walking distance of The Field Museum and Shedd Aquarium, this hotel met our needs perfectly. The rooms were well appointed with good closet space and a bathroom big enough for four people to share easily. Parts of the movie "Return to Me" (a favorite in my family) were filmed in the hotel's ballroom. We had lunch at the buffet, which was $14/person, which seemed all right to me for an all-you-can-eat meal. Parking is in a nearby lot at reasonable rates. Also on the bus line and it's easy to hail cabs here.
