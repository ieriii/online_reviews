Rick Bayless can do no wrong. Yes, it's busy and sometimes you have to wait...but it is soooo worth it. The food is great. I am in LOVE with the Milanesa Torta and have recently tried the Pozole and would recommend that as well. If you haven't been there you have to. It is definitely a place you have to try in Chicago.
