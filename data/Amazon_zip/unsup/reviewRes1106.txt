I like to start off by saying Doug, the owner, was a pretty cool friendly down to earth guy. Doug takes everyone's order and reguardless of the looong line out side the door he takes his time with you while you order. As I visited Chicago my friends took me to eat at Hot Doug's on a Friday because I was told I had to try the Duck Fat Fries and boy were they delicious!! We all got something different and we were not disappointed in the least. This place is a must go to when visiting Chicago, it's kinda small for all the people who do go in and out of there but it just works, take my word for it. And as for the long wait in line, well it's just part of the experience, just be prepared. Can't wait to go back and enjoy some more good eats!!
