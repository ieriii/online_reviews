Enjoyed a wine flight and the vegetarian entree. I thought the wine was very good and reasonably price. I was actually pretty impressed with the vegetarian dish, as it was creative and tasty. My friend ordered the roasted chicken, and I was told it was very good. The space is open and simple. One side is casual and the other side is meant to be nicer. The same menu is served on each side. The only thing missing on the "nicer" side was the crispy rosemary bread sticks that are located on every table in the casual area, so we just requested some!
