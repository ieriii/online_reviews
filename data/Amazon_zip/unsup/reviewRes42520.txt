Went to Gilt Bar for Valentine's Day dinner this year. It was my second time here and it didn't disappoint. The food is meant to be very rich, though, so be prepared and don't order too much unless you're prepared for leftovers. Bartenders - very friendly and very knowledgeable. Already a great way to start the evening with a drink at the bar and good service! Appetizer - We had the bone marrow which I tried last time, and it was almost better than I remembered! It is such a rich, delicious dish. The onion jam, toasted bread, and parsley do so much to enhance the flavor. As an asian I've grown up meeting marrow as-is...this takes it to another level. And it is a generous portion....it's a MUST try. Entrees - We ended up splitting/sharing the truffle/mushroom pasta and the pot roast. Truffle/Mushroom Pasta - hands down one of my favorite dishes ever. The flavor is out of this world, papardelle is perfectly cooked al denta, and the portion is just right to not weigh you down. This is a MUST order as well for me :) Pot Roast - This was tasty...but I guess pot roast is pot roast. Meat was cooked well, tasted, good....but it's hard for me to think of what would make this an "amazing" dish for me. Brussel Sprouts - I cook brussel sprouts a lot at home and was hesitant to order them because how good can brussel sprouts be. These were SIGNIFICANTLY better than what I make it home. They cook them to the perfect done-ness (not too mushy/overcooked). And the flavor of the bacon makes them very memorable. We ended up being too full for desert (like I said, the food is RICH!). A few other items I ordered my first time here that I would also try again: Balsamic/Garlic bread - Sounds simple but man it was delicious. A great starter for a group (might be too filling if it's just two)
