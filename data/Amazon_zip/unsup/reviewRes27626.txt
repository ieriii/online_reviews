This is my favorite pizza place in the Chicago area. Exclamation mark! I'm a suburbanite, but I don't mind driving out to the city and waiting for a table to eat here. Speaking of which, if you come on a Friday or Saturday night, be prepared to WAIT. So worth it though... Believe me. Nice thing is you can order your pizza when you put your name on the list for a table, and when you are seated you don't have to wait very long for your pizza. When I come here, I usually stick to 1 - 3 toppings max. The perfect pizza for me is pepperoni and maybe fresh basil. The cheese and caramelized crust is the star of the show, so I try and keep it simple as to not detract from that. One thing I don't get is the mascot? A whale with a thong on it's head??? No clue... Two of the servers I spoke with couldn't really explain it either. Seriously, if you haven't been checked out Pequods you are definitely missing out. Speaking of which, I should start planning my next trip out to this place :-).
