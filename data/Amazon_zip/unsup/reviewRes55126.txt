Wildfire is one of my favorite restaurants hands down. Their salmon is so flavorful and well cooked. Their scallops and sauteed spinach dish is one of my favorite dishes...those scallops are *kisses fingers* magnificent. The steaks are wonderful and the surf and turf is excellent. Oh yes. I will be coming back....definitely.
