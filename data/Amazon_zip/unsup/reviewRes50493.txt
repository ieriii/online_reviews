I love this place's decor of psychotic overly-fertile chickens!! I've come to this establishment on many an occasion, weekday and weekend, and have always had great food and service! My favorite thing to order is the Black Beancakes Benedict. It is really good and not too heavy. The coffee hear is great as well! One of the best things about this place is that no matter when I come, I am never waiting longer that 20 minutes (which is nearly unheard of in Chicago on weekends).
