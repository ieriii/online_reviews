Making a reservation on Opentable, the soonest we could get in on a weekend night was about a month down the line. So when the date finally arrived (and after reading practically every yelp review), the experience was met with anticipation.  Despite being briefly hindered by Critical Mass, we were able to find a street parking spot very near the restaurant, avoiding the $6 charge and the embarrassment of wedging our Corolla in amongst the BMWs and Jaguars. We were warmly greeted at the entrance, and we were seated within minutes of arriving. The tables are pretty tightly packed, but I did not find the level of noise distracting or off-putting. We started off dinner with a salad, calamari fritti, and an appetizer portion of pasta. The salad was negligible, and a little high-priced at $6for a small mixed green salad. The calamari was tasty and typical. I do enjoy fried food. The appetizer portion of pasta was delicious... It was a tagliatelle with wild boar ragu. We had tried a wild boar ragu in Tuscany this past summer, and Piccolo's version was very comparable. The meat wasn't quite as tender, but overall the taste was right. For entrees I had short ribs which were good but over-salted I thought, and my husband had some gnocchi dish which he liked.  Service was good but kind of slow, and confusing. I think we literally had 10 different people at our table at times throughout the night. There was someone who I presume to be our waiter (he took our order), someone who filled our water, someone who dropped off our entrees, someone who boxed them up, an add'l person who took drink orders later in the night... Lots of people but no major interest in our thoughts on the quality of the food.  We ate inside, so missed out on the supposed loveliness of the patio. However, I thought the interior felt very warm and cozy for a cool fall night. Overall, it was a good experience that I would hope to repeat, possible with visitors (parents) in town.
