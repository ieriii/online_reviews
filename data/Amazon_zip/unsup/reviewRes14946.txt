Not a huge drinker, but everyone seemed to enjoy their drinks. Bouncer was really nice, but for some reason, he kept letting parties behind us, go in before us. That was kind of weird... My favorite part of going to a speakeasy is the coziness of it, and watching the bartenders make drinks. This "speak easy" was not cozy at all. It felt like a warehouse with tall blue couches thrown in, separated by tall, heavy curtains. The music was decently loud, much louder than any speak easy I've been to. As for watching the bartenders, there are not many bar seats making it very difficult for a large group.
