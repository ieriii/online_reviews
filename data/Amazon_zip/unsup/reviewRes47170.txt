Didn't want to battle lines at DMK so we hit up Lockdown and wasn't disappointed. Super nice server, and though heavy metal isn't my thing, I felt totally comfortable chilling out with the rockers. I cringe a bit anytime I spend more than $10 for a burger and fries, but I will say they were perfectly cooked, creative and the fries were on point! Had a burger flight I couldn't finish consisting of the "warden's choice" for the night which was something with pulled pork, something with an onion ring and something with hot sauce stuff. Definitely will be back, cool place.
