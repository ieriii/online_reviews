Frankly, I've spent a great deal of time falling in love with the food of Mexico...from the simplest grilled fish and ceviches under beach side palapas to the swankiest of restaurants.  There is a reason Frontera has been called one of the best restaurants in America and why this lowly diner gives it five stars. I don't know how he does it, but Rick Bayless can create an orgasmic experience from a piece of fish, mashed potatoes and a simple broth. He does it time after time. I have never...never...had a meal here that was anything less that amazingly fresh and explosive with flavor. It's like this guy has mapped out our taste buds and discovered exactly how to push the right buttons. He even takes the simplest side dish, like frijoles charros, and lifts it to new levels. I could go on for days, but suffice to say that this unbelievable menu, the first-rate staff and a casual coastal Mexican atmosphere come together to make Frontera one of my all time favorite restaurants in Chicago.
