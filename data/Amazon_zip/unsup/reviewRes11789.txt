Quite nice. The pizza's good, good beer selection. Hell, not much else I demand out of a place like this. The crowd is lively, though saying it's the "best pizza in chicago" is a BIIIG stretch. The waitstaff is always very nice and attentive. Decent place to bring a kid during the daylight hours, at night it gets a little more bar-like. The live band karaoke is sort of a hoot.
