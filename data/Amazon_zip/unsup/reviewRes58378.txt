I made reservations for four, three months ago and glad I did. At 7pm, on a Saturdaynight, this place was packed. I have problems with my knees and my back so climbing up a tall flight of stairs was the first encounter. I was not happy about it, but I did it.So, if you are at any way, shape or form handicapped, ask to remain on the first floor.We first were greeted for drinks which took a while. The bbq chips and sweet pickles were a nice touch to start off but don't eat too much of these! You will be full before the meal comes.We ordered the hush puppies and the fried green tomatoes, and split the cobb salad. Absolutely delicious!My husband ordered the competition ribs and my girlfriend ordered the regular ribs and both appeared to be the same. My friend's husband ordered the pork chop which was HUGE! It was cooked perfectly. I ordered the competition Kobe beef rib. It was cooked almost too well done because there was not a lot of meat and it was crunchy. It was very good.The cornbread was delicious, the greens, the mashed potatoes and the slaw were were all very good.Not bad for Chicago in the rib scene. However, I am still searching. I prefer a wet rib to the dry rub ribs but hey, that is individual preference. I only wish a Kansas City based rib joint would come to Chicago. Is there one?
