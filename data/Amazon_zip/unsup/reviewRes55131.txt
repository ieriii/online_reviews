Chicago q's was an experience!First, the pickles and chips were amazing: usually I'm not a fan of kettle chips, but these were perfect: they didn't get stuck in my teeth for hours, as usual.I split the pulled chicken and brisket sandwich with my brother: I have to say the chicken was very juicy, I just wish it had been cooked with the barbecue sauce. The brisket was also great: a tiny bit dry since it was cut into such small pieces, but it was still one of the best brisket sandwiches I've had. The cole slaw (my side) was great, but they gave so much I was getting sick of it by the end: but what did I do? Started mixing barbecue sauces with it in e end to switch u the flavor: it was amazing! The original and mustard barbecue sauces were the best: mustard not too spicy/horseradishy (which I usually think it is) and the original was just right: sweet, smokey, overall delicious.The place was very interesting on the inside: clean and neat, and had a somewhat homey feel. I would definitely recommend this restaurant, and will definitely be going back! 5 stars!
