This place was great!! I came with only having one other experience of eating Ethiopian and that was when I was in Rome. The experiences were very comparable. Soft, spongy bread, used to pick up an assortment of stews and vegetables. I would suggest ordering the family style for all.. it was like $15/person and we got to try about 8 or 10 different meats and veggies (way more food then the three of us could finish). It was the best way to go and they had a great assortment of African beer that intrigued me. I commend the restaurant for not even giving the option of a fork and knife! Hands only and it is truly the best way to experience it. Also, the communal way of dining is great for the group I was with as we almost always pass and share dished when we go out, this simply took away the confusion! One final note, for those that are apprehensive to try Ethiopian, it really is not what I would place as the most "adventurous" food.. it is simple meat stews.. nothing scary! I believe there is a lot of Indian influence to their dishes.. so if you can do Indian, Ethiopian will hit your plate just right!
