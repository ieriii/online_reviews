I went here for a very special evening with my significant other. It only added more wonderful feelings to that night. Expect a wait. We waited for probably two hours on a Saturday night in the middle of winter. Luckily there was a wine bar across the street - all of whose inhabitants were waiting as well. The restaurant calls when seats open and the atmosphere and wait staff are so friendly and inviting, that even after the wait I was immediately happy to be there. I am of Italian descent and generally don't find Italian restaurants all that exciting. However, the dishes here are not your typical Italian-American fare, and I have rarely tasted anything so great. The mascarpone polenta with ragu is perfect.  I can imagine its richness and creamy texture now. The foccacia with soft cow cheese is also excellent. We also had farro and swordfish dishes that were quite enjoyable. We had no room for dessert. I wish I hadn't filled up on a crappy cheese plate at the wine bar while waiting. I would definitely reserve this place for special occasions though I would love to have the opportunity and funds to return here often. They do have take out deals during the week that I may have to try sometime...
