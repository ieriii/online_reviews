I usually come to Piece for the beer, then I spot/smell a variety of colorful pies, and then I talk a friend or am talked into ordering one. After that I stay for the beer until I'm squeezed out by the crowd. Unfortunately I can not usually figure out where I can find a comparable beer nearby. The pizza grows on you over time until it becomes a favorite. Sometimes they bring it out way too hot and it's damn near impossible to let the thing cool off for more than a minute. If you are not careful moving your slice to your plate you'll end up losing all the toppings.
