One of my friends always loved this place and mentioned to me before, but I guess I never paid attention because I don't remember haha. I had a Groupon for Gyood (review after this) that expired today, and we decided to have dinner nearby before dessert. I guess my friend didn't even know till we arrived that the place has been remodeled and is a lot bigger.... YAY- Portion: I think this is the first Mexican restaurant I've been to with portions so big! I ordered mushroom and spinach enchiladas, and I had at least 5 or 6 of them PLUS rice and beans of course. I don't know why I didn't just eat half and save half for lunch today for work. Silly me. Price: My enchiladas was just under $10. That's usually around the same price for other Mexican restaurants for the normal portion size for 3 enchiladas. NAY- Got water?: My pet peeve is when food is too salty, and I know alot of restaurants have that. The food wasn't that salty to the point where we can't eat it, but we def kept chugging out glasses of water. Service: I didn't really realize it till towards the end, but our server and the service in general was slow. Took forever for them to fill our glasses of water. And our server seemed as if she had an attitude problem the whole night. She also gave us our check even before we asked for it. She seem as if she was in a rush for us to go. Mushrooms: Another pet peeve of mine is canned mushrooms.. not a big deal but just a note for those who are curious. Needless to say, I was really full. I wouldn't mind going back again, but it wouldn't be my first choice mainly because of the service.
