Da Vh. I've been in here a couple of times with my girl. She dragged me here the first time and I was skeptical at first. It seemed fancy and like the kind of place people go to keep their hands to themselves. But I quickly realized how intoxicating it all was. Both times we got sat at tables and had the same server. At first, I thought he was stiff, but he knows the menu like the back of his hand and has never steered us off a good drink and is always there when the glasses empty. Good place for privacy and making a lady feel special. All in all, not a place I'd bring my bros. But a good place to show a lady a good time.
