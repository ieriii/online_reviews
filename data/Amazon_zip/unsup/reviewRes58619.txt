To the reviewer who mentioned not getting it and my review re: crappy service...1. I get it. I'm Greek.2. I disagree that getting liquored up cures crappy service.Don't assume that because you disagree with someone's review, you know a restaurant and its food better that he does. Thanks for your insight though.
