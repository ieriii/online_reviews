If I were to rate Revolution on just being a bar it could be five stars, but for a restaurant it's hardly a revolution and mostly more of the same. Some big pluses. 1) The waiting area. Very rarely is this seen anymore and I love that there were a good amount of seats for us to wait at and we could order beer from there. 2) The decor. It's very awesome. The giant wooden fists holding up the bar and the same fists as beer taps just seem cool. The rest of the wooden restaurant and visible kitchen make it a cool place. 3) The beer. One thing a brewery should make sure they do well is their beer, and Revolution does that right. I had their Belgian Wit Ale and it was outstanding. The other sips I had of their IPA was also very good. And if you're nervous, they have a great selection of other beers as well. There are some areas that need work though. The noise level is set for a bar experience but 90% of Revolution is set up for dining. It's very difficult to eat and have fun with dinner guests when you can barely hear each other. Our server was nice, but infrequent. She came once to take orders, a second when dropping them off, and then a third for the check. A little more follow-up would have been nice. Lastly the food just wasn't great. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't...well...revolutionary. I would be happy to come back here for some drinks, but it's pretty far out of the way so even that may be infrequent. There are some areas that need work though.
