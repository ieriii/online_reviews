I have never been a fan of deep-dish pizza, but it feels wrong not to at least try a deep-dish pizza from Chicago.  The pizza was interesting, putting the sauce on top of the meat and cheese. Underneath the sauce was a thick layer of melty stringy cheese with bites of sausage spaced throughout. The crust was thick and crumbly with a toasty flavor very similar to a pie crust. I was pleasantly surprised how good the pizza was.  Still prefer New York style but I can definitely appreciate this for what it was.
