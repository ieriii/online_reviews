My boyfriend & I could not get reservations at Roy's Steakhouse and decided on Zed451. One step inside and you are transported into a luxurious rustic playland for the senses with high ceilings, candles abound, and a fireplace sourounded by numerous salad offerrings .. I could have sat here until the sun came up sitting in the most comfortable cushion leather chair made to man!. I always choose to sit in the booth side but it made no difference at Zed! Our waitress, Susie, gave me a $20 gift certificate; and after chatting we realized we were neighbors! We decided on riding in the Zed Party Van, which was pleasant as Edgar for our driver. Zed is the only restaurant in Chicago that offers a complimentary ride/pick-up to & from the restaurant I was told by the driver; but, obviously, we graciously tipped him for his time. On the other hand, I am saddened the delectable food that was left on my plate gets thrown away. The employees cannot take it home and it is not donated to even a homeless shelter and of course, not given to customers in a doggy bag. The soup I had was barely warm. They need a Whole Foods heat system for their soups. Whenever I splurge on soup at Whole Foods, the soup is piping hot. I would definitely come back here and recommend to others who are leary of unlimited "meat-on-a-stick" type of restaurants.
