Bone-In Delmonico. Kinzie does a very fine job indeed with this cut. This ribeye is trimmed back off the bone. So the bone does not interfere with one diving knife first into this glorious cut of meat. What courteous and thoughtful chaps they are at Kinzie. Instead, the bone hangs slightly off the edge, only just secured flavorous strains of fat, so it might act out a smoky tap dance on the entire piece of meat while its seared to perfection(thoughtful chaps again). I will return for this cut alone. The drinks and sides were nice compliments, but the Delmonico is most certainly the star of this steakhouse.
