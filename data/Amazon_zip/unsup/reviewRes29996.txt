Wow. It could have been that I was really hungry, or that it was just really good, but a simple roast beef sandwich with some au jus for dipping (which, I have to say, wasn't a big enough container for dipping a huge sandwich...) was soooooo good. I mean GOOD. I also had my first Cosmopolitan here, and it was deliciously sweet and girly pink. I tried to have another Cosmo somewhere else downtown and it didn't compare. Local artists hang on the walls for a very "around-the-corner" feel which is nice. Staff is also very upbeat and polite.
