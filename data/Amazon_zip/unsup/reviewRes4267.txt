This is and has been my long-time favorite place for jazz. As everone else has mentioned, between the history of the place and talent that shows up --- you can't go wrong. In the last four months, I have discovered one more reason to love the Green Mill: the Sunday Night Poetry Slam hosted by THE poetry slam creator himself - the talented Marc Kelly Smith (so what!). If you've never been to a poetry slam, picture the opening scene of Mike Meyer's movie "So I Married An Axe Murderer." It's kind of like that except there's no slideshow in the background and there's no one cool like Marc hosting the evening. The evening begins at 7pm with an open mic performance from various poets - newbies and people who have been around the poetry scene for years. Afterwards, a featured performer or performers share their best with you. Finally, the actual slam starts. I'm not giving anymore details because it's part of the experience. Seriously. Just go. Try it. This is DIFFERENT. Bored with the usual sports bar scene? Are you looking for something to lift you out of your uninspired existence? Do you dare to exercise that little noggin of yours on a Sunday night? Step outside of the norm and check out the Poetry Slam at the Green Mill! Again, it starts at 7pm, so get there a little earlier to grab a seat. Admission is $6. And now here's an attempt at poetry (no I've never performed any of my stuff in public)... Just picture the band behind me --- piano, standup bass, and jazz drums. It's a Sunday night I have a choice To sit in front of the TV And be hypnotized by Meaningless, mindless banter Blah, blah, blah Wind down before the work week begins Or NOT I choose the latter Green Mill I choose inspiration Poetry Slam I choose expression Smart-clever-shocking Dirty-sexy-disturbing Funny-conceited-depressing I choose right brain stimulation Fed by poetry and music Give me the Green Mill on Sunday!
