5 stars might be slightly excessive for Mayan Palace, but it's the best mexican food in the lincoln park/lakeview area as far as i'm concerned. if it were in pilsen maybe it would be a 3.5 or 4, but for the sake of convenience...... super friendly service. they always act like they remember me, whether they do or not, i don't really care. extra salty chips with extra drippy salsa is a great combo to start the meal with. fajitas, enchiladas are excellent. not a fan of the chile rellenos. half price margaritas on tues/thurs.
