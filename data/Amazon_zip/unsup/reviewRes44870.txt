Tip: PRE-ORDER the SUPREME DEEP DISH!! My family and i came here on a trip to visit my son, who had just graduated boot camp. There was a 20-30 minute wait on a Saturday afternoon around 3ish or so, we were told we could wait or pre-order our pizza so it would be ready shortly after we were seated. Best advice we were given that day! We were seated and our pizza arrived within 10-15 minutes. One slice of this pizza is all you need and i love my pizza (new york style preferred) but this was amazing! I was so full and happy we ended up taking the left overs back to the hotel for a midnight snack! Street parking may be tough, you can always park at the sears tower parking lot and pay the parking fee, it is so worth it!
