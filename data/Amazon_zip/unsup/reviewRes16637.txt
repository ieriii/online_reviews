we ordered the five (5) ceviche tasting...meaning 5 different types of ceviche. We get only 4 on our plate... no explanation nothing...maybe they thought I would not notice....especially when a $32 caviche is missing. I did flag the waiter and he said they were out of that particular ceviche. Then why didn't you tell me that in the first place????
