I rarely give 5 stars. BUT, this place deserves it. The food was great, cheap, and resembled something homemade.......but Mayan Palace doesn't deserve 5 stars for only great food.....they deserve it because the staff is nothing but AMAZING and friendly. Everyone there is engaging and helpful. I will definitely go back there and spread the word. KUDOS to MAYAN PALACE
