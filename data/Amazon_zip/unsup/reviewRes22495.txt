This is one of my favorite restaurants in the city. Food & selection are amazing. Love the original empanada (gluten free!) and the selection of batidos. I could eat every meal here for a week a be happy. Remember to bring cash & know that service is a bit spotty-- just as it is in Costa Rica! Muy autntico!
