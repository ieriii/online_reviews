I went to shaw's with my parents and had a really enjoyable time. There was a sign on the door that said proper dress code is required for eating in the main dinning room. We were all in jeans and polos and asked the Matre d' if we were dressed appropriately and he said of course we were. I am not sure what they mean by proper dress code, but you may want to call ahead to figure out if you will be dressed ok. Our server was really friendly and knew the menu very well. He was able to make all kinds of suggestions on oysters and the daily specials. The oysters were excellent, my crab stuffed lobster was great. We (3 people) shared a side of vegetables which was a perfect amount to be shared. The only thing that I wasn't jazzed about was the gumbo which I found to be somewhat bland.
