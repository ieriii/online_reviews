You may just have to experience it yourself, but I think Publican was designed-from space to menu-by people who hate people. I fully understand the "communal table" dining experience, in fact I sort of like it. What I *don't* get is everything else. The layout of the place is just odd. Why cram ALL of the dining into 1/2 the room? One 1/2 the room is the weird booth stalls and communal tables crammed against them. The other 1/2 of the room is occupied by a few heavy wooden high-boy contraptions surrounded by NOTHING for 15' all around, and the odd bar. The room's also INSANELY LOUD.  The bar... a small (10 people?) L-shaped bar that's made of (wet) perforated metal, with the glass washer and taps within inches of where you set your drink, and where the bartender will set your paper menu (in my case literally on top of the glass washer). On the smaller part of the L... seafood on ice. Mmm... how's that beer? Speaking of the beer... great selection, but zero elaboration on any of their draught options. Name, where from, size, pricey price. If I'm spending $10 on a glass of beer I don't recognize, it'd be great to know something about it. Why not write a sentence description? Hopleaf does and some of the best beers I've ever had have started with that little menu. It's the same issue with the food menu... minimal description, maximum price. It spends more time spelling out the exact address of my pig's home than what's on the plate: Pork Short Rib - Wilshire Region County Farm, Whatever, IL with peasant bread, $20 ...or something like that.  Now granted, 75% of the food we had was pretty good (except the ribs, they were INSANELY salty... and I loves me some salt). Summary: Good beer... if you're familiar Mostly decent food... if you're in the know Little wooden box booths... if you're one of the 10% of the people there that get one. Not so much.
