My kids want to give it 4 stars. They loved the pork chops and mashed potatoes. We all loved the extensive menu - something for everyone. For the kids they give you these bendaroos to play with and kids thought they were great toys. As adult I give it 3 stars. Food I give 4 stars. Taste was like Macaroni Grill. Molten Lava cake was very good, but the ice cream that came with it did not taste like anything at all, if that makes sense. Ordered the linguini cabonara, which I thought tasted good. Service was 2 stars. Had to ask for water twice. Water glass was never refilled and sat empty on table the rest of the meal. Dirty dishes were never cleared so we ended up stacking dirty dishes on the table and playing dirty dish shuffle. While we were sitting down the hostess tossed the bendaroos on the table and walked away. Getting a seat is a little impersonal and confusing. The front door actually faces Ontario street (I think). Once you get in, you go to one counter and the guy tells you to go upstairs and tell the person at another counter what you just told him. Then the person upstairs at counter #2 takes your name and # in your party and says something like "go down that hall and wait for your name to be called." Kind of like cattle. Then someone comes up from the other side of the hallway and calls your name and you follow them to the table. I am guessing they do that because the place is so big and noisy. All in all we will be returning because it was a hit with the kids.
