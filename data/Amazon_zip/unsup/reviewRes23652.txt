Delicious creperie, at its second location (first is 5200 N Clark St.). A wide variety of crepes to choose from, both sweet and savory. The merguez (lamb sausage) gets high marks, and their creative concoctions (try the Crepe Marrakech) dazzle the taste buds.  If your preferences are more traditional, you may want to either build your own crepe, or ask what additions are included (e.g., fancy mustards, etc.). The menu selections are a little off beat. Our server was excellent, prompt, friendly, and offered helpful suggestions while we were deciding from the menu. Tasty food, filling, excellent value, and an interesting departure from the average breakfast joint.
