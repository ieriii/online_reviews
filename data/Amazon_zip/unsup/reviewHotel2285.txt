I should say that I type this on behalf of me and only me in case anyone knows me or figures out my organization :-) My experience with the Marriott was absolutely exceptional in terms of event planning. I work for a nonprofit organization that chose to move its fundraising gala to the Marriott from another Chicago hotel. Being a new venue, and ne to the organization and planning this particular event the combination of Amy (Sales Manager) and Christina (Event planner - I don't think that's her exact title) made everything easy and seemless. They were wondreful to work with and the night-of, Christina practically bent over backwards to go the extra mile for us, that's for sure! I really can't say enough nice things- from the tasting to the planning to settling the bill, everything went very smoothly. I woudl say if you're planning an event (conference, dinner, wedding, etc.) this is a good bet. The location is perfect for those who work/live downtown and for those visiting. It's pretty much in the heart of everything. The recent rennovation has made the hotel very colorful and modern, yet still very tasteful. The ballrooms can be modern, elegant, whatever you want them to be. The dinner was amazing and if you get a chance, be sure to include the desserts all made by hand. They are absolutely to die for! Best pastry chef ever! Apparently, everything is made in the hotel and is locally sourced as much as possible. The hotel even has its own butcher shop. I'm going to stop now because I'm starting to sound like an ad. If it balances out the review a little, I will say that the rooms were nice, but not exceptional. You had everything that you needed including a nice big bathroom, but otherwise, I would say they were pretty average. Great views, though. Ok, now I'm done.
