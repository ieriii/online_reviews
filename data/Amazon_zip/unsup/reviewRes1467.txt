"You know how many foods are shaped like dicks? The best kinds." Came here with a couple of friends which meant it was massive sampling time. Classic Chicago dog, rabbit, boar, duck, and pork. Only one I thought that was sub-par was the rabbit, which had so much goat cheese and mustard on top I couldn't really taste much else. Everything else was awesome, the other patrons were jovial and Doug was a pretty chill dude. Protip: Don't sit at a table until you've ordered. On the way home, my roommate was driving..."Right now I'm feeling like I'm in..." I snapped my fingers, "Euphoria!" I was so right.
