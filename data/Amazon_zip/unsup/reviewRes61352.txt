90 Miles is the real deal. My wife and I were looking for a place to eat outside when I remembered hearing raves about this place. The outdoor seating is perfect and the food was even better...authentic, tasty and not over priced. It's BYO so we brought a bottle of wine and the waiter brought us a delicous sangria mix...they also offer a mojito mix if you bring rum. The service was great, the portions are huge and I'll definitely be back.
