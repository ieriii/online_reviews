6 of us sat down and we simultaneously took our first bite and looked at each other in unison and thought, "Damn!" Amazing pizza. The crust is awesome and it's not a deep dish, it's a pan-crust, but a little thicker. Good stuff, I think it's my favorite of all the Chicago establishments I've been to so far.
