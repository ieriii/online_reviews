I first came to Glenn's for breakfast about three years ago. The bowl of cereal for around $5, with refills, and all the choices, like Lucky Charms and Fruit Loops (no comments, please) is a cool idea and reasonable. I have since been back and had other breakfast combos and they were all great. Glenn's really has some unique items. There pancakes are great. Once thing I want to say is that I have gotten poor service here and have had my meals not prepared correctly, either overdone, or not done enough, and they ALWAYS fix the problem. Once they even fixed it, plus took it off my bill. They really take pride in their food and service. Don't be afraid to speak up and let a waiter know that "it isn't quite right." They also have great seafood and great specials. The all-you-can-eat crab on Tuesday is really a bargain and very good too. They also have a shrimp night and a ribs night, both are good. Give Glenn's a try.
