I always feel like a traitor when I say that Chicago doesn't make the world's best pizza; that distinction belongs to Naples, and Spacca Napoli does as good of a job as possible at transporting its diners to this pizza capital of the universe. First off, the space is expansive and inviting; the latter can also describe the staff who, despite the crowds and our lack of reservation, was willing to accommodate our request to hold our table until 6:30 with relative ease. Now for the important stuff: the pizza. All of the pizzas are served on a thin yet impressively soft sourdough crust, roasted to a delectable crisp in an Old World oven. Aside from *maybe* Great Lake, this is the best crust in the city that I have tried. We sampled four pizzas; Funghi e Salsiccia ($14), Broccolette e Salsiccia ($15), Bianco Nero ($16, involving porcini mushrooms, black truffle, and white truffle oil) and a special pizza topped with Guanciale and a fried egg ($16). All of the ingredients are of highest quality; the sausage is spicy and not unpleasantly greasy, the broccoli rabe is bitter but not unpleasantly so, fried egg is cooked to an impressive degree of perfection, and the truffle on the Bianco Nero is easily detectable but not overwhelming. Wine list is long and cheap. What's not to love?! All in all, Spacca Napoli deserves its spot in the pantheon of Chicago pizza joints, largely because it so effectively captures the magic of Neapolitan-style pizza. An absolute gem and a must-try!
