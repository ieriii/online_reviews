This place is seriously a crowded mess! We went on a Friday after an evening of shopping, and were sucked into a chaotic tourist throng! I'm sure everyone there was a tourist, and I know we looked like tourists ourselves! Amazingly, we snagged two stools at the packed bar to wait our 20-30 minutes for a table. All the drinks are exciting and yummy. I started with the blood orange mojito, which was well prepared, but I think I'd have preferred a regular one in retrospect. They aren't shy about the extremely fresh mint, however! At our table, our server approached us quickly. She was attentive and fast the whole night, which amazes me, because the place was packed and it's a huge space. My next drink was the Grand Lux Margarita, which I had blended, and it was one of the more tasty margs I've had around town! Our food came out quickly, and the portions were huge (as our server kindly warned us). My 2 ahi tuna steaks came with mashed potatoes, mashed sweet potatoes, broccoli, carrots, and snap peas! Seriously, all that! The vegetables were very simple and tasty. The ahi tuna wasn't terribly flavorful, but it was fresh and had good color. There was just nothing unique about my food. It was all perfectly fine, but not beyond what I could do myself. It seemed to lack creativity and spark. And it was all fairly pricey, being on Michigan Ave! Nonetheless, I decided to have one more drink....a strawberry martini! This one was strong and tasted like fresh strawberries. This one was also the reason my speech became a little slurry and I suddenly thought Amanda was the funniest person in the world. woohoo! Great job on the cocktails, but the food just didn't excite me.
