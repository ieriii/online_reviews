I finally went to Greek Island for the first time last Saturday! I always hear good things about this place from almost everyone, and I have to agree. Whenever we go out in Greek Town we usually go to Pegasus or to Santorini. Neither of them compare to Greek Island. In fact, I have a craving for it already and it's only been two days. The service was great, but we went early. It was pretty full, but we sat down right away. We ordered the Saganaki (fried cheese) and that was okay. The best part of the meal was the bread that you get when you sit down, the skorthalia (garlic potato puree w/ pita), and the calamari. I ordered the spinach pie and it was okay, but I don't think I like spinach pie. I have had it elsewhere and wasn't a fan either, but I thought it was because it was a bad restaurant. Everyone loved their food and it was pretty inexpensive. The atmosphere is much better than the other Greek Town restaurants, but just be careful walking to your table: the floor is really slippery near the kitchen!
