As many have stated before I am unimpressed by their wait staff. I feel like waiting 20 minutes in order to flag down our server to ask them for our check and then only to wait 10 more minutes before we get it. Really? The drinks which my friends raved about seemed very McCocktail to me. The food was grossly overpriced and very bland. The Mac and Cheese was more bland than the stuff I can get out of a frozen Trader Joes box. I went with four others and none of them were that impressed with the food. In short: Everything is terrible.
