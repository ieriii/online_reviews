What a great way to start off my Chicago Restaurant Week! I went to Kinzie Chop House to celebrate my boyfriend, J's birthday and I was pretty lucky to have ALSO booked it during Chicago Restaurant Week!  For those of you who know what Restaurant Week is, please skip to the next paragraph. For those of you who do not, Restaurant Week is a great opportunity for the average Joe to check out some of the hottest restaurants in the city at a cheaper price! Some restaurants that participate offer a lunch prefix menu for $22 per person and/or dinner prefix menu for $33/$44 per person. The prefix menu gives you 3 to 4 courses and they don't skimp on the portions! It's a great value, especially since many of these restaurants can run you a tab into the hundreds! J had the "Kinzie Cut" Flat Iron Steak and broccoli with cheese fondue (he opted to not try their restaurant week menu) and I had the calamari starter, house salad, beef medallions with mushrooms and mashed potatoes, and chocolate cake from the prefix menu. Let's just say, his entree and side cost a little more than my entire meal! The steak was delicious but the beef medallions were just as tasty although the meat wasn't a steak cut.  Our waiter was attentive and our glasses were filled up often, always a good sign of a top notch restaurant. Although the place is a little crowded and noisy (I mean, come on it's restaurant week) it was still a great experience. Worst part, their coat check system... stick it on a hanger and hope no one steals it!  I'd highly recommend this place for a business dinner or a nice night out for a special occasion!
