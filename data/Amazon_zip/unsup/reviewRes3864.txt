Very possibly the best wings--outside of Buffalo--I've had the pleasure of putting in my mouth. Far better than anything at Wingfest, sadly (though Wingfest remains a revelation). They proclaim that wings should be meaty, crisp, and covered in intensely flavorful sauce, and we are all better for their efforts.
