Had high expectations after being told that this place rivals Kuma's for burgers. Not bad, but didn't meet the hype. First, the cheese curds = awesome. You can't go wrong with deep fried squishy cheese. Burgers, just not that amazing - interesting choices, but I wasn't wowed. I actually wasn't even going to order a burger at first, one of their sandwiches instead, but they were out of the roast beef. The homemade ketchup tasted more like marinara sauce and was a watery mess, I wanted to keep it as far away from my fries as possible after tasting it. Seriously, why reinvent the wheel - don't try to be cute by making your own, just leave it to the experts at Heinz. Fries were yummy though. The waitress was super friendly and nice, which wins some point, and the beer selection was great. So I may give it another chance, just not for burgers, maybe next time I can try the sandwich I wanted.
