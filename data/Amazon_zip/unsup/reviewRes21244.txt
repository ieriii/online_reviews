Don't be alarmed if the waiter sends you through a door that will have you wondering if you are about to be chopped into a million little pieces. This is actually the VIP door and it will lead you through an insanely narrow passageway to a heated back porch. I made reservations here without having gone before (I like to live on the edge) and had a really positive experience. With a group of 13, I'm sure we were insanely loud, but out servers were super attentive and VERY accommodating to any needs that came up. While I didn't try a margarita, I thought my mojito was delicious (and subsequently had a few more). Our appetizers were really good -- we had both the spinach quesadillas and some quacamole -- and everyone (to my knowledge) enjoyed their main course. I would definitely come back!
