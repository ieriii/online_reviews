I absolutely loved this place. I've been to several steak houses around Chicago, and surprisingly found the best mix of service, price and food at Wildfire. Their filet trio was great, since it allowed me to try the horseradish, blue cheese, and double baked potato crustings/toppings. We also had a dessert trio, with key lime pie, snickers pie, and peanut butter cup. This was a great place for a big group, and for a nicer restaurant I found the prices to be very reasonable. Of all the places I've been to for a good steak, this would probably be on the top of my list to take out of town friends. It's been two days and I'm still raving about it.
