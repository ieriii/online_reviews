I absolutely love this place. The ambiance, the food, and the service. I've had their brunch before and it's just amazing. Everything on the menu is just delicious! You really can't go wrong! They also definitely know how to plate their dishes to look amazing. I recently went back with a friend, I had the Grilled laughing bird shrimp and oyster po-boy which was pretty good. It was heavy so be sure you're hungry. But yes of course, it's quite pricey. But it's quite worth it!
