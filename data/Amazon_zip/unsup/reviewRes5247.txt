The pig shaped bowls and platters made me happy. The "french fries from the sea" made really happy. And the nutella, banana and marshmellow cream sandwich put me straight into heaven. Mmmmkay, now that I've gotten that out of the way, Purple Pig has a lot going for it (clearly). Cat L., Molly G. and I opted to try this place out as our celebration spot for Cat's birthday. We arrived around 5 p.m., and snagged a great table on the deck, ordered a French white (dry/light - perfect for sipping), then picked out a few small plates to start with. Up first was the aforementioned french fries (wee little fried fish with aioli dipping sauce), the pig's ear (with a fried egg, peppers and kale), braised baby artichokes (not a fan, but my tablemates loved it), prosciutto bread balls (mmmm), peppercorn salami (very peppercorn-y, which I guess was the point), and my favorite, the whipped feta with cucumbers smear (spread on their toasted mini baguettes). We also added the milk braised pork shoulder to our order (uber tender, and uber delicious), then a slighty heavier white wine (called Suave, as in Rico Suave...or that's how I remembered it, anyway). It was a bit too heavy for me, but not bad. We finished with dessert - in addition to the nutella sammich, we shared the strawberry ice cream with balsamic vinagrette and the butterscotch pudding. Our server was attentive and helpful, and while I wouldn't consider this place heart-stoppingly fabulous, I'm definitely a fan of the cheese, wine and swine.
