I told myself I wouldn't write this review if it happened to me. After LITERALLY months of calling daily I scored a reservation for my husband's 50th Birthday. I was in Chicago for that week - I flew in wine for our dinner (you have to check it!) and purchased stems locally.  The day before the dinner I got a call confirming my reservation. 4 hours before dinner I received a voice mail telling me the restaurant was not going to be open that day. REALLY - 4 hours before?? I really don't know if they actually were closed but I do know that I was in a position where I had little time or access to the internet to find another restaurant on such short notice for my husbands birthday. Oh - in the message they said I could call back and reschedule - IT TOOK ME OVER A MONTH TO GET THROUGH TO THEM IN THE FIRST PLACE! No matter how you slice it, it is a common theme here, very disrespectful.
