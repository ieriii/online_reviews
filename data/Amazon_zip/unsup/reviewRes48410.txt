Sure, we all know the food is great. What you don't know though...Publican has some awesome bathrooms. Now you may think this sounds strange, but a good restaurant bathroom can certainly be cause for celebration. After drinking tons of coffee at brunch (they are fabulous with the refills on the Intelligentsia) a girl's gotta go! Just past the hostess stand there is a bathroom alcove with 3 individual rooms for the ladies and 2 for the men. Of course there are sinks in the loo but why not come into the center of the bathroom hub and wash your hands in possibly the coolest ever washing receptacle/fountain extraordinaire! Bonus they have yummy smelling C.O. Bigelow hand wash AND lotion. Wow, who can compete? Of course the food is fantastic, but would you expect anything else? I was actually a fan of the communal dining table and enjoyed its intimate dining nature. How is it that you're sitting with a bunch of strangers but you feel much more focused on your dining companion? In any case, it also allowed me to focus on the food...and who wouldn't want to?! Thank you Time Out for recommended the ricotta with hazelnuts and stewed prunes (they looked like cherries to me but I'll go with the experts) it was a divine start to the meal! The menu changes frequently (so sad no foie gras pancakes) and I was so happy with my smoked trout dish...it was light but still filling enough that I had to take home leftovers. Check out The Publican (of course - look at all the other reviews that sing the praises of this place!) but don't forget to check out the loo too :)
