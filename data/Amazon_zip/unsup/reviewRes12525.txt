Mojito = yes, properly mashed mint, not just chopped up. Tasted great. Bacon wrapped dates were good, but small portion (4 dates). The Ropa dish was nicely prepared, tasted good, not spicy at all but was flavorful. The plantains on the dish were amazing! Tres leches cake was good. Coconut topping was not very traditional but complemented it well. For the price of dinner considering the area, I thought it was very reasonable. Found parking on the street a block away. Had an opentable reservations for a Saturday night (9:30pm) but they were not needed at all. Sat outside which was nice, and had excellent staff service.
