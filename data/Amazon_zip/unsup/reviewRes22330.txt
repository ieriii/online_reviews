This place is fantastic! What can I recommend? Gyros is always good, as is the teramousalata. I probably spelled that wrong, oh well. Really, everything in this place is fantastic. This is the kind of restaurant that has tiny soda bottles and a guy who wipes off the crumbs from your table with the handy little tool but they don't make you feel like a jerk for wearing jeans. Which is handy because I am always rocking jeans. Check it out sometime, ladies.
