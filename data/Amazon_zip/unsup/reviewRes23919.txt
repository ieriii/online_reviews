Just left an amazing experience. Justin our waiter was helpful and. prompt. Ordered the casado, and its the best meal to fill you up and still have leftovers for lunch/dinner the next day. Also had the banana milk shake, it was delicious. Thats actually putting it mildly. So good i ordered two more to go. One was with oatmeal. I highly recommend eating here. If you happen to get justin as your server, ask him for his suggestions he will help you enjoy your experience Prices : Very good in comparison to the portions Service : A+
