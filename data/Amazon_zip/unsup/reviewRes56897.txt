This is my old time favorite. Great quality and very high quality tasty food. Le Colonial is always consistent in great customer service and excellent dishes.Grilled shrimp on sugar cane, tuna tartar, the macaroon and so much more. Excellent wine line.Whoever does not give this place a 5 star does not understand excellent food.  Perfect all around.
