A great bar. Sort of out of my usual stomping grounds, so I don't go there as often as I should. An amazing and extensive selection of great and reasonably priced beers. Even more importantly, the atmosphere is really relaxed. It's not a cigar chomping, back slapping "hey let's guzzle down something from Germany!" kind of place. Check it out.
