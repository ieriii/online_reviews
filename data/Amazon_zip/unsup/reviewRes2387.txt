I waited in line in 32 degree weather for 45 minutes for this place. I had to go considering all the hype. I will credit them with creative hot dog creations, but most of it was a bit too wierd for me. I should have stuck with my gut and ordered the chicago dog, but instead i went with something that i cant even remember. It had a ton of flavors going on in it and i cant say that i honestly loved it. I did LOVE their fries though. This place is at least worth checking out.
