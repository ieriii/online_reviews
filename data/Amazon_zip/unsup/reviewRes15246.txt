A hidden gem in the heart of Wicker park. First if you find it, props to you.. Then if you get in, you will be enticed in a suddenly magical bar which has awesomely high ceilings and every chair that is soo tall that it makes you look like royalty. The whiskys that were on the menu are phenomenal. It's a super classy, upscale bar that is sure to impress on a first date :)
