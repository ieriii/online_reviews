This place was AAAAhhhhmazing! Great service, great food, great atmosphere. Slightly older crowd at the bar, but everyone was super nice - easy to make friends! But the real fun started when we sat down for our dinner... Drool-worthy side dishes: sweet potato fries (aka crack), lobster mashed potatoes, gorgonzola mac and cheese and black truffle gnocchi - all sides, I know, but soooooo good! You should definitely order one or more of these for the table. We also ordered the seafood tower with oysters and prawns, not really my thing but it was so fresh that I was able to enjoy it with the atomic horseradish. The crab cakes were eh, I wouldn't order again - nothing too special. The warm spinach salad was yummy and so was the Salmon Filet I ordered. The service was perfect, the wine selection excellent and we all had a blast! Highly recommended and I hope to be going back soon!
