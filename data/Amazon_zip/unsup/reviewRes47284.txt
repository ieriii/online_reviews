It's not Kuma's. The burgers are varied and interesting... on the menu. But execution falls short. I appreciate that they were willing to substitute bison meat for hamburger. I don't appreciate the awful stomach ache I had later. And we waited, no exaggeration, almost an hour for our food. Place wasn't packed, our orders weren't complex.  Won't be going back.
