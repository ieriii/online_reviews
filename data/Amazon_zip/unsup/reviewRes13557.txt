Revolution, you're killing me. This time, the Bacon Popcorn was swimming in bacon fat. That was unpleasant. The Polenta fries were just okay. I think we'll stick with the sweet potato cakes, though. Now, the entrees were good. I decided to behave myself (as much as I'm willing to do so) and ordered the Tempeh Reuben. That was really good. It was spicy and savory. The vegan Thousand Island dressing was great, the sauerkraut was good and the tempeh was nice and spicy. I had the fries with it, though, and that was not my favorite. We've had them before and they were phenomenal. This time they were overcooked and in pieces which, for some reason, is a real turn-off for me.  A fellow diner had the regular Reuben which was fantastic. You really can't go wrong in the Reuben department whether or not you eat animals. And, yet, another person in our party tried the Pork Belly and Egg sandwich. It was good, but I'll stick with the Tempeh Reuben or, better yet, the Forest Burger (God help me, I'm a carnivore). As for beers this round, the Repo Man was good, not Mad Cow good but tasty. The Rosa was really fantastic as far as the lighter beers go. The Brown Sound, however, was weird. For me, it was neither here nor there. And that is just strange for a Revolution offering, in my opinion. Also, whoever was pouring wasn't doing the beers any favors (the head was weak or nonexistent). We'll be back, though. I just can't quit you, Revolution.
