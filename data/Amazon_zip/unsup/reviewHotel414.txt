Don't stay here, the you're better off going to the adjacent hotels for a better hotel stay and are more accommodating than the Hilton. The Mariott and Hampton have been a better experience for myself and was just a little more money per night. Paper thin walls that everyone can hear you and neighbors will complain when coming back from the night. You only get one personal warning and the second time they come up they will kick you out by force. We were literally in the hotel for 30 minutes before we were told we were being kicked out. We were kicked out with excessive force by police after trying to negotiate with the manager who was stuck on kicking us out. We had 8 police officers escort people who were quiet by the time the officers came. Not worth the cost for people enjoying the city or even for business trips since everyone can hear everything.  I've already told our sales force to never book any nights here and instead, we go to the Marriott now.
