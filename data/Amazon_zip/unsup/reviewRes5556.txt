Wine, Meat, and Cheese. I mean could it really get any better than that?! Came a couple weeks ago with some girlfriends after work. Has communal tables it was a bit tight for us, but I didn't mind. Had some great malbec, which I got 4 glasses of, whoops...as did my friend, we should have just gotten a bottle. oh well. Cheese plate was good as any cheese plate to me really is, Brussel sprouts were my favorite, actually we got a ton of small plates between 5 of us, and every single one was good. I can't wait to come back! oh and olive oil ice cream, is a MUST
