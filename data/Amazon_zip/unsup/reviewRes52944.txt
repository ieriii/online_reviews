90 Miles opened up their second location in the former home of Calvin's BBQ. We've been watching the place progress over the past couple of months and it's great to see it in action. They definitely had first-day jitters, but the people were incredibly friendly and welcoming. My cubano was fantastic and the plantain chips were a great side. Looking forward to trying a dinner special some time this week.
