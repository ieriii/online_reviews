yum! i went while traveling on business to Chicago with a gf from the area. Thank goodness she made a reservation, the place was packed on a Tuesday. My friend called during the afternoon and the only place they were able to seat us was at the community table. We opted for the sushi bar where we could talk a bit easier.  Our waiter was awesome and made all the recommendations as to what to order. I like when waiters are honest and tell you not to order something and suggest something better. We ordered the chicken dumplings to start which were good, not amazing. The sushi was great. I loved the tale of 2 tunas roll it was my favorite, perfect amount of spice. The fried rice, tuna roll with jalapeno was also great. The rainbow roll had a bit too much fake crab for my liking . All the fish was fresh and the rolls were creative and different. I would go back if I am in chicago again! fun place, would be fun for big group. It is a bit loud so I wouldn't take Grandma here.
