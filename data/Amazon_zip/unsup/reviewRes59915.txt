Why is there a wall separating the bakery/cafe from the actual sit down area? I walked in one door to get my coffee, back through that door, and into the door next to it to sit down in an eerily quiet room. I might as well have snuck my coffee into a library. Oh, wait. Then some really annoying knitting bitches came and sat down at a table right smack in the middle of the room. I was moments away from asking them to stab me in the ear with one of their knitting needles.
