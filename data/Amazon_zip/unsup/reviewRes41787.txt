There is a great quote from Maupin's "Tales Of The City": "In New York, you can have a great job, a great apartment and a great companion, but not all three". Port that to a restaurant context, and you have great food, great atmosphere, and great service. So rare to get all three, and Gilt Bar certainly didn't prove to be the exception. Food - lovely. Nicely prepared, well-seasoned, and attractively presented. That you can make my dining companion's lack luster love of mussels fade for the night while we desperately order more bread to sop up the lemon broth is an achievement all in itself. Atmosphere - again, great. Just man-cave enough without being too dark to put everyone at ease, while still keeping heavy enough furnishings to reduce the overall noise so one can have a normal conversation without yelling. Service - horrible. Why at happy hour with only two other people at the bar and three employees actually at the bar I have to constantly call one over to refill my air-dried glass is beyond me. If the bar experience hadn't turned us off, the table service did. She started off nice and all, but then promptly disappeared for such great lengths of time that it became necessary to just ask any server wandering by for even the most basic necessities - only to then have our server come back all put-out that we asked someone else for something. Really did a great job of tainting the entire experience. But I did start pointing out that you can have two of three, and as they did provide two, I'll give it another go next time I'm in town. But everything else isn't so fabulous as to overcome bad service, so if my next round is like the first, I'll be gilt free skipping this place.
