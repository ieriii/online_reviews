I just went here today for lunch. I had been here once before, quite a while ago. I must say it's great to sit outside here on a warm sunny day. I had a sandwich with romaine, avacado, smoked gouda, and mustard. It was pretty good, but not great. I wanted to indulge on one of their cupcakes but resisted the urge. The decor is clean and fresh. You order at the counter first and then wait at your table with a number for your food. So there is only minimal wait service--they bring your food and then bus it when you're done. Overall, it was okay to good, but not great. It's worth a try to form your own opinion.
