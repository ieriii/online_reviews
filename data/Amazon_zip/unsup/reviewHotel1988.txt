A stylish European style hotel located in the heart of Chicago. Expect large comfortable rooms with stylish bathrooms. Standard rooms have bright blue carpet and marble with flecks of iron so you get a very classy upscale feel from all the light reflecting on the walls.  Larger rooms have hardwood floors and a nice separate sitting area (suite) along with a balcony. Wonderful views abound including views of the Chicago River and Navy Pier on one side and the edge of Millennial Park on the other. Downtown and Michigan Ave. are short walks away. A great spot. We've already stayed their twice and we plan to return once the weather warms up.
