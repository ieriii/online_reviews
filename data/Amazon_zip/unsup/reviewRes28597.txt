CHINGON! I was the only bean face in the place! ("Cara de nopal") I took a peek at topolabampo, looks like a happenin place, will check it out in the future. I ordered the Milanesa de puerco. Good stuff. It was perfect. Juicy and crispy on the outside. Excellent. I tried a few things off of other plates on the table. I'll try the enchiladas on my next visit. They tasted fantastic. For a starter we had some type of sample platter, which was awsome. Best sample platter on earth me thinks. Took a picture with chef Bayless too, that was coo.
