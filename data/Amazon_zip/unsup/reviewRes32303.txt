The food was absolutely delicious, and the Asian-inspired interior was beautiful. Some of the delicious items we ordered included: Baked snow crab handroll, shaking beef, and honey ginger braised beef longribs. Our waitress was awesome and very attentive. The cocktails were so yummy and very creative! I will definitely be back again!
