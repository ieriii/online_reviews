Am I the only person that doesn't really understand Publican? At first I thought maybe I wasn't cool enough, or cultured enough, or pretty enough, or European enough.  I mean, it's okay. The seating is just plain silly and if I wanted to hang out with people I didn't know I'd hit up Craigslist. When I come to a restaurant I'd like to sit with the people I came with, and only the people I came with. Is that too much to ask? I can't hate on Publican too much, as the beer menu is crazy extensive, and it serves Hannah's Bretzels. Also, the restrooms are really cool. But I guess that just sums up Publican...where the restrooms and the pretzels might be the best part of the restaurant.....
