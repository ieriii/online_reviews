This place was just OK for wings. I would not go out of my way to eat here. I thought it was too sweet for my liking. If you have a sweet tooth you will like it. I prefer your classic wings that are more savory and salty. I will say the quality of the chicken was good. Will I return? I doubt it! Unless some friends want to go.
