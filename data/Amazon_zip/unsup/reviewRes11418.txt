I heard that this place was a good spot to go with a group, so on that info, I rounded up a group and called to make a reservation. I had 20 so I wasn't sure how smooth it would go. The manager on the phone was super friendly and he apologized for being booked up on the evening I requested, but he assured me that if we headed up that they would do their best to accommodate us. So we did. We got there at about 830 and it was packed (Thursday night) so we headed to the bar for some house brews. The hostess was great about getting us seated, and she sat 8 of us relatively fast. The rest of us hung out and continued to drink while we waited for a nearby table to clear and clean. Soon enough we had a nice long table for our party, let the pizza ordering begin! We ordered 4 large pizzas. Now these things are huge, they come out on a huge pan (the pizzas must have been 20 inches). Now, I have lived in chicago for about three years and I am a pizza lover, but I dont really like deep dish, you can see my dilemma. This thin style pizza loaded with big fresh toppings was just what my pizza craving ordered. It didn't hurt that I was washing it down with some Cap'n Kickass IPA from the bar. Karaoke started around 10, and it was pretty funny, especially because I'm used to karaoke being in some hole in the wall dark bar, this was a nice changeup for entertainment. I really had a great time here. I'm torn on the rating only because we really did wait a long time for a table, because of how busy it was, and because I was pretty buzzed by the time I ate the pizza (everything tastes better :) One of my new favorite pizzas in the city. I will take the trip back to wicker for this place.
