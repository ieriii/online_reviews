I have a rule that I don't write reviews for establishments that already 100+ people giving them top marks. I figure by the 300th review everyone gets the point. But I'm breaking my rule for Sun Wah. We went last night for the duck extravaganza and now I am completely obsessed. So obsessed that I practicly made a scene at our table and our friend compared it to that part in "When Harry Met Sally"... you know the part I'm talking about. But back to the food, when you order the whole Peking duck it comes out in three courses. First, they bring the whole thing to your table and carve it up right in front of you to eat on fluffy buns with their homemade bbq sauce and garnished with green onion and carrots. Heaven. The duck is juicy and flavorful, the skin is crispy but melts in your mouth and it is the perfect salty, sweet complement to the duck meat. As though this wouldn't be enough to make anyone happy, they round out the meal with duck fried rice and duck soup. This will easily feed 4-5 people and the whole 3 course meal is only $32. We also ordered their egg rolls, which were amazing, and a side of Chinese broccoli which was obviously fresh and came out perfectly steamed. BYOB to top it off ($5 corkage fee) Moral of the story: The best Peking duck I have ever had. Period. End of discussion. Now go order some duck.
