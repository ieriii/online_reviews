i heard such great things about Garcia's but i was not too impressed.. . the food was great.. their garlic marinated shrimp is my favorite... but the customer service is not so great.. My water cup stayed emptied the whole time and the servers made me feel like i was bothering them.. i ordered a sprint and it came out with my check at the end..  and the host in the beginning refused to give us a bigger table bc we had 3 people... he insisted that the table for two would work with an extra seat.. one of the people that came with us had to sit on the hallway where everyone was walking back and forth.. that was a bit annoying.. i might just order carryout next time.. if i go back..
