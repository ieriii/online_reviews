I've had a few of these higher-end eating experiences. Here in the city, I thought Charlie Trotters was the pinnacle. In Detroit, it was The Whitney. But it wasn't until dinner a few nights ago at Tru did I truly understand that "surprise and delight" is still alive and kicking. The valet checks our name on the list, takes the car. When we walked in, I didn't have a jacket so they were kind enough to supply one for me. We joined our party in the ante room. The maitr d' came by, took us to our table, where the pageantry began. We started with champagne -- without ordering, of course. Then we got the first of what we counted as 11 visits from the server: a delicious cucumber bubble with salmon roe on top served on a curvy spoon that looked like a high-heel shoe. This was followed by a series of delicious "treats" through our appetizer and, finally, to the entre. For me, it was venison. Even afterward, when we ordered dessert, we were treated to two additional desserts. I felt satisfied with the portions and didn't feel like rolling out. Every dish was memorable. I don't give it five stars because of the stature of the place -- but I have to say that I was just delighted course after course. The kitchen tour was stunning and very welcoming.
