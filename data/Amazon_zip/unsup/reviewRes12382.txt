We have been going periodically to this place since they opened 15 years ago.  It remains consistently a great value.  Very hospitable service, attentive to detail and the food/flavors continue to excite you.  The drinks are generous portions for the price and the ambiance is genuinely warm and inviting.  There can be quite a wait even with a reservation but the crowd is very convivial and cafe tables near the bar are quite homey. They have a wonderful, killer brunch with hearty bloody marys and, when the summer season is upon us, a lovely semi private garden to enjoy.  Cafe 28 remains a relaxing haven to either be introduced to cuban cuisine or to savor every mouth watering bite.
