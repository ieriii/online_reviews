I've been eating at Garcia's in Lincoln Square for over 20 years, and I still am hard pressed to find anything bad to say about the place. Yes, it can be noisy and the lighting stinks, but the food - oh, the food!! It comes to the table piping hot, & delicious. The portions are huge so don't overstuff yourself with those home made chips and salsa. And save room for the fabulous flan. It's always fresh. The late hours and great Margaritas make it a perfect destination at the end of a work day or very very late at night!
