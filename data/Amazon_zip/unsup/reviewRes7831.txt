The steak trio made this our focus for a recent meat adventure, and I have to say that it was a truly an amazing and unique experience. Meat flying from every corner by men in fancy breeches, how can this be wrong? Everything was right, and I didn't spoil myself at the salad bar (despite the fresh cheeses and veggies), and focused my attention on the meat on the spits. The beef courtiers were courteous, and I dug the way that they'd keep tabs on you so if there was something you wanted, cooked a certain way, they'd seek it out and bring it your way. I don't really know what can be said about this place, other than go here hungry, get a dessert, get a drink, and flip that little disk over. Just don't forget to flip it back or you'll be bombarded by the Latino types ready to serve you their meat. Oh yes.
