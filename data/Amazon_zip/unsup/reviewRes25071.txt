I used to go here often and I always take family and friends when they come in town to visit. It has a cozy atmosphere, delicious food, and a large selection of desserts. The chocolate mousse cup...MMMM. It's not on their menu anymore, but I always get their baked goat cheese appetizer. You can still ask for it even though it's not printed anywhere. I love Artopolis, it's great for first dates and the service is pretty good as well. Once we had a cranky server who got mad because my 2 year old nephew caressed her butt. Otherwise, the servers are super nice.
