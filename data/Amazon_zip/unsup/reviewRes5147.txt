Every time I walked down the magnificent mile, this little nook of a place always caught the corner of my eye, I noted it for future reference, and continued on my merry way. Today was a different day though, and we decided to see what lay behind the iron gate and enticing signage displaying Cheese, Swine, and Wine. As we walked in this Sunday afternoon, we noted that two seats were available at the bar. Now, I learned that just because two seats are available doesn't mean that the space is. Short of rubbing Crisco all over our asses and sliding into two of the barstools, we climbed in and placed our order...10 minutes later. Uncomfortably invading the people's spaces next to us I ordered a vino tinto and le BF ordered the Surprise Grilled Cheese sandwich. I'm Latin and culturally-speaking love close, tight quarters that invade people's personal spaces, but even this was a little much for me. The bar is small and the bartender works only as a bartender, so I really had a hard time understanding 1.) why it took so long to ask for our order, and 2.) how they were able forget to serve me my wine even though I was smack, dab, shoe-horned in front of them. Overall assessment, hopefully not influenced by my "cramped style": Vino tint=great (is it ever really less than though?) Grilled cheese=excellent Service=caca   (For those not familiar with the Spanish word caca, may I refer you to Google Translate:-)
