I'm not a huge fan of Vietnamese food or Pho in general but I decided to try this place because of all the great yelp reviews. I have to say I wasn't disappointed and I would go back again. For starters I had the chicken puffs and I liked that they had veggies in them so it didn't feel so unhealthy with just the chicken. The dipping sauces were interesting, I didn't like the plum as much but I did like the spicy chili sauce. For our entrees I had the sate shrimp. I read on yelp that it wasn't that spicy but I thought it was. They give you plenty of jumbo shrimps in the dish with broccoli, peppers, onions, and cauliflower. The side of rice definitely helps to cut down on the fire. My friend had the grilled salmon noodles and it was also good. The salmon was cooked well done but I think it worked with the noodles and the sauce. Both dishes were very large and I was completely full after eating dinner. As others have said, the owner was there walking around clearing plates, making sure the water was fill and doing his duty of being a good host. I also appreciated that when the dishes came out of the kitchen the server explained to us what the sauces were and just a little bit more about the dish. When we received our check they also brought us strawberries with ice in a little tea cup. This was the perfect dessert on a hot humid day after eating spicy food.
