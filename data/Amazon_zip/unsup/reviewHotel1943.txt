I stayed here a few nights while working on a project. In fairness to this hotel property - I suppose it was true to itself, but it just wasn't me. I just couldn't get comfortable. If you like clean line architecture, modern decor and darkness with smatterings of artificial light - this place might feel like home for you. However, it wasn't just this that I didn't like so much - it was number of things, one being the uselessness of the room set-up. The rooms were clinically beautiful, but the Plasma TV was at such an angle that when you pulled it out to watch from bed, the remote sensor was covered by the molding, rendering the remote useless.  Also, I went to retrieve ice from one of the ice-rooms and my key wouldn't work, so I called down to the staff and they stated that every floor's ice room had that issue (they offered to promptly bring me ice). But I just couldn't help but wonder - every ice room on each floor wasn't functioning? Really? I also didn't like the fact that there wasn't a terrace or any place I could "go-outside" and maybe read a little bit. The property was very constricted and cold.   This isn't about the staff - honestly - they were insanely helpful and courteous. I just don't get the purpose/model of the hotel. It reminded me of going to a pretentious French fusion restaurant where the entrees are big on pretty and small on taste. A little confused I guess. I've been to other W's and they were very nice. This may be an anomaly, but I think I'll check out the other hotels in the area.
