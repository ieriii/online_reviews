This kicked off the New Year just right. Sunday brunch with good friends. Started out perfect $3 mimosa's are we really in the city? Every part of this experience was good. Our waiter was spot on from the moment we sat down. He explained everything in detail as to what we would be eating down to the desert. I started with just small samples before the meat fest began. That is what I came for. No complaints at all everything was delicious. The price and amount of food you can eat is well worth it. It all begins with service and the staff was on top of there game. If your looking for a nice place with good food, service and cost stop here. Best to arrive early for brunch as the place filled up and lines were forming.
