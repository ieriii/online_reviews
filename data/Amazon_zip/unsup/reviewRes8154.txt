Pretty damn good meal. The appetizer (buffalo mozzarella and prosciutto) was fresh and perfect.  The margherita pizza was delicious. The sauce was great, the basil tasty and the pizza had just the right amount of cheese. I don't generally eat the crust with real, Italian pizza because I find the middle (soupy) so tasty but the crust I did eat was good.  The dessert I had, tartufo, was pretty rich. Basically it was chocolate ice cream surrounding vanilla, all covered in a dark chocolate powder (which I loved) and some nuts (which I could have done without). Our waiter did forget our appetizer for a bit but was quite distressed when we asked about it (and in the end, didn't charge us for it). I think overall the service was good, the atmosphere was nice. Long wait times are a reality. But...as a little added bonus, our waiter was dreamy and we noticed that this applies to most of the wait staff.
