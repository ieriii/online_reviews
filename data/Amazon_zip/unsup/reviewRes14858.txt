great food....very tast;y...i had a cuban sandwich with rice and a cup of coffee.....it was all deliciious...oh yeah also had the beans...of course i figured out they have a lunch special that comes with rice and beans so dont order it seperately like i did....the place is tiny fast foodish kinda of joint but its clean and the food is awsome...no tables just counter and stools...yummy for the tummy.....
