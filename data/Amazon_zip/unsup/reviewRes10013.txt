I will never go here again. The food is overrated! Just like the neighborhood it's in. The pizza is supposed to be East Coast because the owners are from there. People from the East Coast will be very disappointed in this pizza. It looks very good when it arrives, but the crust seemed very dry and had a stale quality to it. The sauce has no flavor. We had a white pizza with clams and a red pizza with garlic and sausage. Both were terrible. I told the other couple we went with they could have the left overs. To put this in perspective, I don't think I have ever in my life said I would never eat their pizza again. I've had all kinds. It's hard to screw up a pizza and these people have done it.  Why the hell are the serving trays so big? We ordered two medium pizzas and for some reason they have to be served on metal cooking trays and each pizza has to be served in a single tray. It's like when you are at home and everything else is dirty, you have to use this huge tray you never use. So we could barely move our hands to eat the pizza until we decided to do what the owners should have instructed their servers to do and moved both of them to one cooking tray. Let's talk beer. Again, terrible. I've never been to a brewery and thought the beer was just okay bordering on crap, never. My friends have made better beer in their closets!  I give it two stars because the service was good and the restaurant seem clean enough. Bathrooms...no chance in having an intimate encounter not that I would ever go here again.
