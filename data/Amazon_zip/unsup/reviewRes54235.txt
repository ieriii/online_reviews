I had been told by at least 6 random people over the last year to try Irazu, and I'm glad I listened to them! The meal was excellent, the prices very fair, and the portions were very large. Nearly everyone I saw at every table was bringing leftovers home. Get anything with the Lizano sauce on it- it's delicious! I'm within walking distance of Irazu and plan to stop by often. It got busy on a Friday after 7pm, so get there early or be prepared to wait a bit.
