There's a lot of flair: in the table side presentation, food presentation, and overall atmosphere. I loved the Harvest table and the whole concept of an upscale buffet! It was an enjoyable experience to try so many different flavors and cuts of meat. This is a place for people who love food and company while enjoying it. Great fun for a group!
