My friends and I sat down for dinner outside at Flatwater when it started to rain heavily. We had to go inside and squeeze into a table, but there was a private party and we couldn't hear ourselves think. The waiter recommended we go continue our dinner at the Westin right around the corner. So we sat in the bar area at the couches and had a great evening. It was quiet, the couches were comfortable, and the food was incredible. Not to mention the great ambiance. We were unexpectedly pleased with our meal and experience!
