I am probably being generous with 2 stars but I will probably try this place once more. Service was not even in the realm of McDonalds. My first time there and couldnt help but wonder who does their hiring. Our waiter was a meek little guy, the bald headed guy. I thought he quit after taking our order because we never saw him until after we were done eating. Never brought the things we asked for and I had to get up and go to bar myself after first 20 minutes so I could get my own drinks. He showed up just as I was doing it and acted like no big deal.
