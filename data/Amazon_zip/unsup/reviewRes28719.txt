I've wanted to try this place out for years and finally made the committed visit after a cold night at Zoo Lights. We sat down at the long bar facing the cooking action. I had the Farfalle Pollo and hubby had the Gnocchi Aurora--both recommended by the server as fan favorites. And we both concur--the dishes were delicious. Hearty, fresh and completely affordable. I probably could/should have had leftovers for lunch but it tasted so good, I cleaned my plate.
