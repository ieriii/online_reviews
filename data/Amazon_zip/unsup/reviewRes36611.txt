Excellent food and great sushi.  I think the sushi is better than the thai food but both are good. Really enjoyed the summer crunchy roll (I think that is what it was called) and another roll they had on special. Friends all really liked it as well. Came back and got the pad se ew and it was good but not the best I've had. I will definitely return for some sushi!
