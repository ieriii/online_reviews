Came here Sunday about 9:30 and the place was packed - but it turns around quickly so we were sitting in about 10 minutes (we sat at the bar though - table wait was about 30).  Coffee was great. I just had eggs and toast which were great - hard to screw up. Boyfriend had banana peanut butter pancakes which were delish - and something that I had never tried before. However, I could only eat about 2 bites of them because they were so ridiculously sweet. Cool place, good food, fun for brunch. Have a slightly limited menu, but if you like really decadent pancakes or eggs - you're in luck!
