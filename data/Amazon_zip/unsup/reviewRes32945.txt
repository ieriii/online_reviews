I wasn't expecting to like Ethiopian food. Spongy, sour bread is what I heard, and it scared me. I couldn't have been more wrong. We started with the chicken/veggie appetizer which reminded me of a samosa, and was extremely flavorful and tasty. The accompanying sauce was amazing - spicy, slightly hot and smoky. Once we tasted that, we knew we'd want to order the spicy dishes, so we split the 2 veggie 2 meat combo with spicy chicken, spicy beef, cabbage and spicy lentils. It was plenty of food for 2 of us. Loved every bite of it and never noticed anything about the bread really - it was secondary to all the great flavors of the food. I gave the Ethiopian beer a try - not so great, stick with the local microbrews on the menu.
