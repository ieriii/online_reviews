I went here with fellow yelper, Andrea yesterday morning and got the Lemon butter cream pancakes because the name just sounded so good. When the server brought pancakes smothered with fresh raspberries and sauce to the table, Andrea and I both looked at each other confused and I went, "Oh I got the lemon butter--" But it turned out to be the right order and when I actually took a half second to think about it, yeah... I don't remember even reading past "lemon cream" It still looked good and so did Andrea's omelette... so we took tastes of of each other and her omelette was GOOD!!!... Then I ate most of mine... I mean the pancakes themselves had a lemon buttery flavor and were just the right texture... The raspberries were fresh and made the meal perfect with its sweet tartness... Oh... my mouth is watering right now even though I just ate! p.s. that wait I keep reading about though... hmm I don't know... maybe if they handed out those buzzer things or gave people the option of being called on their cellphones when their table is ready then yeah... i'd do the wait... otherwise... naaaah...
