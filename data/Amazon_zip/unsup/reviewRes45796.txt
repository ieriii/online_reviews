I live close to Wilde and go there often.  They did a ridiculous job turning what was once a True Value Hardware into an amazingly beautiful Irish pub. Atmosphere-wise you can't go wrong. Food-wise, you can. Wilde is not consistent. That's their biggest problem. I've had some fantastic meals here and other meals that were both awful and made me sick. Here are my specific tips: Stay on the menu and avoid specials. They have killer mac n cheese but be warned before making out, there are whole cloves of garlic in it.  They have great burgers as well and most of their traditional Irish specials are good.  Their corned beef is marred by the fact that they shred the cabbage and serve it slathered with too much butter. I prefer their brunch to dinner but again, there are goods and bads. Their eggs Benny is awesome but the lox/bagel platter has lox that are clearly artificially colored and leathery dry and rough.  On a plus side, great bloody's and two dollar domestic bottles on Sunday! Overall, I love the bar but am disappointed that, after several years in business, they can't get it all right.
