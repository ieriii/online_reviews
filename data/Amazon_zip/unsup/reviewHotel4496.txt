I booked this room for New Years Eve a month ahead of time. For the price I paid I believe I got a great room with a 32in LG LCD. The location is excellent being at the center of everything and the room's were cozy but still comfortable. The King sized bed was soft but was still able to get my full 8 hours and I own a Tempurpedic King at home. The room size was more than what my girlfriend and I needed. The only thing that was not so great was the view but that could be from my specific part of the building I was at. I could not hear my neighbors and I know that my entire floor was booked. I had excellent customer service from the front desk. Beautiful lobby! The security at night was tight but this was understandable since it was New Years Eve. I just showed them my key card and was let in no problem. There so was much anger for those not allowed back in without cards. They seemed to have quite large egos and made huge scenes as if they were not allowed on a life boat during the sinking of the Titanic. I I turned around and said "First class passengers and women and children first only my good man" then I got flicked off. No Humor in people anymore.  The toilet was powerful enough to take down a spicy Thai dinner and the toilet paper was nice and soft. Great water pressure and warm/hot water for the shower. All around a great stay.
