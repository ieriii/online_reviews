Inventive, enlightening and definitely the best restaurant I've been to in Chicago. The service was phenomenal -- my dining companion's spoon was shifted at the last minute during one course as the wait staff noticed that he was left-handed. (Impressed, he said the last time he had this level of service was at the Bangkok Oriental.) Our 12-course degustacion was memorable, and we were even treated to a tour of the pristine kitchens afterwards. Chicago is truly world-class to have a restaurant like Alinea. As a transplanted foreigner, I rate it on the same level as Spoon.
