Maybe we made it on a slow day but Sunday at 11:00 am and only a 20 minute wait, that made us very happy. The four of us had coffee in the lounge area in the bar while waiting and had to settle up with the bartender for our coffees before heading to our tables, that was a little odd. Food was very good, we were all happy with our selections. Service was attentive without being smothering. Serving portions great and priced in the mid-high range. Oh, they have parking. Would definitely go back.
