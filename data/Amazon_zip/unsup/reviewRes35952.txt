I can't believe I just found out about this place! I loved it so much the first time, I had to go back the next weekend. Plenty of reviews here to describe what to order, so I'm not going keep repeating what everyone else says. This could possibly be the best value in Chicago. My friend and I split 2 meals and ordered beers and got a $12 bill. Its laughable!
