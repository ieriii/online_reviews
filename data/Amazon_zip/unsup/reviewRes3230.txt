Buddah, You helped me achieve a brief window of enlightenment. Thank you very much for your scrumptious belly filling fried egg topped treats...  The buddah bowls are a must for first time Crisp-ers... The bowls come loaded in good vegetables (carrots, spinach, zucchini, bean sprouts, etc) and they are topped with an juicy liquid filled fried egg... Top it all off with your choice of chicken, beef or tofu and my friends, you are in the zone. One of the best parts of the bowl was the side of Korean hot sauce (Gochujang) that was just the perfect amount of added hotness. Although the sauce comes in a small container, it has a perfect consistency and it packs a punch. You gotta try it out in your bowl! What more is there to say about Crisp. Food comes fast, it's healthy, tastes great, is cheap, the staff is fun, and the environment is really welcoming. Crisp, I will be back and ready to challenge your epic Fried Chicken Wings.
