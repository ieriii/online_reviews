Love this place. Great food. Dining in service is a bit slow but I never have problem with my pick up orders. I recently tried their Costa Rican iced coffee with horchata and I love it. The right taste of coffee with the right hint of sweetness. Totally replaced my regular cup o joe with the little green woman on it. The staff is also super sweet. =)
