I am surprised by some of the poor reviews - especially the TWO reviews that talk about shards of glass in the wine stems! I actually really like this place and have never had the inkling of a negative experience. Reasonable prices, decent food, a CHEESE BAR!, and great seasonal flights. I can't wait to bring my friend from San Francisco here this weekend!
