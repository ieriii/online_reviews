Great place to stop by for a bite.  The guy manning the cashier was very helpful in explaining the difference between the fried chicken sauces and even let us split our order - half seoul sassy and half crisp sauce. And it was finger licking good! Seoul sassy is my favorite. Also ordered the baby buddha bowl, which is more than enough and essentially your bi bam bop. Good fix for Korean if you don't have the time to head up north. BTW, love the cute chick logo.
