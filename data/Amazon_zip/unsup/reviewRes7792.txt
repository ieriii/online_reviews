I was at Fogo de Chao for the first time a few weeks ago and boy was I impressed! I can't believe I never heard of this place until I heard the commercial for it on ESPN radio (yea, go figure). The meat selection was unbelievable and extremely satisfying... I ordered the flank and wow the peppery crust on the outside was a perfect contrast to the tender, juicy meat on the inside. This meat just melted in my mouth! I also had my eye on the pork, but I was so full after eating the steak so I decided to save the pork dish for my next visit -- which no doubt will happen! They also have an extensive list of sides, and the wine selection was superb! The pinot noir they had on hand was a perfect match to go hand in hand with my steak. You will have no trouble finding a fabulous wine to accompany your meal. As for the layout of the place, it is gorgeous! The decor is terrific with a cozy atmosphere. You definitely get the sense of being in Brazil when you eat here. The parking options are limited as is with many Chicago restaurants, but trust me your parking worries are well worth for what is waiting for you at this place! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this restaurant to any meat-lover! I can not wait to go here again and try their variety of delicious meat options!
