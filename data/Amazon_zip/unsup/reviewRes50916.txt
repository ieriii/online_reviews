I like this place. I mean, I'm vegan, and there aren't a ton of options, but the Veggie Burger was pretty good, and my girl seemed to be satisfied with her chicken sandwich. The server was super sweet. AND THEY HAVE SWEET TEA What really sold this place for me was the adorable jazz band they had and the %15 discount for cyclists! Pricing wasn't bad, and the place is cute. I'm gonna go back...
