A small group of about 10 of us counted down to 2012 at this restaurant. We didn't want to spend an obscene amount of money and we wanted to have a low key NYE where people weren't going crazy. Bad Apple was exactly what we were looking for. We made a late dinner reservation for 9 PM and started off with few rounds of appetizers and drinks. Our table shared the fries, cheese curds, goat cheese fondue dip, olives and the poutine. I tried everything except the fondue and the poutine. I loved the curds which had a breading that was similar to tempura. The fries were ok, and we felt like we overdid it with those since they came with most of our entrees. I heard that the fondue and poutine were wonderful. Our service was wonderful. The waitress was very attentive and even split the checks for us which saved a huge headache at the end of the night. We all ordered different burgers and sandwiches for our entrees. I had the PB&J sandwich while my husband had the Strange Famous veggie burger. My sandwich was OK, and his veggie burger was interesting. I think we probably would have enjoyed them more if we didn't stuff ourselves so much with apps. By the end of the night we were trying to calculate in our heads how much the total would be. We were pleasantly surprised to see that our total including tax and gratuity were even less than our estimated subtotal. Overall, I was pleased with our experience.
