This is one of those places I'm not quite sure why I keep going back to... I guess it's likely because it's close to my 'hood and nothing is ever really terrible enough there to keep me away for good. I guess it's kinda like giving birth (not that I'd know)... it's a far shot from a great experience, leaves you feeling kinda icky and is truly undesirable on the yay-o-meter but after a substantial amount of time passes you think 'hey, that wasn't so bad, I guess I could be up for doing it again' and it's not until you're pushing a ten pounder outta your... well, you know... that you realize some forethought may have been useful prior to jumping right back in to suckville. So yeah, that's how I feel about Wishbone. It's not the worst brunch in town, it's definitely a far cry from the best but there is nothing so terrible about it that keeps you away permanently. The food is alright. Mine always seems to need a ton of salt to taste flavorful though and the service is meh. I've had servers who whispered, servers who smelled, servers that left their shift and went home in the middle of my meal and servers who seemed to just not give a shit. The best part is I've actually waited in line on a Sunday all to just get that experience. I'm not sure why, but at a minimum I guess it explains why some families have 13 kids... poor short term memory, just like mine.
