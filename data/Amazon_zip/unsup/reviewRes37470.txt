After numerous visits for their extensive beer selection, I finally had a meal here. I ordered the CB&J - cashew butter & figs - what a delicious combo to have in my mouth! Only complaint - a bit on the greasy side, but that should be expected due to the nuttiness. The mac n' cheese on the side was pretty good, but for some reason it wasn't as creamy as I hoped. Overall, the food was good, I'd try it again as i have heard it can be hit or miss on some items. Please get your consistency together & make everyday a good day for food. I love their beer selection and the bar itself, hence the 4 stars.
