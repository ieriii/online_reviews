Wow! My hubs asked me if I wanted lunch while we were in the City. Hmmm, lunch in the City or back to the burbs? Yeah, I want a City lunch. We agreed on Hot Doug's. The line was not too terrible, the rain kinda sucked, but when in Rome...... I ordered a chicken sausage sante fe style with duck fat fries. Yum! My husband had whatever came with fried plantains. Wow - plantains really do make everything better. Soda has unlimited refills. Thanks! I liked that there was enough seating. The counter guy was great, all servers were polite, helpful and professional.
