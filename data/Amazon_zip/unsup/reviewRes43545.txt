Thanks to the wonderful shops on Division I actually find myself in this area quite a bit on the weekends which means brunch at Milk & Honey is inevitable. And what a delightful inevitability! Everything I've had here has been great. From a really tasty array of rotating baked goods to the juevos rancheros. Brunch at Milk & Honey is just great. Despite such a great menu and daily pancake special I usually find myself ordering the orange brioche French toast. What can I say? I'm a sucker for brioche. And this French toast is out of this world good. A nice hint of orange topped with tasty toasted almond slivers and maple syrup? My idea of a good time! Also the portion is HUGE. You may be inclined to split it but for around $6 bucks an order you may want to hoard it all yourself so you can take the leftovers home. Pop it in a toaster to crisp it back up and you have a great second meal. Occasionally I make it a little too late for breakfast and I order myself a sandwich instead. The sandwiches are awesome. Tasty bread choices and a variety of fillers. Not to mention house made potato chips on the side. YUM! Their granola is also wonderful. They sell at a number of retail locations in Chicago but you can also buy the bags right there in the shop. A variety of flavors and even a reduced fat option means there's something for everyone in the granola department. They have a few cocktails on the menu should you want a beverage with your meal (the boozy lemonade is a favorite of mine) and their plain old unsweetened ice tea is one of my favorites in the city. A nice sized outdoor seating area is also available for people watching on a warm summer day. A few months ago they extended their hours to include a dinner service. I haven't tried it yet but I'm anxious to give it a go!
