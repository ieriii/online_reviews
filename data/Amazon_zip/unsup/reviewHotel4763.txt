Our reservation was for 2 people. Two people whom were not a couple. We were given ONE King bed room and told that's all there was. This room was book well in advance but we were treated as if we walked in off the street. This over priced room small as a closet, to make it worse early am I was woken up by the people in the room next to us having sex. I'm no prude but I could not believe the walls were that thin. No worries it was over quick, LOL and I was back to sleep. Getting my car from valet the next day was another story in its self. Bad Hotel, Bad Service!
