Fox and Obel is one of those places I go to and it instantly makes me feel happy. It's a great place to go for unique specialty items you wouldn't normally find at Dominick's or Jewel, as well as simply browse around and look at all the tasty treats. The bakery area is my favorite! I love the white chocolate and sour cherry sugar cookies, fat boys (two cupcake tops with a creamy frosting filling in between) and cinnamon swirls (a cinnamon bun/sugary roll). I can never leave without at least one of those three items ;) They also have delicious deli items - unique take & bake pizzas, sandwiches, sushi and guacamole - as well as tasty cafe meals. I love their breakfast - the pancakes, bacon & potatoes are sooo good. I would get here early on the weekends, though, as the place can get very busy and seating is limited. Once Oprah designated their oatmeal cookies as her favorite, touristy women have been coming in drones ;)
