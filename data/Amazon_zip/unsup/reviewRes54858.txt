I love Hopleaf. Everybody I know loves Hopleaf. It's the best gastropub I've ever been to, and one of my favorite places in Chicago.Hopleaf has the best beer in Chicago -- everyone knows that. I don't think I even need to say anything about the beer -- it's truly the best in Chicago. But the food is incredible, too. The CB&J is awesome -- simply awesome. And the fries are the kind of fries I find myself daydreaming about. Oh, delicious fries...Everything on the menu is great. My girlfriend swears by the Heirloom Tomato salad, the onion rings are amazing, and the mac and cheese side is exactly as good as you hope it's going to be.If you're vegetarian, it's the kind of place where you take a quick look at the menu and pretty much know what you're getting. (They used to have a polenta dish that was one of the best things I've ever eaten in Chicago. Alas, they don't have it anymore.) That being said, vegetarians will eat very, very well at Hopleaf -- the food is great.The only problem with Hopleaf is that sometimes you can't get in. There have been a few times that I've gone there, found out there was an hour and a half wait, and then gone somewhere else. Other times, I've walked right in. It's hard to say what your wait is going to be.In any case, there's a reason it's so popular -- it's extraordinarily good.
