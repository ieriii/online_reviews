This place is amazing! I couldn't stop eating the homemade BBQ potato chips and pickles. I'd seriously go back just for that. I had the pulled chicken sandwich with coleslaw. I loved the four sauces they bring out. The service couldn't have been better. They are so attentive. The only negative thing I felt was that it was extremely loud in there, to the point where it was hard to carry on a conversation with the person I was with. I've been thinking about Chicago q ever since I went and I will definitely go back!!!
