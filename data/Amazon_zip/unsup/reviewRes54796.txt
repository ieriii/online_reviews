Hopleaf is ALWAYS crowded... and for a reason. Correction: Sometimes it's easy to get a table in the dining room, but the bar is ALWAYS crowded. The beer list is extensive, and the food is great.Everyone talks about the mussels - and with good reason. They always have 2 styles on the mussels. On my last visit, one of them was Spicy Thai Curry (sweet potato, jalepeno, cilantro & lime). Our waitress recommended those, and we loved 'em. They come with a mountain of frites... we loved them. Also... the CB&J (cashew butter & fig jam, with raclette cheese on grilled sourdough) has to be tasted to be believed. Served with their mac n cheese, these two dishes were enough to satisfy two hungry people (along with a couple choices off the beer list).
