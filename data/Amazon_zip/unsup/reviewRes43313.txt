This place is pretty good. I'd rather they had table service though. Instead, you wait in line to order and then get a table. They bring the food to your table then. To me, if you're going to bring food to a table you can go to the table to take an order and hand out menus.  I had the smoked turkey reuben. It was good but there wasn't anything really special about it. Just a sandwich. It came with homemade chips which again were good but not anything special. If I were in the neighborhood and wanted a quick bite I'd go there again, but I wouldn't make a special trip.
