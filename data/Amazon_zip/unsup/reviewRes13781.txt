90 mile cafe ME LIKIE! They have some pretty tasty sandwiches there papa rellanes are pretty good. The soup was super salty but ok HMM I dont know I'm a big lover of Hispanic non Mexican good Puerto rican Cuban south american etc., and i have not reveiwed many of the GREAT puerto rican cuban places i have been to because i have just started yelping. So with that said this place is just ok. The quality is Excellent its a very small and clean place threre ropa vieja was really good there cuban sandwich was ok. My brother likes this place a lot so i have been there a couple times.Overall its good its clean and the prices are alright. A little over hyped but the food id good. HAPPY EATS PEEPS! P.S. Cuban coffee THATS A HUGE WAKE UP COFFEE! EYES WIDE SHUT!
