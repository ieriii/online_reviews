A below-average Hilton. Don't book a block of rooms here for your wedding or other event. 1. If you're planning wedding or other event for which you need a block of rooms, don't do it here. They will claim to give you a "good rate." Then you will find yourself either (A) explaining to your guests why should pay a higher rate than necessary when they can get a better rate on their own, or (B) eating the cost of the rooms you reserved because your anticipated guests all got the lower outside rate.  2. Then when you do get someone to agree to help you out and give you a more reasonable rate, you will find that the rest of the hotel "didn't get the memo" and spend several hours on the phone. You call your contact, who will assure you that it will be taken care of immediately, only to find that nothing continues to happen. Then you get to call again. I think of it as the "Chicago Hilton" cycle. 3. And this is totally petty and unrelated, but a friend of mine stayed here and when she walked into her room, she found poo, i.e. #2, on the floor of her supposedly clean hotel room. These things happen, it's true. But it makes you think. (They were, admittedly, kind enough to give her a different room.) 4. The have a nice pool that my mom likes.
