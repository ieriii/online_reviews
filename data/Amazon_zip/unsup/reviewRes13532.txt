Hmmm, I think my expectations might have been a little too high for this place. A lot of people who told me how great it is are vegetarians, and I can definitely see how the menu is great for them. The veggie items were a big part of the menu, without overwhelming the menu. And the place is super cute, with a great microbrew feel. However, the food, and even the beer, fell a little short. For appetizers we got the mussels and the pretzel. The pretzel was soft with a decent cheese sauce - pretty standard. For the mussels, we ordered the chorizo ones and the server accidentally brought us the blue cheese ones. They ended up being free, so on the service side it was fine, but they really weren't that great - and I'm a big blue cheese fan! For entrees I had the twice baked potato pizza, and the rest of the group had the smokehouse pizza and the smokehouse burger. My pizza was fun, but ultimately kind of bland. The smokehouse burger was also pretty unimpressive. The best was probably the smokehouse pizza. As far as beer - I live closer to Piece, and it still has my heart in microbrew world.
