I love Sabatino's ... just not near or on a HOLIDAY. My hubby and I went there to celebrate Valentine's Day early this past Saturday. What is normally a relaxed and wonderful evening turned into a nightmare. We arrived 20 minutes before our reservation to have a drink and were told we would have to be seated immediately. We were then lead upstairs and seated across from the hallway with glaring lights leading to the bathrooms/kitchen at a wobbly wrought iron yard table disguised with a table cloth. The waitress rushed us through our meal to usher the next poor saps to the table that shook and popped up and down every time we attempted to cut our food. Where we normally treat ourselves on special occasions and spend near $300, we dumped only $70 and were happy to quickly walk away from the experience. A lesson learned.
