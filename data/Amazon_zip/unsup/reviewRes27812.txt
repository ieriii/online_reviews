Annoyed. The multi-course tasting menu I made the mistake of going with was littered with chef-indulgent follies that arrived as lavish smears and scatters on the plate but left little to linger on the palate. With one notable exception: the foie gras lollipop covered in Pop Rocks left a film on the roof of my mouth.
