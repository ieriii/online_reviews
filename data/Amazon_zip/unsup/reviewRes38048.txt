Every time I think of this place my mouth waters, I start smiling, my stomach rumbles and just like that the day has gotten better. (see-just happened again...) Giordano's is now a bit more ubiquitous than when I lived there, however, it's still *that* good. It was the only pizza place I know of people would go and wait for an hour to be seated, full-well knowing that it would be 45 minutes for the pizza to get there. And great piles of dippy-damn that pizza rocks. I'm not a spinach fan, so the first time I was there (with veteran giordanoans) they tricked me into the spinach-stuffed pizza. Because of that I now love spinach, and every time I go there it's still the one I order the most. The pizza pies are about 2" thick, *loaded* with your stuffing of choice. Beer crusts, multiple cheeses melting everywhere with hints of virgin olive oil drizzled all over. ... sorry, I was having a moment... Needless to say I enjoy it immensly. It actually took a couple of months to work up to being able to eat 2 or 3 pieces at one sitting. huge. tasty. also great for left-overs. Don't know if they still do it, but for a while you could actually get a *subscription* to their pizza, anywhere in the country. Tell them what you want, when you want it to show up; they would 1/2 cook it, flash-freeze it and UPS it to your doorstep then bill you monthly. Now if only they could pop up in Dallas....
