SALTY! I'm really torn to write this review. The atmosphere was typical hipster, fun, busy, comfortable and the first round of small plates were great. However, service was lifeless, shoddy, awkward, mismatched and the main entrees were salty. Now, I know this is a pork-centric establishment, which is a naturally salty food but everything we selected (four people at the table) all had really salty food to the point we just couldn't eat it. After speaking to our server she suggested the scallops from the small plate menu, which turned out to be chewy. The scallops were delivered to the table by the restaurant host who then happened to say that our issue was not the first time they had heard this comment and chuckled, saying the chef can be a little heavy handed with the salt. For my first visit I was just really disappointed and left the restaurant feeling embarrassed and salted. I was not worried about the wait and that wouldn't be a reason to deter me going back, but the entrees would be a big stumbling block for me the other three diners.
