Trying? Too hard? I am speaking of the Hostess, who was trying to hard to be, I am not quite sure, the verbal dance we had to go through to get seated was unnecessary, luckily the gentleman host jumped in and saved us from ourselves and the Hostess; figuring out a seating plan...  The food, the service, the atmosphere; smashing! Beef tenderloin tar tar - um wow! Foie - Phenom Fresh fig and greens - Yes please! Gnocchi - Delish Fries - Disappointing Four Roses and Miss M - grand supper companions! Coconut crme mocha diner pie - hmmmmmm I am a fan!
