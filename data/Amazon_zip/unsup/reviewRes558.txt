Could this place receive more than 5 stars? What a fun dining experience! We did the full tour and it was better than I could have imagined (although if you look at their menu, you realize that it's pretty hard to imagine what you're going to get). I also did the wine pairings and they were delicious. I am dying to get a bottle of the Riesling they served with a later course. Despite 24 courses, I never felt overly full. Truly an experience -- and we went into the kitchen afterward, which was a treat!
