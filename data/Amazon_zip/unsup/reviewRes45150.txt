Hands down, the best Italian I've had in the city so far. I absolutely love the atmosphere and decor--it really sets the mood for a wonderful evening. Our server was incredibly friendly and helpful in recommending some dishes. Their menu changes weekly so the bucatini amatriciana may not be there for long, but I highly recommend it if you see it on the menu! It was absolutely decadent, how well the flavors played on each other and left the palate very satiated. The chianti braised pork shoulder was a delicious appetizer that literally melted in your mouth. Speaking of wine, of which they have a great selection, they were very generous with the serving, which I always appreciate. If you want to treat yourself or others to a superb dining experience, Anteprima is the place to go.
