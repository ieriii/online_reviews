Great beer selection. They have Three Floyds Gumballhead on tap which is enough to make me happy but lots of other good beers too. I'm usually here to drink but had dinner once and the food was good. The downside is that this place can get crowded. They also have a great outdoor area in the back in the summer but you still have to go back in to order drinks. They have a third floor which could alleviate some of the congestion at the main bar but you can't get tap beers. Overall great beer selection but some downsides make it lack perfection.
