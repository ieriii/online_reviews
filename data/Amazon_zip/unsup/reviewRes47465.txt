Cheap, delicious & great service. What more could you ask for? Oh yeah, and now patio seating! Who cares if it's like Kuma's? The burgers were amazing (the one with kimchi was fantastic), beers were cold & there was a pretty good selection to choose from. Despite what some of the little nitpickers on here say, this place is a great addition to the neighborhood & we'll be back!
