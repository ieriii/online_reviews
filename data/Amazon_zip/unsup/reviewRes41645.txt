This was one of the best experiences I have ever had at a restaurant. Our waiter was very nice and very funny. He always addressed us by our names, which I thought was an interesting touch. Our steak was amazing. Cooked perfectly. My friend and I also shared the spring salad and the broiled tomatoes. Both were delicious. Since it was her b-day we got free cake as our desert. I could go on about this place for hours, but instead, why don't you go check it out yourself!!!
