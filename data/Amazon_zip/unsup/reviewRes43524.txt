I have only been to the location on Damen near the Blue Line stop, never the larger store on Division. I have been here several times, and always have been impressed with what I have ordered.  The banana cupcake with peanut butter frosting kind of changed my life. And turned me onto peanut butter frosting, which if you have never tried...you must. As soon as possible. Breakfast sandwiches are great. Simple, fresh, very tasty.  Good selection of baked goods, light sandwich menu, but all seemingly good choices.
