Stayed here 10/15/11 because its fairly close to the united center. Booked our room back in August with a 72-hour special, still paid $156 for 2 people for 1 night. Figured that's just the city for you. We were totally excited because the website makes the place look amazing. However, the website is TOTALLY misleading.Parking is in addition to your room. The valet was adequate, its $33 to valet your car or $28 to park it yourself around the corner. The lobby is okay, looks tired and old (not in a good way). Could use a remodel. We stayed in the Buckingham Wing, which I guess is where all the smoking rooms are. There was a stale smoke smell in the hallways and the room. The tiny elevator reeked of some kind of cleaning agent, which was okay I guess. The room was very basic, which is fine because we were only staying one night. Their website boosts beautiful views, but our room was across from Colombia college, and a fire escape. You can hear everything going on in the hallway and the street below. Got hungry late at night (around midnight) so we found a pizza place nearby called Pauly's (or something like that). The area is okay, not great. I slept on top of the sheets and without a pillow, I was terrified of bed bugs. We couldn't wait to leave in the morning, if that tells you anything about the place.
