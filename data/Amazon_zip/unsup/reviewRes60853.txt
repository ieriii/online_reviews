This is a great restaurant if you are looking for something different. The steaks are as good as any other all you can eat steak house, but the sides and appetizers are unique and delicious. This restaurant might possibly have the best atmosphere of any restaurant I have ever been to. The lighting was a little dark, but there was a big open fire in the middle of the restaurant.
