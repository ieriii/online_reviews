Came here recently on a Tuesday night for dinner with some co-workers. Nice outdoor patio and a very attentive waitress who managed to treat us like we were her only table when she was actually the only server for the patio area. Helps that the clientele are also fairly laid back. Jailhouse/Metal theme is fun without being intimidating. 5 stars for atmosphere and service. Overall, 3 stars though as the food was just alright. Excellent Mac 'n cheese, $1.50 "burger beers" and the homemade potato chip basket is a nice touch but the burger was nothing to write home about. I was really geeked to try the "Cruetly to Animals" which had all the trappings of a gluttonous meat feast (aka pretzel bun, huge patty, creative extras and interesting flavor combinations) but the carnitas was so salty it almost ruined it. (which isn't to say I didn't stuff myself with the leftovers the day after...oops my b!) I didn't mind paying $6 for it (Oh yah! Tuesday nights are half price burgers!) but if I'd paid full fare, I might be even more disappointed. So if you're in the neighborhood early or late on a Tuesday night (we finished around 7:30 and there was a pretty healthy line as we were leaving), Lockdown is certainly not a terrible spot to indulge your carnivourous cravings. Way not as good as Kuma's, Fat Willys or Owen & Engine, but definitely better than DMK.
