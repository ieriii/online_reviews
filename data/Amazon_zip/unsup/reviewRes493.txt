We went here for our 1st year anniversary. This was definitely thematic to celebrate our 1st year "journey" through life and the journey we went through with the Tour menu and the wine paring. As with any journey in life, you experience the same emotions with the Tour...surprised, pure ecstasy, shocked, delighted, humbled, flabbergasted, laughing (especially when you experience something completely unexpected in your mouth), satisfied, maybe in tears (when its over and you have to pay the bill). If you could experience a lifetime of emotions in 5 hours, wouldn't you want to understand how food could do that to you?!?! I know...weird that food can do that to a person, but that's the only way I can express how extraordinary Alinea is.
