My boyfriend and I stopped by Milk & Honey Cafe Sunday morning for breakfast. We were super excited as we love trying new places. Unfortunately, this visit left us extremely disappointed.  The food wasn't good at all. This is a hard review for me to give as breakfast food is usually hard to mess up. But here is my option... I ordered the orange brioche french toast and he had the granola pancakes flavor of the day nectarine. Both came out looking amazing and with a huge scoop of butter melting on top. This is where the beauty ended. The brioche was already SUPER buttery so the additional butter made it almost sickening. I added some syrup, but it was difficult to find the flavor of maple with out almost drinking the syrup. The pancakes on the other had were super dry and the granola had a strange crunch that tasted like stale nuts. Lots of butter and syrup were needed to make them remotely moist. The "flavor of the day" only meant some nectarine slices were placed on top. Sorry Milk & Honey Cafe, but we won't be back. All we are left with are achy stomachs.
