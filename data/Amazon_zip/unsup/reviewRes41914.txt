this place hits the spot every time. the pho is so good and the broth...oh man! the sandwiches are also great picks in case you're not in the mood for pho. spring roles have great texture and the stuffing is really fresh. often times, you may be seated at a roundtable with other customers you don't know. this reminded me of my childhood days in hong kong.
