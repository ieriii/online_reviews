I dream about this place. My most recent trip to XOCO was on Wednesday. Having read all the Yelp reviews for the Wednesday special Pork Belly Torta, I wanted to give it a try. YUM. Really good, but really greasy. The bread, as usually, was crispy and delicious while the pork, cheese and bacon melted in my mouth.  My friend got his usual, the Shortrib Red Chile Soup. He loves it but wishes it came with a side of rice.  This was my fourth visit to XOCO and I've never had a long or annoying wait, but I do tend to go right after work (5-ish) to miss the rush. The service has always been friendly and helpful.
