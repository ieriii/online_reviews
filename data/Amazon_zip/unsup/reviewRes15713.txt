I was torn between giving Calo a fourth star or not, because when I went, my palate was still thick with the after-effects of the flu. Still, I'm glad my guy took me here for a late Easter Sunday lunch, because it was a little reminder of my roots on a holiday. The mozzarella was good, the octopus well-marinated and properly cooked, and my chicken saltimbocca hit the spot, while he very much enjoyed his gorgonzola gnocchi. The quality was solid but unexceptional, portion sizes were on the absurd/large side, prices exceptionally reasonable, and both the hostess and waitress were thoughtful, prompt, and friendly. I'm favorably inclined, and plan on revisiting to try the veal and see about whether there's a fourth star here, perhaps unfairly withheld. June update: I went back, and yes, that fourth star is deserved. I had an outstanding pollo saltimbocca and washed it down with a tasty South African white. It was perfect for a warm day, the service was cheerful, and I can consider this an open question tidily resolved.
