Love this place! 90 Miles provides a fun, unique atmosphere with great food! This would be a good place for groups, but we just went as a pair. Our server kept our beer on ice (BYOB) and made some excellent recommendations from the menu. Everything we tried was really good (portabella mushroom, bruschetta apps and bistec steak and pork dinners). The prices are a little higher than we expected them to be, but whatever. It was a really fun place and I look forward to going back and trying other things on the menu.
