Wildfire is an experience! I have been 3 times and will be back many more times because it has never disappointed. It is always a 5-star experience!  I hate when people complain about the price at a restaurant or bar, so I will never write a review in which I complain about prices. When you go to a place like Wildfire (located on Erie in the heart of Chicago), expect to pay a good amount of money. This place is definitely worth every penny so stop complaining. The food is exceptional and the atmosphere is tremendous from the minute you walk in. It is shocking to read reviews that say the service here was not good or even terrible. The service at Wildfire is great and many people I know have complimented the place specifically on the waitstaff's service.
