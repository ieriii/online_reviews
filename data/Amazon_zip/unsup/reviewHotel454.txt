I came to Chicago on business and was initially supposed to stay downtown; however, a colleague recommended this hotel--and I am so glad that they did! The attention to detail and finishing touches in my room are what made this hotel feel like home. Staying in a smaller hotel allowed me to connect with the local Chicago vibe, while simultaneously enjoying exquisite service from the staff, at a fraction of what it might cost to stay in a Magnificent Mile high-rise. Considering the quality, ambiance and charm of this hidden Chicago treasure, it made my trip a memorable experience. Not only was I able to secure a bike rental to avoid the high cost of renting a car, but I also was directed to some of the local galleries in the West Loop by the friendly staff members.
