Met friends from out of town for brunch here this morning. Our party was large - 9 to be precise. They don't take reservations on Saturday mornings, so we waited. And waited. And waited some more. It took about 45 minutes, but were seated at around 10:30AM. The place is cute. It's bright and friendly. Once we were seated, the service was good.  I ordered corned beef hash and eggs. It came with fresh fruit and toast. Everything was good and the portions were large. In fact, the bread was probably about half a loaf of rye bread. With nine people, there was a lot of variety at the table - Belgian waffles, Omelets, French Toast (with different fruit flavored breads) and even a cheeseburger. Everyone seemed happy about the food. I didn't have coffee (I'm a Starbucks addict), but was told the coffee was good and strong. If you like your coffee sweet, they only have Truvia or sugar. The price was fairly reasonable. It's a long haul from our house to get there. (10 minutes to the train station, an hour on the train, then a cab ride to the restaurant.) So, it's unlikely we'll return. But, if we lived in the city, I would try Yolk again.
