I went to Mastros for a company dinner on Saturday night. Dinner reservation was for 6:30. Surprisingly they were ready for our party right on time. For appetizers we got the oysters on the half shell, king crab claws, sauteed shrimp, tuna tartare, crab stuffed mushrooms and the caviar. All were very good. The sauteed shrimp and the crab stuffed mushrooms were my favorites. I am not a big caviar fan but the others in our group really liked it. One person in our group ordered the French onion soup and said it was some of the best he has had. Most of our group ordered the Tomahawk steak which was excellent. I ordered the lobster which when it came out looked a lot smaller than the advertised 2.5 lbs. Still can't complain because the lobster gnocchi and the lobster mashed potatoes made up for it. Two thumbs up for sure. For dessert we had the butter cake and the triple chocolate cake. The chocolate cake was a little over the top with how big and rich it was. For being a big dessert guy, this was not my cup of tea. The butter cake on the other hand is without question in my top 3 desserts I've had in my life. Unbelievable. If you go to this restaurant and do not order this, you are doing yourself a disservice. Our waiter was very attentive and gave great recommendations to ensure a pleasurable dining experience. I have to give them 4.5 stars. The food was worth 5 stars without question but I have to knock them a half star because it is so expensive. Mastros just made my top 2 favorite restaurants in Chicago with the other being Joe's Stone Crab.
