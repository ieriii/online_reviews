This is the best Indian food I have had in Chicago, which still is no comparison to what I've had on the East Coast. Much of the food lacks flavor. It's almost as if they tried to "American-ize" the food to appeal to the American pallet. I like my Indian food spicy and flavorful. The buffet had a large selection. The best thing about India House is the free Tandorri chicken. The samosas were tasty and the Naan was excellent as well. The buffet and soda's for two people came to $45, which is expensive compared to the other Indian buffets in the city. I'd say if you have Indian food newbies and some money to burn this is a great place, otherwise try some place else.
