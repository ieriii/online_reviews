All I have to say is Hamachi Carpaccio. I am always with a bunch of people when I come here and we end up sharing this dish (which I always insist on getting). The problem is then I have to share it. Don't get me wrong - I love sharing types of restaurants - more to try. However I must admit that I just want to eat the whole plate of thinly sliced hamachi served with a thin slice of jalepeno, a cilantro leaf and some spicy chili oil all by myself.  Now that I got that off my chest... everything else is good as well. The atmosphere is a little too hip for their own good in my opinion but I'm kind of averse to places that think they are very trendy. I love the crunchy spicy tuna and white dragon and they often have interesting special rolls as well. Prices can get a little steep if you order the more interesting rolls but the byob factor saves cash so I guess it all evens out.
