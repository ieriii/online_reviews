It's okay. I booked Hotel Indigo on Hotwire for just over $80/night after taxes and fees (it's a 3 1/2 star hotel in the "Gold Coast" area, if you're looking to Hotwire it..), and it was a decent place to stay. Like everyone else, I can't help but be confused by the beach-ish theme. Coming here in the dead of winter, it seems.. incongruous at best and somewhat taunting at worst. Smallish rooms, but clean and well-appointed. Free WiFi. The location is good, definitely in a cooler, hipper, more residential area than Mag Mile or Loop hotels I've stayed in before, but the hotel itself if nothing spectacular. Free caramel Andes candies in the lobby. I doubt I'd pay full price for it, but - like nearly every hotel I Yelp - it was a good Hotwire find.
