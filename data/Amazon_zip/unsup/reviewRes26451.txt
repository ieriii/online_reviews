Okay, this was the one time that Yelp has failed me. I was in the neighborhood with a friend and we decided to drop in here due to all the fantastic reviews. I also ordered the pineapple calamari, according to what everybody has said about it. Even though the presentation was good, it was waaaay too salty. I ended up drinking three glasses of water and continued to feel thirsty for the next four hours following the meal. We also got the avocado and cream cheese wonton appetizer, which was just a sad, sad take on the crab rangoon. All in all, not super delighted by the experience.
