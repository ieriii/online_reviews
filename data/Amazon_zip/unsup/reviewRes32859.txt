I would not say that I am an aficionado on Ethiopian food, but this place was fantastic. I have read some complaints on the service, but I thought it was just right. It is a place where you go for a relaxed dinner. The appetizers came out promptly and our dinner arrived withing minutes after we finished them. The food was excellent and there was so much of it! After I went to this restaurant I recommended it to friends and coworkers. The servers were nice and happy to offer suggestions based on our meat/vegetarian preferences and spice tolerance. I enjoyed the artwork and decor of the restaurant and the space had a warmth to it. I definitely will go back and recommend giving it a try.
