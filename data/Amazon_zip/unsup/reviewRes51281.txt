First off the Margaritas are great! The price is phenomenal for the amount of food you get! The burritos are enormous, be prepared to take half home and the Al Pastor is the best I've ever had!! The have a small outdoor section, that's great to enjoy the Lincoln Square activity. Everything is very clean, including the bathrooms! The staff is very friendly as well!
