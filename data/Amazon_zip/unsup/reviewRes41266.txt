I LOVE this restaurant. My daughter lives in Chicago and very near Tank Noodle Restaurant. We walked past and saw some very impressive looking food so we had to go in. It was very very busy but so worth the wait. I ordered the spring rolls and the bahn xeo (rice crepe with pork and shrimp). They were both amazing - the spring rolls were unbelievably fresh and the bahn xeo was light and crispy, full of pork, shrimp and bean sprouts. My daughter had a tofu curry (she is a vegan) and was extremely happy with her choice (there are plenty of options for vegetarians and vegans). I plan on eating here every time I visit Chicago.
