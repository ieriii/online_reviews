Great food although not outstanding. Tastes like any other Chinese place. The portions might seem smaller but they WILL fill you up. Pros:Starts off with Chinese restaurant tea (love love love!)Interesting menuChinatown mall location!Great orange chicken CleanQuietCons:The waiters -.- I told the guy 5 times I was a student and he never marked off the student discount on my bill. The have a sign for student discounts! If you say so then please do so. I will definitely come back one day to try their other dishes!
