I'll keep this short because if I get truly started I will never shut up about how great Piece is. Their beer is the best in the city. Even my beloved Goose Island Brewpub doesn't come close to the Dark'n'Curvy Dunkelweisen at Piece. Their pizza is the best thin crust you will find in this city or any other. And lastly the hosts at the front must have side jobs as CIA operatives because they can find you with no more than a 4 word description in a bar jam packed tighter than a can of sardines without even yelling your name over the cacophony. Every time I go out to eat in my neighborhood it is a palpable effort to not come here instead of trying a new place.
