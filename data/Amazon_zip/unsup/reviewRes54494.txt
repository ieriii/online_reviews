This place probably has the most attractive waiters I have ever seen. I had the Philly Cheeze Steak sandbo and it was awesome. I also had a mean Banana PB shake that was so rich and creamy I didn't want to share it. Lastly, the Banana Split cake was super good. Moist and full of flavor. The price is pretty neat and the diner seems to always be busy meaning they have incredibly fresh ingredients.
