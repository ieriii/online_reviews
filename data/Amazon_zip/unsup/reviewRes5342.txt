You can take my review for what it is worth because I didn't order dinner. I decided to follow up my ahi tuna that I had elsewhere with dessert and wine. The place was busy and had an energetic vibe. I pulled up a seat at the bar, slightly self conscious. The bartender was nice and was particularly good at suggesting food and wine pairings. I had read about the Sicilian Iris, which is a fried brioche filled with ricotta and chocolate chips. I thought to myself, holy mackerel that must be amazing. However, I wasn't that impressed. It lacked moisture, almost as if there needed to be more filling or some sort of sauce with it. I would like to go back for a real meal though because the dishes that people were eating around me had me thinking- second dinner?
