WowWowWow!!Where to start!! I have nothing but great things to say about Texas de Brazil, located just a hop skip and jump from State Street in beautiful downtown Chicago. This elegant restraurant is a meat lover's heaven. The experienced servers journey their ways throughout a maze of tables with their eyes open for your card. If you flip it to green be ready to be bombared with almost all thirteen of their different meats (try the Picancha!!!) and they will continue to come until you flip it to red. With the gochoes roaming the restraurant with thier sword like skewers it is an amazing experience. This family friendly restraurant is begging for your reservations and when you do I suggest requesting Antonio as your waiter (He was as good as they come.) If your looking for a quick and efficient server he's your man. I went with my girlfriend for my birthday and he pulled our chairs out for us to sit down when either of us got up from the table and filled our glasses up when ever we were running low. He always seemed to be around the table which was very nice. Have I mentioned their salad bar which is filled with a bunch of little fun foods and exravagently decorated. The salad bar is located right next to a sushi bar It doesn't get much better then that. Oh wait it does because you still have your pick of any of their amazing meats!! A 2 story high wine wall filled with basically any wine you can think of!! Are you kidding me!! and watch a trained acrobate shimmy her way up the wine wall to get the wine of your choice.The worst part about it is that I can't go there for dinner every night!!!
