I found that after leaving California, I'm having a hard time finding a good Mexican restaurant. One day as my friend and I were driving back to the city from Lake Geneva, we decided to try a restaurant in Pilsen. I mean, hey, it's where all the Mexicans are, right?? Her friend recommended this place to us so we decided to give it a try -- later on, I found out that her friend is a vegetarian. I wanted meat though!! Anyway, so I asked the waitress if they serve pozole. Nope, they do not. She recommended that I try menudo -- beef tripe soup. I wasn't sure about that so she gave me a little saucer sample of it. Thank you for the sample, but it was not at all what I wanted. In fact, the tripe soup was almost foul-tasting. I ordered a chicken enchiladas plate, and it was very dry and very cheesy (not so great for the lactose-intolerant such as myself). I almost wanted to dump the entire salsa onto it just so that it'd be a little less dry. I refrained... In the end, I didn't finish the enchiladas and I definitely did not finish the tripe soup. I left the restaurant still hungry. It was very disappointing.
