My friend introduced me to this place since we were hungry and just so happened to be around Pilsen. The food was great. I don't think the server quite understood what I ordered, so my order was off, but I dealt with it and it was still great! I had their steak tacos. To me, all tacos taste almost the same--some better than others. This was one of the better ones :) I forgot the name of my appetizer, but it consisted of melted cheese with a sprinkle of mexiacn sausage. Very cheesy and fattening, and need I say more, I loved it! Be sure to bring cash because they don't accept plastic. Boo....
