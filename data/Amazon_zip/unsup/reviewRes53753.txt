The green mill is a Chicago landmark for a reason. Great music almost every night, incredible ambience, good drinks and I think the staff is very friendly. The jazz music is some of the best I've seen around, and green mill can provide a fun change on a Saturday night. Can be a bit pricey but...Last time I went it was the after hours jazz party with Sabretooth.
