For our last night in Chicago I'm convinced we could not have chosen a better restaurant. We were looking forward to this restaurant and it more than exceeded expectations. we had the Carne Asada A La Oaxaquena -- which is a ribeye steak with black refried beans, plantains and homemade guacamole on the side. I have not had a better tasting steak in my life. It had just the right zing, there was plenty, and the price was a steal -- I'd have paid twice the price for that dinner. The restaurant was kind enough to seat us even though we came later than they usually allow (10pm), and service was speedy throughout. The only complaint is that, because this restaurant is so popular (because it's so good), it was noisy as can be, it was hard to have a normal conversation without raising our voices. I would go again! If you're ever in Chicago, it's worth taking a stroll over to Clark St and waiting for a table. Rick Bayliss and his staff have created a wonderful taste of Mexico right in downtown Chicago!!
