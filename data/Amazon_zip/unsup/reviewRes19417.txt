Always a tremendous experience. I've been here a few times for lunch and dinner, and just had my first brunch there with my wife and infant daughter. I had the amazing Eggs Benedict w/ rabbit hash and watermelon, and my wife had an equally terrific Corned Beef Hash. Decadent and delicious. We followed the brunch with peanut butter beignets w/ bananas, caramel, and peanut butter ice cream. Needless to say, it was unbelievable. The staff was very accommodating concerning our seven-month-old daughter. They offered a high chair right away, and the manager on duty offered to park our stroller out of the way in the front of the restaurant. I love the Gage; it's simply one of the most reliable and best restaurants in Chicago.
