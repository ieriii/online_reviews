I went here with my fiance for our anniversary and we loved it! The location is great. The look and feel of the restaurant was very romantic and comfy (even for a Saturday lunch!). We both had vegetarian entrees and enjoyed it. We really really wanted to try the Pho but unfortunately it had beef pieces and we are both vegetarians. They had no vegetarian soup options which was a let down. I would definitely go again though because the food and service was excellent!
