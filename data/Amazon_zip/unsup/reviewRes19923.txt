A friend recommended Fontera Grill for my visit to Chicago. When I found it was a Rick Bayless restaurant I made a point to try it but cause I was busy with work we ended up not having time. So me and some coworkers stopped off at XOCO before we headed back to LA. We all ordered the some hot chocolate and shared some Churros. The Churros are really nice with the chocoloate dipping sauce. We ordered the Classic hot chocolate, Aztec and one with almond flavor. The Almond was a little weird. Server said the Aztec would be spicy but it wasn't. I had the Classic and it was nice. The refinement of the fresh cocao beens is very subtle but noticeable. I ordered the Woodland Mushroom Torta and the Pibil to go since the server said they would keep well on the plain ride home. I ate half the Mushroom on the flight. It was ok. Took it home and popped it in the toaster and it was much better. The bread just came to life, crispy on the outside and soft and fluffy inside were it had be alittle hard when it was cool. The salsa's are really what make push the sandwiches over for me. They're flavors are undeniably robust. My coworker got the Seafood Caldos. While it was a little on the salty side it was actually really good. I'm not a huge soup person but this had a lot of layers. The fish was tender, the potatos firm but not raw, the veggies were crisp and mixed with the soup it was quite nice. The perfect kind of meal for a cold Chicago night.
