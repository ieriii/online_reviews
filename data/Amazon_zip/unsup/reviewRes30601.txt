My stars have not changed but I do want to add something.  I have now been to Sunda many, many times. This is the type of restaurant I want to dislike due to the crowd but cannot because they consistently deliver great food. I cannot speak to their wait staff because I tend to sit at the bar or the sushi bar (to avoid long wait times). At the sushi bar, Jesse de Guzman is an A+ chef and host. Jesse knows I am a sashimi eater and a sushi purist, I ask Jesse bring me whatever he recommends and he hits the nail on the head every time. The sushi is always fantastic, but on my last visit he gave us some hot food as well as a sashimi platter. We had a warm Brussels sprout salad and I was so impressed. A big shout out to Sunda for managing to stay consistent with their food.
