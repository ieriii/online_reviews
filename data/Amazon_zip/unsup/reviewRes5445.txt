I love this place. Small plates, able to taste lots of different items, great wine list. Went Wednesday late afternoon and got right in. We had the wagyu meatball sliders, beet salad with goat cheese, almonds and rosemary cooked in pork fat (YUM!), shredded brussell sprouts with pecorino romano, chorizo olives and the pork rillette. The sprouts and rillette were wonderful. A great evening with friends and fabulous food.
