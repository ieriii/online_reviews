Not the best Cuban food in town but certainly a decent try, everything is toned down from the authentic Cuban dishes to accomodate its more.....not so authentic customers. While the local was great and service was friendly, the authenticity of the dishes where far from Cuban and has since only been toned dowm more, aim for La Unica if your really looking for great stick to your ribs Cuban food  =)
