I love this restaurant. I really like to try new places, so there are few restaurants I visit repeatedly and frequently, but Noon O Kabab has quickly become a standby. It is perfect for almost any occasion- date night, casual dinner with friends, family in town, etc.  The food is fantastic. I have tried many of the kebab plates, and am constantly amazed at how juicy the meat is, perfectly seasoned and with a slight char on the outside to build a more complex flavor. The chicken, ribeye and salmon kabobs are my favorites. The appetizers are also wonderful, particularly the out of this world baba ganoush (the best I've had) and hummus. And while it may seem a bit silly to mention rice, the rice here is amazing- so fluffy and with a saffron accent; it is the perfect complement to the kebabs, absorbing their juices and becoming even more delicious. And then there are the tomatoes. A charred tomato comes as a garnish on every kebab plate. They are so amazing you can order extras in sets of 2 or 6. At $2 for six extra tomatoes, it is an amazing deal, healthy and packed with so much flavor I can't imagine a better "side" to the kebabs and rice. They're perfect. The one negative comment I have could just be personal preference, but I do find the baked desserts to be a bit too sweet. One or two bites of any are the most I can eat. That said, the ice creams are devine, particularly the strawberry and chocolate mint, which seem to have only the slightest amount of sugar acting as the perfect balance to the cream and highlighted ingredients. The portions are also very large. My husband and I often will split a two skewer kebab plate. Particularly with an appetizer, this is plenty of food for us for dinner or a late lunch, and 9 times out of 10 we have enough left over for a second meal for each of us. I've read in some Yelp reviews that other places are cheaper, but when you consider that you could get four meals out of a $16 plate, that's a fairly unbeatable value.
