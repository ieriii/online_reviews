I did this place last week as a little overnight get away. I also did not know that they damn restaurant show was in town as well and half the show was booked in that hotel. Anyways, it's in a fantastic location and everyone I dealt with at the hotel was extrememly nice and helpful. It was a horribly rainy day when we arrived, but the lobby was spotless and fresh smelling. We were checked in quickly and got our free cookies... WOOHOO!! (Got one later too!) The room was spotless with a great view. Extememly quiet and the bed was like a cloud. So much that I took an quick hour nap and forgot who I was... or was that the Jameson... Up, out and on the town to the Cubs game for an awesome night and wrapped it up with a free breakfast in the hotel the following morning. Again, good tasting, clean, plenty of staff and friendly!
