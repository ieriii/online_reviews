I always have a tough time figuring out exactly what I'm going to order, but I always love what I have. We love Bin 36 because we have great service, enjoy the food and its location across from HOB makes it an easy place to have dinner prior to attending a concert. The valet parking works out great for this as well as we made a quick get away after the concert.
