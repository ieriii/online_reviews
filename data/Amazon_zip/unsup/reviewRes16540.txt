Escapism. Minimalist decadence. Parisian blue decor, high back chairs, marble bar. Trimmed in white. Order the dark and stormy. You'd expect to hear Beethoven. For those who have qualms with the doorman- be polite and you will be treated politely. This is a very pretentious establishment so be warned. I've walked right in with no problems while others before me were told there was a 45 min wait. It's all how you carry yourself. Dress appropriately and read the rules in the lavatory. This is not a neighborhood bar for ordering shooters or being obnoxiously loud. You are paying for the experience. Act accordingly, bring your best manners. Enjoy yourself. This an excellent dwelling to loose yourself in fantasy. Even for an evening.
