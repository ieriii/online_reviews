My partner and I have dined here several times over the course of the last year and every visit proves itself as why we keep returning. Great food, whether you're in the mood for something casual like pizza or for something a bit more full flavored such as steaks, chicken, or pastas. Everyone in our most recent party enjoyed their meals - black scallions, filet mignon, chicken alfredo, and the skirt steaks were the dishes ordered, all receiving nothing but praise. One thing that could change? The tacky live pianist who butchers a many classics with his homage to bad karaoke.
