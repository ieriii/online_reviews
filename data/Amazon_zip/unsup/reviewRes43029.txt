Didn't have a reservation, so we were told it would be a bit of a wait. We sat downstairs at Curio which was a very intimate little bar area. Not feeling, however, the rather expensive cocktails, we opted for a cheaper beer and were satisfied. Our wait though was only about 15 minutes which was a happy surprise. We went back upstairs and were excited to try some dishes. We had a pasta dish and the steak which were both super good. I'm always leary of pasta at non-Italian places, but this one was very good. The steak was tasty too, needing no other seasonings. Over all we were very happy with the meal and will definately be back.
