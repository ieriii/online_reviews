Booked a two bed standard room only to arrive and find they only had a single bed bedroom available (wish I'd known this before I booked the room for $200 bucks!). Manager told us that they would inform our third party booking site (Expedia) that they wouldn't charge us since they didn't have the kind of room we wanted. Instead they informed the site that we stayed in the room for 2 hours (instead of 5 minutes) and that they will not refund our money (wish they would have told us that before we left!). All we wanted to do was stay in the room with TWO beds that we booked. Be careful when making reservations, as what's advertised is not necessarily what's available.
