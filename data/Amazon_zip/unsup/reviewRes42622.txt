DO NOT GET THEIR THIN CRUST PIZZA if you want a thin crust pizza. It's not thin, more like hand tossed, maybe even thicker than that. Pizza Hut does a better job on their thin crust. Im serious. But their stuffed pizza is really really good. And their daily specials are super cheap. If it wasn't for the stuffed pizza, this place would only get 1 star....
