Ive been living in Logan Square for about 4 years now, and I can finally say that I have found a place that I would like to call home. The food is incredible. I recommend trying to pork belly served on (I believe) a pumpkin risotto. Also, there were more whiskey selections than I could even count. Ridiculous. Also, they have a juke box that plays 45's. I cannot remember the last time I saw one of those. I could go on and on. But you seriously need to try this place for yourself. I love it and so will you.
