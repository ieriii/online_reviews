Great decor and really swanky. The "Living Room" lounge which also serves as the hotel's lobby is nicely decorated and a great place to grab some good grub. Right in the the middle of everything, you can walk to the El and River and Magnificent Mile. Good luck with finding parking though and I would suggest you just account for having to pay $55 / day for parking - at least you'll be able to come and go as you please. The room I got was contemporary with hip furniture and stuff, but it was super small. eh. Good times none the less.
