Holy Moly!! I love a place where my caricature is on the menu!! (wink wink--Hi RJ!!)  RJ Grunts is one of my fall-back restaurants when I don't know where else to go. Here's why: 1. decent salad bar that takes you back to salad bar's roots (pun!) It's not the salad bar you'll find at Fogo de Chao, but it's seriously good. (be sure to try the weird cream cheese & chocolate chip dessert thingy--soooo good. and I love the tuna salad--but don't mix the 2 together--yucky!) 2. great wings--the extra hot are really spicy 3. temperature soup! (cost of the soup is the temperature of the lake--a great deal these days!) 4. yummy burgers 5. fun drinks 6. milk shakes 7. Rockin' 70s tunes My main con to this place is how crowded the tables are, and the small bar area.
