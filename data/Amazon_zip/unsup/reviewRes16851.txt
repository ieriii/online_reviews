I have been to India House in the past and ordered delivery as well. Overall, I have been pretty happy with India House. However, I will never eat here again after my last experience. I went to India House on 9/24/2011, and found a rubber band in my samosa. I had eaten about half of it, and found the rubber band as I was cutting into the remaining half of the samosa. I WILL NEVER EAT HERE AGAIN!
