I would stay here again for two reasons: the staff and decor. The front desk concierege were able to help us find a place for breakfast and hailed cabs in the blink of an eye. I especially love the saltwater taffy at the front desk. No crummy mints here.  I love the bright, yet calming seashore themed decor. You forget that you're in the middle of downtown Chicago. You can leave the metropolitan Gold Coast and step into your own seashell. I really felt comfortable here. How often do you hear "outdated decor" in reference to a hotel? Not here. No way. Very chic, very relaxed. Worth every penny.
