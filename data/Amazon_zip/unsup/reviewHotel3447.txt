Stayed here on Dec 17th, to be close to MagMile shopping experience. Great location, easy walk to shopping, dining, entertainment venues. Hotel was great, very clean, all personnel was very nice. Yea, the elevator is slow...and small, yea, some of the rooms are smal tool, but it's a very cute, clean, budget friendly boutique hotel. I'll go back there again, maybe we even started a tradition of Chicago Christmas shopping?
