I like culinary adventure and that is what's delivered by Graham Elliot.....and very well I might add. To start, my choice was rather conservative with a beet salad nicely paired with mixed greens goat cheese and hazelnuts. Then we were presented with a complementary amuse bouche of wings and foi gras. An interesting but delectable combination. The main course was the raison d'etre of the meal...the grilled rack of pork prepared in a root beer barbeque and served with white peach chutney, grits and collard greens. All in, a very memorable dining experience.
