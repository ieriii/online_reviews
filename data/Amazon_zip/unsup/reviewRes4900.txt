Very good tapas dishes, and well priced at that. The only drawback is they don't take reservations. They have a variety of tables, some of which is communal seating, and others are just regular tables / outdoor seating when it is a nice day out. Service is pretty good - only drawback is they just bring dishes as they come out of the kitchen, so not much "ordering" to how you're served. Dishes that I would recommend for future diners: - Prosciutto Bread Balls - Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg - Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs - Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes - Octopus with Green Beans, Fingerling Potatoes & Salsa Verde - Chicken Thigh Kebabs, Fried Smashed Potatoes & Tzatziki - Wagyu Sirloin Tip with Fingerling Potatoes Red Onions, Olive & Bone Marrow Vinaigrette
