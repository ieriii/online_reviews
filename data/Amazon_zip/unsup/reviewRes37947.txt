This place is awesome! Not only is the beer selection great but the food is too. There may be a wait....but it is worth it. Just sit at the bar and drink some Belgium beer. As for the food, go with the mussels which are delicious that come with fries and this yummy garlic mayonnaise, and the sandwich listed as the ham and gruyere....it seems simple compared to everything else on the menu but it is one of the best sandwiches I have ever had. The waiter also recommended it to me. I have been thinking about this sandwich. Im excited for the next time we go here....it is a must.
