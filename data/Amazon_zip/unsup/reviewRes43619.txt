I have always avoided coming here for brunch bc it's tiny inside, but figured in the freezing rain we'd be okay...not so, the place was PACKED. We were quoted a 40 minute wait but the food that was coming out looked so good....and milk n honey always delivers. So we stayed, were given a a number, and incredibly people came and went and we were seated w/in 15 minutes, our drinks came immediately, and our food not too long after. The walk up and order system can be annoying, but they seem to have it down; nothing was messed up w/our order and it came quickly. To the food. The sandwiches are killer...blt, smoked gouda avocado, rueben, homemade potato chips. Great salads, homemade lemonade, yummy pre-cooked gourmet foods to take away. This morning we went w/the 'huevos rancheros casserole style' w/a side of avocado...phenomenal. Almost ever table had someone w/this dish. This place can get crowded, but it's well worth the wait. Make sure you grab a lavender-lemon cookie to go.
