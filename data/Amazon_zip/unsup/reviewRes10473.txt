Killer pizza with an outstanding selection of toppings! They also have a brewery featuring their own beers on tap. Unfortunately, like all other Chicago brew pubs, they don't take any chances with their beer brewing. All ales, no lagers or pils style beers. C'mon Chicago brew masters, quit being pansies and stray from rich mediocre ales!  Staff is always very nice. This place could use a real air conditioner installed as well.
