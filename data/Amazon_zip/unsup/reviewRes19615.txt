I know I am the last person in the world to try Sushi, but in the spirit of expanding my horizons... why not. Full disclosure... I don't eat fish, always found fish to taste "fishy" and if Fish wasn't "Poison" why is the French translation Poisson... So, Reservations for 6:30, immediately seated, water glasses filled and the our server (Greg I believe) stopped by to open our bottle and tell us the specials. As a Sushi Virgin I have no idea what I am looking at on the menu so I deferred the ordering to my guide through this ordeal... Start Asparagus wrapped with Beef in a delicious sauce (hey baby steps I'm in a Sushi Restaurant). Now the adventure begins... White Dragon Roll, Crunchy Tuna Roll and an item not on the menu a Jalapeno roll. I know, I know, not to adventurous for all you cool kids that are versed in Sushi. To my surprise I survived and actually liked it... a lot. Asked our server for a recommendation for a final roll. He came back with another item not on the menu that had Caviar dabbed on the top with a Japanese leaf that was similar to Basil. Me Caviar? Delicious. For my first foray into Sushi I have to say I will be back to be a little more adventurous. My lovely guide took it easy on me and for that I appreciate it. Thank you Coast, now I can't bail the next time someone mentions Sushi.
