One of my favorite pho places. Pho reals. Inexpensive food, delicious food, short waiting (for the most part, but I never come at peak hours), and fast service. The environment is casual, well-lit, noisy and kind of fun in its' own way. Never had any of the pho after a long night, but I bet it is the best hangover cure.
