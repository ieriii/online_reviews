How to build trust with your patisserista* by Peter Kaplan 1. Wander back and forth endlessly between two gorgeous delices: the Michelle and the Dee. Note that there are no other customers to hide behind. 2. Engage your patisserista Rae in an extended discussion of the pros and cons of each. Begin attracting attention and pity. 3. Ask your friend Meg what she would do, but then, without being excessively dismissive, decide you're unwilling to go with her judgment anyway. 4. Sheepishly ask your patisserista Rae -- who shows no sign of running out of patience -- which she would pick. Secretly hope it's the one you're secretly leaning toward. 5. Listen, confounded, as she picks the other one. 6. Determine that you still can't decide, and ask your patisserista Rae to just make the determination (but don't tell!) and bring it out to the back room where you'll be waiting. 7. When your patisserista Rae appears after 2 minutes that felt as endless as they were brief, absolutely love that she didn't flinch and brought her suggested Michelle despite your hopeless waffling. 8. Make sure to smile and blow a kiss on the way out. 9. Write a Yelp review two months later in the fool's hope that Rae will someday read it. Love, Peter _____________________________________________________________ * The word "patisserista" is copyright 2010 by Meg Olson. All rights reserved.
