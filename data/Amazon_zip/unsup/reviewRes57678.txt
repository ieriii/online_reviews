I have been going to Nuevo Leon for over 20 years and must say that the food and service have gone down hill. I made the trip to buy 3 orders of steak fajitas and found that 1 of the orders did not have the steak just veggies. When I called they made me feel like I was trying to cheat them. I won't be going back.
