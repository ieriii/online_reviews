Wanted to come here for more than a year and finally went last night. Staff is super friendly and the place has charm.  I had the polenta with veggies entree, a side of Mac and Cheese, chocolate cake, and the hot cider. The polenta dish was super yummy...really truly skip the mac and cheese, I added it to the sauce of my entree to help, but it lacked almost any flavor and no creaminess at all....the chocolate cake is for 2-4 people as the cake slice is so VERY rich so I have some for later today...hot cider yummy.  Coming back for sure.
