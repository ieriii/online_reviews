We love an occasional dinner at Wishbone. We used to live right near it but never tried it, and then consistently walked past seeing it full of people so figured we should give it a try.... and we were not disappointed. Is it perfect? No. But the food is very consistent and it is very affordable. The wait staff is always friendly and while there are always a crowd, we never seem to have to wait for a table. I don't think it is overrated or hyped up - it is just a great place for a casual dinner when you aren't in the mood for the typical casual dinner selections of pasta or a burger. I recommend giving it a try! I love the corn cakes, and my fiance loves the cheese grits and the crab cakes. The black bean cakes are good too.
