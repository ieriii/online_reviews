This place has a great happy, neighborhood vibe. The service is pretty friendly and the food is pretty good. Everything is swimming in garlic - just a warning. By the end of the night, I was eating spoonfuls of it from my chicken vesuvio sauce. My husband and I like going for a nice night out that isn't going to set us back a lot. The BYOB with no corkage fee helps!
