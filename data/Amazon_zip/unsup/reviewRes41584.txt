Oui c'est encore si bon... Bon Soiree knows how to use their space and personality! We went for a birthday and they reserved a table perfect for talking and greeting new guests as they arrived. Very reasonable cork fee; we brought Veuve Clicquot which perfectly complimented our courses. Great variety and party for the taste buds (we had 5 courses including some of the best pasties in Chicago). We had fine laughs and conversation with the staff and chefs. I'm very excited to try Bon Soiree out for catering this summer; Underground dinners look intriguing! Will report back...
