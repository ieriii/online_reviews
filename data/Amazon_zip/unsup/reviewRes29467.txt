Best guac I have ever tasted. This is a must try in my opinion. I have been half a dozen times and have had something different each time, all of which have been amazing, although my husband swears by the Carne Asada & orders it every time. The ingrediants are so fresh, and the preparation is superb. Reservations are hard to get, but calling first thing in the morning seems to help. Go hungry though because you will want to eat every last bite!
