YUM. Have been to this place 5 times and counting. Good service and great food. The highlights are: lobster bisque, gnocchi, dungeness crab, filet, and the butter cake. Not super excited about the lobster mashed potatoes, Kobe beef steak special (and for $99 a steak should deliver), and the crabcake. Order the rack of lamb if you want to feel like Fred Flintstone...it's humongous. I can't wait til my next meal at Mastros.
