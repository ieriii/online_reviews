After waiting for ages to find the time to come here, (the waits are usually long) and after all the hype, I have to give this place 3 stars to be fair. The food is quite good. It's a fresh, upscaled take on typical Mexican cuisine. My comparison would be to imagine what Lula Cafe would serve if they served Mexican food. Quality and size to match. I enjoyed the margaritas, guac and pork tacos ( I know, not the most adventurous selection), but for what you pay in the end, you could get a fine meal at many other places. The only thing I was disappointed in was the side of black beans totally wasting space on my plate. The service was less than average this time. I don't like having to flag the waitstaff down to order another drink or get the check. I'd probably come back if I was with other people who wanted to come..
