My boyfriend and I had our very first date here... and I LOVED it! (Almost as much as I love him now!) Dinner is GREAT! The Almond Crusted Halibut is to die for, and the Flan & Rice pudding is Heaven! (And since I consider myself a Rice Pudding Connoisseur, I can point out some bad choices.) But the GREATEST thing about Cafe 28 is their Sunday Brunch! I will rant and rave about it forever! The Stuffed French Toast is quite possibly one of the best things I've eaten in my entire LIFE! 2 Pieces of toast stuffed with a creamy mixture of pureed bananas, brown sugar and cream cheese, and topped with berries. O.M.G! AMAZING! I can't even say it enough! Plus, they have this cute little Cuban 3-piece band strumming away while you eat! And those paintings on the wall, I'm pretty sure the artist works as a bartender, (at least he did last time I was there,) and sells his work if anyone's interested. If there's one restaurant I'd recommend here in the city, it's Cafe 28 FOR SURE!
