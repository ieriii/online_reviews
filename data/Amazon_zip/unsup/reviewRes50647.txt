Yum. This is a great newer place that deserves more business (it's never been crowded when I've eaten there, including Saturday dinner). Best parts? The warm beignets (sp?) that come with brunch (mmmmm .... ) and the catfish entree on the dinner menu (who knew that catfish could be so tasty?). They lose a star because the ambiance doesn't seem quite right - it feels a little un-cozy, and the temperature always seems wrong. All in all, though, this is a great spot that deserves to succeed, so eat there!
