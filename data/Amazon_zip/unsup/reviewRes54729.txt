Shaw's offers great fresh seafood, with 2 choices of atmosphere. Feeling a little casual? No problem, they offer the full menu in the bar. And if you're looking for something fancier, make reservations in the dining room. The dining room's ambiance is nice, it makes a great romantic location. I thought the service was good, but the food was great. Not a bad place to surf n turf, the steak was very good also. If you are looking for strictly seafood, you will be hard pressed to find something that tops Shaws.
