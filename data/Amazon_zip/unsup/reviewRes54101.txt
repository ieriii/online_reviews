I'v been here a couple times now, and cant tell you how much i love these tortas. Forget any torta that you have ever had, these are the best! I have tried just about all of them. You cant go wrong.I dont care about the size of the place, long lines, or the price of the menu but they do need to improve upon the food delivery system and overall communication. The last time I was there they lost our order ( ok whatever, it happens) once we flaged down one of the bussers the food came out in 10. same thing happened with out churros and the hot chocolate. After we ate, the Hostest came to us and appologized and offered us free ice cream. Nice gesture, but that also didnt come and we had to leave. Also, just about every employee is glued to their cell phone which can be slightly frustrating when your food dosnt come.ALL can be forgiven with the food. Will be a happy life time customer
