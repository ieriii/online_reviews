This place is extremely overated and overpriced for what it is. I ordered poached eggs and waited 15 minutes and then told it was going to be another 5 to 10 min. Come on people it's a poached egg for God's sake! They said that it takes time to boil water. On a restaurant stove? Not really they lost my order in the unorganized shuffle of the whole place. Worse yet after several leers my server finally came over and told me the news. I will go to another greasy spoon anyday over this place. I will never go there again. NO FOOD IS WORTH THAT WAIT. I am very unimpressed at the level of customer service and the quality of food from previous meals, since I did not get food this time I walked out and had to grab something at the 7 eleven around the corner or be late for work waiting for god knows how long for a poached egg.
