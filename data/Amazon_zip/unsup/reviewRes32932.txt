I've been here at least a dozen times since I discovered it a couple years ago and have never had a bad meal. The last dinner I had there were the enchiladas with black beans and spanish rice on the side.....fantastic...garnished with avocado and soy sour cream...really really good. I've have loved the lasagna, the grilled cheese with tomatoes and onions and sprouts, the santa fe salad....too many to list. The desserts here are OVER THE TOP GOOD. I've tried all of them, the cakes being my favorite, and the cookies and cream cake....ahhhh..that and their yummy coffee is the perfect ending to a really enjoyable meal. The service can be spotty, they are always quick to bring your meal, but can be hard to track down afterwards. I have never encountered any rudeness though in all of my visits...so I don't know what some of these other posters are whining about....maybe rude patrons get rude servers.
