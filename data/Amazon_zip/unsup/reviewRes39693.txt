I really love this place. I think it's a breath of fresh air (or smokey air if you decide to work the grill yourself) I've been a few other BBQ's before and this one is my favorite.  I have never had a problem with rude service. Ever. The potstickers are effin amazing here.  I love the 15 sides that everything comes with.
