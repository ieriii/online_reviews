Being vegan, I hate to write a bad review about a veg restaurant. However, the service is horrible, with a bad attitude (although I hear that the food is very good).I placed a pick-up order at 9:30pm, expecting that it would take me about 30 mins to drive there (according to Google Maps). I arrived at about 10:15pm, and the woman at the door told me that they close at 10pm (their website says 10:30pm), and that they may have thrown out my order.I spoke with someone else, who said they didn't know about the order. A third person tried to help, and asked me what I had ordered, which was the wings and a Reuben sandwich. He informed me that they had run out of wings hours ago, and implied that I didn't actually call and place the order. I was pretty pissed with his attitude.So I never actually tried any of their food, but the snarky service is disgusting. I wasted over an hour on that trip.
