This place mainly falls short of a 5-star rating because of ambiance and "craziness." Your experience here depends GREATLY on when you go. For food and drink, Revolution deserves a 5. Their beer is amazing, and you can get growlers also. The burgers, salads, and brunch is excellent. I've had their goat cheese and beet salad, and eggs with rainbow chard.  DO NOT, under any circumstances, go here on a weekend night. The wait is over an hour, easily. Sometimes, with a long wait, you can "make a night of it" and enjoy a drink at the bar. Here, the bar is too packed, loud, and crazy to do that and enjoy yourself. It's a "circular" bar, with stools all around it, and all standing room is in the aisles where the waiters and seating hostesses have to walk. So standing at the bar is hella awkward. I have definitely walked in and walked out more than once. However, I had a great time at Sunday brunch with my girlfriends. We went at 11:00 a.m. and got seated right away, had excellent service.  I recommend Revolution for its food, drinks, and "non-prime-time" experience. It needs to work on its bar experience.
