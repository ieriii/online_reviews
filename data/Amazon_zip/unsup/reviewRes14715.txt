Pro: Amazing food! I've been hoping for a good place to get wings in Logan Square for a while now... and good wings is what I found. And that is not something I would quickly admit: I am a pretty sharp critic when it comes to wings, but these are some of the best I've ever had. My wife had a burger that was wonderful as well, and the mashed potatoes and potato salad that came with our respective meals were both really good. Con: It was pretty loud in there, and they were playing noisy music that wasn't able to be understood or appreciated, which didn't help. Also, it is a bit pricy. The food is great, but the expensive meal will keep me from coming back very often. After one appetizer (my wings), one dinner (her burger), one drink and tip, we were easily over $30. But again, you won't be disappointed by the quality of the food food so I gladly paid it, it just won't happen often. Check this place out!
