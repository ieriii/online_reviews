Delicious! This is my 3rd time having Ethiopian food, with the other times both at Ethiopian Diamond, so I don't have much to compare to, especially since the flavors are so different from anything that I've had before. The two restaurants are equally delicious in my mind. On this trip to Demera, we ordered the "messob sampler" (with meat and veggies), which came on top of a giant tray of injera, with a basket of injera on the side. We both like to eat, but couldn't finish it. We could have *probably* split this amongst a third person. For dessert we ordered the "ethiopian style tiramisu", which had a slightly "nuttier" taste than regular tiramisu.  It was soooo good. I mean, just look at it: http://www.yelp.com/biz_ The service here was also excellent. We came here at 9ish on a Saturday night, and got seated right away... next to the live jazz player, who apparently needed to be amplified by giant speakers, despite this being a very tiny/intimate restaurant. Fortunately, our server recognized our distress and moved us to a more distant corner. I'll be back Demera!
