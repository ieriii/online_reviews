Pricey! Not a bad upscale gastropub with an enormous array of choices and exceptional service-- but unfortunately, the quality seemed to vary as much as the selection.  Great location across from Millenium Park, and although you can't tell from first impressions by the relatively small outside seating and bar area, the restaurant stretches waaaay inside and fits the middle ground where you could be comfortable either in casual or more dressy digs. I sampled the Smoked Haddock Cake and Peekytoe Crab, which was seriously good and had me excited for my next dish. Unfortunately, the Fish & Chips majorly disappointed, being more batter and grease than actual fish. Clearly not worth the $17 they're asking for it. I like the fact that you have the choice to eat on the reasonable side here, with options in the $10-20 range, but it seems like most of the good stuff is in the $30-40 end, so consider this fair warning. Be ready to spend over $50-70 per person with drink and maybe dessert. Worth it? Not quite, in my opinion.
