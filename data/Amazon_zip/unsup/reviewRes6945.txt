the pumpkin pasta, the lobster ravioli, rabbit ravioli, etc.. there were 14 of us and the food was good with big portions, but not... oh my god, the best italian food ever. overall, the whole experience-- from getting menus that said "Happy Birthday (someone else's name)!" to getting the dessert without utensils, to absentee waiters and long periods of waiting (an hour for food, almost just as long to get our cheques and pay and leave), and awkwardly waiting for half an hour to get seated after arriving on time for our reservation and rubbing against the seated diners while waiting to get seated..... the restaurant seems disorganized and flustered. however, the waiter was very nice and someone stopped by afterwards-- the manager, i presume-- to apologize for the messy night. i guess restaurants can have their good days and bad days.
