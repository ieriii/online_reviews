Ok, they are just so nice here...have not had that in a while at a hotel. Of course it would be a Joie de Vive hotel...Chip really has a great model. So close to The Loop without the high cost. Two bus lines and 15 minutes into The Loop right outside the hotel's front door. Very convenient. Nice artwork and views of the lake and park areas. Bikes and great restaurant/bar downstairs. I was told there was a rooftop deck although booked with private events both nights I was there.
