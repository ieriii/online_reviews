Not much to eat here as a vegetarian, but what I had was really tasty. I shared the vegetarian tortas, and the vegetarian caldos with my wife. Both were excellent! After, we shared a flan and chocolate cake slice and one of their rich fresh ground chocolate drinks. I will definitely be back to try more of their drinks, and thanks to the cafe style, walk-up ordering, I won't feel uncomfortable doing so. I caution against the over crowding, though. We found seats alright, but it was packed around 5:30.
