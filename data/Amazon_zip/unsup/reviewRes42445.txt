PARADISE BY THE DASHBOARD... Went there last night, got an Art's Special thin crust, and it didn't disappoint. The rich and naturally sweet sauce, the perfect thin and unsoggy crust, the browned not burnt cheese, and the sausage-onion-mushroom-green-pepper melange that acts like a 3 by 3 inch square happy meal on its own edible plate. Oh so good, oh so satisfying - car don't fail me now so we can get home and eat this pie-o-paradise. And thats just the thin crust...
