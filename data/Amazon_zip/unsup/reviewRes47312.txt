Lockdown is an awesome atmosphere and the employees are awesome. Sophie (I think that's how you spell her name) is fantastic and I try to be served by her everytime. PJ, who I think is a manager, is awesome as well. They're all just so fun and make the experience all that much better. My friend was in town for the night so there was no doubt in my mind that I would start our night at Lockdown. That's how I am going to start my nights out from now on, I am so lucky to live on the same street as this place. You've read the reviews, heard people talk, now try it out. You won't be disappointed.
