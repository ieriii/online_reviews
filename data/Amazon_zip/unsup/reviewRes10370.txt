Great pizza joint! Great vibe! Great pizza! I'm sold! I "get" Piece... When a place is slammed it normally says something about the food. Piece is no exception to that rule of mine... the place is packed and the food ~ well the food is WOW. The brew their own beer. I'm a fan of Top Heavy Hefeweizen, Full Frontal Pale Ale, and Wingnut. All in all a fun place to eat great pizza, watch sports, and drink yummy beer!
