I was excited to try this place. Heard a lot of great things. Bon Appetit wrote this place up as one of the ten best new restaurants in 2010. But alas, it was just OK. We shared the roasted bone marrow spread, the pork tail, the milk braised pork shoulder, raw corn, and mussels. It was all very tasty but I didn't think anything was particularly outstanding. I see what they are trying to do with the nose to tail dining tapas style which is daring in itself. In the end, this place pares in comparison to all the great restaurants that also serve charcuteries and tapas in the bay area. Service was subpar. At times, our waitress was nowhere to be found.
