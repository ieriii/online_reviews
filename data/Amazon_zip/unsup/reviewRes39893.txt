We usually come here after the bars because they are open 24 hours. I love Korean food and this is where my Korean friends take me. Lots of 'banchan' (small dishes), not bad of kalbi, where you can either choose to bbq it yourself or have them do it for you to save time. Bring some Korean friends with you, because their English isn't that good. Don't plan on coming here before any type of public activity..you will smell.
