I've noted that alot of Vietnamese are down on Tank for their average pho, and I'm not one to argue with their expertise, however I must add that the menu is huuuuge. I'm guessing that pho is probably the most important barometer of a quality vietnamese joint, I just don't think it should be the sole gauge, especially when the rest of the menu is how do we say...delish. Come on,...#108?...pork chop, garlic prawn, fried egg, and chinese sausage on top of rice...who you kidding boss.    I've made it a point to try a number of items and my palate might not have the appropriate reference points, but one thing I do know is tasty. And Tank has that in spades. I also strangely like the service...it's organized chaos and you can have 4 different servers for a meal, but they are amazingly efficient.    As a bonus you can take home the Thai basil on your pho veggie plate and root it in water and then voila...you have your very own Thai basil plant. Can't beat that with a wet noodle.
