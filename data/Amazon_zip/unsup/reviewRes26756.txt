Love this place! Great authentic dishes yet just a bit more upscale than the places up on Broadway/Argyle. Definitely still a casual environment. I go back every few weeks, and always seem to get the beef pho and green papaya salad. I change up the main course everytime. I definitely recommend it for your first vietnamese food experience...or any other time! you wont be disappointed!!
