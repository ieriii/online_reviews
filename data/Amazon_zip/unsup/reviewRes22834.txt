I like Irazu, but I think people are a tad over-zealous about it. I will say that I don't eat chicken or beef, so maybe I am missing out on some exciting dish that makes it make sense. The veggie burrito is nothing special. It's just a tortilla with rice, beans, avocado, and lettuce basically. I could just assume go to picante and not have to wait for 30 minutes first. I do really enjoy that breakfast dish they have with an egg and some rice/bean mix w/ plantains.  Everything else, including the chips and "salsa" (in a squirt bottle) are whatever. I go there, but it certainly doesn't excite me.  There's a long wait; the ambiance is, well there isn't one, and the service is indifferent.
