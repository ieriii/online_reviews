First of all, let me say that I had the best service I have EVER had from all of the people working at Publican. They were consistently knowledgeable and super friendly. I was there before my friend and the bartenders kept me company, recommended beers, etc. I thought the beer selection was great - think hopleafish, but not quite that big of a menu. The white wine that I had was also good. I loved the communal seating option, but alas we just grabbed a table for two. As for the food... we had the pickles - yum. The scallops carpachio was a little small for my taste, but still very tasty. The mussels were out of this world and the fries... best I have ever had. Rumor has it, they are fried in beef fat. But I have to tell you, they are well worth it. Order them with the egg's on top. I almost want to give this place a 5. Everything was great, just perhaps a little pricey overall.
