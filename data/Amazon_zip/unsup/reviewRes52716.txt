Went to Brazzazz for lunch today after hearing the hype about what a great deal lunch was. Was eager to see how it compared to Fogo, since that place rocks. Overall, experience was fair. Definitely not as good as Fogo. Service was attentive, salad bar was decent, and like others have mentioned the cheese tortellini and risotto were nice. The main reason everyone was there though, the meat, was defintely sub-par. All the meats tasted about the same with few exceptions (garlic steak and filet mignon stood out, though only because they actually had flavor and were hot). As others have mentioned, the meat seemed rather bland and I did find myself throwing salt on most of my meat. I must also note that most of the meat at Fogo is done medium-well and here they definitely erred on the side of rare, with red meat juice staining my plate for most of the meal. Also, the sides were not fresh, and as much as I loved the cheese bread at Fogo, the cheesebread here was just not hot or freshly baked and the fried polenta was stale as evidenced by its crisp as croutons texture. Overall I would not go back. Stick with Fogo de Chao where it's done right.
