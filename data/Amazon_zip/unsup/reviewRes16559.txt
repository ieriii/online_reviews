I ordered the Vegetarian Special Thali as a carryout meal, and I hope I didn't get part of someone else's order, because they gave me a ton of food. Well, maybe not a full ton, but at least five pounds. It is all delicious, so let me describe everything that I found in the bag. Seven 8 oz plastic deli containers containing: Paleek Paneer, Channa Masala, Kali Dal, Lentil soup, Savory yogurt with shredded carrots and cucumbers (couldn't find it on the menu), vegetable garnish (pieces of head lettuce, tomato, red onion, slivers of Jalapeno pepper, wedge of lemon) and Kheer (sweet rice milk dessert). A 6" diameter platter of Basmati white rice and a 12" loaf of Naan completed the meal. All that for $22.09 with tax! I have no idea how many lunches and dinners I will get out of this one meal, but I will enjoy every bite, because it is all very tasty!
