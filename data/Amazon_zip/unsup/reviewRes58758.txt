Today I experienced an over the top culinary experience. I went to Graham Elliot for their Sodapalooza dinner! Can I say: Sheer Ecstasy! We started the meal with lobster that was paired with Ginger Ale. The soda was also integrated into the dish. It was delicious. The second course was halibut that was paired with an orange soda (again utilized in the sauce as well). Quite possibly one of the most delicious taste sensations of all times. A pork dish followed, paired with Root Beer, and then dessert which was a popcorn gelato, and house made sweets that recalled reeces and milk duds. Unreal! My new favorite restaurant in Chicago!!!!!
