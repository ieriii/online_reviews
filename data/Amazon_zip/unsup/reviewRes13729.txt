The best crab legs I've ever had! Go here on a Tuesday and get the all you can eat, it's 100% worth it. The crab legs are the size of a grown mans arm! FYI - make sure you call ahead and make a reservation, the place get's packed.  As far as the other food, I am sad to say I haven't had a chance to indulge but the menu looked like it had a lot of fresh seafood that was well though out and not your regular pan seared salmon plate you'll find at Red Lobster.  Enjoy!
