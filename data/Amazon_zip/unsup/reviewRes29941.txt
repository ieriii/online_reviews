Utterly relaxing at night. A friend and I were looking for a place to chat around 10:30 p.m. on a Thursday night, close to the Clark and Division red line. Having been instantly repelled by the loud, bad music and grinning middle aged suits at "The Lodge", we were delighted to traipse over to 3rd Coast (I hadn't realized it was open that late) and cozy up to a booth in a corner of the restaurant which we had all to ourselves. Though you're below ground level the windows are tall and expansive, so you have a great sense being tucked away but still connected to the world outside. The lighting is bright without being harsh and music is tastefully chosen, in the background. We were both content with our beverages--a Peppermint Schnapps hot chocolate, hot apple cider, and a cocktail I can't remember.We didn't order food but there's plenty of it, as well as a good looking wine list. It would make an ideal option for a lateish dinner when you want something other than diner or fast food. (They do serve breakfast all day if you have that hankering though.) I'd been to 3rd Coast for a few Spanish language Meet Up groups and it's served the purpose very well, reasonable sound level, no problem splitting up checks, quick service. If I lived in the area I could also see this as a great place to go solo to read or work on a project. In sum: great multipurpose spot.
