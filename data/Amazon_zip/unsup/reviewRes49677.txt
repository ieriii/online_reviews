Thank you Groupon. Back to Las Tablas, a hop, skip, and jump away from home, called ahead and with no wait, we trekked on down. Arrived, seated and pleasantly greeted by the same lady who was our server the previous time in December. It was a delight that she was our server, but the maraschino on the sundae was that a few thousand customers later, she recognized us! One mojito, two glasses of pinot noir, and a combination platter for each of us and we were fully satisfied. Lighting was perfect and actually more lit than before, but still sultry, dim, and sexy, though (hee, hee) not as much as my latin lover.
