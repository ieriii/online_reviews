Once you pick through the unnecessary overpriced nonsense here, I think you can find some treats. I have heard the store sells Rabbit. I could make some Rabbit Stew this winter! Most importantly, the store sells Gelatin sheets. This is not entirely my discovery because Chowhound informs me of most of my random ingredient discoveries in the city.
