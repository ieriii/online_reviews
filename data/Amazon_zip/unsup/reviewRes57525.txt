Another hiden treasure! Fondue dining at its best. I Love this restuarant -- it's perfect for a romantic evening on a tight budget. This place reeks of romance complete with live classical guitar on weekends. The food is excellent with a great selection. The private booths are extremely romantic, but even if you can't arrange for a booth, the general ambiance is perfect for a romantic evening. Excellent wine list with some excellent inexpensive wines for those on a budget. Fondue is something you either like or don't -- but I defy you to not like the melted chocolate Fondue it is incredible.
