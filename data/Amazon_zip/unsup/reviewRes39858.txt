I haven't been to many Korean restaurants, but SSGS certainly beats the pretencious ones that serve soju-tinis and don't give you fire to play with. It's a great time and the meat is flavorful and tender. The communal tables may be hard to squat in to, but once you're there you are happy and ready to drink some soju. The smoke and garlic permeats your clothes, hair and skin so go with someone you love so you don't offend later on...
