I love mexican. Give me any kind whether it be from Chiptole to this place and I will enjoy it. That being said Rick Bayless has rocked my world. While he restaurant has enjoyed some fame from Top Chef and word of mouth, there is a reason for that this man knows how to cook. We started with the sampler which included five different samplings of some popular appetizers. The guacamole was made to perfection, the ceviche was out of this world, the mexican city quesadilla was a fried piece of perfection, and everything else on the plate was spectacular. I followed it up with a chicken enchilada with a dark mole sauce. The tortilla was flaky and soft and the sauce was heavenly. The chick was succulent and every ingredient on the plate somehow mixed together perfectly. I look forward to Topolo and Xoco because this man is truly a Top Chef.
