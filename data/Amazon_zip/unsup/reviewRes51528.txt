Oh Garcia's. . . I have been going to this place since I was little. I used to ride my bike over to get a taco, and eat it on the way home.  The food is really really good and quite cheap. They also have giant pitchers of margaritas. Honestly I have tried everything on the menu and it is all good. I love the combinations. The burritos are indeed enormous, and they have a ton of meat in them. I would suggest getting half meat half avocado to lighten it up.  The food is pretty authentic, but it is a bit Americanized because of the neighborhood. They have a lot of soups on the menu which shows that it is still true to a traditional Mexican restaurant.  It has recently gone though a much needed face-lift, and the food is still as good as always.
