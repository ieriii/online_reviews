I went here for a date a few months ago and I feel compelled to review my experience. I ordered the fluke and some wine. Everything was fresh and very well prepared. Even the beets tasted perfect. The flavors were all spot on and I walked away feeling completely satisfied. Service was good, no complaints at all. Despite being located prodigiously close to the locus of west side gentrification, I got absolutely no sense of snobbery or snotty hipness from the staff. Classy folks, all around. As my price range rating suggests, this is not a cheap BYOB. Know this going in and you'll be fine; you definitely get what you pay for here! I was, however, surprised at how widely the prices on the menu varied, ranging from the burger/fries variety (around $9-10) to pricier fish and meat dishes ($20-$40). Although I only got the fluke and I can't say if the burgers are any good, I can't imagine the same people that made that fluke could screw up a burger, and one could conceivably have a great meal here for less than the price of a shitty 3D movie. As trite as it sounds, it was truly the best meal I've had in a long time. As Logan Square continues to gentrify, I hope that more quality establishments like Longman crop up. If I had an extra zero or two on my paycheck I'd be here every other night but as it stands I'll settle for coming back to splurge once in a while.
