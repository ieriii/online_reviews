We were in Chicago for 3 days and ended up coming here 3 times. Yeah, this place was that good. I actually am still dreaming of their Jackfruit smoothie which probably wasn't all that spectacular but far better than anything I've had in the DC area. This wasn't even the Pho restaurant we'd intended on going to - but the place we'd intended on heading to was deserted and this place had a line going out the door. I'm still a relative newbie to the world of Pho, but that's the first time I've ever seen that. And wow, was the wait worth it. The soup was so, so tasty. Really fresh ingredients and the broth was really, really good before I added anything to it. The appetizer platter was also good, and is definitely an excellent way to sample all their delicious appetizers. They were even nice enough to let us in a few minutes after they closed to grab a bowl of soup, since we'd walked quite a few miles to there and were starving. Would go to this place again in a heartbeat. So jealous of you people in Chicago.
