nothing is wrong with this place. just it's very mediocre. very uninspired. my brother and i agreed nothing on the menu looked terribly interesting. so i had the caprese sandwich and coffee. my brother had a chicken club. his homemade chips were tasteless (like cardboard, he said, but i've never eaten cardboard). my sandwich had all of the right ingredients. but nothing popped. very plain-jane. and perhaps that is exactly what you (and my brother's roommate's ex) like. not for me (especially not in this neighborhood).
