The Publican has a bit of pretense as some of these other reviews mention. But it's just enough to make it credible. The menu is hit or miss, but when they hit, they're homeruns. The must haves: mussels, frites with egg, and spicy pork rinds (no, really). The ambiance is great as long as you understand you're in a Euro beer house. That said, the point about the lighting is valid: cool idea, bad execution. All in all, this is a fun place to make a night of your meal and much of the food and beer list kick-ass. Just know what you're getting into when you sign up.
