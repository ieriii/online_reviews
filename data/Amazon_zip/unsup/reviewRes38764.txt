Like many of the other reviews, I'd say the service here has much to be desired. MUCH. When we arrived, we had a large group (WHO WERE ALL THERE, STANDING OVER MY SHOULDER). I asked the hostess if we could get a table and she asked if everyone was eating. I said I wasn't sure but I didn't think so. I went and checked and everyone said they WERE eating. I went back to her and said yes, we'd like a table for 7. She looked at me and said "is everyone eating?" I replied in the affirmative. Then she put on her kindergarden teacher voice and said "Wait, didn't we JUST talk about this?" I wanted to slap her. Instead I took a deep breath and said "Yes, and you asked if we were all eating, I confirmed with my friends that we all are, and now I'm asking for a table for 7." She ROLLED her eyes and walked away. I stood there, perplexed. She finally wandered back and said "follow me" and took us to the table.  That should have been our first clue that the service was going to be atrocious. Our server was rude, inattentive, and couldn't answer the simplest question about beer (ie I like summer wheats with berry/fruit undertones, what should I get?). The food took forever, was cold, and pretty disgusting. I got the Tilapia sandwich. I love Tilapia because it's not a very "fishy" fish. Except this sandwich was so fishy I couldn't even finish it. I wonder how fresh the fish really was. It was also so dark in the main dining room that we could hardly see our food. It took forever to get the check and if they hadn't auto-grat'ed us for our party of 7, I would not have left much of a tip at all. In the 1.5 hours we were there, the server visited our table twice. She didn't even bring us the food. If you like beer and misanthropes, go to Hopleaf. If you like good food and good service, there are many other amazing places in Chicago to get beer and dinner.
