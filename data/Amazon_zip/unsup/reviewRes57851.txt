I have been to Demera numerous times and never had exactly the same experience as the time before... The food is consistently good- lots of options for vegans/vegetarians- AND they will make gluten-free injera if you call a day ahead and let them know. If you're going on a Friday or Saturday night I recommend making a reservation- I'm sure you'd have to wait without one. Overall my experience regarding service has been so-so, on a couple of occasions I have had servers that are very friendly and attentive, on others we had very standoffish servers who made themselves scarce and our water hardly ever got refilled (which isn't so great if you've ordered spicy dishes- which almost all of mine usually are). In general I would go back, but I think I'm gonna venture out and try a couple other Ethiopian restaurants for the time being.
