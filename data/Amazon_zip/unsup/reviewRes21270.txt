While fumbling over my order at Superdawg, the guy ahead of me waiting on his food turned around and said, "Everything is good. Best dogs in the city. You'll come back." In my head, I was thinking "Ok, we'll see." I ordered their classic dog and a milk shake. Had I not been to Gene and Jude's I would probably have been impressed. The pickled tomato seems to be mentioned a lot on the reviews I've read on Yelp about this place, but I didn't care for it that much. It was a "eh... so this is a pickled tomato... pretty cool" instead of a "OMG, where have you been all my life oh pickled tomato?!?!" If I had to blind taste test the shake, I would not have been able to tell it from any other shake at any other place I've been. And I think the shake here was pretty expensive as far as shakes go too =( So I think back about what that guy in line said, and he probably should have said, "Everything is good. Solid dogs in the city, though a bit pricey because you're in the city. See ya around kid." I have not been back to Superdawg. I think the following points need to be made to justify the discreptancy between the number of stars I'm giving and the general average this place is getting on Yelp: 1. Gene and Jude's has a better hotdog in my opinion. It's smaller, but you can order a double dog and get twice the "snap". 2. Superdawg has a pickled tomato. Go here if that turns you on. 3. The Superdawg dog is $5 and change. The Gene and Jude's DOUBLE dog is $3 and change. 4. Gene and Jude has better fries. Hands down better fries. Both hands down. Underground hands. In summary, my recommendation is go here if you're around the area and really craving a dog. Their dogs are good and solid. However, if you're out to hunt for the best dogs in Chicago, this is not the place. There are cheaper and better dogs at Gene and Jude's, though that may be a bit of a drive away depending on where you're coming from. Good luck hunting my friends!
