I have found my new favorite restaurant! We went here last Saturday night after reading the reviews on Yelp and I loved it so much we went back on Sunday night. Everything on the menu looked so good, I had a hard time deciding what to order on Saturday. As soon as I made it through the most delicious French Onion Soup I've ever had - I had not even gotten to my entree yet - I knew I had to come back and make my way through more of the menu. Everything tasted as good as it sounded on the menu & to top it all off, they serve desserts from Hoosier Mama Pie Company! It doesn't get much better than Glenn's.  Now I just need to go back for breakfast!
