I can't say much that hasn't already been said here, so just let me say this is THE jazz spot in our fair city. I've been introduced to types of jazz I hadn't previously known existed here. Plus I get to listen while channeling the bad-ass energy that just flows through the space from the mafioso who used to chill there in Capone's days, including Al himself. The bar obviously recognizes this, as they have a framed picture of Al Capone right next to the bar. Definitely not a jazz hand to be seen here.  I loved it, and apparently lots of other people do too, given the crowd. Suffice to say, I'll return to this cool little spot.
