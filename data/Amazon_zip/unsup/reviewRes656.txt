If you want a really unique meal and don't mind shelling out the dough, come to Alinea. It was a one of a kind experience, and I thought the food was fabulous. We had the 12 course meal, and it was definitely filling enough. It also took us nearly 4 hours, and I can't imagine how long the 24 course meal would have taken. The only negative I found was that the waitstaff definitely hovered, making it a little difficult to have a conversation without feeling awkward. Even so, worth it once.
