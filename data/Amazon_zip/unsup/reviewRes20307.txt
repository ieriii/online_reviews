I'd never been here before, but my friend was dying to go back...he made advance reservations, but somehow Coast had no record of that...it was a Thursday and the place was pretty crowded, but they still seated us right away (!) which was quite nice of them. We found the waiter to be incredibly knowledgeable and helpful (comped us for a mistake in the order)....and the liberal BYOB policy is certainly a HUGE plus (no corkage fee with minimum $15/pp). We ordered two of the appetizer specials...one (salmon dish) was so-so, but the other (white tuna) was amazing...unfortunately, not on the menu. Pretty much everything we ordered was great, and quite fresh...unfortunately, as both of us are sushi fiends we were barely able to stay under $100. Loved the spicy salmon maki....the Volcano was good, but had a bit much going on (crumbled tempura everywhere)...spider maki was excellent....Maguro was delicious. Overall, quite satisfied!
