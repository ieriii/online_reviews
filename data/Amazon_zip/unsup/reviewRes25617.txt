Went to Geja's last night to thanks to a gift certificate given by a friend. We were pleased with the service before we even got there---thanks to crazy traffic, we were 30 minutes late for our reservation, but when we called the maitre d' told us that he would be happy to seat us whenever we arrived. When we finally got there--an hour's drive from Andersonville--he told us he would be happy to seat us right away, or if we preferred to wait 10 minutes for a booth that he would offer us a drink at the bar. Very courteous, seeing as our tardiness was OUR fault, and not his. Yes, the guitar playing was lovely, and the grotto atmosphere was romantic and less Disney-fied than I'd feared. The middle-priced wines by the glass were tasty. My husband and I went for just the cheese and chocolate fondue specials, which (with included house salad) proved to be plenty of food. I can't imagine having gone for the "premiere fondue dinners" that included shellfish, beef, or chicken to be cooked in oil. And honestly, none of it smelled so great--do you really want to boil shrimp and beef tenderloin in the same pot? So, while the service was excellent and everything that we ordered was tasty, I still couldn't shake the feeling that this place was a little gimicky and might have been more at home in the burbs or a smaller town. There are too many restaurants in Chicago with really excellent food for me to make another trip to Geja's.
