Loved this place. Very reasonable prices and tasty! I got a steak sandwich for just under five bucks. The tostones were delicious, but beware of the garlic. Not a good option if you're trying to get your mack on. Also, it's a BYOB and they didn't charge us a corking fee. Our wine was screw top (because we roll classy like that). Some places will charge either way. It's very small inside and cozy. The only downside is the bathroom. There's only one and it's right in the dining area. Not exactly optimum placement. You'd best take some immodium before you go or run the risk of any indigestion becoming public knowledge. I'll be back very soon.
