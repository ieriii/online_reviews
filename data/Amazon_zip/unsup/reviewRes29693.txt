I used to be a fan, but it just seems to be consistantly going down hill. My husband and are Thai fanatics. When we started dating, we probably went about once a week to various restaurants. At one point, we did Thai about 8-9 times in 2 weeks (yeah, that was a little crazy & we had to take a little break after that). We still go once or twice a month, but I think we'll be skipping Opart from now on.  First off, the service is pretty bad. We managed to get the same server pretty frequently, and he has to be the most disinterested, lethargic person ever. We had a different server when we went last week, but it was very nearly the same story. We only went because we forgot Thai Oscar was closed that day. Second, the food. It's inconsistant. Once I had this amazing dish delivered--so spicy it was hard to eat, and so delicious it was impossible not to. I ordered it in the restaurant and asked that they make it medium (I forgot to mention the spice level the previous time). I got a dish that in know way resembled the first dish, covered in that gelatinous, brown sauce ubiquitous in Chinese fast food. Another time, when our food was served, mine was COLD. Not warm, or not piping hot--cold. parts on one side were warm on top (clearly the effect of a heat lamp) but underneath that and the whole other side was cold. It had to have been sitting in the window 10+ minutes. It was also totally bland instead of cooked with the hot peppers. When I let the server know that it was cold & not spicy, he took it back & the cook tossed it in the pan with sriracha. Cuz that's the same. Boo. Thai Oscar all the way.
