WHATS FOR DINNER? GREEK FOOD! I came down this Greek Town area last year for Greek Fest, enjoyed trying out Greek Food. Where I come from only thing that comes close to Greek Food is Gyros and its not like how they make it here. I LIKE GREEK FRIES! : ))) A LOT! I had my first taste of Greek Beer! And Greek Wine, I don't remember what the names were but it was very good! I LIKE (talking like Borat). I came here few days ago to Greek Islands Restaurant. Inside is Huge! In layers, giving out candies up front, that's a plus. Lets see, oh flaming cheese! Pretty dang cool I tell ya. I was feeling like a kid, they have to have some experience lighting that up. Kids, DO NOT try that at home for sure. Hmm I wonder how they do that flaming cheese thing? I think my favorite part of my dinner was the beer and watching so many people working in the kitchen and every customer drinking red wine. Red wine! Every table got one or two bottles each. Having wonderful time. You know one of my favorite movie is? My Big Fat Greek Wedding. Hahaha you know what the old woman said? "You don't eat meat? Okay I cook you lamb!" Someone make me some GREEK FRIES!
