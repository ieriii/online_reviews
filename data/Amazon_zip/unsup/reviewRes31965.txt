I fell in love with this restaurant the first time I came here, in December. I have been back at least 5 times since then. Its hard to find a Vegetarian/Vegan restaurant, let alone one that is delicious. The food comes out fast, the staff is completely helpful and attentive. I've never waited long for a table either. Love Love this place!
