Wow. This place was amazing! We went on a Saturday night to celebrate a friend's 30th birthday. Since there were 9 of us, we knew we wanted to get the chef's tasting which would make deciding what dishes to get (and splitting the bill) much easier. We also knew we wanted Sangria. And lots of it. We wanted to try all of the three different varieties, but our waiter convinced us to get the seasonal and then just one more. He said we would love the seasonal and shouldn't even get another type. We should have listened. There was nothing wrong with the red, but the seasonal was really amazing. So amazing, in fact, we ended up getting 6 carafes by the end of the night. Ok, on to the food. The Chef's tasting was amazing. The food came out consistently and with enough time to enjoy it and say "oh my GOD!" after each bite. Out of all of the items, the prawns were the only thing that we probably could have done without. Highlights include: Bacon-wrapped-walnut-filled-dates, tomato flat bread, chorizo and cheese plates, beans with pine nuts, and the lamb chops...oh the lamb chops!!! We couldn't quite figure out what made them so good, but then determined that they must have been dipped in s*x. That really could be the only explanation. They were that good. The atmosphere was very "hip" but without feeling intimidating. There were some tables of people that I'm pretty sure thought they were in Vegas, but we honestly were too focused on our food to really notice. Overall, we loved this place. Highly recommend the Sangria and the Chef's tasting, and would jump at the opportunity to go back again!
