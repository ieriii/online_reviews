Eat the Frenchie. It's amazing! In fact, I need to go back again and try most of their burgers on the menu. There are a lot to choose from and the atmosphere is awesome! The only weird thing is their ketchup- I'm all about organic goodness, but I think this batch of house made ketchup was just.. off. Other than that, it's a great place to go for fancy burgers and great beer selection!
