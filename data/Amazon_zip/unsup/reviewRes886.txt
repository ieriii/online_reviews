Kind of the place everyone wants to go to cause everyone says its great so then it must be great or else anthony bourdains and half the city wouldn't wait in line to eat a hot dog from a place that accepts cash. Worth the experience...but maybe not worth the wait. Still four stars cause I'm man enough to say I could be wrong.....it's just not all that.
