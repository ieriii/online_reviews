Oh. My. God. This is good.I started going here when it first opened, and I've gotta say it's gotten a LOT more crowded since then, which is kind of a bummer but I completely understand why. The expansion of the porch that they made makes a difference, too.The ox-tail is fantastic, and I'm always a sucker for sweet plantains. Seriously, I could eat those things for every meal. The sandwiches and cafe con leche are also good if you're in the mood for something a little lighter.PLUS if you bring a bottle of wine, they have a sangria mix. Oh yeah.To be honest, I don't know what that previous reviewer was complaining about with the service. Every time I've gone there the wait staff has been really attentive. They're always patient with me when I make bad attempts to pronounce menu items in Spanish, too. Also one of the waiters is REALLY CUTE, and dances a little bit when he's doing his side work on slow nights...just sayin'.
