Great place to dine. It's certainly a woman's choice for dining. Great for a first date or with another couple. The food is really unique and it's not heavy on your stomach. In the summertime they have seating out on the terrace, so cute.. It's located on a busy, happening street as well, which is always nice. The staff is always there catering to your every need. Love it...
