Recently visited for dinner with friends. Sat by the bar area which probably wasn't the best choice as there was a large group of birthday goers and we could barely hear each other from their noise. The food selection was good... typical Italian choices and their specials didn't really draw my attention.  The waitstaff was attentive and friendly which was nice. Prices were decent as well.  I would've probably rated this place higher if it wasn't for the busy area seating, the people seated in the dinner area looked much more relaxed and they weren't shouting as much.
