Friendly, lots of great baked goods at a cheap price. Not everything is out of this world amazing I'll admit, but the price, friendliness, and overall quality are great. Coffecakes (you can buy halves, which is nice) are very good as is the marzipan-frosted carrot cake which I once had for my birthday, and was maybe my favorite birthday cake ever.
