Finally got around to trying this place. It was a sunday night, and pretty busy, but we still got seated right away (we had a reservation). The table was decent-sized, and we weren't wedged in between other couples, which drives me crazy. So off to a good start. Our waitress greeted us promptly, and was friendly and helpful. The popcorn that was placed on the table in lieu of bread was a nice touch. So far so good. For an appetizer, I ordered the duck ravioli. Good, but tiny. Three pieces, and they were bite-sized. For an entree, I got the sturgeon, which the waitress recommended. It didn't seem all that appealing on the menu- there was a sauerkraut glaze or jus or something that sounded questionable- but it turned out to be amazing. I'm talking plate-licking good. Absolutely lived up to the recommendation, and I was glad I listened to the waitress and tried it. Only problem was there wasn't more of it. Literally. I was still hungry when I was done.  Now, while I don't need to, or even necessarily want to, leave a restaurant feeling stuffed all the time, I also don't like paying top dollar for sample-sized food. Which is what I got. And that really is my only complaint. So I'm glad I went, I'm glad I tried it, but I probably won't go back any time soon.
