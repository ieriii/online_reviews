Wonderful place for Sunday brunch. They make one of the best bloody mary's I have ever had, complete with an accompanying beer and a plethora of pickled vegetables. I had the pork cheek sandwich with a fried egg, heirloom tomatoes and aioli. Everything was cooked perfectly and the service was fast and attentive. To top off an already amazing menu they serve Intelligentsia coffee! I will definitely be returning soon.
