Holy crap that's a lot of food. I have a wicked sore throat and congested so I suggested Pho to the hubby. I have never tried it but my sister swears by it. I read the reviews for this place more than a few times. We headed over and got seated within minutes. The menu is huge. And the service is quick, maybe too quick. We had sat but a minute and someone was there to take our order. I got #43 and the hubs got #40. The food came out fast and hot. I added the bean sprouts and siracha. A lot of it. Spicy and delicious! I had a hard time getting over that sweetness I could taste but after a few more bites, I was acclimated. I barely made a dent in it when I threw in the proverbial towel. It's my lunch for today! Total bill with tip was $18. Talk about cheap AND delicious eats! And guess what? My sore throat is a lot better! I think I found my cure for sore throats!
