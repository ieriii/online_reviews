I absolutely love The Art of Pizza! I went here with a few of my girlfriends prior to going to a street festival across the street and we were very pleasantly surprised.  They have excellent pan & thin crust pizza. I haven't tried their stuffed pizza, but I plan on trying it soon! Another great thing about this place is that you can buy by the slice. They also have a great selection of appetizers (the fried mushrooms are awesome!), pasta dishes, sandwiches, and salads. The prices are reasonable and there are excellent daily specials. It is definitely a great "local" pizza place!
