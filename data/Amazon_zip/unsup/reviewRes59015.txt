Exceptional service. Phenomenal food. Overall wonderful experience. The "toast and jam" is my favorite dish. Definitely make a reservation, especially if you're going on a Thursday, Friday or Saturday night. It's a great atmosphere and is good for going on a date but also going with a group of friends. I recommend Sunda to anyone and everyone.
