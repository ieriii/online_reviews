I really love this place. I have been coming here for a solid 6+ years... every vacation I took to Chicago prior to moving here Francesca's was a must. I think the food is really good, the price points are very nice and they have such a cozy atmosphere (especially on the top, 2nd floor). Out of my many experiences here, there was only one that was lacking, and that was when they sat my party and I in the back garage area...  that was bad... but I still think a solid 5 stars based on consistency and customer service.
