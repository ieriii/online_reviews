Great place, though a little loud. Came here because I like what Jose Garces does on Iron Chef. Great place for small plates. Excellent selection of flatbreads. We had one with chorizo and shrimp...delicious. Tip: order less than the server suggests. You can always order more.  Another tip: Cocktails are great, sangria is average.
