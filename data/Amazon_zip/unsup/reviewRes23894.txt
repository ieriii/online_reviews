So I've been here for lunch, dinner and drinks after work (BYO!- one time we ordered the shakes, with water, and added a little extra good stuff). The staff +food +vibe = perfect. If you're coming in a group -it's great for groups outside- you don't have to call ahead but you can. They bring out a big bucket of ice for your drinks to chill if you need it. The food is great and affordable.. there are a good amount of veggie options and the sandwiches are yum! The staff is also as equally attentive as they are laid back.. Kudos to whoever is hiring these people. Omar is the best- he takes really good care of us every time. Last time I was there with my little family of friends from high school and we didn't want to leave. We stayed until closing and he schooled us about house music and djs. Chicago's northside can be a small world, but it's better with IRAZU in it!!
