I really wish this place weren't so far from where I live. I could eat here every day! Last night was only my second time there because of the distance, and now because of $4.39/gallon gas, I probably won't be driving up there just for dinner despite the deliciousness. The pizzas are fantastic. I love the crispy, chewy, lightly charred, and slightly salty taste and texture of their crust. They've got wood-fired oven, Neopolitan-style pizza down to perfection. We had two pizzas: the Marguerita, which is simplicity itself with good quality Italian tomatoes, buffalo mozzerella, and a sprinkling of basil. Then we had a white pie with arugula. Also delicious. The arugula was lightly dressed and sitting of top of the pizza like a little salad. It did not have the piquancy of the dressed arugula that came with our pizza at Francesca's but that's just fine because the arugula was very fresh and flavorful. Speaking of fresh, the salads are wonderful here. The insalada mista is a large plate of springy mixed greens, tossed just right with a balsamic based dressing. The anchovy appetizer was to die for. Beautiful little white anchovy fillets sitting on a bed of arugula salad. these are not the super-salty canned or bottle anchovies that you get in the store--absolutely not! These anchovies are a revelation. they taste like the sea and the texture is soft and tender, like a piece of sushi. If you've never had this appetizer before, you're missing out. Anyway, five stars. The only thing that marred our experience and was not at all the fault of the restaurant was that a car alarm went of across the street while we were dining outside; then a souped up pickup peeled off down the street. There was also some event nearby that brought a herd of overdressed teens in our direction. They proceeded to get into their cars and peel off one after another, to our utter irritation. If we had known about these potential disturbances, we probably would have opted to sit inside...
