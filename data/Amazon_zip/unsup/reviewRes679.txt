Wonderful experience. It waiters are very attentive, very professional and very knowledgeable about what is being served. The food was amazing. I recommend you try it at least once, may break the bank but worth it in my book if you like to try something new. The menu is awesome and they matched the drinks, food and bread choice up perfectly. The dry ice thing was cool to. My sister and I were there since she had a conference and I was tagging along. We did the 12 course with the drink pairings. Worth a shot at least once in your life time if you are in Chicago.
