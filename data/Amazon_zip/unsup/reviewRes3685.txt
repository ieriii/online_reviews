I don't want to repeat all the good things everyone has said here - they are all true. Wonderfully delicious chicken or wings that are highly, highly addictive - be warned. And the beef bowls are incredibly good as well. I so want to give this place 5 stars - but it is fast food with communal tables so I have to hold off on that 5th star until they open a store up in the Andersonville area or expand their operations. Enjoy - it is really, really good !
