Even with the deals they offered, the food is not worth the price. Flat priced meals (an appetizer, entree and dessert or an appetizer, half pasta and and entree for $30) certainly helped (my meal would have come to $45 with out the deal), however, it wasn't enough to merit a return trip. For appetizers, we tried the house made rabbit sausage and the salama/prosciutto etc sampler. The sausage was spicy but quite good, however, the sampler was a miss. The quality of the meat was not notable. The winter squash ravioli was nice, however, a half portion is anemic. Of the main courses, ribs w/polenta and peppers and spicy chicken with spinach and broccoli, only the tender ribs were worth remembrance. The polenta was flavorless and the spinach was bitter to the point of being inedible. The chicken, while not terribly over cooked, was dry. For dessert, a dry, bland bread pudding. Definitely can't recommend this restaurant for these prices.
