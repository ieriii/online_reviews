We got in the same day we called for a reservation. Let this go down in Schwa history (and thank you to whoever cancelled their reservation). Schwa is probably the smallest restaurant I have ever eaten in. The atmosphere is nothing to write home about, but you don't go to Schwa for the atmosphere. We came loaded with a six pack of Southern Tier for the kitchen and a bottle of champagne, bottle of white, and a bottle of red for the two of us. Don't judge. We just wanted to be prepared! And yes, we went through it all. 3.5 hours. 12 courses. All the guys are extremely friendly and everyone is clearly having a good time. Although each dish was prepared beautifully and most everything was quite delicious, it was not the best meal I've had in Chicago. My biggest complaint would be the heavy handed use of truffle oil two courses in a row. I had that taste in my mouth for the majority of the evening and it just wouldn't go away. Truffle oil may be for some, but it's certainly not for me. There were, however, definitely some highlights. The roe course with the key lime fritter was probably my favorite of all things. The baked potato soup was quite memorable, as was the foie gras. One of the courses was served with a nice cold glass of Dr. Pepper which surprisingly so was the perfect accompaniment to the dish. Fun stuff. Schwa is quite an experience and if you get in, you won't regret it. Like I said, not the best meal I've had in Chicago, but I'm glad I had the chance to go. Oh, and the music was just fine! I'm not sure what people are complaining about - it wasn't any louder than the music in any other restuarant you're going to sit in. And it was good - it fit well with the whole experience.
