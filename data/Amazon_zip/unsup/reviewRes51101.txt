The name had me hello. The food. Some good. Some not so good. Cheeseburger- is greasy and just the tasty damn thing I ever put in my mouth! The grits- outstanding. fried cauliflower- barley fried. The Jambolia- needed more spice but okay. Atmosphere is darling- not what I thought a "comfort food" resturant would look like... I would go back for the cheesburger and fried powder sugar thing.
