What a find! Wicker Park seems to be overrun by pricey sit down restaurants - until you come upon this yummy choice just steps beyond Subterranean! Although it's tight for seating - you'll probably have to share a table or take it to go- this little self serve, "fast food", middle eastern treasure has a buffet, plenty of veggie selections (AXE-cellent falafel!), free self serve fresh water, and quick, savory hot and cold middle eastern goodies. OK, no alkie drinks, but get it to go and enjoy it with your favorite Shiraz at home! One other down is that it is so popular they do run out of things... but the alternatives are delicious!
