Has some really good deep dish pizza. I feel like I've enjoyed the filling better at other places, and this is going to sound kind of weird...but I was really impressed with the crust.  Normally, when I get deep dish, I can't even eat the crust because a lot of places either can't keep it from getting soggy or try to prevent that from happening but just end up making it way too thick. However, the crust here was perfect - not so thick it couldn't be cut through yet still crunchy and flaky even after the 15 minutes it took me to finish my piece. Thumbs up.
