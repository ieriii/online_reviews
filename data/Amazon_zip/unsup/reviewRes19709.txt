It's always bad going somewhere with high expectations. There is a lot of room for disappointment, and that is what happened with our dinner. I had the pepito torta consisting of short ribs with pickled jalapenos, caramelized onions, Jack cheese, and black beans. There was a good quantity of meat but the other ingredients were very scant. I did not taste any beans or cheese in the sandwich. There also nothing spectacular about the ingredients. The ribs were essentially shredded beef, the pickled jalapenos were just like the kind you get out of a jar, etc. Nothing about this torta made it worth $12 when you could get the same thing anywhere in Pilsen for $4. Avoid the Almendrado. It is supposed to be a hot chocolate with almond milk, but tastes like chocolate flavored buttermilk. Overall okay, but I would not recommend the wait just to try this place.
