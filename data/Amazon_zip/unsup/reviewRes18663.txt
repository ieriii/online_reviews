Cheese curds. Properly made. Beers and other beverages that put your corner bar to shame. Great food. Always have great service in there. Nice atmosphere. Good music. Sage Francis veggie burger called "Strange Famous"? I'm no vegetarian but I love me some Xaul Xan! This is a favorite- no brainer -just want good food - oh yeah Bad Apple! There are 10 or so restaurants within walking distance of Bad Apple, but few have the right mix of food, drink and atmosphere. Used to eat at this location when it was "Feed the Beast" I can this was a great replacement.
