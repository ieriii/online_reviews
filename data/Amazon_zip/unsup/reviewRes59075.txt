i was visiting a friend in chicago for new year's and we came to yolk for breakfast on sunday and what a great time. the food was awesome, the service was great and what a vibrant atmosphere. watching the owner taki at the counter preparing the food and his friend who sat us was a real treat, 2 handsome studs. i'll be coming back to chicago really soon. thanks yolk!!
