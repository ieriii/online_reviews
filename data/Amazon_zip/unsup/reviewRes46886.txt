First of all I am loving me some Uncommon Ground. It's almost impossible for me to imagine anyone who would not LOVE the Tree-tini. This may be the worlds most perfect cocktail. Ginger infused vodka, chai vermouth, and handmade cider. Get the heck outta here with all that lovin in a glass.  The artisinal sausages with the grainey mustard and purple potato salad-Yum! I also loved the calamari- I had mine with the sauce on the side so I could dip at will. Very light tempura style breading with a balanced sauce- not too spicy, not too sweet. I kinda wanted another of the Tree-tini's for dessert, but I had to drive home in the snow. Oh, and one more thing! I guess for every Tree-tini they sell they plant a tree. I like that, good people making great drinks.
