Fresh, inexpensive, absolutely delicious meal in under ten minutes. I usually prefer to take it to go as the seating area is slightly cramped and people tend to walk into you while you're eating if you're not lucky enough to grab a table away from doors, windows, lines, bathrooms, or... well, pretty much anything but that one table by the ATM, that one's awesome. I've had some pretty bad issues with their delivery service, but I would consider moving back to Wicker Park just to be closer to this space. Plus, the guys behind the counter are often flirty and look just as yummy as the lentil soup. Mmm.
