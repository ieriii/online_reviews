1. IF YOU'RE HERE ON BUSINESS, IT'S OK.  2. IF YOU'RE HERE FOR ANYTHING OTHER THAN BUSINESS, MEH. Sorry for the caps, I just wanted to make it clear that this place can serve a purpose, but it shouldn't be your first choice for a nice stay with the Mr./Mrs. Good: The staff is friendly, no problems there. Rooms are spacious and clean. 90 min. freek cocktail time on weekdays is cool. The beds are super comfy. Bad: The nicest part of the hotel is the lobby. The rooms are way overpriced for what you get, a glorified Holiday Inn with a terribly-obstructed view. There's no room service, they partner with Harry Caray's across the street till about 11pm and I hate Harry Caray's. It costs $44 to park/valet your car here! Park your own car at one of the self parks next to the hotel, trust me. All in all, not a horrible place, but you can do way better. I recommend Hotel Sax a block south of this place if you're trying a romantic weekend/night.
