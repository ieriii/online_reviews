The beer gets 4 stars. The pizza gets no stars. If you love soggy wet thin crust pizza then Piece is your place.  I can't believe this place continues to sell this hack pizza, wet, floppy, and falls apart, leave it in the oven longer guys.  Come for the beer, eat your pizza somewhere else.  Love the beer, when this place isn't crowded, it's a nice place to grab a drink.
