One of the best spots there is....period. I've been going regularly for over 10 years and it never disappoints. Incredible food, incredible value. Best falafel sandwiches in the city, hands down. The lentil soup is fantastic, especially with an egg & cheese pie on the side. You really can't go wrong with anything here. Don't miss it!
