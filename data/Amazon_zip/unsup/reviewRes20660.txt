BYOB is where it's at - especially with sushi, right? cause let's face it - the good stuff's not cheap. so HUGE plus... and allowed me to feel free to spend the "saved" cash on more rolls. And the sushi at Coast is great! I'm a huge fan of the White Dragon and the Jalapeno Hamachi... yummmmm - my stomach's growling as I reflect... The server was chill, plenty of personality, and wasn't pushy which was much appreciated given the confusion which appropriately characterizes our group's ordering technique. Potential bad things..... 1) Place is super crowded. Went on a Tuesday night and was absolutely packed. However, they do reservations - which I highly recommend! 2) Place is LOUD - generally. Specifically, the two drunk guys that were sitting behind us added a whole another level to the preexisting cacophony. But I like this place and will definitely be back.
