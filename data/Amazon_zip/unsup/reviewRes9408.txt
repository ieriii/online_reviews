This place captures what 'Nam must have been like before the war.... Asian food with a hint of French influence. You can smell the intrigue in the air and salt air mix with the jungle..... Could be a significant wait for a table late weekends, but early is no problem despite the increased business.  I was a huge fan in it's early years because of the atmosphere, but it had become a little touristy as of late, which knocks it down a star. Service may be spotty (it was impeccable in the past), but the food tastes authentic (like they smuggled the chef in on a freighter). Great date place if you are having a night on the town - sophisticated and homey at once. Nice, but they could shake things up with some new options.
