The only possible reason for marking Hot Doug's down is that now every other sausage, hot dog, or french fry that I eat tastes just a little bit worse in comparison. Hot Doug is doing god's work and there's no two ways about it. The wait can be close to two hours, bring a friend, a book, a phone, a video game this is the 21st century, if you can't entertain yourself for that long then you need to up your ritalin dosage. Duck fat frites prove the existence of a loving force for good in the universe. The foie gras duck sausage is transcendent, but so is everything else. If you even care the slightest about sausage, then you must eat here before you die; it's a revelatory experience about the glory of meat in tube form.
