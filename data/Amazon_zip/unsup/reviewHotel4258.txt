The only reason this hotel is not getting 5 stars from me is the price. Normally my work pays for my trips, and did on this occasion, but I respect the folks out there reading this who may not be flushed with cash. This is a pricey hotel, and is probably a little bit more expensive than it needs to be. The building is old, and thusly, the rooms are not quite as spacious. However, my room did have an attached "living" room with chairs and another flat-screen tv, which helped stretch things out a bit. The lobby truly is spectacular. You come up from ground level by way of escalators and find yourself floored by the cathedral-esque painted ceiling and detailed architecture. Since the room was not ready by the time of check-in, the hotel offered $50 in hotel services for the wait. That $50 was used towards the amazing high tea they offer daily in the grand lobby - best high tea I've EVER had! Lots of food and you could also get a glass of champagne to boot. There was one gentleman with thick-rimmed glasses who would work the desk and he was just so helpful and delightful. He was extremely knowledgeable about the city and could provide both flashy and mega cheap-but-awesome places to go.
