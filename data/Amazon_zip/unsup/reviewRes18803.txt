Well after my third visit I've come to the realization that this place is the best in NORTH CENTER. If I hear someone say south lincoln square again I'm gonna flip out. The beer menu is beyond extensive. Ronny the bartender knows his beers and fun facts about the brewers. Great selection of seasonal and non-seasonal beers.  The burgers...I've only had the Sirloin and Big Texan. The sirloin is a 10/10. Meat on top of meat (sorry vegeterians) with horseradish cream sauce...to die for. The big texan was good, but a little dry. Listen to me complain about a top 5 burger in my life. The fries are top notch as well. I hear the chesse curds are pretty good too. I spend too much time in Wisconsin to enjoy cheese curds in north center.  If you an average beer drinker who loves sports you probably won't like the crowd. If you can get past the poser emo crowd you'll be just fine. Mostly yuppies and emo wannabes, but there are some legit normal people in there. I don't know why good burgers and extensive beer lists attract people like this but it does. It's a must if your in the hood and hungry.
