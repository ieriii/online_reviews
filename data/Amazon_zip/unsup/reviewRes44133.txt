Having lived in LA among sushi snobs for several years now, I have to say that some of their snobbery has rubbed off on me. Not that all the sushi in LA is good, mind you...there are definitely some mediocre joints. That said, when I went to Wakamono with my family the Friday after Thanksgiving, I was so pleasantly surprised - I thought the food was absolutely delicious, the presentation was gorgeous, the place was cool and the prices were not outrageous. The only reason I dock a star is because I thought the service was a bit inconsistent - the host with the glasses refused to let my mom and I sit down at the empty table while my stepdad and brother were parking the car. He even waved his hand at me when I moved closer to the table and said, "no, you cannot sit here until you're whole party is here." It was not very welcoming. Were they going to give us another table? I wondered what he would do if we sat down anyway...kick us out? I HATE that stupid rule. After that stupidity, the rest of the meal was pretty perfect. As usual, my family ordered way too much, but here's a list of what we had: Wasabi soba noodles: Good but VERY spicy. Edamame: Hot with sesame seeds. Beautiful presentation. Salmon tartare with rice crisps: My mom ended up ordering a second one of these. The salmon was fresh, simply prepared with lemon and basil. Absolutely divine. Salmon, amberjack and wasabi tobiko sashimi: like butter. Fire Dragon Roll: great if you like eel. Wakamono Roll Spicy Trio Roll: probably the least impressive of the rolls, but still very good. Yo La Mango Roll: this might have tied with the spicy scallop roll for my favorite of the evening. Delicious and interesting with the mango. Emerald Roll Spicy Scallop Roll w/ fresh salmon and wasabi tobiko on top: this might have been my favorite. All in all it was a great night. I would highly recommend Wakamono if you're in the hood and I will definitely come back when I'm in Chicago!
