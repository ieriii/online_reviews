Well I set a new personal record for dinners in one evening by eating back to back with two different parties in one evening. The advantage was I was able to sample about 50% of the menu. There was nothing that I disliked and a few key stand outs as far a my personal favorites. The chicken kabobs are delicious, I never order chicken and after party #1 ordered them party #2 also had to so that understood the fabulousness of that dish. Another stand out was the squid, the flavor was delicious and the seafood was not too chewy at all. Everything else was tasty and I have to say I really loved the pork shoulder and the pig tails as well. As far as cocktail I enjoyed some bubbly and wine, I wish that they had some Argentinian varieties....maybe next time?? We had a rice pudding dessert with chocolate topping that was truly a treat without being so overly sweet. My dinner guests were trying to decipher the recipe to pillage for their own enjoyment. Go early and go often, this place is a little place of character and heaven in the concrete loop.
