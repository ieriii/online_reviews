Rumor has it that Geja's will be having another Groupon come April 2011. Look for it. Buy it. Best $25 I ever spent on a Groupon. I'm going to jump on the 4 star bandwagon and also jump on the "most romantic restaurant in Chicago" bandwagon. Going into Geja's from a cold winter night was like stepping into a different world. It's downstairs and pretty dark with low ceilings, so it has kind of a cellar-ish feel to it. But the staff is so friendly (and there's a coat check), and the candles are just so warm and inviting....and something about it is just so relaxing. I love fondue anyway but I have to say I was blown away by this place. My girlfriend and I came here to catch up and had the most wonderful meal. We were seated by the patio where it was quiet and we were able to have a great conversation all night. We got the Veggie Platter (which actually is more a four or five-course meal). You get a plated salad, cheese fondue with grapes and apples and bread, a veggie platter with hot oil for cooking and various dipping sauces, and finally the chocolate dessert fondue. The whole process just engenders a relaxed conversation, sharing, and enjoying the finer things in life - i.e., yummy food. In other words it's freaking awesome. Best date night ever - with girlfriends or boyfriends :)
