I love this place. My boyfriend is a big foodie and saw Graham Elliot on Top Chef Masters, so I thought it would be fun to take him here one night. I've been a few times, and have never had a bad meal.  The decor is very chic and classy, but not stuffy and overdone. When reviewers say that Graham Elliot is a playful take on gourmet, they really mean it. I mean, what hauty restaurant would have something like Arrogant Bastard Ale on their bar menu? My boyfriend obviously ordered that just to be able to say it to the waitress. I adore the truffle popcorn that they serve in place of bread and butter. So delicious, but dangerous to have within arms reach. We opted not to do the tasting, but to pick our own plates to share Tapas style. By far the coolest was the Casear salad. Such a creative way to serve it. Who wouldn't love a brioche twinkie :) The tuna sashimi was also delicious, of course, as were the scallops (cooked perfectly) and the sweetbreads. I am usually a picky eater, but I figured that anything Graham Elliot makes would be delicious so I hesitantly tried the sweetbreads, and loved them. I don't think you can go wrong with anything at that restaurant. For bigger plates, we got the lamb (my favorite of the whole night) and the salmon (also delicious). For dessert my boyfriend got something chocolate with cardamom ice cream and I had the strawberry shortcake with lavender ice cream. I really liked the flavored ice cream, but my boyfriend said he thought he was eating soap. I remember coming her forever ago and getting a deconstructed Snickers bar. (Graham Elliot if you're listening - bring that back!) Anyway, it was a pricey dinner, but such fun and delicious food. I've been to a number of gourmet restaurants and felt that they weren't worth the money, but this definitely is. My boyfriend and I still talk about that dinner, and we will definitely be coming back here soon.
