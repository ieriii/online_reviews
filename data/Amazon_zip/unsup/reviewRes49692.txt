What is better than a BYOB restaurant?  A BYOB restaurant with GOOD FOOD! This place has got it!  I always get this chicken and shrimp dish that comes with a salad and rice for about $15. It is a large amount of food and just really, really good. Last time I was there, we went during the week and everyone brought at least 1 bottle of wine. It was nice because we didn't feel rushed to leave (no crowd) and just were able to have a nice long dinner. Everyone else that I was with ordered appetizers but they are a little too bizarre for me. **And I just noticed they are moving across the street to a new condo building. I wonder if that will change the ambiance.
