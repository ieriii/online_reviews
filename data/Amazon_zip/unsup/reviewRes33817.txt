I've been here many times and it's one of my favorite italian restaurants because you don't have to leave here feeling stuffed, but usually do because you can't help it. Every experience has been pretty great, except for one time when I made reservations for a 8:30 for a party of eight, and we didn't get seated till around 9:30. It was really frustrating because they kept telling us that it was because one table was just sitting. Well, there's got to be a plan B if a table doesn't get up. They didn't seem really sympathetic, but when we did get seated, they had complimentry appetizers already ordered for the table (calamari and bruschetta..my faves). They majorly redeemed themselves since I had little expectations that they even felt bad and because I was with my parents from out of town.  I usually order everything but the entree. I love love love the calamari (probably my favorite in the city), the mia francesca salad, and the chocolate flourless cake. I've tried about five entrees and they've all been good. The wine list is small, but I've always liked my drinks. The only thing that keeps me from coming here more is that it's always crowded and there's no place to really sit and chill while you wait for your table since the bar is always crowded too(sometimes you can get a seat at the upstairs bar).
