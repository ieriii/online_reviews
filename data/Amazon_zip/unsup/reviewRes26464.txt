Chicago deep dish is stuff of legend. The amount of cheese, the dough, the the thickness, flavors of the sauce...it all has to be on a grand scale of taste. Uno is great, Lou Malnati's is wonderful however none of them can be complete in every category like Pequod's.  Being that I'm from chicago, I love deep dish and have had pretty much all the staples of "the best deep dish". None can come close this place. The sauce alone I could drink if it was bottled. The amount of cheese is perfect everytime over. The crust is beautifully toasty on the edges and chewey and a bit buttery to compliment that sauce. The ingredients are fresh and plenty. I like to get the pepperoni, mushroom and peppers. Mind blowing flavors.  The restaurant has two floors and on weekends both will be packed. It's good to get in here around 6pm on the weekends...don't worry, 2 slices will keep you happy to the following morning. Service is standard, nothing over the top but they get you your food. This place is more of a bar/restaurant, some big screens are around for games. The beer selection, though small, is good enough along side to this wonderful deep dish.  This pizza would be my last meal if I knew I'd die tomorrow.
