Sorry... but the hype was too big for this one, and Pequods didn't deliver the goods. We drove all the way out from downtown to experience the self-proclaimed "Best Pizza in the Universe". No easy public transit options to this place, so that lowers the rating for out-of-towners as well. We had the deep dish and it was decent, but not better than Lou's in my opinion. Beer selection was pretty good... I enjoyed the Half Acre (local Chicago brew). Atmosphere is lively though, so if the area, I would return, but not go out of my way for this one.
