This is hands-down my favorite find in Chicago. I do not live in this neighborhood, and therefore had no reason to stumble upon this restaurant. But when other reasons brought me to the area, I made this place a regular stop. Truly, the restaurant and the chefs are amazing. Each time I go, I find myself studying the presentation and food preparation, hoping that one day I might be able to replicate a dish at home. Until that time, which will likely never come, I will be a faithful. Good luck to you guys!
