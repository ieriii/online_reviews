Great place for a special occasion. Had the seven course (which is really more like nine) and the standouts included a scallop dish that was to die for and rabbit that was heavenly. I loved the presentation, especially the "eggs benedict" dessert. We had a great waiter as well, always kept our wine glasses full and explained every dish in detail, including how to eat it. Very relaxed atmosphere for fine dining. Granted, I don't have any dietary restrictions. Check out the wesbite before you go, it gives you a preview plus the wine suggestions are really good and really affordable.
