If I were ever put on death row and had to choose my last meal, this place would seriously be a top contender. My boyfriend and I nabbed a reservation for restaurant week on a Friday night, so we were thrilled. The place is right down the street from my apartment and completely unassuming to someone who walks by 5-10x a day. You would never guess that this is a BBQ joint from the outside. Let me start out by saying that we had our reservation locked in on a Friday - the first Friday of Lent, nonetheless - growing up Catholic and not eating meat typically on those Fridays...I will happily accept my warm little spot in hell for eating here. Highlights of the meal included: EXTENSIVE bourbon menu, the housemade chips and bread and butter pickles, the BBQ shrimp and lemon infused grits (could've seriously eaten those all night), the kobe brisket and the [oh em gee so good] carrot cake. I left this meal extremely full and extremely drunk, which is an automatic A in my book. Our next venture is to check this place out for brunch - cheddar and chive biscuits and gravy?! Yes, please!!
