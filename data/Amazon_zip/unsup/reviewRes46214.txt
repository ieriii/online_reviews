After living in Chicago for 3 years, I finally visited the oh-so-popular Grand Lux Cafe. It was pretty good. I had some fish dish that was filling, healthy (?), and had great flavor. And the decor was pretty awesome, actually. Some of the chandeliers they had were unbelievable! If you are a tourist and like standard touristy things, go here. And if you've lived here for 3 years and still haven't gone, go here. But, if you're looking for something truly unique and very "Chicago," pass on this one.
