Finally! We've been meaning to try Wildfire for some time now and since my sister is in town we finally made a reservation in time for dinner (the last time we tried to call the day of and they only had a slot for 9:45pm, so do make those reservations!). For starters, we had the house salad (yum) and the baked french onion soup (perhaps as good as it gets?). I opted for the petite filet and was easily able to finish it. We also had the horseradish filet mignon wrapped in bacon and the New York steak. The filet mignon was probably the best of the lot and they were all very well cooked, but I still think the one I had at Chop House was the best so far. The desserts are all homemade and they bring you a tray to pick from. We opted for the peach and blueberry pie with peach ice cream - that was delicious and the ice cream was especially good (not sure if that part was homemade but if it wasn't I'd like to know where they get it!). When we go back next time, maybe I'll try the chicken...
