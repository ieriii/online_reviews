I would suggest Hot Doug's to anybody and love the creativity and quality of the menu and the personality of Doug while taking your order. It is a unique place that everybody should try at least once. But there are a lot of places in this city where you can get a great hot dog and some of the sausages I've tried have been great or just ok. I thought this would be a place I would go to as often as I could but have found myself sometimes passing it by for other options. Definitely try it out and see for yourself.
