Not the best Hyatt I've ever stayed at. It is at a good location, on the water and right by Michigan Ave but the rooms were not impressive at all. The bar and restaurant areas were really nice though, so that's a plus. Random fact: the bar stretches across almost the entire length of the hotel and is the largest bar in Chicago.
