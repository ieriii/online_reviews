We had a great stay at La Quinta Inn! We got our room for $120/night on Priceline (for 2 double beds) and were impressed with the modern and stylish look of the decor. The bathroom was great- amazing glass shower with plenty of room for two people. We had a flat screen TV, free Wi-Fi, desk, and a great view of Chicago skyscrapers. The beds and linens were extremely comfortable! The room was quiet- we never heard our neighbors. We appreciated that the front desk staff asked us to show our room keys before entering the elevator ever time we got back to the hotel. I imagine this keeps out the "riff-raff". The complimentary breakfast was sooo good- waffles, bacon, sausage, eggs, bagels, cereal, etc. All of the staff we came into contact with were polite and friendly, especially the breakfast room staff. It was a very comfortable stay in a stylish place.
