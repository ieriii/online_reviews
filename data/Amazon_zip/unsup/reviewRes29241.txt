My family and I have been fans of Pequod's for decades, and I've never written a review on Yelp before. But I just had an experience worth sharing. White taking refuge from a thunderstorm, I decided to have lunch at Pequod's. I ordered the special which is a drink and personal pizza. When I was about half way through, a guy who had not been my server asked if I would like another drink. And I said sure I'll have another Diet Coke. He neglected to mention that you don't get free refills on the lunch special. So my 6 dollar lunch went up to $8.57. I realize this isn't a huge amount of money, but I strongly feel he had an obligation to tell me I would be charged for another drink. When I asked the hostess after I received the check, she blew me off. A smarter business move would have been to have taken the charge off and apologized. But I guess they don't care about customer relations. The whole act just struck me as shady, and I will probably go to Malnati's more often than Pequod's...no matter how good their pizza is.
