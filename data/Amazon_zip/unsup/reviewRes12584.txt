This is probably the best Latin American restaurant I've been to. I'll admit I haven't been to thousands of them, but still, this place is extremely delicious. I split the Taste of Cuba appetizer with my table, and those empanadas were damn good. Can't go wrong with the plantain chips either. For the entree, the Honey jalapeno pork chops are a league of their own. Holy god. I don't think I've ever eaten a better pork chop anywhere else. Now I just need to figure out how to make my own honey jalapeno pork chops. Or I could just come back here, cause the food is so damn good. Oh, and the sangria was tasty as well.
