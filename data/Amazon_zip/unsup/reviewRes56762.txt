Wow truly great neopolitan pizza when I asked the owner where he really learned how to make pizza from he said Italy which is always a good sign. The pizza was fresh with the crust having the perfect amount of char. It truly was a wonderful Margherita pie. Also, when I asked the owner what pizza he reccomends for my list on best pizza in the world he said Keste on bleeker street in ny, I will definitely go check that out.
