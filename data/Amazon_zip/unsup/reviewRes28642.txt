Reservations are your friend. Fortunately, we had them. Very colorful decor. Fun, bustling atmosphere. Service was very good. They had a wide variety of non-alcoholic, non soda beverages (it was 11:30, after all). We had heard so much about their guacamole, so we had to give it a try. My guacamole that I make at home would give them a run for their money, but they lived up to their reputation. The quality of avacados was top notch. In fact, we all wondered where they got such good ones this time of year. Needless to say, this goes way beyond your typical strip mall Mexican-American fare. I had Tacos al Carbon, with duck (duck!). The special of the day featured goat (goat!). I was disappointed they didn't have tripe tacos. That would have really freaked out the others in our party (love shock value). The menu covered a wide range of prices, from basement bargain to splurge territories. I get the feeling that it would be hard to go wrong with this menu. We'll have to try Topo next time. I wanted to try it this time, but we were only able to get rezzies at Frontera.
