I had the barbacoa torta and churros when I went for lunch. The ingredients used were definitely top quality and the torta was delicious. The churros, while good, don't beat my favorite Churro Factory churros. This place is WAY too crowded though and that makes it tough to just sit down and thoroughly enjoy your meal. Still, I will rate more on the food than on the actual atmosphere (unless the atmosphere is supposed to be really nice and just wasn't). Could have been a 5 though... I really want to try some Caldos the next time I go.
