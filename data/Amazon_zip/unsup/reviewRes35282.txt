The Beijing Duck is awesome! I've had it here on a number of different occasions. The table side carving is fun, and the duck awesome (the crispy skin is the best), the steamed buns are great, the condiments (green onion & pickled radish) are fresh. The fried rice and the soup that come with it, so-so... No worries, as the duck is well worth the price! I also enjoy going here for a light casual week night dinner out. I one of the many dumpling soups or barbecue meats over rice. I like the duck and pork over rice, it's cheap and very satisfying. I also like the soups, usually the combo wonton soup, which is a good light meal. I usually order a side of Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce, can't go wrong.  A must visit if you are hungry for Asian food and your on the north side of Chicago!
