Amazing Steak & Organic too. I left very impressed by the old world style foods that are so healthy. I never had duck liver mouse or pate before and it was a little strange to my palate but I have had a strange craving for it ever since. This was one of there appetizers of the day items I hope I can find it when I go back. I enjoyed the homemade sauces as an alternative to chemically laden bottled condiments but I will admit I missed having A1 sauce with my steak that being said, I have never enjoyed a steak so much in my life. The price was a little more than we usually spend about $80 for two people but this will definitely be our new spot for Birthdays, anniversaries and special occasions. The price is absolutely worth the quality and we could have had a great dinner for less but I'd rather play cheepskate elsewhere just to eat here more often. Our $80 got us 2 Rib-eye steak dinners 1 salad with Rabbit confit 1 appetizer of the day and 2 drinks
