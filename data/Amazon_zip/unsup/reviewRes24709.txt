The hubby and I went here last night as part of their restaurant week promotion. Overall there were things we liked and things we did not like. Ambience/Space: Very tight quarters if you are not in one of the booth enclaves that they have. I basically had to listen to the entire conversation of the couple next to me, because the tables were so close together. I mean I couldn't tell which tables were seated as a group vs. couples sitting so close at different tables. If I were to go back, I would definitely wait for/ request a booth by reservation. It was almost a bit clostraphobic. Those who claim this is one of the most romantic restaurants in chicago, have a strange definition of romantic. Service: Host and Manager nice, prompt, and professional. Bar staff friendly. Wait staff friendly and competent. Food: It was a nice change to the typical melting pot, and the cheese fondue is good, but the basket they served the bread and grapes in was definitely old and worn out and needed changing. The main course we had the international and the conouisseur which basically included beef tenderloin, chicken, shrimp, and lobster. The portions were small and also there is not choice of cooking liquid. Just the oil. Protein quality was good, some of the dipping sauces were excellent (dill sauce, horseradish). Teriyaki and garlic aioli type sauce were decent also. Veggies were standard but good. Dessert was definitely the highlight. The chocolate was delicious, although I would have preferred less strawberries and marshmallow and more bananas and pound cake instead. But that's just me. All in all dessert was very good. Price: Definitely a little high for the value and quantity of food, but both my hubby and I were definitely full when we left. I'm not sure we would go back here if we had to pay full price, but I can see the appeal. Parking: It's lincoln park.... had to valet for 10 dollars. Overall, definitely worth checking out once, but not sure if I'll be back.
