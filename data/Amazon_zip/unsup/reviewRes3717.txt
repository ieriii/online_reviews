You know, sometimes it's the little things in life...like the fact that Crisp pokes holes in their to go containers so the steam can escape and not make everything soggy....and the many soda choices you can find-hellllloooo Tahitian Treat...and the big things here, like the food? Awesome. Crispy chicken and tasty sacues. The steak bowl is awfully good too-the beef is flavored just right and the portions are huge. Go with friends, order lots of different items and then share everything, it's the way to do it. Damn, I want some right now...
