I have only been to this place once and at the recommendation of a friend, I had their soup #39 (if you go for it gotta go big!). I am not too familiar with this type of food, but I really enjoyed it! I liked that they let you season the soup with basil among other things, and that it seemed very hardy. For the price I think it was worth it.
