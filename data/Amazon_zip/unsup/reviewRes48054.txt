Since my first review I have probably dined here a dozen times. Each time is spectacular and moutherwateringlydelicious. If you must pick a meal period to dine at The Publican, brunch is the way to go. The red wine poached eggs are probably one of the best brunch options in the city. This place is fun for groups and great for folks who enjoy sharing food with one another...you are going to want to after seeing the other dishes. Other dinner musts include: Cioppino fish stew and the fried walleye.
