OK I am actually reviewing W Hotels in general--to date I've stayed at one in Montreal, New Orleans, Istanbul, and NYC. The rooms are always mod and interesting, the hotels are always done up in a theme that is somehow regional and each hotel has a bar or club that is good for hitting when heading out or coming back. Sometimes the hotel can be "too mod"--it takes a minute for your eyes to adjust when you walk in the lobby...at the hotel in Istanbul you had to walk in and out of a series of curtains. The last night in Istanbul all the mood lighting in the room malfunctioned and started coming on anf off. And this might just be me..but it usually takes me a minute to figure out the modern light switches and faucets. But the best part is the more you stay with them they will upgrade you and once you do a suite at the W it's very hard to go to other hotels!
