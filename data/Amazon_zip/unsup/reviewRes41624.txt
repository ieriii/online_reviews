Over 400 reviews? Really? I would have never known. So I decided to randomly meet Jennie T here while I was still salty from the gym. I would have never guessed this place was so popular...however, we did come around 9pm on a Thursday night so there wasn't much of a wait. I've never had Pho before...and I definitely pronounce it incorrectly. So don't judge. So for about $20 (tip included), I got to be stuffed with the below. Pho - noodle soup with beef and tripe - awesome. I was too much of a weenie to put in the hot peppers but the mint/basil/whatever it was/sprouts I put in were amazing. Lotus Salad - Interesting. A bit tart but so tasty, crunchy, and fresh. Vietnamese Crepe - I was supposed to wrap in lettuce with cucumber but I was too lazy and just stuffed myself with the crepe filled with shrimp and bean sprouts. Delicious. One suggestion though. I went after a trip to the gym and I was starving. Not a great idea...bc the menu can definitely be overwhelming when you want to eat one of everything. Also, you're definitely going to smell like Pho when you leave. Be prepared.
