Good to take your phat hungry friends from out of town. All the meats have the same flavor to them. The chicken tastes like the shrimp, and the beef...they all taste the SAME! The service was so impersonal. The wait-staff seems to have a "speal" to spill. They seem only interested in selling you on drinks, upgrades...bla, bla...I know that is what waiters do, but they don't "do it well" here.  The salad bar was alright. They had a few healthy options there. In my opinion I think it is just a "fancy version" of a pig-trough. It is not sexy, not romantic and not fun to watch people burst their buttons stuffing themselves as if they would never see food again. It is gross, no matter if they are wearing a suit or not. If you are a total carnivore, this would be the place for you.
