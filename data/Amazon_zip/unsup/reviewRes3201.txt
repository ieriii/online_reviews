Great chicken wings or try the half chicken. I haven't tried anything else. It is a once a month treat, that combined with a pbr and I'm pretty set for the evening. Seoul Sassy, you are my rocking hot date and if you're not available or in the mood, I'm hanging with Crisp BBQ. Hopefully, my dating life will improve so I don't have to make these ridiculous, but tasty dates. Maybe I'll try something else at Crisp, but I'll stay faithful to the fried wings and half chick, for now.
