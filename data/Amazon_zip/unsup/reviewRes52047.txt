We popped in to get some carryout food at the bar. Meatball sandwich, Calzone thingy, Chicken Tenders, and an Appetizer Sampler. The portions were big so it was in line with the price. As for the taste of the meal, most of it was ok so nothing to go crazy over.  I did notice that their Mozzarella sticks were huge. Thick pieces of Moz with ultra-crunchy breading. That was the highlight. Would I ever take out from here again? My bro had to catch a flight. The bartender said it would take 30 mins to make the food (really?). I assured my bro that it would really be 15-20. Guess what? It took 45. Damn!
