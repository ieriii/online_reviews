I was really pleased to finally be able to hit up this joint. A buddy of mine had been telling me about Q for a while and we were finally able to figure out a time to go. I was definitely impressed. First of all, I was really amazed at how big the place is. We went for lunch, and it wasn't crowded at all...we went right at Noon. We were seated right away in a booth in the back room. On the way back there you pass the main bar area, which is made for entertaining. Too bad it was lunch and we couldn't enjoy a bourbon or two. I knew I wanted a sandwich, and I ended up getting the pulled pork, at the recommendation of the waiter. I loved what they brought out. It was a generous portion of pulled pork on a pretzel bun. They serve it with 4 sauces on the side. The spicy one went the best with the pulled pork. The one sauce that is watery is too vinegary. The others were too sweet. The spicy sauce is the perfect balance of spicy and sweet. The cornbread that came on the side was also delicious - the perfect combo of sweet cornbread with the spiciness of the peppers. They have a pretty cool upstairs area as well. I can't wait to head back here some evening where I can kick back with friends, relax with a few drinks, and enjoy some amazing BBQ!
