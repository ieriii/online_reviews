Compared to all of the taquerias within walking distance, it is pretty expensive. A burrito, which comes with onion and cilantro at no extra charge, is north of $8, and a taco will cost almost $3. The best part about this place is that it is consistent whenever I've gone: before the lunch rush (11am), after the rush (2pm, 3pm, etc.), dinner time (8pm), and really late (2am). Although Tierra Caliente a few blocks north on Ashland produces a better taco during the lunch rush, I come here more often because I can trust it.
