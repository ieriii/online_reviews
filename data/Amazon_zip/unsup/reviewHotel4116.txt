I stayed here after staying at a smaller boutique hotel. Its posh for sure. Nice size rooms and a huge bathroom. I just cant believe they nickel and dime you for everything. Example:WiFi , at 12 dollars a day. A hotel this size can be giving that away. And whats with $4 water??? Really, come on. Its water. Plus this place was insane. People were trashed all over the place... lots of patrons slurring things to strangers walking by, stumbling around like they were at a frat party. Unfortunately thats the first impression I got before I reached the check in and thats what I remember most. Considering its a Hyatt its not that special, its just large and they'll make sure you'll remember your paying for the name.
