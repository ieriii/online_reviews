I like Alliance Bakery a lot. I've only ever had a few of the pastries, but what I've had has been quite tasty. I mostly like to go to Alliance to study, and the lounge next door is the perfect place for that - quiet, lots of outlets, good wi-fi signal, and access to tasty pastries and coffees. And I love looking at the cakes in the window - if they taste half as good as they look, I'd have to take one home every day!
