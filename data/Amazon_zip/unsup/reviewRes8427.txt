Wow. This place is AMAZING. I cannot even think of anything I disliked about any portion of my meal. We started with two glasses of wine and the special appetizer- some sort of ball of white cheese..almost like a cross between mozzarella and cream cheese, and came with crustini bread. It was so good, we asked for more bread...and I would have asked for a third helping, but I had to control myself a bit for our pizza. We split the diavola pizza- buffalo mozzarella, red sauce, salami, and red flakes. OMG. That was an amazing pizza. For dessert, we had the cappuccino gelato and the tiramasu. Both were incredible. I cannot say good enough things about this place. All I know is that I would like to go here again. VERY soon.
