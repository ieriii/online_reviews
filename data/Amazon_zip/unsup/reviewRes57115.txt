The first time that I came to eat here was for my friends birthday dinner. Soon as I walked in I loved how colorful it was plus the atmosphere of it all- was great! I tried their chicken--which was very tasteful! The second time I came here I brought my boyfriend along so he can taste the awesome food. He ordered the ARACHERA which was delicious!! It was at least the best we've ever tasted! That is truly THE reason why we keep coming back.
