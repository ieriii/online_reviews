Being a fan of AZ and Vegas we were excited they finally arrived in Chicago. We were however disappointed. The noise level is unbearable you can't even talk to those at your table the noise was actually painful in the dinning room and you have to SHOUT to be heard even the wait staff. It is so dark they hand out flashlights to read the menu. Food was just ok if they don't step it up they won't be around long.
