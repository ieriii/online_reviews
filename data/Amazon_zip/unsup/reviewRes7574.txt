I came to this place with a good friend and it was my first time being there and I must say I fell in love with this place. I can't recall what night of the week it was but it def was during the week, and a good crowd was at the place. He made reservartions and we arrived approx 20 mins earlier than we should have and the hostess was extremely nice and seated us immediately. I enjoyed the salad bar alot it was fresh as well. I tried about every meat and fell in love with the pork with cheese on it!! yum and the mashed potatoes were to die for!! along with this Banana like side dish. I will def be coming again everyone was nice and food just amazing!!
