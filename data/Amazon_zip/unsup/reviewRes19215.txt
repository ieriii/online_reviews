Bad apple may very well lay claim to the best burger in Chicago. Especially when you consider that they aren't charging silly $13 gourmet burger prices, it's hard not to hand them the crown. I know Kuma's fans or Sweets and Savories Wednesday burger special might argue but check it out for yourself. And the beer list? Awesome. Eleven city diner's $7.50 domaine dupage draft please take notes. Awesome local and international selection at totally reasonable prices. Bad apple will definitely get me to drive to Lincoln square again.
