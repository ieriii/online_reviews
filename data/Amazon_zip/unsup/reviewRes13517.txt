Glenn's has three things that are music to my ears: 1. excellent brunch (served all day!) 2. fresh fish 3. BYO option I LOVE Glenn's hash browns! The potatoes are crispy and there is a delicious tangy creaminess going on. The pecan pancakes are from heaven. Omelets and corned beef hash/eggs... yum! yum! You can tell that Glenn's background is in seafood. The fish selections are always really fresh and prepared in a flavorful, but simple way. I have yet to have anything that I did not enjoy. I also appreciate that they have a good wine and beer list, yet still allow you to bring your own with a minimal corkage fee. Sometimes, you are just in the mood for something specific. The real reason I am giving Glenn's the fifth star though is the service. No matter how busy it gets, you get attention and a smile. Glenn will often walk around to check on you himself. Quick story... Every year, my friend and I share our birthday party. This year, I had just moved to Minneapolis and came back last-minute. We could not miss our traditional Hoosier Mama pie though! I called HM directly, but that was delivery day and they were closed for sales. So, I called Glenn's. They not only sold me a whole pie, they trusted me with one of their own pie pans. It is things like that which make a place really stand out with me.  Yes, there can be a wait for brunch, but you can kind of figure out the traffic patterns if you go a few times. They are also pretty good at estimating wait times if you call ahead to ask.
