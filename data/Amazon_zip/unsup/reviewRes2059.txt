Totally worth the hype. I saw this on Bourdain and had to come when we went on vacation in Chicago. We got there at 10:15am, and there was already a line outside the building waiting for the place to open. I got the duck sausage with foie gras and a traditional dog with everything on it, my wife got an italian sausage. Oh, man, and some duck fat fries. If I lived in chicago, I'd come here every morning and try something different. My one regret is that I couldn't eat any more. I really wanted to try the steak sausage with horseradish mayo, the lamb sausage, etc. Living in LA, there's no place that I can get sausage like this. Next time I go to chicago, I am for sure coming back.
