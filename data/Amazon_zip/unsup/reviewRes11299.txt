Fantastic service, INCREDIBLE food! Seriously, it has been over a month since I've eaten at The Bongo Room & I am still craving the crab club sandwich. Big chunks of fresh crab, butter lettuce, thinly sliced hard boiled eggs.... HEAVEN! My friend had the most divine beet salad - the flavors were perfectly harmonized. We finished our meal with a... get this... pretzel pancake with caramel & white chocolate drizzled all over it. And yes, while this is technically on the breakfast menu & technically would be absurd to eat as your real breakfast, it is certainly reasonable to eat as dessert! I will be craving that damn sandwich (& trying to recreate it at home) until I can make it back to Chicago to eat it once again!
