I enjoyed a nice Sunday afternoon brunch here with some ladies. A few good things are the coffee and teas, pastries and of course granola to go! We enjoyed our lunches of huevos rancheros, salmon with cream cheese bagel and chicken panini. Great quality food, a little odd with the way you're seated after you order, servers aren't overtly excited or particularly nice, but the host who seated was accommodating. I would only recommend this place for smaller groups of people who are flexible... If that makes sense... Great food, somewhat nice atmosphere just very clustered.
