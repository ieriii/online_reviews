this place fell off big time! espeically the sit down one with the waitresses. i used to sell chiclets gum in here in the early 90's when i was kid. food was great! now it seems like every time i come the food and service gets worse and worse. there prices went up alot but thats not my issue with them. the meat is starting to taste more and more like rubber the chile rellenos are getting soggier and soggiier the hot sauce is literally turning into water , mabe cause ther freezing it or somthing and waitress have got the shittiest attitudes. id come and spend 60 dollars in tacos for every one at work two or three times a week and ask for a big cup of (now watered down) hotsauce and thell try to charge me 4 dollars for it. ill order 25 tacos and thell give me 5 tiny cups of hotsauce. breaks my heart to see them the way they are now.
