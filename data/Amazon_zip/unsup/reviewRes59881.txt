I ate at the Kinzie Chophouse about a week ago and I was not impressed. I couldn't help the feeling that I had just paid $40 for a $15 steak. The food tastes cheap for what you are paying. I got the distinct impression that this was a suburban chain steakhouse masquerading as a fine urban dinning destination. It needs to realize its place in the world. The menu is ridiculous and makes a mockery of anyone who is willing to pay these prices for this quality of food. And there lies the problem. I would guess that ownership feels it is in their best interests to buy inferior ingredients, markup the price, and pocket the savings. The only reason I'm not giving this a one star review is because the service was excellent. The staff is knowledgeable, friendly, and extremely helpful. The entire restaurant runs smoothly and the staff make it a pleasant dining experience. If it was not for cheap ownership, this would be an excellent restaurant for anyone to visit.
