Oh Gilt Bar. How you had set the bar way too high, as you were my first tackle after landing in CHITOWN! After touching down in Chicago, I WAS STARVING. I MEAN ST-ARRRRR-VING. The concierge at Sax Chicago led us to you and i am so glad he did. I could tell the place was crackin before I even walked in, which was a promising sign. We were led to their lounge area that reminded me a bit like a mini version of those bottle service areas in a club where the tables were more like coffee tables. We were quickly sat in between a couple of parties, but we were able to have more than enough room to ourselves. We were so hungry we ordered everything at once. We started out with our beers and Gilt Bar had a lot of beer from their local microbreweries. I had tried their Dark Ale Raspberry Beer which tasted real good. Our first dish: caramelized brussels sprouts & pork belly. I never had brussel sprouts before then and i couldnt believe that I have been deprived of such magnificence in my mouth (yes, i said it). Second dish: ricotta gnocchi with butternut squash & pancetta. This might have been my favorite dish. Pasta or pasta-like dishes are definitely my kryptonite. The butternut squash just fit right in with the Chicago fall weather. MUST TRY. Last dish: steamed mussels with dry vermouth, herbs &lemonbroth. This was good, but against the first two dishes, the mussels NEVER STOOD A CHANCE. Sadly, because i actually really enjoy eating mussels. Loved the vibe, service was awesome & the food really stole the show. Like i said before this place set the food bar too high and all that i ate afterwards was no contest. I WILL BE BACK WHENEVER IM IN TOWN AGAIN. next time, the CHEF'S TABLE :)
