i was having a hard day & had some time to kill. so i wandered to the marilyn statue but on my way i turned to my right, crossed over michigan avenue & headed in to the purple pig. i've been meaning to go here since they opened but the location kept me from achieving this. but here i was, it was 330 pm & what the hey? i was pleasantly greeted & sat at the bar. the wine list is completely overwhelming, so i let the awesome bartender help me choose. then i started to eat from the cold app veggie menu. she told me she did not like beets but loved the beet dish. ok. so i had to try the delicious pistachio crusted beets bathing in goat cheese. mmmm...then they sent out the orange cauliflower in bread crumbs & pecorino. mmm...then some delish soft serve, which i couldn't finish. i left happier than i was when i entered. marilyn can wait another day. i'll definitely be back, but with my bone marrow loving husband. if you love small plates, the ramones, awesome hip wait staff & kitchen staff, comfortable cool atmosphere, go here.
