Had a great weekend in Chicago; hotel location is perfect, but that's about all it has going for it. Room wasnt ready till 5pm on check in day. First room was moldy smelling; walls are paper thin, lobby is bright, loud, and uninviting, pool is fun, but tiny. room AC not up to par.  Bill- the GM - appears to have no sense of customer service/customer satisfaction skills. WIll definitely try another hotel next time, and would not recommend this. I expected more - Very disappointed for a Marriott
