We stopped here for an early dinner last week with a friend. I had sushi, while Chris and our friend had Thai food. I got to taste quite a variety of dishes and everything was fresh and really good. We all loved the sweet potato tempura maki. I have had sweet potato maki rolls before, but this was so good because it was tempura and so freshly prepared. I also had a chance to taste the red curry with tofu and the beef Pad Thai. Both were very good. The sushi combo I had was really fresh and everything was nicely plated. We went fairly early, but it looks like it could get crazy crowded. It has that "trendy" look to it .... not pretty, but cool. I look forward to my next visit to try more items. I'll go early though because I am allergic to crowds.
