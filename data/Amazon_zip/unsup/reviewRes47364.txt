Points for having a variety of vegetarian options at a burger-centric metal bar. Points for trying to have variety and cool choices on a burger menu. Points for being open late, for being reasonably priced, and being very close to my home. Scorn for using generic frozen veggie burgers and pretzel buns, which I hate. Seriously, maybe on the regular burgers pretzel buns are legit, but for the veggie options, it makes for a sandwich where everything is dry and the same texture. So, for five stars, maybe develop a cheap veggie burger recipe that's exclusive to Lockdown (mushroom burger? black bean burger? seitan?) and have a choice between traditional and pretzel buns. If a few people chose the regular bun, it'll save them money anyway. Overall, awesome, but in need of minor adjustments.
