Prices have increased slightly, but still a great value. Recently tried the Beijing Duck dinner. If you love duck, definitely come try it. The duck is cooked differently than the duck that they serve as part of their bbq-ed goods. They bring out the whole duck to you and carve off the exterior layers and legs and wings. You eat this w/ steamed buns, pickled daikon/radish (?), green onions and plum sauce (?). This was my favorite course! The meal comes w/ only 6 steamed buns but we were told we could order more at 50 cents each. Next comes the soup that they have used the bones to flavor, very similar to an egg drop type soup but with duck pieces and a few veggies. Really, I would have been satisfied w/ those two courses, but no, now you get duck fried rice. Honestly, it was nothing special; or it could have been that I was just overstuffed. The server told me that the dinner was made for 2 to share, but w/ 3 people, we still had trouble finishing, this would easily fill up 4 and you would probably still have a little bit to take home. Ooh and i forgot they do give you some sorbet, but I didn't care for it much.
