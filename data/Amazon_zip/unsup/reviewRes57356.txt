Great BYOB sushi place, quality sushi and the miso soup is great too. I always get a version of the Dragon roll at every Japanese place i go to, and i still haven't been able to match the one at Friends Sushi in the Gold Coast. I have moved out of the Gold Coast about a year ago and still trying to find my roll. The sushi is good quality here and the BYOB can't be beat, definitely worth a check out.
