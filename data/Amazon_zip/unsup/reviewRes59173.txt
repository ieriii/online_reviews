This place seems a little rotten. I was turned off as soon as I walked in. The decor is terrible and gloomy. Sushi joints are supposed to be a little flashy, no?Too expensive for the taste, when Butterfly down the street does everything better and less expensive.The staff was not the best by any means, after being asked a question our server responded with a short, snippy answer as she was WALKING AWAY!Not wasting my time/$$$ there again.
