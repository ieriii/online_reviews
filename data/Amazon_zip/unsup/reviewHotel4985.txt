Either I have had comparably great experiences at other hotels in Chicago or this one was exceedingly dismal. The staff are not refined but then again it is not like I threw out the cash for a refined experience. My biggest issue with the hotel was the shower. The bathroom was dark and the plumbing made awful noises when you flushed or turned on the shower. Not to mention the rusty, moldy, and dirty looking tub. Upgrades are very much needed. However, the view was not too shabby.
