There are so many great things about this place. The burgers are awesome, loaded nachos are amazing, and the atmosphere is exactly want one would look for when "grabbing a burger". The only reason I took off one star is the lack of french fries! What?! They are one of the most popular foods in America!! I still have hope that RJ will realize what's best for him, and put some french fries back on the menu. Their homemade chips just do not cut it.
