My friend would rave about this place forever and ever, so finally I decided to join a group of friends for a birthday celebration dinner here. Started with the cheese empanadas and it was good, not great. Ordered a specialty fresh fruit pineapple mojito and the bartender made it perfectly! Now we are talking!!! Let's get this party started! So I then order the char-grilled shrimp and chicken. I'm not a fan of yuca or sweet plantain so that was my only drawback. This place definitely knows all about flavor profile so it gets high marks in my foodie book!
