Stayed here twice, once on business and once while sight-seeing. As others have said, it's a big, older hotel. Big means staff occasionally gets overwhelmed when everyone's arriving at the same time. Older means the rooms have dated (though nice) furniture and decor. Rooms are sizeable by downtown standards. Didn't try the fancy restaurants, but as for the others: The Irish pub was pretty good. The lobby bar was sloooow for table service. The executive lounge was patient with our group of 4 when we stayed there for 2 hours while meeting friends. Breakfast buffet was good and had huge selection but at an eye-watering price of around $30. For the price there are more modern hotels nearby. For similar old school charm I prefer the Palmer House Hilton several blocks north-- it's more conveniently located in the loop 1-2 blocks from all El lines.
