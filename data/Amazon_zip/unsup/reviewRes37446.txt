I finally tried lunch at Fox & Obel last week and absolutely loved the place. First of all, I need to go back to check out their cheese selection because I glanced at a few very delicious-looking ones! I only had the Tomato Basil soup with crusty roll for an early lunch. The soup wasn't as creamy as I usually have it, but it had a nice fresh roasted flavor to it. The roll tasted like it just came out of the oven. Slathered on some butter and it was the perfect accompaniment to the soup. I'll have to go back to try more from their menu, and also to shop a bit in the store section. Overall a really cute, quaint place. Reminds me a lot of places in Europe!
