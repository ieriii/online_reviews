I saw Rose Polenzani perform at the new Uncommon Ground in Rogerswater (edgepark? but i digress...) tonight.  I looked at the menu online and had braced myself for overly pretentious food in small portions. Luckily, I was wrong on both counts. I ordered the chopped salad and a side of sweet potato fries, with coffee. The salad was huge and everything in it was absolutely delicious--the chicken was juicy and tender, the avocado was perfectly ripe, the bacon was a nice touch.  The amount of dressing was exactly right. I was so pleased that while it was $9 or so (that's a lot for me, i guess i'm cheap) I could only eat half of it and took home the other half for dinner #2.  The sweet potato fries were divine, though I wish they had a half-portion because there were just too damn many of them.  The sound was awesome and the setting was intimate yet still spacious enough that you don't have to dine on top of the people you are seated next to. I will be honest--though it was perfectly lovely, the prices are a bit much for me to be able to visit this place that regularly. Especially if I want to have a drink with my meal.  But when you think about it, I suppose it's better to get one really good drink for the price of two mediocre ones. All in all, welcome to the neighborhood Uncommon Ground. You are a great addition to Devon.
