So Hot Doug and his crew came in while we were eating so you know it's gotta be good. In spite of the chilly Aug weather, we sat on the back patio which I recommend as it was jammed pack inside when we were leaving. Started with a bottle of red and the house made goat sausage which was fantastic. Then we had half orders of the lobster & ricotta ravioli and the orcecchiete with spicy lamb sausage. Both were excellent but the orecchiette had so many great flavors. We split the wood grilled rabbit which was very good too and they split it up for us on two plates which was nice. We finished with a chocolate-hazelnut tart(get it) and blueberry tart(skip it). Service was excellent. I didn't feel it was too pricey considering the quality of food. Tab was $120(sans tip) but we didn't get the cheapest bottle of vino and had cappuccinos as well. Definately want to come back on the prix fixe night then. So then on a side note, my celebrity chef sighting continued when I look over at some range rover and see Art Smith driving with another dude. I tell my wife who looks over and says "wow that is him and he's picking his nose". I think it looked more like a scratch but very amusing.
