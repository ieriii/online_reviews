The price, food and atmosphere is all excellent. The menu has plenty of variety with lots of creative dishes.  The toughest part of a visit here is picking out what to eat. Every dish I've gotten there has been well balanced and full of flavor. One of these days I'll dare to try the pizza with a raw egg.
