In town from STL and loved it! Everything we had was top notch, the service was excellent and attentive. We enjoyed the crab rolls for an appetizer, the whole maine lobster and the shaw's seafood platter. We shared the sides of spinach and potatoes au gratin. The sides were big enough for 4 and since there were only 2 of us, it was quite a bit of food. Definitely a must visit again.
