If you like meat you'll for sure love this place. Skip all the filler at the salad bar (although good) its just a way to get you to eat less meats. Its hard to beat a meal where you don't have to decide what type of delicious meat you want, just how much. Highly recommend;, they also mix some delicious Brazilian drinks so be sure to wash down your bacon wrapped delicacies with a couple of those for good measure.
