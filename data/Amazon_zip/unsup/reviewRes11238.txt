Damn you Bongo Room, why must you be so far away from me. You guys have the best brunch menu, but yet you are six states away from me.  It's been over a year now since I got to dine there, and i'm dying for that banana caramel pancake. I miss you more than a girlfriend. Damn your pancakes for being so tasty - i've been gone through sleepless nights and tired mornings without you. If you're in Wicker Park, please come here. I understand, it does get busy in the mornings, and yes waiting can be long, but i promise you, its worth it! It's nice and cozy inside and the service there is so friendly. The waitresses are always really talkative, but still manage to provide flawless service in such a busy restaurant. i believe the menu changes seasonally, but almost everything on there is good. But I would like to warn you... Almost everything here is very very rich and sweet, so do be prepared to get filled up.  How I long for you, Bongo Room.
