Just figured I'd add to the insane amount of praise already on here for the bongo room... because this place rocks! I recently went on a saturday morning and the wait was only 30 minutes. The banana and bacon pancakes were fantastic and I just loved the sauce they put on top of them. You get 3 pancakes with your order and they're so large and filling that you're guaranteed to have leftovers to enjoy later. I'd say if you don't mind the wait and love to try new things, this place is a definite must.
