The amazing cocktails are works of beauty. Hush and Wonder is my signature drink now, so much so that a bottle of Creme De Violette is my go-to hostess gift, thus ensuring a Hush and Wonder knockoff from those who know me well. Dark and Stormy is another favorite and inspired me to use more ginger in my own creations. Juliet and Romeo is a fail proof summer fling drink; relaxing, unusual, a hint of flowers and the comforting kick of gin. The phone free ambiance and spare sensual decor are well worth the visit, but once you've sipped these cocktails, you'll thank yourself for forging through the hipsters out there to the sanctuary inside.
