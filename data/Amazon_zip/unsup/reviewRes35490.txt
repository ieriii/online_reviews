I ate at Shaw's for the first time last night and absolutely LOVED this place! The decor is awesome and the music only adds to the atmosphere. We had the cold app combination platter which gave us a good mix of all the great seafood apps, but definitely wasn't overwhelming in size. I had originally ordered crab fingers, but the waiter returned to the table and told me the chef didnt want to setve them bevausw they werent a good size. I really appreciated that. We both had fish entrees, which we loved. The portions were a good size for the price, and I liked that they had a good selection of regional fish. The waitstaff was super friendly and helpful as well -- making great recommendations and being honest about the food. Overall I had an amazing experience at Shaw's and will definitely plan to return on my next Chicago visit!
