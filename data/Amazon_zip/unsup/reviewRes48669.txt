This is my current, top Chicago fave...a plus that I live in the neighborhood as well so it is easy access! I have been to the Publican twice now and there has been no disappointment. The oysters are great to start off with...this coming from someone who never had oysters before!...this first experience with the shells was yummy! Also, I would say the mussels here are the best in the city...big portion that comes with bread so anyone can dip in the broth/sauce. The pork belly is the specialty and for pork lovers - it's tasty. I really like the kobe beef on the menu...and the kale as a side is top-notch. A great taste experience...great beer menu...super knowledgeable and attentive staff...perfect atmosphere for all you foodies with a guy's feel to it! Reservations, esp on the weekends, are a must....and ENJOY!
