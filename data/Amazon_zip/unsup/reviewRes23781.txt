Best restaurant in Chinatown hands down. I had a fried shrimp dish that was some of the tastiest shrimp I've ever had--and I don't even like shrimp. Don't go here if your version of Chinese food is orange chicken from Panda Express. Also don't go here if you can't handle family style eating. Lastly, don't go here if you're one of those people who expects your server to dote on you. It's not gonna happen. Do go here if you want to have the tastiest Chinese food in Chicago.
