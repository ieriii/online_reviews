This place is loud and busy for a weekday night. Not too many vegetarian options, but as always you can customize it. I had cucumber/avocado rolls and a drink. I really liked the ambiance minus the decibel level. I'd recommend that you should check out the place for sure depending on whom you are going with. If its friends and you want to have cocktails, then i surely recommend it. If its a date, then may be not as it gets loud in there.
