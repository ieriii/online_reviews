The inside is gorgeous - Expect dark wood, a mix of industrial design with modern light fixtures. I've been once for drinks and another time for food during prime hours and have been seated immediately both times. No waiting is a definite plus for me.  The space is large and they have great tables, a gorgeous bar, a raised lounge, even a comfy couch to pretty much suit any sized group or vibe. Oh, and food? I'd recommend the fries, bone marrow and meatballs. My only thing is that the food seemed a bit inconsistent - the fries they've touted famously was amazing the first time (and gratis for my group of friends to celebrate their opening weekend), but the second time was heavy on the salt! The drinks are strong, GREAT and can take a while but are worth it.
