This is the 3rd time I've been here, and it's always a few years in between each visit. The reason is this: when I go, I'm never blown away like everyone else. And then I decide not to go back until enough time passes that I've heard enough people say "oh Frontera grill? I love that place!" and then I go back. Today was more of the same. Went there for lunch with 2 old friends. We had no problem getting a table which was great. Even though we were clearly chatting and catching up and kept telling the waitress "we need a few minutes," she kept coming back and asking for our order. We asked for recommendations and she recommended the 3 specials which were all entree sized and nothing else. I thought that was a little weird, but whatever. After we were badgered to order, our food took a LONG time to arrive, during which time we were not checked on, even though the place was not very crowded. We ordered guac which was tasty, but received that before ordering our entress, so no other appetizers or anything to worry about during that long wait. I ordered one of the fish specials, which was good but not memorable. It was a moist and flavorful piece of fish in some sauce. The accompanying polenta cakes were very good. I also enjoyed my horchata. My main gripe would be the price - my friend pointed out that my fancy dish was about the same (or less) food than he had on his $10 appetizer dish. And it was also FREEZING in there. There must have been a door open. It's good but not mind blowing, and if I had to wait for this, I think I would go elsewhere. Try Nuevo Mexicano (and their straight up margarita) which is delicious and you can always get a reservation. I know it's not Rick Bayless, but they have some more interesting dishes, and I think the service is better.
