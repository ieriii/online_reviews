Nice place, and very classy. I love the unusual decor and ambiance. I would also say the bar staff fit the decor of the restaurant, adding to its mysterious bordering creepy vibe. Bartender was great and cracked open the bear bottle with another bottle, a trick I would love to learn sometime. He was also pretty knowledgeable. The hostess was a little rude when seating us, but not a big deal. I was hungry but their menu was less then appetizing, with only about 10 or so items (half of which i did not even know what they were). My friend ordered something i can't remember what and did not like it. He was sick all night and funny enough was our DD (aka he was not drinking more then a beer). The place seemed a little uppity to me, but maybe it was just not for me. Over all service was good, ambiance was creditable but not friendly, the food was bad, and the drinks where expensive.
