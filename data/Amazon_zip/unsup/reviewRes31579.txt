Just noticed it's been over a year since my last review of my favorite diner...this place is still super awesome!! The radical reuben is still delish but as I am now gluten free (or so I try), I had their gluten free chilaquiles for brunch today, delish!!! They have a whole gluten free menu along with a list of corn free, soy free options :)
