It is the best fondue restaurant in Chicago - bar none. The ambience is unbeatable as far as seductively lit places go. And I'm not just saying all this because a good friend runs the joint. The menu offerings are more than plentiful, and this isn't a place where a singular built-in burner limits one's options to one choice. Start with a cheese appetiser, move into either a meat, poultry, seafood, vegetarian or combo entree, then to the sumptuous chocolate fondue. The wine list is five star, and the flamenco guitarist is an exotic touch. If you're anywhere near the edge of cool and need a boost into rocking status, take your date here. Even a place buddies can hang out and have fun cooking your own tidbits and dipping into a variety of tantalising sauces. Don't forget to say hello to Jeff....
