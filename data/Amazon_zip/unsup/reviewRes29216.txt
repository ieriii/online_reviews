I had thai food from another restaurant and I absolutely hated it.. when my friend said 'let's eat thai'--I think I complained for a good five minutes before I said 'Fine! But let Yelp guide us!' This place was awesome, 4 of us shared about 7 plates and the tab was slightly less than $50. I was not a fan of thai.. but this place definitely changed my mind about it. My favorite items were the Tiger Cry (I think that's what it was called) and the combination fried rice. There is parking across the street, metered but it's only a quarter per hour.
