Only four stars out of five because of the wait (although it's a given from what I've been reading about this place). The parking is in the alley on the left (as you face the front door) and you have to park diagonally so folks can still drive on through. After two years of waiting I finally made it here! And boy was it a treat! I can't get over how delicious everything looked on the menu, I had such a hard time choosing! The given was that I had to have something with the ice cream because it's a local brand and it is rated as a top yummy by veggie-heads like myself. Significant other unit and I started with a blue moon beer (he) and a chocolate milkshake (me) and an order of the bufalo wings to start us off. The buffalo wings were more like ribs and bbq sauce, but I really, really liked them -- it was my first faux meat dish (besides the tofurky hot dogs and cold cuts I've been getting at Trader Joe's). The ranch dressing was a little liquidy but tasted great and was a fab accompaniment to the veggies (grated cabbage, good sized sliced carrots and teeny celery stalks). I then had the black beans and rice platter that came out huuuge and delectable. I couldn't get over how delicious the rice was, how nicely spiced the beans were, and how fresh the sauerkraut. He had the cowboy chili and loved it! I was really sorry that I had to leave the two pickle spears and kale leaves, but I could eat no more! I was too stuffed for dessert, which is a shame, but I know I can always go to Whole Foods and get a CD cake slice or other baked good. So it wasn't that major of a loss. All around a totally cool place, with fun, diverse, and friendly staff. I just wish they'd expand to the W. burbs so I can get some veggie lovin on a daily basis!
