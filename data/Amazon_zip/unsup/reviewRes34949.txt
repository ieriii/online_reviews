This place is a cool little spot to dine on some tasty sushi. The rolls are definately not of the traditional sorts as one of the managers there pointed out but they are quite delicious. The Red Dragon, Honey Roll, 5-0 (they call it that because there is bacon in the roll) were all fantastic but the double stack was my favorite roll. It's on the afforable side and it's BYOB, without a cork fee and they brought out an ice filled pale to keep my beers frosty. Solid food, up beat music, attentive staff and decent ambiance. (they need more than just blue walls, although they have a projector going on one side of the place). I definately recommend this place especially if Butterfly on Grand is impossible.
