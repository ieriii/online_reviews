Booked the Dana at a super low rate with airfare on a third party site. My husband and I stayed for a few days and couldn't have asked for a better hotel. Perfect location to walk to Michigan Ave, State Street, catch the L, etc. The very modern room had a rain shower, plush toiletries, extra comfy bed, and 2 walls of nothing but windows (corner king room). We were accidentally put in a handicapped room at first and asked to be switched to another. Once we were switched, the new suite they put us in was supposedly being "fixed" the next morning....so once again, we were moved to another room. The staff was so nice and helpful however that the room switches didn't even bother us. We didn't spend more than a couple minutes in each, had yet to unpack, and they gave us 2 complementary bottles of wine which we picked out of the decent selection from the fridge in our room. Ask for a high floor and a room that overlooks State Street. We were on the 20th floor and never heard any noise from the bar a few floors above on the roof. Would definitely stay again!
