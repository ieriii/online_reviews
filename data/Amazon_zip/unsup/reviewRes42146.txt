This was a pretty good place. It was a little hard for me to order, because it was the first time eating this type of cuisine. I ordered the "Salmon in Clay Pot" and loved it. It came with a side of rice. The sauce used on the Salmon was a tangy soy sauce like marinade. It was really good. Not too much ambiance -just a very simple place. But it crowded so it must be popular. Overall, good food, good experience!
