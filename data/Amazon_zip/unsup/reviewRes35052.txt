Like most things I come to yelp for advice on where to go. I want to be adventorous but I need to be pointed in the right direction. My friend and I went on a Saturday night at about 8pm. The place is tiny so I was worried we'd wait forever, it was empty which was great for us! I think it's a very cute venue, perfect for a small neighborhood sushi bar. My friend and I are both fan of rolls and thats about it so this was a perfect menu for us. His only complaint was there was no bar and we didn't bring any liquor. Like always we got about 5 rolls to try all new and different things. Way way more food then 2 people can handle! The mega rolls were huge and very yummy. My favorite was the shrimp tempura roll. My only complaint was the salmon and cream cheese roll (forget the name) but it was such an overwhelming cream cheese taste that I could only eat one. I'll definitely use them for takeout or delivery sometime because they are so close, but I'm still searching for a great sushi place to frequent!
