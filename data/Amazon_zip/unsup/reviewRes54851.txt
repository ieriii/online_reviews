What a rude restaurant! We had heard great things about it, but the reality was otherwise. The food was not good enough to justify the rude service. I even got sick from eating it. I've never felt so relieved to get something out of me! This place is noisy and not worth the wait. You don't need more choices of beer to make a great bar, you just need a few good ones.
