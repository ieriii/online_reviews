This hotel is a lot of fun. The design is great, as is the vibe. As you walk in, it feels opulent, some of the neo-classical and art-deco architectural elements are smoothed out with a soothing neutral palette. Service is excellent, both at reception, in the coffee bar and throughout the hotel. The lobby after 5:00p.m. can feel like party central, as it seems to be a hip after-work hang out spot - which didn't bother me, but it is a bit loud in the lobby in the evening. None of this noise affected me once I was off of that floor, however. The coffee bar is wonderful, too! The coffee is well-priced, and while it is a bit watery, this is standard across the United States. In a city that is known for its coffee roasters and coffee shops, however, definitely check out other places! Nonetheless, the decor is great at the coffee bar and the pastries they offer are not bad. The room was very comfortable - very visually soothing and a great place to unravel from my jam-packed days!
