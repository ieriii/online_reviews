I came here for dinner last Friday, and I'm still thinking about it! The food was superb. One of the best meals I've eaten in as long as I can remember. The service was great, our waitress was sweet, genuine, and attentive. The prices are totally reasonable. COME HERE. You won't be sorry. We had a roasted eggplant appetizer, a traditional Persian soup (can't remember the name but it's the only one on the menu) and their vegetarian platter. All 3 items were individually amazing in their own right. The flavors were all unique and perfectly balanced. The smoky flavor of the eggplant was present but not overpowering. The Persian soup had, to my palate, a bizarre combination of ingredients that my mouth had not experienced before. I think there were noodles, beans, pomegranate, etc...? So good though. And so unique for someone that doesn't eat a lot of Perisian food. Which brings me to the main course, the veggie platter. This had a big mound of rice with some roasted vegetables and mushrooms that had been marinated and grilled (or roasted) in a tangy sauce. Don't get me started on this rice! I don't usually get excited about rice. But this was special rice. I would have been happy eating that rice, and that rice alone, for the entire meal. Or week! It was sweet, had raisins in it, and maybe some orange... Basically, I don't know what was in it. But I didn't care, or take the time to stop shoveling it in my mouth to look on the menu. The veggies were good, but nothing unusual compared to the rice which was really outstanding. All in all, a flavor party in your mouth. Couldn't have been happier. Can't wait to try it out again and get their saffron gelato!
