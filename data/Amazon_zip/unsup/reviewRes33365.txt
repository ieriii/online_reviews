Stumbled upon this gem by accident and boy were we happy! Unique, Itallian brunch menu and 5 dollar mimosas/bloody mary's! I got the chicken hash which was outstanding. I tried my friends Baked Uovo Florintines. Again excellent. Both were a bit heavy and could be shared. Inexpensive, fun, brunch place especially if you are looking to drink!
