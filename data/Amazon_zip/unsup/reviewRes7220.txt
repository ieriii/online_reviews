Really enjoyed my trip to the q. We were in a booth on the main floor on Dec. 22 so it was very busy and very loud, but fortunately service did not suffer from the high volume. The BBQ Flight and the Hush Puppies (in addition to the pickles and BBQ potato chips) made for great starters. The Flight gives you a great way to sample the sauces offered. The Competition Baby Back Ribs lived up to their reputation as well. The full rack (the only portion size the Competition ribs come in) is more than enough for 2 hungry people to attack. The coleslaw on the side adds a nice respite in the middle of this carnivorous meal. The Straight Bourbon Flight went very nicely with the meal as well. Overall, a great meal at a very reasonable price.
