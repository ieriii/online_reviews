though the critic's reviews have rated this place in the upper echelon of fine-dining Chicago, i only can give this a 3/5. after dining here twice - 1. Prix Fixe Menu 2. Sommelier's Menu both times, i left the restaurant hungry, and ended up @ the R&R mcdonalds on ohio.  the foods are definitely - pieces of art and the combinations are exquisite, however, my favorite parts of both times have been the amuse bouche and dessert cart.  the service is excellent and it does hold up to it's "5-star" rating you would expect. however, if you are an "eater" and have an appetite, be prepared to take a trip to the golden arches or maxwells after this 3+ hour meal. Valet is available and suggested.  the location of tru is very hidden and there is "large" signage for all to see. it is elite and fancy, with the best wine list i have ever seen - with german rieslings that can be found no where else. it is very pricy (~$150-$500) however, it is an experience if you are looking for a change and adventure.
