Pretty good. Both times I've been to Lock Down, I've been out on the back patio, which was clean, comfortable and well maintained. For apps, we tried: -Barb'd Wire- spicy four cheese chorizo sauce over hand cut fries (and as a dip with chips) Good, but heavy on a hot day -Prison Yard- mussels braised in coconut curry sauce- delicious -Chain Gang-onion rings- a-ok -Buttermilk fried pickles-a-ok I've tried two of their burgers so far: The first I forget the name of, but it had Gorgonzola cheese, onion rings, BBQ sauce and bacon, all served on a pretzel roll. It was huge. It was definitely medium when I ordered it med. rare, but it was still good. I saved half to bring home. I also tried the mac n cheese, which was thick and a little pasty, served with bacon and green onions. It was really rich but I couldn't stop eating it. My second time there I ordered the Hawaii 5-0 with pineapple, BBQ sauce, and braised pulled pork. The Pork was a little dry and a little much, so I just took that off and ate the burger with the pineapple which was good. This time, my burger was much closer to med well, so it wasn't as enjoyable. I got a side salad with this order, and the salad was fresh with huge slices of cucumber, tomato and fresh lettuce with a simple vinaigrette on the side. My fellow diners tried all different kinds of burgers, including the Jailhouse Rock (the Fat Elvis) with peanut butter, banana and bacon which got rave reviews all around. The Federales will make any heat lover happy, and the fry servings were massive. The flight of burgers were turkey burgers which were all too dry and didn't get good reviews. My husband had the border patrol, which he liked but his Med Rare order came out rare. We wish they had split the difference between my burger and his. Service was ok. That being said, I would come back here. Good burgers without anti-customer snark or the long wait times. The guy at the door was super nice and we were able to get seated without a wait.
