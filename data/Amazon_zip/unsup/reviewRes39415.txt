Another great FIND!!!! Thanks AP!!  With regards to the food, delicious. I thoroughly enjoyed the option to prepare your own food over an open fire.  Picture it, a restaurant, lots of booths, in the middle of the booth is a table with a whole (square) in the middle of it. After your order your meat of choice (we ordered baby squid, chicken, and beef) they bring out a cauldron with charcoals and a tiny grill on top of it. This is placed in the center of the table and you are able to grill your food however you desire. After ordering the meat options, very small sides are brought out. I believe there were about 15 options. Amazing. On top of that, a version of miso soup and white rice is served.  OMG!!! So, for about 24 bucks a person (we divided everything three ways), this wasn't bad at all. Well worth the money. I highly recommend going to this place!!!
