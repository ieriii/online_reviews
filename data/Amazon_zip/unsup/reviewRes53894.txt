Awesome, awesome, awesome..and crowded. Food is meant for sharing and small portions keep the calories under control. All of it excellent, tasty and wine to die for. Service was attentive but not overbearing. When we moved inside to keep the party going at the bar, service was down a notch, but they were packed. Get there, worth it!
