As with the other Brazilian steakhouses in the city, this one has tons of fire roased meat, seared to perfection. What does this have that the others don't? Amazing service. We went there for the first time on VDay and were absolutely blown away by the level of service. The server called us by name, made suggestions (like, Try the sushi bar!) and took great care to make sure we were satisfied. Not only the server, but all the gauchos as well. The decor is dark and homey, a very large space broken up into many smaller dining areas, so you're not overwhelmed by noise even when it's crowded. This was the best experience we've had, after visiting the other places many times, we will now only return to Texas de Brazil.
