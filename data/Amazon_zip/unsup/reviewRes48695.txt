I went with a friend and we had a great time! I'm reading some of the reviews and it seems like maybe they've worked out some of the kinks.  Our waiter was knowledgeable and friendly. We had a couple of different kinds of beers and a whole lot of raw meat. Yum!!! The steak tartare was good, but the oysters were excellent -- the freshest and tastiest I've ever had in Chicago. They could be a little more generous with things like bread and crackers (they were homemade and fantastic), but the service, the quality, the vairety and the fun decor make it a worthwhile trip. Check out the bathrooms! It's probably a great place to go on a first -- or maybe a third ;~) -- date, beer + oysters = brief bouts of happiness.
