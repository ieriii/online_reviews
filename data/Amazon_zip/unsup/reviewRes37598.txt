I will never feel the same about Gelson's ever again. Fox & Obel sole my heart. Now I just need to pray they will expand. If you are into food, I suggest going to this market like it is a tourist attraction! It is pricey but wonderful. The grilled cheese and tomato basil soup combo was amazing. Nordstrom's version doesn't hold a candle to this one!
