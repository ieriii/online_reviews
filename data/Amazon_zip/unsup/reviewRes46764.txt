Yes the burger was reasonably priced. And yes there was a salad bar. But by no means was the burger one of the best that I have had; and by no means was the salad bar worthy of all of its acclaim. A ten foot long salad bar where it is difficult to get a plate, let alone a second one to take advantage of its AYCE feature, made me regret actually paying for the salad bar. Next time I will just get a burger since that was more than enough on its own. Nevertheless, our waiter was very friendly and everyone that I was with appeared to enjoy their food.
