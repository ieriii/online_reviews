Awesome place. The food and service were excellent. As I was with a big group, they handled our orders very well without any confusion. I had ordered the seafood spaghetti dish which was very delicious if you don't mind the calamari ink used.  This is the best place I have been where the service is very attentive. However, we sat near the front entrance which there was cold draft near us along with a big party that was quite loud near the bar.  Definitely would want to go back again!
