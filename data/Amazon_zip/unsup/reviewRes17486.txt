Felt like a party on the outside but no party in my mouth. Place is fabulous with fun atmosphere. Chips and Guac are so-so. Ordered their empanadas and churrasco nicaraguan style wood-grilled beef tenderloin, malanga goat cheese puree, arugula chimichurri, spicy beet salsa. Food is creative and unique but only slighty above average in taste. Beef lacked flavor. If you like Fogo de Chao meats (which many people do) you'll like this joint's meat. I like a little more flavor. I would go back just for the atmosphere. Not sure what I would order though.
