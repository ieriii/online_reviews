Hells muf'fu'un YEAH! For whatever insane reason, I lived in Lakeview for many years and never set foot in this place. Just became a creature of habit I guess. We tried this for brunch for the first time, and were totally floored.  The mojito was literally the best mojito I have ever had. Ever. And I have had some fine mojitos. The coffee was good, the service extra prompt. The breakfast burrito I had was excellent and filling as hell, wife had some french toast that she was a big fan or as well. Man was our server on top of things! I will definitely go back. Gotta learn to keep an open mind, or I might miss some other great stuff in familiar locales.
