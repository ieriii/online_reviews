As I entered, I was greeted promptly by the chef! We were sat went for the larger menu, and everything was perfect! It is great to bring your own wine, and the chef was even so kind to pour us something to match a course! For me, that is really going above and beyond. It truly is an experience not to be missed. The food was seasoned perfectly. I didn't mind the phone tag as the restaurant seats only about 20. It is important to realize that there are about 4-6 people running the show. It is important to be flexible with the chef, and they will take care of you hands down.My new favorite restaurant in Chicago!
