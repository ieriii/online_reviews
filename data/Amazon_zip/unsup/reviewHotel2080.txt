Spent 5 days in this hotel and loved it. They did an excellent job catering my son's wedding reception, in their lovely reception room overlooking the downtown and river. The staff were always polite and helpful. The location was excellent and convenient to downtown. Room prices, for the wedding guests, were very reasonable. Many rooms have been re-done nicely. Some still need fixing up. Ask for one of the new ones. If you're doing a downtown wedding in Chicago, look into this place!
