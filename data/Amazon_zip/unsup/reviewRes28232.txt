I have eaten in Graham Elliot twice and on both occassions I thought the food was only average. For me, the truffle popcorn is a poor alternative to the amazing bread that Graham does bake when he wants (the bread in Avenues was amazing). I started with the sweet corn bisque which was pretty average. Different with the garlic marshmallow in it, but not better than regular sweet corn bisque that I have had. My gf had the beef tartare which was the highlight of the dinner. Very small portion but really delicious. The pan roasted scallops are oversized and tastleless. Really poor quality and they tasted as if they had been frozen. I was really surprised that GE would use such poor quality ingredients. The bison skirt steak was tasty but the accompanying baked beans and onion rings were poor (The Kerryman bar just 3 blocks away has much better) so again an average meal that with wine and gratuity will cost about $100 per person. The ice milk is tasty but the chocolate cake dessert is basic and totally overpriced for what you receive for $10. I have eaten Dale Levitskis food and in my opinion he is a better chef than Graham Elliot.
