What can I say about the best? Sabatino's treats you right way in everyway. Extensive menu, and even great specials.  Old school Italian food...high quality, homemade and great. Best meat sauce in town. My favorite? A Lobster Diavilo.--spicy, red pasta with lobster chunks. YUM.  Besides that , they have all the italian dishes you could think of...variations of veal, chicken and fish. Outstanding. Here's one indication of how Sab's treats you: * Order a glass a wine, and check the pour! They fill it right up to the top. Eddie seats you with a smile, and owners always come by and say hello. We need more places like this!
