Heard this place is sometimes on and sometimes off - still trying to figure out how to run itself since it's new, but the night I went with my fiancee, it was totally on. The food was fantastic. Really hit the spot. We got the two veggie / two meat injera combo.  Our waitress was very attentive and came by to apologize for the food taking so long. We didn't think it was long at all, but she threw in our drinks for free. Will definitely go back.
