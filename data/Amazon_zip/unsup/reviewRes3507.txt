Un-cluckin'-believable. The hubby and I had been meaning to try this place for the longest time and tried it for the first time today. We ordered the half portion of Crisp BBQ chicken, the Baby Buddha Bowl with beef and a large Superfly Frites. All were absolutely delicious. The Buddha Bowl, according to my husband, was just as bi bim bap should be - a scrumptious mishmash of fresh veggies, rice, and beef. The fries were crispy and salty on the outside, potatoey on the inside. And the chicken...oh my god...don't even get me started on the chicken. Served piping hot and smothered in the most unique mouthwatering sweet and spicy sauce, it was barbeque perfection. The chicken was also some of the crispiest and juiciest I've ever had. I'm not usually a fan of chicken "on-the-bone" but this dish had me sucking every last morsel of meat off the bone. Fabulous. And huge portions too. I'm in Chicago only for the summer and have sampled many restaurants during my stay here. This ranks in my top three so far. A great super low-key place to go with friends. As other Yelpers have hinted at, not a great place for a romantic date or a special occasion (unless that special occasion was that someone had an enormous craving for amazing Korean BBQ). Admittedly, I actually just signed up for a Yelp account today because I wanted to share just how good this place was. Please go and support them :)
