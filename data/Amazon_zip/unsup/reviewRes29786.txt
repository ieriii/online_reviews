This was easily the worst meal I've ever paid for. Simply put, it's a restaurant you'd see on the "before" section of a Gordon Ramsay show. Seriously, just save yourself the cash and hassle, and go anywhere else. This is not a wine bar. To suggest otherwise is insulting. Of the 5 white wines on the menu by the glass, they didn't have one and couldn't suggest a replacement. Because there are wines on a menu does not make it wine bar. The decor is as sloppy as the food and hints at the detail they put into the whole operation. I went there for a Restaurant Week 3-course meal. The waitress didn't know or understand the menu. The artichoke bruschetta topping came from a can and the halved baguette it was on wasn't even toasted. And it was on a baguette. And it was bland and awful. But before we could have the second bite, the salad came out. And then we waited 40 mins for the entrees, which we didn't bother finishing. I got the wrong side, my wife didn't get a side, and they both were just flopped on the plate. It was ridiculously, hilariously awful from beginning to end. Easily the worst $80 ever spent on a nice evening out.
