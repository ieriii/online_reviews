Came here for Superbowl Sunday. All in all, a fun experience. Drinks were about average price, food was good- split a salad and a turkey burger with a friend, the sweet potato fries were AMAZING. The wait staff was very attentive, we never had to wait long for drinks or food.  The average rating for this bar is a 3.5. I wish I could give half a star because I don't know if it's quite a 4. It might be a little different on a normal Friday or Saturday night, and my group kept to ourselves so I didn't really take note of the other clientele. I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt though and giving it 4 stars simply because they have a burger named after Brian Anderson, which is pretty damn stellar in my book. And also I'm hoping to one day run into Curtis Granderson there.
