I had dinner at this restaurant last Sunday. This is what I found:-The food is NOT authentic latinamerican cuisine.-The drinks are good. We tried the sangria and mojitos and they were really nice. I do recommend drinks here.-The place is pricey: we were a party of five and the check was $370+-Pineapple cake was a major disappoinment. It came undercooked so I ended up with an upset stomach.-Service was good -coat check lady and hostess were very nice, our waitress did a good job explaining items and bringing our food/drinks on time.Will I come back? I don't think so. I mean, I do know (and love) latinamerican cuisine and I didn't find true latinamerican cuisine in Carnivale.
