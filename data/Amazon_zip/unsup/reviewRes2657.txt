My family came into town and we decided to hit up this hot spot hot dog joint. Loved it! Very different and unique hot dogs. I especially loved the fois gras. Their bratwurst was really good too. The line started even before they opened their doors, but definitely worth the wait. The guy at the front desk was also really nice and friendly. Service was quick, considering how many people there was. Highly recommended to try at least once!
