What a pleasant surprise! The beers here are good but the food was awesome!! My vegetarian friend got the. Butternut squash pizza and it was awesome! Part of me wanted to steal it from her and snarf it down myself! But I had the burger and lemmetellya. Super!!! I forget the name but it had egg on it- runny yummy goodness. One of our other friends had the Reuben that was great too. Buuuuut, you HAVE to get the popcorn. Wowzers. I mean bacon always makes everything better and this is no exception. Just get it. Just do it. You won't be sorry.
