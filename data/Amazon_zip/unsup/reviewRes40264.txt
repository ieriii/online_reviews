Don't get confused by the multiple locations. The one at 1132 is the one and only. All you need to know is try the black salsa. Charred, spicy, and it does magical things to whatever you put it on (chips, your tongue, your friends). Whether it's for a late night or a regular dinner, go here. It's not fancy and there are only a handful of tables. You will eat some damn fine food made the right way. Go to this location. Go now. Or later tonight.
