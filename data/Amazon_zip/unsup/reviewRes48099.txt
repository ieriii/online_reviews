Okay, this is probably my favorite spot in Chicago. As a beer aficionado and someone who appreciates new and different foods, Publican is a dream for me.  They have an amazing beer list, and the ever-changing array of small plates is fantastic. The ambiance is also great; it's like a modern take on a German Bier Hall. Among my favorites are the charcuterie plate, the ham selection, oysters, skate, sweetbreads, and virtually anything with pork (apropos considering the pig artwork adorning the walls).  It doesn't get better than this in my world.
