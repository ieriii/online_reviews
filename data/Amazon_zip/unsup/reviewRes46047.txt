As someone who hates chain restaurants....Grand Lux Cafe just gets it RIGHT.... Organization when waiting for a table. Inventive menu. Extremely attentive wait staff. Amazing food. And the best part? Those desserts that take 30 minutes to prepare.....like tasting heaven on a plate! Order them, even if you don't think you want/need/will eat them. We're talking hot sugary beignets, gooey chocolate souffles, etc. Grand Lux desserts are as good as any out there! Come to Grand Lux Cafe after a long day of shopping on The Mile...it won't disappoint!
