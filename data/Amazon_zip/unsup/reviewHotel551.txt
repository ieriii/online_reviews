Recently traveled to Chicago and decided to stay at this hotel opposed to the Fairmont which is my usual choice. The hotel is recently remodeled and looks wonderful. The rooms are average size and tastefully decorated. The hotel staff was prompt and responsive to all my needs. This hotel is located in a great little neighborhood and there were many places within walking distance. I love the restaurant and the food was excellent. This hotel will definitely be at the top of my list of choices for my next visit to Chicago.
