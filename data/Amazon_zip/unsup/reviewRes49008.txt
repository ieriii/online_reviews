This is one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. A little expensive, so I have to save it for special occasions. They specialize in fresh seafood (flown in daily) and delicious pork dishes. I always order their fresh warm pork rinds and one of their jamon serrano selections. Their basque stew is wonderful on a cold day, and their sweet bread is the best I've ever tasted. The wait staff is knowledgeable, and can always recommend a great beer pairing. It's always busy, so a reservation is essential. You might find space at the bar, if you're lucky.
