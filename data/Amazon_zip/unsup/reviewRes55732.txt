Italian food is my favorite so when looking for a place to go for our anniversary an Italian restaurant we haven't been to was first on our list. When we saw the reviews for Sabatino's we thought it sounded great. We had high expectations as we arrived. Unfortunately we were disappointed. We were greeted and seated in a timely fashion. After sitting down and ordering the restaurant became uncomfortably cold. The bread was great but very messy. We saw a gentleman scraping crumbs of another table and thought that we would be next. But we never were and we spent the rest of the meal with crumbs on the table. The roaming singers were going around to the tables and playing some songs. They went to the table next to us and played three songs then came to our table and played one song and walked away. The service was average besides knowing all the specials very well we only saw the waitress a few times. And last but not least the food. It was low average. I could have made the dish at home at it might have tasted better. My husband had the chicken Parmesan and it was good. I was not wowed in any way and probably not return to Sabatino's in the future.
