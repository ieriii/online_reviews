We went to the Bad Apple about 6-8 months ago and thought it was great, so we decided to go again. Beer selection is excellent. However this past time, we waited over 45 minutes to an hour for them to produce two burgers and nothing. I asked the waiter about it, and not 30 seconds later the burgers appear. The fries didn't seem as hot as they could have been, and our theory was they were left under a heat lamp and forgotten. Had we asked about the order, and it took another 10-15 minutes, that'd mean someone had to cook it since we were forgotten. That while crappy, would have been ok. But in this case they tried to pass off old food as fresh. I asked the water what happened, and he claimed that it took longer to make it since one of our burgers was medium-well. That made no sense, and in fact both were medium well. Stuff happens, people forget things. It's not so bad. But when you try to pass off your mistake as not having happened, that is a problem. I emailed the Bad Apple about this, and after a week passes nobody replied. Seriously? I am not one to complain at a restaurant. I think I've maybe done it three times in my life. I recommended this place to a number of people after the first time we ate there, but now I'm going to go out of my way to make sure I tell this story to as many people as I can. Why would you ruin something like this by giving someone cold food and insulting them insisting it isn't? A shame really, they have such a good beer selection...
