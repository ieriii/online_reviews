Brought my wife to Glenn's last night for her birthday, it was her 1st time, and my 2nd. Started with coconut shrimp and a Three Floyd's Gumballhead. I had the (amazing, very filling) pan fried Mississippi Catfish w/ corn bread shrimp stuffing and hollandaise sauce along with my 2nd Gumballhead, my wife had the char grilled Scottish salmon which was light and delicious. Everything was AMAZING, came out hot and was cooked perfectly. Our server Amy did a great job; she was super helpful and checked on us often. Our food came out very promptly even though the house was packed. It seemed they had plenty of staff working and everyone was really nice. We had a perfect experience and I can be a bit over-critical sometimes being in the industry. Thanks Glenn, you and your staff made a rare night out without the kids reallly special, thank you so much for not dissapointing us like so many other places do these days. Much respect! (Yo Glenn, next time I will have to let you know if there is any validity to your claim of having a better lobster roll than Maine, I spent every summer of my life a quick bike ride away from Ken's Cove in Bridgton, he's got a wicked good one so my bar is set pretty durn high but we'll see!)
