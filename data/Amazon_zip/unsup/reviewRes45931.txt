What do we have here? A starving out-of-towner friend, with hotel accommodations right off the Mag Mile. NO reservations at 9 pm on a Sunday. Hmm. Who to turn to on such short notice, within walking distance? Well, there is that Grand Lux restaurant... Even at 9 pm, we were told there would be a 20-25 minute wait. Andy and I were more than happy to catch up over a beer at the bar. Only 3 beers on draft, but Grand Lux definitely touts their specialty drinks. Just don't order top shelf-- in the Michigan Ave. backlight, you could clearly see the thick layer of dust that had settled on the top shelf bottles. Ick. We were sat and greeted, and then pored over the menu for a good 10 minutes. Lots of options, not quite as many as sister eatery The Cheesecake Factory, but more than enough. Sandwiches, seafood, pasta, salads and meat... all prepared a dozen different ways. We started with the perfectly seared tuna, which was served with a mild wasabi sauce. What happened to your kick, Mr. Wasabi? He was a no-show. Dinner: Andy ordered a pasta dish and I had the spicy chicken flatbread sandwich. OMGhugeportions. I somehow managed to put away almost half of my sandwich. Can we say, glutton? Flatbread, chicken, pepperjack, avocado, corn salsa. And mmm, tasty seasoned fries. Tomorrow's lunch has been served. On a tangent-- I thought it was funny our server interrupted us to announce that he forgot to enter my sandwich minus the tomatoes per my request, but that he had saved the day by making an interception in the kitchen. Okay, um, great?! Overall, good service and gobs of food for your money. GOBS. Splendid choice for families traversing the Mag Mile.
