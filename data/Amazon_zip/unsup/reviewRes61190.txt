Bad visit, sarcastic waiter. Waited close to an hour for what we thought was a deep dish special. He brought us a thin pizza. Manager apologized and said he would rush us what we ordered. Sarcastic waiter brought us a cheese and sausage, loaded w/tomatoe sauce. Ginos was a favorite years ago, but don't waste your time! Lou Malnatti's is the very best pizza, and we are thankful they have a pickup store in Geneva.
