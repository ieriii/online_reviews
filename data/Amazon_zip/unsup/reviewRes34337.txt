Um, this was really good. Went here for brunch a couple months ago, then somehow forgot where it was until I was walking around the South Loop yesterday, and ever since I can't get it out of my mind. This place is awesome for breakfast. I got the cinnamon bun pancakes and ohmygosh they were so scrumptious. I had to decide against the berry blast pancakes when I got them, and I can't wait to go back and try them. The others in my group got omelets and skillets, which they also said were delicious. We did have to wait a bit, but it was Saturday morning so that should be expected, and really it wasn't that long of a wait. Plus one of our group didn't show up until we had already ordered, and they were very understanding about that. The decor is really nice and airy and inviting, but it was very bustling! Really, now that I'm thinking about it, I need to go back immediately. Go go go!
