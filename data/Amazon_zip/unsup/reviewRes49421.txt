Bin 36 ended up with better wine than food, whch was a disappointment. I had read the reviews and while some liked the food, no one raved about it. I can be a demanding wine person (http://winofile.blogspot) and Bin 36 had a lot of red wines I'd had before (Hahn Estates, 10 Mile Red). I had the red flight and 2 of the four were very good but the other two were so so. That said, they do sell bottles to go and their prices are fairly good, only about a 10-30% markup from the best Calif prices. The menu was fairly generic with only a few exciting items. The dandelion salad which both my wife and I wanted... was sadly out. My wife was so uninspired by the menu, that she went with the cheeses.. and the "standard" 6 cheese sampler at that. And it was really quite nice. A goat cheese from a Dallas mozzerella company and an English cheddar were the stars. The side of mashers were fine but nothing special. I had garden salad and it had a very rich creamy goat cheese and some pumpkin seeds that went quite well. I had devoured half of it before I realized how good it was.  I splurged and got the flank steak which turned out to be pretty good. A good spice rub and they gave it to me med rare, as I had asked. So: Wine: 2 stars but a disappointment given it was a wine bar Cheese: 4 stars, very good but pricy Food: 3.5 stars, solid, tasty but lacking in choices Value: 2.5 stars
