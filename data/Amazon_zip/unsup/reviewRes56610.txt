Best steak house in Chicago. The service was outstanding! Recently celebrated my birthday there and when we sat down, the hostess and waiter wished me a happy birthday. Food was absolutely delicious! Would go again anytime. The following day received a phone call from the restaurant asking how our experience was. Now that's class. Do not pass this up!!
