Good spot, good food, good brunch. But just good. I enjoy the booths, it's a good spot to grab with longtime friends. The room otherwise might be a little loud. Food was decent, strawberry-oj was great, and the bottomless coffee is good. What I really appreciate is the fact that they will let you sit there for nearly three hours munching and drinking coffee with barely a blink of the eye. Friends and I hadn't seen each other in years, and we had to love that we weren't forgotten. We tipped well for it, no worries (seriously tipped). I think there are better brunch places in the city, but this is so close to downtown and really I can't complain about the food. Again, all was good.
