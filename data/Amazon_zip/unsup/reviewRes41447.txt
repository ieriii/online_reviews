so glad we got to go back to Bonsoiree we recently went on no menu sunday and ordered the 7 course dinner everything was fantastic, we had thai lobster bisque, duck breast salad, scallop + shrimp bake, fish (my memory is failing me here, i can't recall what kind it was), foie gras, venison and beignets for dessert service was friendly and they let you know all the ingredients in each dish the portion was perfect (i was full by the 5th course) and who doesn't like BYOB? can't wait to go back again
