This place is awesome but is very easy to miss. Look for the Ann Taylor shop and look up. We spent a good amount of time circling around and parking can be a mess, but that's expected with any foray into downtown Chicago. This place is awesome. They stop seating guests at 12:30am and they welcome large groups. The menu items are fabulous and the interior is SO elegant. You must come here. They are related to the Cheesecake Factory but the menu options are a bit more varied. The menu will please anyone as it samples from a wide variety of world cuisines. Highly recommended for the food and the views.
