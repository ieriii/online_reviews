I'll make this short and sweet. This is the best Cuban food I've had outside of Miami beach. Eff it, it's just as good as what I've had in South beach. The food was fantastic. I had an hour to kill up near Roscoe village, so I figured I'd try out 90 Miles since it was so highly reviewed on Yelp. I definitely over-ordered, getting the fried plantaines and--at the advice of the yelpers--the ropa Vieja. It was so good. The ropa with their special hot sauce was a perfect combo. Very flavorful meat. I came back the next day (this should tell you something) for the cuban sandwich. It was even better. I love a good cuban sandwich, so I think I'm partial in that way. Still, though, it was so good. If you like cuban food, this should be a stop in the city. I definitely won't be forgetting about it.
