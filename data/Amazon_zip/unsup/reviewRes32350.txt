I'm not sure what happened. There was like 8 of us, we pointed to a bunch of things, then the attached picture happened. It was all delicious. They even had Ethiopian beer, which was a little sweet but cool to try. There were spinach piles, potato piles, lentil piles, chickens, lambs, beefs. That thing in the middle was a beef tartar. One would think that eating raw beef from Ethiopia might not be the best idea ever, but it was delicious and I can attest to my lack of food poisoning. You eat everything with this tasty spongy lime-y bread. Well done, Ethiopians.
