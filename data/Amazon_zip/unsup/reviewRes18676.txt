Eh. We waited 30 min. Everyone who got there after us was seated before us. Why we didn't go somewhere else I have no idea.  I got the burger with pineapple and ham, a McDonald's burger tastes better than the one I paid 10 for. The fries that came with it were supposed to be truffle fries, but I didn't taste anything from the small handful of fries I was served. Server made us feel like he had better places to be.  The one plus was the fun beer, however when they fill your glass 3/4 full it's not so great anymore.
