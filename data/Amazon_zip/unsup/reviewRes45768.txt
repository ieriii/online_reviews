Great atmosphere, great location, great beer list, and pretty decent specials. The Reuben kicks all kinds of ass and the fish and chips are decent, but without the custom coleslaw, would be pretty bland. The kitchen seems to be eternally out of bison for their famous Bison burger but the aforementioned coleslaw rocks as hard as the sides so as far as pub food goes, Wilde has got it going on. Fun Tuesday night hangout, but it gets packed on the weekend.
