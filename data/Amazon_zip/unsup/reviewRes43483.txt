I was so glad to see that Art of Pizza was in Chicago Magazine's top 25 best pizzas in the city. This place has the best stuffed pizza in all the land, and their deep dish is also fantastic. Honestly, I can't say that I have tried anything other than these two items at Art of Pizza - but going off that they get my seal of approval!
