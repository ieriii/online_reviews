I love it! I'm not a fan of hot dogs but since coming to the city known for their hot dogs, I had to go! Also prior to booking my ticket, I saw them featured on the food network channel so it was a must go to!! The first day I went here, I got the kira knightly, my boyfriend and Aileen V go the Selma Hayak, and my mom got the Elvis Presly. I thought it was pretty good but not as spicy as I imagined it to be though. We also got a side of fries which were pretty good, and for all you people out there who know about in n' out, it's like that. My boyfriend loved it so much that he went back for seconds and got the italian sausage which was also really good! The second time I went here, I got the lamb sausage with the sweet curry mustard and the smoked gouda. This did it for me. I loved it! I even wanted another one, it was THAT good. I also had to get the duck fat fries which I was a bit disappointed but it was still good, I just didn't taste any duck to it, it was more like in n' out well done fries for me. My boyfriend got the paul kelly which was also pretty yummy! We also got the cheese fries! It was so crazy! I recommend getting here early! The first day we went here we got lucky and we ended up being the first ones in line. Then the 2nd day, we were there for about 30 minutes and the line already went out the door!
