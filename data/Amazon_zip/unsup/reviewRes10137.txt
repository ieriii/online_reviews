WOW. This place is great! Had a black truffle pizza for an app that I would probably eat every day if I could. The star of the meal was definitely the short ribs with the polenta. OH MY JESUS CHRIST. It was definitely a religious experience. I can't remember everything we ordered because it was a table of 5 and we were all happily buzzed... but the next day none of us could stop talking about it. The chef even came to our table and mingled. It was a really good time. I'd give it more stars if I could
