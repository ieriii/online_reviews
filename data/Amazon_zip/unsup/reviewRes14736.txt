Its less of a gastropub and more of a "hip" brewery bar (maybe that is what a gastropub is). The food is good, not great. The burgers were actually the most disappointing because they were not cooked according to how they were ordered (overdone for medium rare, etc.). The beers are good and they have a lot of them, and the price was right. That being said, its a really long wait, so I'd recommend going for a few beers and the bacon popcorn and other apps and then head elsewhere for dinner
