I came here Sunday night with 2 of my girlfriends and our GBF for some dinner.  The girls and I split the shrimp spring rolls which were fantastic. I believe one girl had the spicy beef salad and the other had the pork with angel hair noodles. I, of course, had the Pho -- which was very good and a MUCH more manageable portion than the Pho you get on Argyle -- though Tank is still my favorite. The girls each had a cosmo and I had a glass of the Cote de Rhone -- very good. Our server, Jessica, was awesome! Another great experience at LeColonial.
