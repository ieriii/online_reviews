A Chicago tourist spot. Don't be surprised to see a line out the door on a Saturday/Sunday morning before the restaurant even opens up. Everything about this restaurant is ginormous. This includes the building itself, menu, and dishes itself. The interior decoration is incredible and is incredibly busy all the time. However, since the menu consists of basically anything you can think of... nothing is specialized or actually really that amazing. If you're looking for a family friendly-touristy (Cheesecake factory like) brunch-lunch-dinner, than this is the place for you. If not, you better get out of downtown Chicago.
