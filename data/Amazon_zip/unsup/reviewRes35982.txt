My partner and I hit up Sun Wah after all the great reviews and talk about $4 dishes. It was fun and the food was good. It reminded me of chinese restaurants where I grew up and I was very comfortable in the space and excited about the dishes. I got the soy sauce chicken over rice, which was very good... although I have a weird thing about eating meat off of bones, and my partner got the combination BBQ over rice. Both meals were very delicious and we also got the fried wonton appetizers which I loved. The only reason I'm giving this place 3 stars is because we both got sick from the food. Myself less than my partner. I think it had something to do with a slightly undercooked piece of meat? So while I would not eat there again, I would recommend it to others as I'm sure this was a rare occurrence.
