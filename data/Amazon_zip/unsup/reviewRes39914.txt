Went on a Sunday around 1pm. Told it was over an hour wait for a table for 6 so I gave my name and phone number. Was told they would call when my table was ready. Went down the street for a drink while we waited and didn't receive a call. After about an hour we walked back and was told they called and left a message on my voicemail. I didn't receive a call or voicemail so not sure who they called or if they even did. We then asked if we can get a table anyways and the response was "our kitchen is closing in 30 minutes" so I guess that means no. Longman was a disappointment and I won't be back.
