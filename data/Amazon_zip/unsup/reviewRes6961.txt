Far and away my favorite BBQ place in Chicago! You could easily have an entire meal of just appetizers and you would leave happy! Highly recommend the cornbread, bacon cheddar Hush Puppies, and wings. Definitely big enough for 2-3 people to share.  If you arent up for an entire set of Ribs yourself, definitely get the competition style ribs for the table. These wings are some of the best in town! You will be sad if you leave without trying. Also, ask to get a tour of their kitchen. Their prep and smoking process is impressive to see.
