I am a lover of pizza- -If this is the best that Chicago style has to offer, then im done with it. I just cant believe that everyone loves this stuff, I try to be sensitive to geographical differences in food preference, but when if you were to administer a double-blind experiment between other cities top pizza, I cannot be convinced that this place would even come close. cheese to sauce ratio- 4:1 Soggy quotient- 7/3 Indigenstion probabiltiy- 90% I know people like to take pride in their local standard food fare- but cmon guys, In New York we recognize our bbq is inferior to the midwest, mexican food will never be like that of Southern Cal.- Stop hatin the NY style. Lose your pizza pride and a few pounds in the process. p.s. the service was good- very good fountain soda served in large cups.
