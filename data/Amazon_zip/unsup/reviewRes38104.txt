So the conversation was simple..."Yes all the meats!" I have to say when you order a pizza and put all the meat they have to offer on it...it comes out pretty damn good! We also had the wings that were nice and spicy... The delivery was fast, the guy was cool and the pizza was still Super Hot and wonderful...
