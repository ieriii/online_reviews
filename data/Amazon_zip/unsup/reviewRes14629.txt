Love the Workingman's Burger, hate the noise. We don't live very far from "RevBrew" so I've been here 3 or 4 times; it's a solid neighborhood place for meeting up with friends or just getting a nice, hearty meal with my fiance after work. The food isn't the best in the city, or even Logan Square, but it's good. I want to like this place more than I do, but there are just little details they haven't gotten quite right. The famed bacon fat popcorn comes out as a bowl of popcorn with bacon and cheese on top of it; after a minute or two you've eaten the cheese and just have a bowl of really salty, bacony popcorn. The exposed brick is really cool, except that sound bounces around the room like crazy. Between loud music, lots of talking and the awful acoustics, it can be hard to have a conversation, especially in the lofted booths on the noisier kitchen side of the place. The pork chop entre (served with stuffing, parsnip mash and a cranberry sauce--perfect cold weather food) is good, but it was also *huge*. I felt like I would explode, Monty Python style, if I finished it. I'm not a great beer drinker, but the house brews at RevBrew are fine. The Workingman Mild and Iron Fist Pale Ale are my favorites. I'm more excited by the whiskey selection; they even have one of my favorites (Suntory Yamazaki) and some great bourbons.
