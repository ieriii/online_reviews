In a city overflowing with a wide range of culinary choices, Hot Doug's is the one place I make an effort to visit every time I'm in the Windy City.  What can I say that hasn't already been said? It's very affordable, the staff is really personable and for a place that basically just sells hot dogs and fries, the flavor combinations that this place produces always brings a big old smile to my face. There is a thoughtfulness that goes into designing these dogs that brings what is often thought as street food to a gourmet level.  I'm the adventurous type of diner, so I'm always leaning towards the fancier dogs, although I had a corn dog there once and that was a decidedly wise $1.50 spent. Because they have so many choices that I find appealing I use the strategy of going with a friend, ordering 2 dogs each and then splitting them up, so that we can each taste 4 different sausages. I always go for the wild game dog too and it has yet to disappoint me.  There is always a line going out the door at this place, but regardless it seems to move pretty quickly. From my experience I suggest limiting yourself to two dogs per person. Anything beyond that will take it's toll.
