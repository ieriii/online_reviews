I came here with a girlfriend on Friday night with reservations at 7:15 and the place was already HOPPING!!! The vibe is intimate and cool at the same time. Dim lighting mixed with wood tables makes for an intimate atmosphere. The service was great. The hostessess were warm and inviting, quite unlike some other restaurants where they leer at you wondering why you are in their restaurant :)Our waiter was friendly and attentive, happy to suggest his favorites and answer any questions. To start we split the beet salad which was lovely. Crisp beets mixed with cool goat cheese, hearty greens, a light vinagrette, and crunchy roasted pistachos. I would order this ever time!! I chose the mussels for my entree which were cooked perfectly....tender and delectable, swimming in a broth so delicious that I wanted to pick up the bowl and drink it all! Gilt serves the mussels with a warm indivdual bagette to help soak up the tasty goodness that it the broth. My girlfriend had the whitefish dish, we she LOVED. I sampled a bite and the fish was tender and well seasoned. For dessert we split a piece of the mocha, or chocolate ( I cannot remember) and coconut cream pie. Doesn't sound extremely appealing you say......TRY IT! The homemade graham cracker crust was crunchy and delicious, and the pie itself was AMAZING. I will be certain to order this when I dine here the next time!
