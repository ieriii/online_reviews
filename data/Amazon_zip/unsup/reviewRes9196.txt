Our first visit last night was simply excellent, and I only regret that we weren't able to try more dishes. I had the lamb shank, which was cooked perfectly in a tomato and served with divine dill rice. The delicious caspian egglant appetizer was a nice alternative to the standard baba ghannouj found in all middle eastern restaurants. Dessert was tasy, but if you want a cheaper option, visit Nazareth Sweets just down the street.
