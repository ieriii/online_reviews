I wish I lived closer to L&E. The staff here is textbook trained, While I was waiting at the bar the bartender was busy but acknowledged and greeted me and stopped what he was doing and gave me a drink menu so while he finished up I could decide what I wanted, I ordered my drink and the bartender was still busy so he asked the free bartender to make it. Well done! The bartender kindly have me my drink and it was only $8! Most places would charge $12 for a signature drink. I paid for my drink and was thanked and when I was thanked again. VERY PROFESSIONAL. A casually rustic atmosphere L&E is a good place to go with friends. Not a singles scene FYI. I love that they have rooms upstairs to rent like saloons of the past.
