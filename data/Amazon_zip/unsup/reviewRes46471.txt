Grunts was pretty good. We tried the grilled cheese, cheeseburger, and chicken fingers. The french fries were ok. My husband really liked the cheeseburger and the kids loved the grilled cheese. I had the chicken fingers which were just ok. Our waitress was really nice and the service was good. The kids enjoyed themselves as well, so we would try Grunts again if we're in the area.
