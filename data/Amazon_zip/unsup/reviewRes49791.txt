First of all, I love the atmosphere of this place- very laid back and dark with low lighting. Which to me is a perfect place to relax and have a nice dinner with close friends or loved ones. But I was GREATLY disappointed that where was absolutely NO wine/alcohol/beer menu. In fact, when I asked the waiter what was available for wines because they don't even offer beer! He vaguely went through types of wines not even listing prices or brands... which is extremely odd for a nicer restaurant. In fact, I think altogether one of the reasons why this place doesn't score 4 stars with me is the lack of Beer at all, and also their beverages like soda pop are NOT free refill. However the food is good but not excellent. We firstly had the cheesy cornbread which was by far the best thing I ate there. Then I ordered the New-York Steak with Calamari and it was all seasoned very well. But the sides were only mediocre and I felt like overall something was missing from the $20 entree. The service was just okay as well- our waiter seemed very aloof and didn't come by often enough- especially near the end when I was ready for the check and it seemed to just take forever. Overall the place had a nice atmosphere and offered some uniqueness that other places don't have. But to me, this food goes hand in hand with drinking a beer- so it really failed on that part.
