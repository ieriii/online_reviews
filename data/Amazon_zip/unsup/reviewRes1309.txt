Love it when someone is so passionate about their food. Doug's love for dogs and packed meats is evident the moment you walk in. Of course, you will be waiting outside for a while wondering if the wait will be worth it. I assure you it will. After a 20 minute wait, finally made it to the wall of menu items. By the time it was my turn, still was not quite decided. Although I presumed Doug might be a little nazi about his menu, he was very pleasant and asked what flavors I liked to help me decide.  Had the Chicago dog and Jaleno Duck Sausage with Blood orange mustard. The ChiDog was amazing, clean flavors on a kaiser roll. The sausage was also good, but the blue cheese slices def. overpowers it.  Must order the fries! Hand cut, crispy on outside and soft inside.....mmmm....
