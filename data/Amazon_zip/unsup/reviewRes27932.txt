Just becuase they sell jars of your salsa at Whole Foods for 3.99 doesn't mean you gotta charge 2.75 for a tablespoon of it. I'm not opposed to fancy 'concept' takes on Mexican food, but shouldn't chips and salsa always be complimentary? And in those rare occasions when they aren't...you should have better sense than to give but a scant tablespoon of salsa disproportionate to a sizable basket of chips. Oh wait, these aren't chips and salsa, they're "tostaditas"... Came here for brunch and liked it overall, minus initial disenchantment with the chips and salsa. The presentation was really nice and definitely downtown-ish. I expected more from the flavors, though...the lightly dressed pea shoots that topped my Huevos Rancheros Verdes were probably the highlight. The rest of it was a bit blander than I would have expected from Rick Bayless, although it did LOOK nice. My boyfriend's brunch chilaquiles were much better, though. And the agua del dia is really awesome and fresh - it's basically perfect for a hot day, especially if you're going alfresco. Another plus: the brunch won't break your bank. While dinner entrees run over $20something each, brunch entrees ring in at half that. Brunch for three of us including drinks and "tostaditas" amounted to $58 after tip. I'd go back again...but only for the brunch. Not super vegetarian friendly, though. They have one thing on the menu that's dairy-free and meat-free. We asked the server if he could suggest anything else or customize anything to meet those dietary needs and got directed straight there with a "sorry, that's the only thing you can get." Poor accomodations for such a simple request!
