I had been looking forward to going to this place for a long time and wasn't impressed. This is a neighborhood place and they wouldn't seat 4 out of 5 of us until we were all there. Maybe I would have understood if they were packed, but there were empty tables everywhere. This is a neighborhood restaurant people. The fresh tomato bloody mary was fantastic, except for the fact that it came in a tiny rocks glass and was $8.50. I ordered the ribeye steak sandwich and it was flank steak. Lame. Service was good though.
