I don't give away 5-star reviews lightly. But this place really met and exceeded my expectations. Those of you who have graduated from the college sports bars, sick of dance clubs, turned off by "ultra-lounges", this is the place to be. Most other lounges i've been to, it seems like the aim is to make you feel inadequate. Until your wounded ego forces you to spend enough money to be in the "VIP" sections, or to buy a bottle service at $300 a pop or more. Yes. they are clever. and it seems that the louder you are, the more obnoxious your entourage is, they more they treat you like a star. Yuck. At Violet Hour, it seems that everyone is treated with respect, courtesy, and privacy. I guess i am sounding like an old fart, but i really enjoy the fact that i can have a little peace, with good music that doesn't make my ears bleed, and most importantly, brilliantly concocted drinks. You ought to sit at the bar, and watch the bartender construct each drink with such care and precision. And all this without pretention and attitude. you just have to be courteous, wait your turn, dress appropriately, and you'll have a great time with your company. As for decor and atmosphere and such--read the other reviews. In summary--totally cool.  a brief warning though--this is not a good pick up place. everyone is seated. no one walks around. if you are looking to hook up, this may be a difficult arena. Second. those of you looking to get drunk with your usual poison of choice, they spelled this out clearly--no light beers, no red bull, and no cosmopolitans.
