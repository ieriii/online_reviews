This guy deserves some sort of coveted prize. To bundle punk and posh in a way that really works is pretty darn impressive. Not only does the place have a unique vibe and undeniably rebellious attitude, but low and behold, the food is both fun and delicious too. Our server was amazing -- knew the menu and wine list inside and out and made some killer recommendations. We started with his signature foie gras lollipops with, what else, Pop Rocks. Yes, POP ROCKS. The duck satay and beef carpaccio are both must-haves, as is the halibut. When I go back I'll probably skip dessert and instead steer my attention back to cocktails. DELISH. Great music and yes, he keeps it loud...but it totally works. My only regret is that I didn't have the chance to personally thank Graham Elliot myself -- for delivering what absolutely is a fine dining experience in a very unpretentious way. You'll have to open your wallet fairly deep, but go!
