I love that the Icosium Kafe has a solid vegetaritan menu, but gives an option to add a good selection of meat to any of their wonderful crepes. Vegans and Meat Eaters can dine together in harmony! The savory crepes are delicious. There are some tasty creations that are already on the menu, but one can also build their own custom crepe! Very exciting. They all come with soup, and the Veggie Puree and Cream of Broccoli are both excellent. Sweet crepes are available in all varieties. The "Crepe Labella" is a perfect complement to the strong Turkish coffee with bananas, chocolate, and coconut. I had always thought that Icosium was some kind of coffeehouse, but I now know that it's crepe heaven!
