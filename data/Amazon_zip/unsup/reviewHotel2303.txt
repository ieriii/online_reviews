The lobby in this hotel was very nice and the food at the restaurant was excellent. The hotel staff was friendly and the breakfast room service was right on time. The hotel rooms were fairly average sized, but the decor was a little nicer than most Marriott rooms. The room has a big desk and a lot of bathroom counterspace, although the bathroom itself was on the smaller side. They only have wired internet in the room and it costs $14.95 as part of their "wired for business" package that includes domestic phone calls.
