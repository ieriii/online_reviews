My delivery order that was supposed to arrive in 45 minutes arrived over 2 hours later. I called at the 1 hour and 15 minute point because I understand being busy... that's a good sign right? They told me it would arrive any minute since it left a while ago. After 15 more minutes I considered calling to cancel but I was so starved and SURE it would arrive the second I picked the phone up. When the food got here it was COLD. I ate it anyway because I was dying. The falafel seemed like it would have been really good if it was fresh. I also got a chicken dish that also might have been ok if it wasn't ice cold. The delivery guy had no explanation and no apoligy. I still tipped him because I have delivered food before and I know that it's usually NOT the delivery person's fault. I will never order delivery from here again. My first experience was not a good one.
