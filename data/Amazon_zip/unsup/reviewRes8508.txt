This has been on my to-try list for a long time and we finally went this past weekend. The service was good, the food was good, the space was good. The prices, not so good. A little too high, in my opinion. However, I don't know of another place nearby that makes pizza this way, or this good. So I'd say, although the prices are a bit high, the pizza is worth it. But next time, I'd do take out.
