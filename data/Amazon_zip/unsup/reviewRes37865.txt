Nice bar. Excellent server with perfect diction and skin (not that it mattered). Ordered the CJ sandwich, which is served with Mac n' cheese and homemade chips (awesome). Tried 3 beers, cannot remember all of the names, but the Delirium was su-per. Crowded place. Took a lonnnnng time to et our food, but worth it, if you have the time.
