This is one of my favorite restaurants in the city. The food is fresh, wholesome, vegetarian friendly, absolutely delicious, and for this price point you won't find much else thats better. I usually get the Chicago Crepe--avocados, munster cheese, mixed greens, sunflower seeds, sun dried tomatoes, and plenty of other goodness, all stuffed into a single crepe that's neatly folded and well presented on a big white plate. The appetizer soup (I get the vegetable) is likewise delicious, especially with a little bit of the spicy tapenade added. I like to accompany my meal with a turkish coffee, always strong and tasty. Writing this review is making me want to go there right now! Btw, as far as I can tell the Andersonville version is identical to the Lincoln Park version of this restaurant.
