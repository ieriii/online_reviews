totally AUTHENTIC!! I had the huevos racheros which came swimming in sauce and appropriately with a serving of black refried beans. The salsa verde is pretty hot which i really dig. Plantains come many styles. Excellent service. Got all the orders right and allowed a party of 12 to split the bill up so each of us paid individually. They have a heated outdoor patio which is warm even in january.
