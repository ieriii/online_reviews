Amazing. This was my first gastropub experience and this place really sets the bar for the concept. Great food, relaxed atmosphere. Came on a Monday at noon- sat down immediately no wait. The menu is not extensive ( a good thing) 2 pages with thoughtful and slightly elegant yet unpretentious food. I had the sunny side duck egg duck hash and it was amazing. My friend had the pigs head- tete a la something or other- and it was also perfect- the pigs head was flavorful without being overpowering and so tender-flaking away with just a fork. Plus a mimosa with fresh squeezed OJ. YUM. This place is about the food- not the hype, though they definitely deserve their fair share. Their drink menu is extensive. Truly for a connoisseur, i imagine, as I am not one. For the price, you can't beat it- 2 people under $30 leaving full and satisfied. I cant wait to come back for dinner.
