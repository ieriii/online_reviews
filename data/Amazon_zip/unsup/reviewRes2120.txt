I love this place for its creativity in something I absolutely love: sausages (a.k.a. encased meats). I can just picture Doug and his fellow geniuses huddled in the kitchen, brainstorming on their newest deliciously disgusting creation. One guy goes, "Gee. I think we should try a chicken and pork sausage combo," and the other guy goes, "And let's throw in some horseradish and a little bit of gouda," and of course everyone else chimes in with various other ingredients and spices, and voila!-- a new masterpiece is created. I wish I lived closer. If I could try one new Hot Doug's creation a day, I would be one happy girl. Of course I'd probably become broke and significantly larger . . . but it'd be worth it.
