I want to give a better rating, but the service was absolutely horrendous. Our waitress brought us water and then coffee but never took a drink order until we grabbed her to order our starters after about 20 minutes. Then she took 15 minutes to bring us 2 mimosas. We ordered another round when we got them because we weren't sure when she would return again. The food is great, but I was with a chef from another restaurant and she agreed that the service ruined the overall experience.
