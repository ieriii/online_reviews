Kobe Beef Brisket!?!?!? Need I say more?? This was the BEST brisket I've ever had, and standing on that alone, Chicago q deserves 5-stars. The fact that my best friends wife went into labor just 3 hours after indulging in a heap of pulled pork and BBQ sauce here is also 5-star worthy, maybe even a little helpful hint to all of you expectant mothers out there! This isn't your typical food on a metal tray, beer in a mason jar BBQ joint, it's a dimly lit, trendy, upscale BBQ joint. The pickles and chips to start the meal were absolutely incredible as well, and I wouldn't feel like I'm missing out at all if I filled up on these in lieu of an appetizer. We did start with the Fried Green Tomatoes, which were just OK, and we also shared a side of mac and cheese (it's BIG) which was among the best I've had--crunchy top and super creamy. Overall, delicious food, cool atmosphere, solid place. My ONE complaint. Why are the sauces served in dainty cups with spoons? Isn't BBQ meant to be slathered in sauce? I find it hard to slather when you are using a spoon and you are meant to share all of the sauces among the table. Maybe it's not classy enough, but bring in the squirt bottles for the sauces!!!
