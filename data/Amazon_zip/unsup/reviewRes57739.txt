I used to go here like 15 years ago when I lived in the neighborhood. I recently started going back, as for some reason I had just forgotten about it! Maybe it's just that it is so low-key. Glad I rediscovered it...worth the trip from Lakeview. Nice old-world cozy atmosphere. Relaxed, friendly setting and staff. Fun mix of artsy Bohemian-types, theater types, young hipsters and older folks. But the food is the best part. Everything is good. Great salads (The Cobb is excellent), soups, entrees, sandwiches and desserts. Excellent pasta specials. Tasty toasted crispy garlic bread served with some dishes and with sandwiches such as their chicken breast. The fish tacos are great, made with either crispy grilled sea bass or tilappia (not a choice I think, just what they offered that night).Served in perfectly toasted triple corn tortillas. Nice wine selection and you can buy bottles to go as well. This place is so inviting and good that it makes me want to live in the vintage high rise apartment building that houses it. I am jealous of the residents who have such easy access. This place hits everything right and is just so darn comforting and familiar you just appreciate that it's here, as opposed to all the gimmicky chains and trendy over-hyped hotspots. It's really very old Chicago with a European cafe feeling. Can't think of a more enjoyable spot for any meal, although I have generally been there for dinners which have always been a delight. Very welcoming and satisfying in a way you just don't find so much anymore as the Corner Bakeries and Chipotles take over every new Chicago corner. Which I like both, but Third Coast is just the real deal. I hear it's a great coffee shop too! Although for me it's a meal destination!
