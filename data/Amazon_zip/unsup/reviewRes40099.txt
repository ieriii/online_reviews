Ever since dining at San Soo Gab San a couple months ago, I will periodically find myself chanting its name in my head as I walk down the road in stride with my steps, it has a very metronomic quality to it. I still don't know why I do that, but that is a side point. The food at SSGS is an experience to say the least. We only ventured to try the grill-it-yourself meat items (ribeye, chicken, octopus) which were all very good, but I wish they would give some guidance on how long to cook certain items. The Ribeye was hands down the best item on the menu for the following reasons: 1. The meat is tender 2. It is flavorful, even if you overcook it 3. They give you a pair of giant kitchen shears to cut it with. The side dishes are what make the dining experience so memorable. My limited experiences at other Korean BBQ places leads me to believe that the number of side dishes they give you at SSGS is extraordinary (must have been at least 30). They weren't all delicious, but it was great to try all those different items, and could potentially be meal on their own. I liked the service simply because of its ballsiness and attitude.  Ballsiness: when the bus boys bring your grill to the table, they put you at risk of 3rd degree burns at least 3 times between walking to the table and setting the grill in its holder, which is sweet. Attitude: at least a few of the waitresses are super sassy and will gladly make fun of you. Kind of like a korean ed debevic's. Its worth the trip if only to experience it once.
