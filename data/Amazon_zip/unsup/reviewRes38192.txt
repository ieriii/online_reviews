Oh happy day! Blinking in the sunlight after stumbling out of the movie theater, we decided to head north to Hopleaf, and it made my day! The wait for a table was a solid hour, but the upstairs bar made it go double quick. I loved the vibe of the upstairs area, which was a combination of cozy benches, tables, and a fun little corner bar with an impressive beer list. (Oh, how happy me and my lambic were together!) It got a little too loud by 9 pm, so thankfully, our table was ready. And it was the perfect respite from an hour of turned up volume. We got a great little corner table on the mezzanine, with a view of the downstairs restaurant. And then, things only got better! I think this is my favorite gastropub in the city. The quality of food really measures up to the variety of beers on offer, with creative flavor combos and just lip-smacking taste. I got a CB&J, which put cashew butter, cheese and fig spread within two perfectly toasted slices of bread. And the stilton mac and cheese on the side was delish too.
