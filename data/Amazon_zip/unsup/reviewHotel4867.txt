It's just a historic and old building, probably it's not well maintained like others said, but minor renovation was going on. I like old style hotel so that was OK to me. The picket was still going on at the entrance (4/2006) and it's very noisy and annoying. It seems they were in the private property. I think the hotel should have removed them. Also, what bothered me was staff was racists and not helpful at all. That was because I was an Asian? Anyway, there are plenty of other nice, well trained hotel staff out there so don't stay there if you are an Asian descendant.
