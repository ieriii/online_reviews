Every steak at this great resturant is served up on a sizzling platter and that best describes my eating experience here several times: sizzling. The staff from greeters, to managers, bus boys to our favorite waiter, Eioghan creates an "at home" environment that keeps me coming back. Suggesting new dishes, having our favorite cocktails and beverages waiting for us makes is a special night out. Between the cowboy, the new spicy lobster appetizer to the creme brulee it was a meal unmatched in prep and delivery, warm complimentary service and even the car valets greet you like an old friend. And that's what it feels like here, eating with family and old friends. Again, this is THE place over all the others that gets my vote for best steak dinner in the Windy City. The Burbridges!
