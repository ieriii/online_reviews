Piece Pizza alone could keep me coming back to Chicago. My fianc and I love visiting Chicago with everything that there is to see and do, but this pizza is everything and more that you could expect pizza to be. Every time our expectations have been exceeded! The atmosphere during the weekends tends to be a little loud and a little crowded, but that's part of the fun. Don't come expecting to get a table without a wait, but do come with some friends and get one of the many delicious and award winning beers while you wait for your table. I can't say enough how much this place is amazing. All I can assure anyone considering it is that you definitely won't be disappointed. Definitely try the New Haven style pizza. It is authentic and delicious! Also, the chocolate pizza will blow your mind!
