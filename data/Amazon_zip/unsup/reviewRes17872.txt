Ahh...a sexy, grown-up bar with amazing drinks, tons of special touches and most importantly, no TVs. Really well-crafted cocktails. Feels like you're in the lobby of an Ian Schrager hotel - great low lighting, Alice-in-Wonderland oversized furniture - an excellent experience. Everything is fresh fresh fresh (fresh squeezed juices, freshly opened bottles, even the ice has a story) and you can feel the love in every taste.
