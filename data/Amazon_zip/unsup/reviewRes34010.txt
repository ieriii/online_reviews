Anyone who EVER said that this place was better than Bongo Room must really be on something and is lame. This place was NOT even busy. There were probably 8-10 tables there, not even half full by any means, plenty of servers and we still were given terrible service. The male server just left us there to roll silverware and talk after we barely ate half of our wet, soggy, drippy omelettes. In addition, the potatoes were salty and the hollandaise sauce, which is majestic at Bongo Room, tasted like sour cream. We finally flagged him down for our check, and again, he left us there. When we waved the check book thingie to show that we were ready to leave, he nodded his head to the cashier, "pay up there," good to know! NOT! The host and bus boys were great! The food and servers, not so much. If you're willing to hunt for a parking spot around there, go around the block to Bongo, totally worth every penny.
