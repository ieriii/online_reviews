I'm not sure how Graham Elliot did it, but they exceeded my already exceptionally high expectations for this restaurant. Admittedly, I was a little overwhelmed by the bistronomic approach since I'm not a picky eater, but still a little timid when it comes to adventurous eating; however, the atmosphere and the service immediately put me at ease. The casualness of the restaurant was a bit of a surprise, but really helped to make the experience feel comfortable and unpretentious. Our server, Mitch, was personable, knowledgeable and attentive, as was the sommelier, Rob. I loved that they checked on us frequently and went above and beyond to make sure we had a great experience. Bonus, I don't think I've ever had wine pairings that went better with each course, Bravo! The tasting menus are amazing and I'm so glad we did that rather than ordering ala carte... we even ordered extra dishes before we couldn't bear to not try the salmon. No, I can't afford to eat here very often, but I'll definitely be checking in for new tasting menus and it will be top of mind for any special occasions.
