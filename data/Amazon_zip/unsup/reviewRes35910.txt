Food: The roast duck and bbq pork are tasty tasty. The seasoned tripe side dish is to die for. If tripe is something that you're not adverse to, I'd try it out here. It is so flavorful and tender, it makes me want to cry. Ambiance: My experience eating here was wonderful. Be warned: No one would mistake this place for the height of cleanliness, the bathroom is as disgusting as a first rate Chinese establishment's john ought to *always* be, and the waitress/cooks in greasy aprons who bring you your food are a little absentminded. But on a Friday afternoon, the place was filled with Cantonese workers slurping down bowls of noodles, large groups of Asian families, happily yelling at each other, and lost but satisfied looking white people chowing down on beef and broccoli. The families made me so happy! Old grandparents making horrible sounding eating noises, always chewing with their mouths open, parents stuffing their kids with greasy food, and the kids in turn, furiously playing away at their handheld video game sets. The little girls with those horrible bowl cut bangs like I used to have... Reminds me of good, chaotic, festive times at home in California. Beer: $2.75 for imported beer? My god! It's true!
