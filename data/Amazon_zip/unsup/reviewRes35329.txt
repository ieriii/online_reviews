I wanted to love this place, I really really did. I LOVE crab, so when my bf took me here and I opened the menu, I was in heaven. But ultimately, I just wasn't overly impressed with the food, especially considering how relatively pricey it is. I guess my main problem with the restaurant was the amount of bones or shell or whatever that we found in our food. And I'm talking about food that should NOT have had anything "crunchy" in it anymore. We got the chilled Alaskan king crab bites as an appetizer, as well as a bowl of the lobster bisque, and BOTH dishes had bones/shell/whatever in them that definitely should have been taken care of during the food prep process. (And I'm talking multiple occurrences in each dish, not just one.) So, that was just unpleasant. That said, our entrees were fine (if somewhat forgettable... I think we both had specials and I don't remember what they were), and we both ordered drinks that were good -- I had a Manhattan and they did NOT skimp on the Maker's Mark!
