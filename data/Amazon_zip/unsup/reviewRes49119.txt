Wants to be trendy/upscale but is kinda whiffing on all accounts. Proficient and pricey, I was not overwhelmed by anything I tasted here. The empanadas would be worth it during happy hour but not at full price - sorry. I had the flatbread pizza with rock shrimp and while the shrimp were outstanding I found the sweet sauce on the pizza to just be offputting. Kind of like, here is a trendy looking flatbread for you, Hipster Foodie in Training, you'll like it because the sauce is so sweet. Bin should look to Quartino's for some flatbread inspiration. I like the atmosphere, the place itself is of great design and layout, it reminds me of a great place I've visited in Carmel, CA. There are a number of non-run-of-the-mill microbrews on-tap which will keep it on the radar of beer enthusiasts. The wine selection is slightly above par for this section of the city. Relatively quiet, which is what I like (I know, I'm old) I will come here again. I just can't recommend it to my friends. Slainte Danno
