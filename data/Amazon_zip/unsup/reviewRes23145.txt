This place was perfect for when you are craving really good authentic Chinese. We had their signature Dry Chili Chicken, which was AMAZING.  We also had the crispy shrimp with lemon sauce which was also divine. The egg rolls which are boasted about, were really nothing great, very little flavor in them. We also ordered the crispy duck, which friends recommended but to be honest it tasted like it was reheated and then crisped up. We had beef and green peppers which was a big hit as well as the green beans with spicy black bean sauce. All the dishes were great and looking around at what others were eating, makes me want to come back and try a million other things. Couple of negatives which I can overlook because the food was so good. 1. The service is awful, slow, and no one speaks any english at all which makes it hard to ask questions. 2. The menus were dirty which just kind of grosses me out that I am touching it and then eating. 3. The chairs were plastic and weird and reminded me of Barbie furniture and were very uncomfortable. 4. The beers were warm, almost undrinkable. That being said, it is STILL work coming to because the food was so unbelieveable, except for the duck, but that may have just been a fluke. I am anxious to try one of their many other places located in the same strip mall. The strip mall this is located in is also pretty cool to walk through and shop!
