Please, don't go here. It is way too expensive for the quality of food and service. Why risk it? I agree with another reviewer that Sprout is way better in all aspects. All entrees were cold, and the server never even asked if we enjoyed the food, and simply dropped off the check. I decided to speak up, and mention that the mochi was mushy, meat was cold, and we were generally underwhelmed by everything. He apologized and offered us a free dessert, which we declined. It was bad and we just wanted out. He brought us 3 desserts anyway (I wish he had just comped an entree) and the desserts were all just okay, and one was actually plain bad. The place was empty, save for a few other tables, and now I see why. There are much better restaurants in this city than Graham Elliot.
