I am so in love with everything Irazu, I think about it and it makes me happy. There's so much good but what drives me absolutely crazy are their Patacones, specifically the mojo that comes on top. I don't know what the hell they do to that garlic but no other place comes close. The green plantains are fried perfectly, the garlic is delicious and I ask for extra so I can put some in my Pepito...mmm Pepito. Beans, lizano, steak, cheese. grilled onions, hot peppers, avocado...its so good. I am addicted and love it and want to eat it every day. love irazu love love love.
