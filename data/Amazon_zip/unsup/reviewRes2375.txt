So I rarely go to Hot Doug's anymore because I just don't want to wait over an hour in line for a hot dog and fries. But when I had the afternoon off and figured not that many other people did, I jumped at the chance to bring my boyfriend for his first experience at Hot Doug's. Luckily, we only had to wait around 15-20 minutes. The key is to go on a weekday (non-holiday) and go around 1 pm or later. There will still be a line and it will still be busy, but it won't be a crazy wait. I decided to splurge that day and go with the foie gras duck sausage... I know, I probably shouldn't be as it was banned before, but I had never tried foie gras before and figured I would try it once in my life at least. It was a good but very rich... I thought I would get sick after eating the whole thing, but thank goodness I didn't. It is definitely more of an acquired taste but I did like it. And of course, my favorite at Hot Doug's, is the fries with cheese sauce on the side. My boyfriend had the spicy pork sausage which he seemed to enjoy, and definitely loved the experience there with everything from having Hot Doug take our order old-school on a pad of paper to all the kitchy sausage and old rock decor. If you have never been to Hot Doug's before, you have to try it out at least once. Wait in that long line just for the experience and try the duck fat fries on the weekends just to say you had them. It is a Chicago experience!
