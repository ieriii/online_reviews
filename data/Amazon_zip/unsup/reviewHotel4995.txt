We have stayed at the essex twice . it is close to the red line, Grant Park and they offer a shuttle service . Yes the beds are small but so are the rooms . Our room was clean and neat and yes the lobby and bar are older but the bar does have cold Old Style . If location and saving a few bucks are for you try the Essex.....I can say we have had no problems staying here.
