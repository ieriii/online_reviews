We rented their basement room for a private party. The food was really well done. The entree options included pollo al mojo and carne asada. Everyone's chicken and steak were cooked correctly and not dry or overdone - and they were very flavorful. The guac that came out first was great and we wrapped up with ice cream sandwiches that were wonderful too. The staff were really helpful in getting everything set up and were attentive through the night. The margaritas were fabulous (even if they do come in smaller than normal glasses). I'm really glad we chose Frontera for our event., it couldn't have worked out better.
