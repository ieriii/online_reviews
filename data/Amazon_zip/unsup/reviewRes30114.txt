There's a lot of hype behind this place, almost too much. Very long waits, & it seems like this restaurant needs to be in a bigger space.  The open kitchen isn't doing it for me (see Vivo), and while almost every part of this menu is fantastic it does fall short one front. Unless I'm missing something culturally, why are there no pitchers of sangria on the main dining room menu?? With Ceviche & Tapas (I think he calls them Pallatos Pequenos, or something) this would be a perfect pairing, no?
