I've visited Mayan Palace a handful of times and with one exception, I've always had outstanding service. A creature of habit, I've always ordered the fish tacos becuase they are DELISH, why deviate?! All of the ingredients are fresh and flavorful. They also bring out chips and salsa right away-outstanding! The salsa has some kick! The margaritas are decent. At my last visit I ordered sangria which waspretty good.  Overall the servers are very attentive and friendly. If you're in the area looking for really good Mexican food, this is your place!
