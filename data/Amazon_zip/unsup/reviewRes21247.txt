I love mexican food and Mayan Place is definitley one of my favorite mexican spots in Lincoln Park. I've been there for a birthday dinner with 15+ people as well as with smaller groups - the service is always excellent. The food is also great. I noticed someone mentioned it looks a little dumpy from the outside, which is true, but inside it is surprisingly big and is so cute! The margaritas and chips & salsa are amazing as well - I 100% recommend it!
