From my daughter's point of viewTwo days ago, for my food expedition that I'm going on with my dad, I went to Tank Noodle. Tank Noodle is a Vietnamese restaurant in uptown. I'm 9 years old and I am a little picky with food, especially spicy food. Remember I'm only nine years old so adults are probably going to like this food. When I walked in the room I took a look around the restaurant and there wasn't really anything very interesting about it. One thing I do like about it is that there are many different cultures and I heard all these different languages. But there wasn't anybody to seat us, maybe the host was just busy or something. They need to make it more interesting and color the walls or something. So I don't really like how it looks but now I'll tell you about the food. My dad ordered for me, he ordered Pho Tai. But first we got this tea that I thought looked liked pee. And guess what? It didn't taste good at all. It might have tasted like pee but, fortunately, I don't know what pee taste like. I did not like it at all. Then our soup came I was a little nervous but when I tried it, it tasted pretty good I have to say. But the noodles were rice noodles instead of egg noodles. My dad's broth was so much better than mine. It tasted almost minty in some ways. It was a seafood broth. Then I tried the bean sprouts and they were not too bad I have to say. That concludes my review for today.     Stella
