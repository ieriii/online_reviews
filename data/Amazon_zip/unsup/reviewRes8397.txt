Hands down the best spot in the city for that super thin crust/baked in a crazy imported from Italy oven! When Spacca Napoli first opened, we went quite a few times. After a long absence, I was really pleased to see that the quality hadn't changed. Definitely try the Bianca con Bufala - my favorite pizza on their menu - I find it difficult to share. I think that other reviewers have mentioned this as well but the service is excellent - water is always being refilled, great suggestions about the menu and super friendly. My only wish is that the atmosphere had a bit more of that wine-bar feel. I think that there are plans to expand into the art studio space next door (I think it is moving upstairs); it'll be interesting to see how that shakes out.
