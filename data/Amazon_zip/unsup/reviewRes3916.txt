I came here with my Korean friend on a Friday night and was surprised to find it not that busy. Good for us! I heard about this place from my neighborhood on Facebook and was peeved that I hadn't heard of it and even more peeved that I missed out on eating there since it's opening. Korean fried chicken?! How could I have missed that? Back to the story at hand. We ordered a half of the Seoul Sassy, Crisp BBQ and the original bad boy buddha. First off, let me say for two ladies eating, this was waaay too much food.  It was delicious! Better than I could have imagined. The chicken was juicy and flavorful. Each bite was better than the one before. The bad boy buddha was good but I probably wouldn't order it again. The chicken is the way to go. I haven't been back in a while and am going to have to take my sister here when she is in from Boston. She is going to love it! Seriously, go here. And take me with you!
