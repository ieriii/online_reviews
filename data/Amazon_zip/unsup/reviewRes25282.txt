Yummy! Oh my goodness I wish we could have it a pie delivered out to California so we could have it again.  By far the best deep dish in Chicago, and trust me while we where here we were on the deep dish pizza diet. Very Very poor service from our waitress but couldn't let that effect my taste buds. Amazing, phenomenal pizza!
