I can only give this little place 3 stars for a couple of reasons. First off, it is pretty small, and crowded. The service was pretty good, a little stiff at first but our server finally warmed up. The food was excellant however, when they say small plate (think tapas) they mean small and expensive. I was surprised at how small the portions were for the price point. The wine menu is extensive, but again very expensive. It's located right off Michigan Av. so I'm thinking they are trying to get the tourist dollar. It's sad because if they lowered the prices just a bit or put a little more food on the plates, I think they would get a higher review, at least from me.
