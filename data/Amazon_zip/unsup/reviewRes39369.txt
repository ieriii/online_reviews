I am uber surprised by yelpers noting bad service at this place. The service was outstanding, servers were darting around all over the place - clearing out plates, changing the grill, bringing more beer.... I had been wanting to try this meatfest for awhile now, and though I thought it was a super fun experience with a larger group, I wouldn't say that I thought it was all that yummy. For one, I was not a fan of the dipping sauce, which probably had a lot to do with it. I wish there would have been more choices in that respect. The meats we ordered were just fine, my favorite being the pork ribs. Definitely the best choice. Our server steered us away from the teriyaki beef for whatever reason. The kajillion small plates coming to the table were lovely visually, the mung beans and kimchee (?) being my favorites. The best thing at the whole meal was the soup. The spicy miso soup with tofu and jalapeno. That stuff was amazing! All in all, I am glad I went. I wasn't floored by the food, but the $24/each (incl tip) was just about right!
