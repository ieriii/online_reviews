I feel bad rating this place 2-stars but I really don't see what others find so great about this place. The servers and staff are in regular street clothes, so it's hard to tell who's taking care of you. It made it even more weird to see random people walking up to your table taking your plates, asking you if you want wine, and bringing your food, and you'd never even know they worked there! The food was okay, but we left so hungry we hit up another joint after. The portions are small and I felt bad for my friend who ordered the raviola, because it was literally one raviola that laid flat on the plate and was the size of the palm of her hand. Overpaid. Lastly, of all the empty tables around we were seated next to a populated table, and the waitress kept wiping her ass on my back trying to get through. We also couldn't converse unless we were shouting across the table because we were in between two speakers and the music was blaring. I wouldn't come back, but kudos to those who find this place excellent!
