Usually I tend to write detailed reviews but Spacca Napoli can be reviewed with one line: Best neapolitan style pizza in Chicago. Period. I grew up in Italy and, trust me, the pizza as good as the one you'll eat overseas. When you leave, they have a tray of mini-cannoli and you can get one for free. Assuming you can still find one... :)
