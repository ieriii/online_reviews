This is a quintessential Jerry Kleiner creation. Read any reviews of Park 52, Club 33, etc and you'll have a great feel for the decor. That being said, its a good look. I guess if "ain't broke don't fix it"? As always, the food is excellent. The ropa vieja appetizer was incredible. The salty/sweet mixture with the plantains melted in my mouth. My steak was perfectly prepared as well. The drinks were interesting, if slightly girly. I loved the Caparinia though, and it is very hard to get a good one in this city. Each element was well paired and surprising -- a great meal all in all. The service left something to be desired, as in many Jerry Kleiner places. Snobby, aloof and unavailable (if seriously hot) are the words I would use to describe our waiter. Why the 'tude when we're downing drinks and ordering like there are 4 of us instead of 2 and your restaurant is empty? I just don't get it, don't you want to earn money?
