I wouldn't normally give a giant, convention-crazed mega hotel a 5 star review, but the Regency Hyatt gets one and here is why: So in order to get to the incredibly small regional airport that services my hometown - I must inevitably fly through one of 4 cities: Dallas, Cincinnati, Atlanta or Chicago. I try to avoid Chicago at all costs. O'Hare is a nightmare and something ALWAYS goes wrong when I fly through. Well this trip was no different. One canceled flight later, I was on my way to the Regency Hyatt in the Loop - I mean, come on, I'm not going to stay at the airport. I got the room at an absolute steal on Priceline (the airlines don't pay for anything nowadays - but that is another review). When I arrived I was dubious to say the least. This place is huge - frickin HUGE. I prefer the boutique route, but whatever it was cheap and I was only going to be there one night. As I checked in, I made small talk with the desk attendant, Gabrielle. I was just talking about my flight being canceled and the nightmare of getting downtown on public transportation because of construction, etc. Not really bitching - just talking. Well - the fabulous Gabrielle - informed me that she was upgrading me to a suite and then proceeded to give me a voucher for free room service and 2 free drinks in the bar! I told her that was absolutely not necessary, but she insisted. The suite was phenomenal with a beautiful view of the river on one side and the lake on the other - did I mention it was a corner suite? :) That is really some amazing service. Next time I'm in Chicago, I will stay again. thanks, Gabrielle!
