Well, Mr. Bayless, you've done it again. Xoco is delicious! I tried the Milanese and it was delicious. While I could do without the chicken being "fried", it was still good chicken, OH and the artisan jack cheese - OMG - it was dripping out of the sandwich; the pickled jalepenos SO flavorful. DH got the carnitas caldos (apparently soup for anyone not aware, as we weren't). It was SO tasty with some kick - I don't think we got any dumplings, but it wasn't lacking - the greens were so bright green and fresh. Also got chips & guac - SO fresh. And then by accident, we were given what we think was an Almendrado - it was assigned to our number but we didn't order it, so he gave it to us anyway. INCREDIBLE! I want to go back for churros & chocolate & everything else!! It's a little chaotic in there, but you've got it nicely organized. Your staff knows what's going on and what to tell people when they seem confused. They do help with seating when folks are standing around. Today was confusing b/c they were not doing take-out, whereas yesterday, opening day, I believe that's all they did; not sure. Rick was there again tonight and my friend and I got a chance to meet him. Very cool!
