Lunch on Saturday was my first time visiting the Devon location of Uncommon Ground, and it was lovely. As would be typical for weekend brunch/lunch, we were anticipating a long wait (even for 2) but were seated right away. The atmosphere was warm and inviting, and our server was laid back and really sweet - and made sure to tell us about the $5 bloody Marys on Saturdays, which we took her up on! So many things sounded good, but because I'm on some sort of a veggie-burger kick (though I'm a carnivore through and through), that's what I ordered. While it's not house-made, it was very good - flavorful and held together nicely when topped with perfectly-melted white cheddar and caramelized onions. It didn't even need any condiments! I ordered it with the sweet potato fries, which were very generous. My husband ordered the turkey club, with bacon and slaw, which he liked but said he would probably order something else next time. And there will be a next time. Bonus: they're participating in ala card (http://alacardchicago.com), so we got $10 off our bill!
