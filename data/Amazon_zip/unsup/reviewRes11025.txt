Since I have a sweet tooth - my favorite item on the menu would be their chocolate chip pancakes with bananas. Thinking about it right now is making me salivate. The french toast here is also kick ass. If you are coming to visit on the weekend -- be sure to wait at least an hour for seating. Totally well worth it though!!
