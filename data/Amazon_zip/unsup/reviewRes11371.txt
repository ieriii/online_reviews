I went on Saturday and it was and hour and 40 minute wait so we walked around the corner to Nick's and had a few beers and came back. we ordered 3 different kinds of pizza bbq,chicken,onion and bacon/white sauce with clams/ and meatballs with mash potatoes and red sauce. They were ok I may try this place again for the beer and try a more tradional pizza like pepperoni or sausage. The microbrews were all right. My favorite was wingnut but I did switch to Jameson on the rocks. I liked the atmosphere a lot better then the bars by me in Wrigleyville. If I could rate just the food i'd give it a 2 and the atmosphere a 4 so I gave it an overall rating of a 3. 3 of us, 3 pizzas and a constant flow of drinks till the place closed about $125 plus tip.
