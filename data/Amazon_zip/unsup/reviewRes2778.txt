Judging by the reviews, sounds like Tru is great on the right night. Unfortunately I clearly did not have the pleasure of enjoying one of those evenings. Service is terrific except when mistakes were made. Frustrated looks on servers faces. Our server seemed to have very little passion for food or fine dining . . . just doing the job. Did not know some basic information about certain elements of the meal. What is worse, he asked if I would like him to find out. Seriously? I do not remember anything about the food. It kept on coming (10 course with wine pairing), that part was good. There is no doubt the food passes as very good food, just did not make an impression. Sommelier was terrific. Great person with great insight, quite impressed. Decor, nice, fine. Expected more. The issue is that for $600+ (for 2), looking for a lot more. I don't believe an off night should be an option. There is a lot more to service than a purse stand and coordinated dish delivery. Not impressed b/c they have both a black and white option for a napkin. Was looking for a lot more.
