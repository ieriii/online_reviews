The pizza here is pretty good. It's not my favorite stuffed/deep dish/Chicago-style or whatever you want to call it in Chicago, but it's up there. The crust-cheese-sauce-toppings ratio is good, and I appreciate the texture and flavor the cornmeal adds to the crust. I also like the amount and flavor of the sauce. It was a little on the pricey side (over $40 after tax and tip for a large pizza with a bunch of toppings). The pizza did feed about 8 people, though . . . so I guess the price wasn't obnoxiously high. We decided to order from here because I have a cousin visiting from Poland who wanted to try some Chicago pizza. Because we needed it delivered, we couldn't get it from my favorite, Pequod's, so I looked for some reasonable alternatives. Calo was very highly rated, so we decided to go with them. And, like I said, the pizza was good. The service left something to be desired, though. I don't think my order was overly complicated. I wanted a pizza that had mushrooms, green pepper, and onion on the whole pie, and pepperoni on half of it. I went over this with the woman taking my order over the phone about five times to double check. It was really important because at least two of the people eating the pizza were vegetarians who didn't want pepperoni or any kind of meat touching their pizza. The woman taking my order was, somewhat understandably, getting a little annoyed that I was triple and quadruple checking this, but, like I said, it was important. Did I mention that this woman wasn't particularly nice to begin with? But, whatever, if the food was going to be good, it wouldn't matter. So, about 45 minutes or so later, we got the pizza. And it was really good. But it had sausage on it. All of it. To be fair, it also had all the other toppings, but the sausage made it inedible to the vegetarians. If you're going to have an attitude about the way I'm ordering, at least get my order right.
