This place has a very fun and fantastical feel to it when you walk in; you definitely feel a little like Alice in Wonderland. When I've had a frumpy day, I like to go here to class up my night :p I've had nothing but good service from the waitresses to the concierge. I work in the Loop so I go to the W for drinks sometimes after. I stayed here with a friend for a "stay-cation" a few months ago and I was appalled by the size of the room! I literally think my jaw dropped. The bathroom, on the other hand, was generously sized. Weird. We really just needed a place to crash after drinking but had I been staying here on a real vacation, I would have made reservations elsewhere!
