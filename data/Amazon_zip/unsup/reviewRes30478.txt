This place is overpriced crap. I ordered skirt steak tacos: the meat smelled and tasted like mold, and there wasn't that much of it. By the time tax and tip were done I paid $27 for a meal that I couldn't even eat. The guy I was with ordered salmon cooked through and got medium rare at first and medium when he sent it back to be cooked the way he ordered it. I just don't understand the high ratings this dump has been given.
