after calling and calling for months, we finally got a reservation only to have it canceled 3 hours before our meal was set to begin. luckily they were able to fit us in the following night and all was well. after handing over our bottle of buffalo trace for the staff, we took a seat at a two top upfront and were treated to about 15 courses of culinary excellence. all i will say here is that dining at schwa is totally worth the hassle, and i plan to try to get in again someday. pics in my blog.
