My parents were in town and they loved this hotel. It is very trendy and minimalist. The rooms are average size but have a really nice flat screen tv. Another plus is that all the products that they give you are kiel's. The gym is also great. Its got all brand new equipment and is pretty big. The only problem my parents had was that there was a little mix up with their reservation and its a little pricey.
