Of the dozen or so pho restaurants on this street, only Tank is bustling with customers. That's a good sign, and there's a good reason for that. Great beef broth, plentiful ingredients and fast service combine for a great food experience. And yes, the other places on the street aren't good, in my opinion. For those of you who are complaining about the noise and dirtiness, my opinion is that you don't share the Vietnamese opinion of what constitutes a good dining experience. Not that noise or dirt is good in and of itself, but the hecticness and bustling is a positive sign, not negative. If you want a chic place, go to Le Colonial and order their sedate pho for double the price.
