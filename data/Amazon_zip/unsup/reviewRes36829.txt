I still haven't been to Indie but order delivery often and have never been disappointed, except once when I received Coke instead of Diet...but that was probably user error. The food is consistently delicious. I'm wary of sushi unless the menu is exclusively sushi but Indie Cafe has fresh salmon that melts in your mouth. Well, maybe not your mouth but definitely mine. I stick with Red Curry and a spicy tuna roll. And the crab rangoon. I need to place an order now.
