My first impression of this place was that it was very basic, which was fine for about $70 a night in downtown Chicago. And that would have been fine, except that I woke up the next morning with a COCKROACH on my FACE. Possibly the biggest cockroach I have ever seen, and the laziest. I think it may have just wanted a good night's sleep. It waited for the front desk attendant I called, crawling from my pillow to the middle of the bed. The attendant cheerfully informed my boyfriend and I that it "must have come from the restaurant below." Needless to say, our vouchers for free breakfast were returned with the key.  I'm pretty sure the elevators are broken. Or just really slow. I waited more than ten minutes for a ride down and ended up having to lug my stuff down the stairs. We got a small discount on the hotel rate, $18 off for "customer dissatisfaction" because of the cockroach incident. Sorry guys, $18 off doesn't cover it. There's a decent looking hostel down the street. There's a bunch of nicer hotels within a block or two of this place. My recommendation is: anywhere but here.
