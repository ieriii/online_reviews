I went to Carnivale with a group of 6 girlfriends in spring 2011. WOW. The dining room is the most beautiful restaurant interior that I've ever seen. The staff was very accommodating. We had only planned to hang out at the bar, but some people were looking to have a sit-down meal. Smart move by the restaurant to make area for skitzo groups like us. While I waited, I had a great time at the bar talking to bartenders. I ordered a caprihina. It was made perfectly -- not too sweet. When the gang was all there, we sat down to a great meal of shared appetizers. The cost was a bit hefty -- mine about $28. Yet the food was great. I enjoyed the guacamole & chips (made fabulously). Other dishes & drinks that were enjoyed by the group: - Frozen White Sangria (wow) - Ropa Vieja - Flores y Camarones (It was my first time eating edible flowers. It was an okay dish, imo. I wouldn't get it again). - one of the ceviches - Remolachas My main gripe was my second order of caprihina. It was made too sweet. Maybe the drinks by the bar come out better or it had gotten too busy for consistency. The atmosphere was hip and all about partying. If you want to impress someone from out of town, this is one of the places that should be on your list. Two thumbs up!
