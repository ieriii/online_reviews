I always love it when my business traveler friends come through Chicago and we set up a sleepover date at their hotel. Really, is there anything more strangely comforting than staying at a hotel in your own city? The Intercontinental is a fabulous find for right around $200 a night. Pillow-top beds (good sleep is the priority), well-appointed rooms, a super convenient location, and a luxe lobby. And the lobby bar is great fun! We stopped by around midnight on a Tuesday night and the bar was jumping. A black tie-clad group was in full effect and their drunken ringleader treated the entire bar to a round (or two) of shots! This morning, while helping my friend search for her crackberry, I found a used Trojan Magnum wrapper under the bed... details, housekeeping, details!
