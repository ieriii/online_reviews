We were heading over to the Congress Theater to see the Pogues, so we figure we're going to see an Irish punk band, what better food to have then some Costa Rican fare! I hadn't heard of Irazu until we were heading to the show and typed in the address of the Theater and asked to see what was in the area via Yelp! All I can say is Yelp! to the rescue again. We had an excellent meal, starting with some chips and hot sauce. We ordered up some guacamole and chips and it was some of the best I have ever had.  I had the Casado with the rib eye steak and it was amazing. The steak was seasoned perfectly, the seasoned rice was out of this world, the plantains brought a nice bit of sweetness to accentuate the spiciness of the food. The over easy egg over the rice was a nice choice, as I agree with Anthony Bourdain that a runny egg makes just about everything better. I had the oatmeal shake, which was also very good. It really is like a shake version of horchata.  Before the days of Yelp! I'm sure we'd have wound up someplace else for dinner and that would have been a shame. Irazu was a real treat with some great food, great service and great prices. Living an hour or so away from Irazu is unfortunate for us as I'd eat there weekly if I was closer. As it is, I'm sure we'll make the trip back just for the food.
