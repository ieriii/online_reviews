My first Chicago Style Pizza while actually in Chicago. Other than the hour and 15 minute wait....this place was cool. The pizza is huge with tons of cheese. No doubt you will not leave this place hungry unless you are some type of freak...lol.  Good food, and the waitress was very nice and helpful. She saved me $6.50 when both my wife and I tried to order a salad. She informed me that the salads were big enough to share....which they were. The only complaints I have are the host was rude and the wait to get in.
