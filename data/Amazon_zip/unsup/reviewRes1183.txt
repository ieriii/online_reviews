I am not going to go into detail about each and every dawg I tried because my review would be about 20 paragraphs long. Seriously. Am I ashamed of myself for such gluttony? A little. Was it worth it? Hell, yes. I joined a bunch of fellow hookie playing yelpers for encased meat mayhem at Hot Doug's one Friday afternoon. My cohort and I arrived just before 11AM. A pretty good line had already formed. Luckily, we spotted the rest of the lunch posse in line already and joined them. Some might say we cut in line but I say it was all just part of the planning process! We stood in line a good hour chatting it up in the sunshine while carefully reviewing the menu that was printed in advance. That's right, the menu was printed in advance, people! That's how we roll, yo. We were a fairly large group so we ordered two dogs each for sharing. I highly recommend going this route. There are SO many delicious dogs on the menu to choose from. Ordering 10 dogs meant I got to try pretty much every specialty dog being featured that week. Genius! Duck fat & regular fries rounded out the table order. The duck fat fries were all I thought they would be. Effing fantastic. Oh, and they have orange soda on fountain! Bonus! I also have to mention that I had a corn dog. The best corn dog I've ever had. Period. I'm pretty sure it put me over the edge and sent me into a hot dog coma but again, it was worth it. My top three: 1) Game of the Week which was venison sausage w/a fig goat's butter and raclette cheese. The butter is what really made this dog. 2) Foie Gras and sauternes duck sausage w/truffle aioli and foie gras mousse. I'm not a big foie person, but this dog was fantastic. It's pretty rich and a good one to share. 3) Cognac infused lamb sausage w/spinach raita and manchego....as good as it sounds. Do not let the line intimidate you. It's totally worth it. Doug's is the real deal and something that everyone should experience. It makes me happy just thinking about it...
