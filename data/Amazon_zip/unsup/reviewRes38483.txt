I'm not really sure why it still amazes me that people still wait hours at this location. Never mind...it's located to attract the tourists and locals who are in the area. Don't get me wrong. I once was one of those who actually waited 2 and half hours for a table to enjoy 1 slice of stuffed pizza. It's still good pizza and definitely needs to be shared. Slices are huge and a small stuffed is too much for 1-2 people. I don't think I've stepped foot in a Giordano's in years...not because I'm lazy, but because I'm just not in the mood to wait. My friends and I end up having it delivered, and we get it in less time than if we were to stay and wait for a table. They do deliver to the hotels in that area (be sure to ask first), so that might be something to consider if you don't dine in.
