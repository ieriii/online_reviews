Great location right in the Loop area.  I was able to walk and see most of Chicago other than Lincoln Park/Zoo. I stayed only for the weekend. The staff at the desk were really nice. I was really early so they let me check in my bags as I explored Chicago. After exploring for several hours, I asked them if it was possible to check in early which they were able to accommodate me.  I like the hardwood floors in the hallway of the room and bathroom. Room was renovated, clean, and up-to-date. I was surprised with the nice amenities of a mini fridge and microwave. LCD TV and free wireless was nice. The toiletries were pretty basic which was fine, facial/body soap bar and small bottle of shampoo/conditioner in one.  The free breakfast was ok. Just your basic continental breakfast.
