bottom line: after watching rick bayless crush top chef masters, i was afraid this casual little spot wouldn't live up to the hype, but i was totally wrong. the tortas are AMAZING and the churros were a pleasant surprise. i also got a head-nod from rick himself as he passed by me on the way back to the kitchen (presumably to check on his other two restaurants which are located next door).
