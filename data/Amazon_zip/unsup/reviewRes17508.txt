We went there with friends tonight for a quick drink and a small bit to eat. The hostess was very nice and accommodating and we were greeted right away. We chose a table up front and there was a jazz band playing that night. The singer was thrilled we were there as there were not many patrons on Superbowl Sunday. She was very warm and friendly. We ordered drinks and the mixed ceviche. I ordered the hypnomito and the others ordered a margarita. The margarita's were great by my drink was just ok. The ceviche was very good and fresh. We wish we could have had dinner there but we did not have the time. The space was pretty spectacular. The music was nice but since we were looking to have a conversation it made it a bit difficult to do so. No offense to the singer...she was great but we probably should have sat at the back bar. Overall we would recommend it for something different. So many restaurants in Chicago are not so interesting and so this was a welcome change. We look forward to returning for dinner soon!
