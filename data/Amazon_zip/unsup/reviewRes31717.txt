Had dinner here last Saturday night and they actually seated us 10 min before our reso time, so that was a big plus! We had a few drinks in the busy bar before we were seated and there was not much standing room.  Shortly after we sat down, we were brought a small plate of some sort of potato dish on that house that was very good. I actually found out that I knew one of the managers from college so he came by our table and gave us shots of sake and later on 2 pieces of fantastic escolar with a homemade potato chip and shaved black truffle. Not something I would ordinarily order but it was delicious! Our waiter was very knowledgeable and made some good suggestions. We ended up ordering the summer of sunda roll, which was very light and refreshing, as well as the kobe beef with crispy rice, which was melt-in-your-mouth awesome! We also ordered the garlic longevity noodles with blue crab and the honey ginger braised long ribs. Both were fantastic and the meat was so well seasoned on the long rib. We were too full for dessert but they had some interesting options.  I didn't find it to be overwhelmingly loud compared to busy restaurants in the area. I thought the uniforms the staff wears were kind of strange and looked uncomfortable...weird choice but I'm sure there's a reason for it. Overall it was a great experience and I will definitely be back to try more of the menu!
