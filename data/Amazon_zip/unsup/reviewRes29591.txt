I've been to Frontera twice (once for dinner, once for lunch); both times, I've enjoyed it more than Topolobampo, which is also, of course, good. I say this just to point out that Frontera shouldn't be dismissed as inferior or the fall-back option if you can't get in to Topolobampo. You can't go wrong with anything involving duck or mole. The mole enchiladas and black bean enchiladas are both great. Every type of ceviche I've tried is excellent, as are the cocktails. My friend and I couldn't decide which of the two flans we liked better. Most telling for me, personally, is the fact that I've never reached for the hot sauce while dining at Frontera Grill--to set context, I'm half-Mexican and have a bottle of Tapatio with me at work, so this *never* happens. Every single item is perfectly executed and doesn't need the "help." They don't do many reservations, but you can always try. Show up early enough, and you won't wait too long, though, even without a reservation.
