Yummy! This place is nothing special, which sounds disparaging, but I mean it in a good way. It is standard and ordinary fare in the sense that you know what you are getting. No foam food. No trendy hype. Just burgers, pasta, steaks, salmon, chicken, martinis, cakes, and wine. Also, good specials- $20 3-course winter dinner menu and $16.95 3-course lunch. Portions are large and filling. I had the hot buttered rum cheesecake for dessert- divine on a cold day, and less guilt-inducing after a couple glasses of wine. Crowded during the lunch hour, but good service nonetheless.
