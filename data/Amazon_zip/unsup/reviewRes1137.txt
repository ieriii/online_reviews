I would not normally spent $8 for a hotdog, but Doug knows how to make it so unique that I always come back for the exotic meats! Wild boar, alligator, snake, rabbit, etc... If you want something spicy, try the Atomic! My friends and I usually get a few special dogs and cut them up so we can get a taste of each. Great plan, huh? The person taking your order is always Doug. If he's sick, the restaurant goes on vacation until he gets better. How cool is that? My cousin once sent him a get well card when he's sick. LOL. The line wrapping around the building is worth the wait for sure. Yes, we've waited over an hour before. Through the rain, snow, hail, etc... However, I would only go on Friday or Saturday because of the DFF (duck fat fries). Also, don't forget to bring cash. Closes at 4pm so make sure you're in line by 3:59pm and you'll be okay. You cannot get in line after 4pm. I wanna go here for my birthday!
