Wandered over here after we were told that there would be too long a wait at the Hopleaf bar. We found that this place was satisfying and tasty as all the others here have said before....and luckily for us it seems they have a sister location in Lincoln Park which is much more convenient for us on a regular basis. Definitely worth a look if you are in the neighborhood.  Icosium Crepe with the lamb sausage was really good. Ingredients were really fresh and tasty. The mint tea is also really good.
