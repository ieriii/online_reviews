YUMMY IN MY TUMMY! Sultans has amazing food. It's quick, in and out type of place, and I wish i could eat there everyday. They have a fresh salad bar, great dressings, the best hummus, bomb falafel and fresh chicken. It's so good. Nothing more to say but you should go. Two negatives: 1. It's surprisingly a bit expensive for what it is. Personally, I think it's worth it but a dinner for two can add up! 2. The seating is very limited and awkward. It never fails that my butt goes on someones table while trying to shimmy to my seat.
