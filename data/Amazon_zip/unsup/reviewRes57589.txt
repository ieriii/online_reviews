really disappointing. i had heard such great things about this place and was completely let down. the service was pretty horrible. we could never even see our waitress because of all the nooks she was able to hide in. the cheese fondue was chalky and unexciting. the cheese and meat plate was more than standard. just deli counter stuff. the chocolate fondue was ok, but i could've cut up some apples and put marshmallows on a plate myself. no creativity at all. the only redeeming part of the whole evening was the flamenco guitar player who serenaded us. i won't be back.
