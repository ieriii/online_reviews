My Aunt took me here for lunch a couple years ago. We were lucky that there was a table immediately ready for us outside. The place was packed.  I got tortilla soup and some appetizers. It was an amazing time and it immediately became one of my favorite restaurants. Since then, I've been a huge Rick Bayless fan and I love his show on PBS. I'll go again some day (I live in California so not very convenient). I'm sure of it.
