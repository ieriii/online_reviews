I have no idea why this doesn't get a full 5 stars. Let's face it, unless I get done dirty, if I post a review on Yelp, it's because I LOVE it! And Gino's is no exception. Now, as far as deep dish or pan pizzas go, Domino's deep dish is my sole experience. Anyway, I'm gonna make this a short review because the mere thought of Gino's crust makes me salivate, and being nearly 2000 miles away, it's not helping me! My buddy and I had two small pizzas, and that was A LOT to eat for the two of us. So much so that one big slice made it back home with us. We had Gino's Supreme with patty sausage and pepperonis. I was a bit disappointed by the sausage patty. It was otherwise pretty damn good! The other one was the Meaty Legend, was seen in Man vs Food, and wow it was sooooo good! But the main attraction was the crust. That big slab of crust that borders the pan is just pure heaven! It's unlike ANYTHING else you've ever had. It's a bit buttermilk and a bit corn bread, but it's a whole lot of goodness! Anyway, if you're a Chicago first timer and a deep dish pizza novice like I was, Gino's East is a definitive stop! BEWARE: The lines are crazy on a Friday night. If you're staying at a hotel, hit up your friendly concierge and they'll hook you up with a "head of the line" pass that lets you bypass the line (and enables your concierge to get a little kickback I'm sure). PS: The decor is pretty cool, and you can write on the walls.
