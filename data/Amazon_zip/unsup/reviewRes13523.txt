The first thing I need to tell you is I was served perfect poached eggs here - the best I've have since my dear grandmother passed. They were cooked juuuust right - so you could dip the toast in the yolk, and it wouldn't drip on the way to your mouth. So that was basically an automatic four stars for them. The additional star is for exceptional service, neat ambience, and a great menu. Since I am a seafood junkie, I showed up for some fish the night after my first breakfast here, and the swordfish did not disappoint. I also took my mom to brunch here, and she said the Crab Cake Benedict finished a close second to Feast (which if you knew my mom is saying a lot). I've also had the Crab Cake Benedict and liked it a lot - it's definitely more crab than cake, which is fine with me. I'm sure I'll be having many more meals here!
