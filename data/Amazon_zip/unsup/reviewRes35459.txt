Five bucks for a whole plate of duck over rice? 3 bucks for a huge bowl of shrimp dumpling noodle soup? *insert angelic choir "AHHHH!" here* This place is awesome for mainly 2 reasons (AND for the two BEST reasons): it's cheap and it's delish! very broke-college-student friendly. (heck for the broke-anything-person really.) the portions are generous, the service is fast and friendly, and the place has a nice modern loft look, not dingy or cheap looking at all. Looks do deceive, but in this case, in a really good way. If you're looking to impress your (non-vegetarian, meat-loving) date, I would recommend this place and for you to order the special peking duck dinner complete with a very impressive duck-carving ritual. The dude (or dudette--I've seen the owner's daughters do this too) rolls out the cart with this beautiful roasted duck and slices the bird at your table with such finesse. Seriously , I didn't know duck carving could be such an art! I could describe it in detail, but really, you should just go witness it for yourself. Moreover, another thing I find pretty cool is that they use your leftover duck meat to make your duck soup and the duck fried rice combo. How's that for environmental friendly? Now, I will admit that I've never gotten takeout from Sun Wah so maybe quality in that department is lacking (based on other people's reviews)? But don't let that discourage you from missing an amazing dining experience. Street parking may be a little challenging (especially during the peak eating hours), but then again, I think it just means that this place is really on to something.
