Wildfire is my "special occasion" standby. Yes, I love my chain restaurants. I'm a poor student so I can't justify Morton's/Joe's/etc. when I'm paying for it, but Wildfire is juuust right.  The inside has a solid, classy atmosphere. Their steaks are good (though not on par with the higher class steak establishments) but there are some other big standouts. Their chopped salad is my favorite salad EVER (although, that's not difficult because I usually think salads are a waste of time). I hear the mashed potatoes are great, although they have skins in them so I stay away. The dessert tray is also amazing... I usually end up with the chocolate peanut butter pie - try it!
