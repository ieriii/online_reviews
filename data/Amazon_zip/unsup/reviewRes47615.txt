Well, well, well yet another Brazilian steakhouse... ...wait we're not going for steak?! No, instead a couple friends and I decided to do the Sunday Brunch on a wonderful Chicago Sunday. It was surprisingly delicious. I absolutely love breakfast food. So when it is jazzed up AND unlimited portions...even better. What makes this place standout from Fogo is that they have an extremely different take on the salad bar. I don't know if maybe dinner is different but I actually found myself going back to the salad bar several times, something I don't do at Fogo. Two dishes that stand out. One, the chicken and waffles. Two, the oatmeal - yes the oatmeal. Yes I've had Roscoe's chicken 'n waffles in California many many moons ago as a child and have not developed that foodie tongue yet and didn't really appreciate it. Wiser and mature, I thought the chicken and waffles at Zed was good. Combination of spicy sweet, protein and carbs, sugar and meat, breakfast and dinner....talk about firing taste sensations! The oatmeal was a recommendation by the server and we all scoffed at the recommendation...but wow it's a good change of pace after chowing down everything else. Can't go wrong with a bowl. I've got to try dinner here now.
