One of the best fine dining experiences I've had in a while. The waitstaff was attentive. Although the runner did deliver his summery of each dish (when served) with very little enthusiasm and less confidence. Our server was fantastic, taking the time to familiarize us with the menu, give recommendations, re-explain things a few times as I stopped listening to enjoy the space (gorgeous space by the way).  The portions were perfect for tapas. Each dish was wall thought out with inspiring flavor profiles and well executed. My only complaint about the entire meal was that the short ribs were way over salted. However, our waitress notices that I wasn't scarfing down every last morsel of it (as i had down w/ all other dishes) and took the time to ask what was wrong, and then proceeded to have the chef remake the dish to my liking. Fantastic!  I can't wait to go back for the suckling pig.
