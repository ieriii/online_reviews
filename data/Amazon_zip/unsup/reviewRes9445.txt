I liked this place, didn't love it though. Food was good, not great. Service was above average though. I give the upstairs bar a solid 4 stars though. Its a very comfortable set up and is great for after dinner. Not cheap though. I had a VSOP and I believe it was $24. Won't be running back there any time soon.
