Had the pleasure of going here twice, first for brunch with the lady and second for a large group dinner with some classmates. Brunch: I had the Farm Egg Sandwich (over easy eggs, housemade chicken sausage, arugula, wisconsin gruyere, hearth bread, side salad). Brilliant, nuff said! Dinner: we had a prix fixe menu that included: Apps: housemade broccoli cheddar soup, vegetarian chili, sunshine salad Entrees: crispy gunthorp farms chicken (ragout of chicken confit, morel, celery and lovage), bacon wrapped meatloaf (Q7 farms beef, gunthorp farms pork, roasted garlic & potato puree, asparagus), sweet pea caramelli (housemade pasta, sweet peas, rooftop mint, pea tendrils, garlic broth, herbed Neufchatel cheese, garlic chips) Desserts: pear brown butter cake (port-poached pears, almond brown butter cake, brown butter gelato), chocolate bread pudding (creme anglaise) The butter cake was out of this freaking world! The meatloaf was good. Solid meal all around. Beware of going in large groups though. Although serving 30-35 people is not easy, I found the service pretty slow. Happy eating, Ev
