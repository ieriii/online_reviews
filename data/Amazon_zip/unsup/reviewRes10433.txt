We came here after hearing from multiple people that it is a must-have. They were right! Piece has great pizza. You choose your pizza type, red (w/ tomato sauce & mozerella), white (w/ olive oil & mozerella), or plain, and then pick your individual toppings. We got a white with sausage and banana peppers. Awesome. The first slice was the best- after which, we both declared Piece our new favorite non-deep-dish pizza. The crust was so crispy, with the perfect amount of cheese and toppings. However, as time passed, the crust got to be tough and chewy. Not a biggie because you can pop the leftovers in the toaster oven and it's fresh again. But the downside was that our jaws were tired from chewing for about 2 hours after eating (though I think worth the pain for the deliciousness of the pizza).
