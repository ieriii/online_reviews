One of my friends told me he knew this awesome bar that I just had to try. Being as adventurous as I am with bars, I said why not, packed my girl in the car and went to Hopleaf. I knew nothing about the place until I got there and saw it was a Belgian bar. As soon as I realized this, my face was like when a cartoon character sees something beautiful. My eyes bulged and "oooooooooohhhhh" was the only thing that came from my mouth. Before we ordered, we walked to the back to get our name on the waiting list for a table. This is my only point of contention. You don't take reservations? That is kinda weird. They said it would be 45 minutes to an hour and we went to the bar to wait. We ordered some delicious beer (I ordered the Urthal which had a nice smooth taste) and got lucky enough that a table opened up as soon as we had the drinks. About 20 minutes passed and they called our name. We were seated in this awesome upstairs section looking over everyone. The dining area is decorated very nicely and you would never know it if you just hung out in the bar. Now my companions were boring and ordered the steak frites which they enjoyed. I on the other hand wanted to be adventurous, so I ordered the rabbit soup. It was perfect. The rabbit had been cooked perfectly, and even sitting in the broth, it stayed tender. It was a really great experience and I owe my friend for recommending Hopleaf. Note: If you are driving, get there early because you will be driving around forever for a place to park.
