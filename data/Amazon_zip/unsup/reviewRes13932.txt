The Revolution in Logan Square is here!  Thank goodness this place opened up in Logan Square. Great beer selection, food, and venue. The space is really nice, with plenty of seating and a very large bar that makes up the center of the place. My buddies and I shared the apple wood smoked wings which were awesome. I had the beef stew which was very good...while my friends had the massive burger. Service was great. It did feel like a good number of people there weren't from the neighborhood....but I guess times they are a changing.  I hope to return and make this a regular spot.
