My friend Colin dragged me in here once with the promise of live-band karaoke, only to be told that, as of that week, they no longer had live-band karaoke. Fine. Whatever. They have put some effort, not much thought into putting together a large, respectable beer selection. In this they have failed. The lines are poorly maintained, and the beers (on draft) come out not quite tasting the way they should. The pizza, though, is great. I forgot about this until the other day when we ordered a white pizza for sitting in and watching the Bears game. Very good indeed. And yes, they do deliver. They have this really cool website thingie that takes your order. Perfect for people who not only don't want to go out that front door, but also don't want to get off the computer for a sec to engage in voice conversation over the phone. You know who you are, you classy people you.
