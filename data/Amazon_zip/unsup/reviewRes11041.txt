We each had a beer, both excellent. Then we started with the guacamole appetizer, which was very good and surprisingly spicy. The chips were flimsy and fell apart in the guac. The pizza we ordered was outstanding! We got a small (which was quite large) white pizza with artichokes, Italian sausage and tomatoes. It was one of the best pizzas I have had. This place is LOUD. The rafters are way up high, and the noise bounces everywhere.
