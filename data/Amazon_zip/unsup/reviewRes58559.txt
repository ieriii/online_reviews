I have to say I really enjoy the food at Le Colonial but I don't appreciate the way the host treats my husband and I. We have been coming to the restaurant at least 2 times a month for a couple of years. He still doesn't recognize us. Admittedly our checks are only in the $120-$150 range but come on...he doesn't recognize us? Could care less if we got a table or not. We often go in very early (5:00-5:30) and he will tell us he has nothing except the table right in front of the hostess stand and the balance of the restaurant is empty. Then he wants to show us the book as to prove he's not lying to us. Last time he said for us to go upstairs and have dinner on the couch. We love the food and long for a night when he is not there. My husband always orders the red snapper and I have tried everything on the menu. The only item I didn't like was the duck. It was horrible, had that old taste. Everything else is great from the sugar can skewer, ahi tuna, soups, seafood stew, shrimp and asperagus etc,etc. Just don't order the duck. My advise to the restaurant? Get someone who is more personable.....gets to know the clients, whom is inviting and welcoming to the establishment. The food is amazing...one of my favorite restaurants. The service otherwise is most excellent.
