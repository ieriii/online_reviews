Their stuffed pizza is almost as good as Nancy's, not quite as spicy. Good crust and generous cheese. I would skip the pan, kinda wishy-washy and the thin crust is mediocre. Pat's has the best thin crust hands down.Not a true Chicago deep-dish experience like Uno's or Lou Manalti's but darn good eatin'. My son's favorite.
