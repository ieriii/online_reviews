Sultan's is a great little restaurant conveniently located a few blocks from the Damen line. I picked up some falafel sandwiches to go for me and my wife today. I got mine medium spicy while the wife wanted it mild. The order is prepared right in front of you (quite rapidly I might add) and if there isn't a line you're in and out of the place in five minutes. Both of our sandwiches totaled 6 bucks! You can't beat that price. When I got home me and my wife did have to do a taste test to find out who had the spicy one since the only indication of the two being different was a smiley face marked on one (if you are ever in this situation the wrapping with a smiley face is the spicy one). I feel like I have had some good falafel sandwiches in the past, so I don't know if these were the best ever. But they were very good and filling. And I was very pleased that the medium was just the right amount of spice. Heads up though that if you get anything other than mild, the spicy sauce makes the falafel and pita bread a bit soggy. All and all, this is a tasty place with generous sized sandwiches for a great low price. I look forward eating in next time.
