Yes it's a "chain". Yes anything dipped in butter is theoretically awesome. That said: I've never had a better steak in my life. In Chicago, I've been to Gibson's, Morton's, Sullivan's, Keefer's, Wildfire, and Smith & Wollensky. RC dominates all. If any of you can suggest a better steak in your opinion in Chicagoland, let me know! :)
