I like coming here when I want something light and savory. Their crepes are very light and there are many savory crepes to select from like goat, spinach, roasted pepper, and garlic or another with pineapple, olives, tomatoes. many unique combination. Plus since my savory was nice and light, there is room for a sweet crepe too. The crepes is a little chewy and has a light crisp.The coffee is really nice and strong and the mint tea is just perfect.
