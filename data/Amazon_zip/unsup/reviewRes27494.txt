I had a great meal at Graham Elliot. The dining area is nice loft-like space (e.g., exposed air ducts, rafters) and has exposed brick walls. The lights are soft and give the room a very warm feeling. My only complaint about the restaurant space is the noise level. The music seemed a bit loud and that may be the reason diner's conversation level was a bit amplified, but it wasn't unbearable. I wouldn't come here on a first date or a business dinner because the noise may be a bit too much to overcome. The food was great. We shared the caesar salad, the beets, the risotto, the duck confit, the cod and beef stroganoff. Everything was good but I think the standouts were the risotto and the duck confit. You could easily smell the smokiness of the risotto and it tasted as good as it smelled.  We also split the pumpkin pie sorbet for dessert - I love a good pumpkin pie and this didn't let me down in any way.   One comment about our server - even though he very knowledgeable and helpful, I couldn't help but feel like he was trying too hard to be "cool."
