#79 - chicken and rice noodle soup. Aside from the homemade recipe for chicken noodle soup that's 4 generations old in my family, this is the best chicken soup I've ever had. I love the fresh basil they bring you. The soup has so many good things going on. The broth is perfect and it's heightened by all the different ingredients. The portion is very generous. I will definitely need to come back, maybe to try something else or to hit up this soup again.
