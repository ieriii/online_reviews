I should preface my review by saying that I am a vegetarian, so I've only ever had the normal fries and vegetarian hot dogs here (I know, I know.) Also I have absolutely NO patience, especially when I'm hungry. However, I am totally willing to wait in line which says a lot about how amazing Hot Dougs is. I've waited anywhere from maybe 30 minutes, up to a recent almost 2 HOURS. Yes, it was about an hour and 55 minutes from the time we got in line to the time I had hot dogs in front of me. The line was brutal but as usual my rage subsided the moment I made it through the doors and knew it was almost my time. I learned my lesson about going over there on days everyone has off work (went on Good Friday) and also a lesson about not dressing warmly enough (it was FREEEZING.) The vegetarian hot dogs are the best I've ever had, and I always lust after the amazing things my meat-eating companions order. I wish they were open later and/or also open on Sundays. I also wish they would deliver to my desk right now because after typing this all I can think about is some delicious hot dogs loaded up with everything...yummm
