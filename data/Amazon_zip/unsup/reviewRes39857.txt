We live 2 blocks away and walked over because we had heard good things about this place. We thought it would either be the sad proof of yuppies taking over our neighborhood restaurants, or hipster hell. We were pleasantly suprised to find that it was neither.  No one acted snobby, from the Nacho Libre clone host, to the handsome (and quite talented) bartenders. The prices were acceptable for the fare, and the food was delicious. I was a bit dissapointed by the portion size of my entree- but that's to be expected of a gastropub I suppose.  The best part of the night was watching the bartender make my whiskey sour (which is my normal drink anywhere). He strained an egg though his fingers to catch and discard the yolk, shook the egg white and the sour concoction with extreme confidence and skill, and poured me up something frothy, delicious, and completely unexpected.  I would go there for the whiskey sours alone! We totally loved it, and would go back for sure. I'm gonna go listen to some Johnny Cash now....
