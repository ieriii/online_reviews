WOW!! That's pretty much it! The wine here is wonderful, the beer is great, the service is impeccable and well the food was absolutely phenomenal! Hats off to you Publican A+++++. You must eat here the next time you are in Chicago, this is the place to go no doubt about it. I do suggest making reservations though unless you don't mind waiting hours for a table on the weekend/ or a communal table (which actually look pretty cool). But I would still wait to eat 3 hours here, even if I had to eat my meal standing up:)
