This place . . . I would have to say is one of my favorite places eat! My husband is a culinary professor - so we make it a point to try to find places were they have new and unusual ways of preparing dishes that would normally seem plan and simple. The Publican was incredible! We went there on a Sunday night - which turns out to be very slow nights for them (to those that complain about the noise - go on a Sunday!) On Sundays they serve a prix fixe meal - and usually the chef will go all out. Each dish was better than the next - first course was Squid ceviche, wonderful - second was a clam chowder, made my knees weak - third was baked turbo with roasted root vegetables , yummy and finally a yogurt sorbet with stewed prunes, sounds not that great, but it was - perfect finish to the meal. I feel the atmosphere is cozy - and yes its going to be loud - its very OPEN - people are really not secluded in anyway - thats the idea. Its family style and its about community. The service was top notch - of course I was there on a Sunday - can't speak for a Friday or Saturday night. However if a place is this popular and has been featured in Chicago Magazine and what not, prepare for it to be packed! Also - yeah its really all about the pork (notice they have large paintings of pigs on the walls) and about fish - a very earthy menu I would say. If your not sure about this place, ask around at Blackbird or Avec (the owners other 2 places) about the menu and what to expect - also what nights are less busy than others, they would be more than happy to tell you. I think Publican have it going on - from the decor, to the food the the service. Also prices i feel were very reasonable, We've spent a lot more for less. My suggestion is to keep an open mind and from the complaints I have read - use some common sense and do a little bit of research.
