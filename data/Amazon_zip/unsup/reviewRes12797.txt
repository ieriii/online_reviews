The place was amazing. They had ladies flipping on a trapeze fetching wine bottles from different floors of the restaurant. The service was great. A hundred people running around with meat and cleavers. The salad bar is huge with like 40 things on it. The problem I had was that the meat is cooked with a salt rub. The salt not only made me hot. It gave me a tremendous headache. I could have eaten all the garlic mashed potatoes in the world. But that meat was too salty. The bacon wrapped filet was amazing. The pork tenderloin was perfect. My wife had the Brazilian Cheesecake and she said it was the best she has ever had. We would go again.
