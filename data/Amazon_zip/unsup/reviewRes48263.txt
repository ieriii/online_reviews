I came here on my Memorial Day trip to Chicago trip and was a little disappointed by my meal here. This may have been partially affected by the phenomenal meal we had the night before at The Girl and the Goat that is in a similar price range and menu style that blew me away. The experience started off well when we were seated promptly from the time of our reservation. The space itself is beautiful with tons of hanging globe lamps. Some tables even have their own enclosed booths with swinging doors, which look like a lot of fun. The beer menu was short but with some great choices, and I enjoyed my saison. The whiskey list also looked good.  We had the oyster sampler of 6 to start and I appreciated the card that came along with the oysters, but they never told us which direction it started or from which one, so we were off the entire way. They were fresh and tasty, but not very memorable. The country ribs were ok, but coming from Texas they were average at best. I was excited about the farm chicken, but it was dry and over seasoned.  Bottom line: pretty space, well chosen beer menu, disappointing meal
