They do take limited reservations on Saturdays if you call about a month in advance (this is what we did). So we were seated right away which enhanced the experience - long wait times can be a drag and set expectations artificially high. This place (IMO) is much better value for money than Topolobampo next door. Service was great (water glass constantly full, waitstaff not condescending, never without silverware), but the food was the real star. Lots of delicious options. We will try to come here at least a couple times a year and bring out of town guests because Frontera really showcases the Chicago food scene. I love that you can get delicious food at a reasonable price (for delicious food) in such a fantastic location.
