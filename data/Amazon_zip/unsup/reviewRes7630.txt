As a native Brazilian, I grew up going to the original Fogo de Chao in Sao Paulo, Brazil. This was my first time in the US. The food here is second to none, the meat is fresh and it is definitely a one of a kind experience. The salad bar is amazing, many different choices and just what you would expect from a 5 star restaurant. Make sure you have the traditional "Brazilian Picanha" and pair it with an original "Brazilian Caipirinha" (Muddled lime, Rum, Sugar, over ice).
