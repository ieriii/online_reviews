Never actually made it to the dining table.. but spent 40 minutes waiting for a reserved table and had to experience attitude and patronizing stares by the hostesses who tried to shuffle us into the already overflowing bar. Cannot comment about the food, but obviously this restaurant has issues managing their customer inflow. Not sure if I'd be willing to go back. Good luck to future diners.
