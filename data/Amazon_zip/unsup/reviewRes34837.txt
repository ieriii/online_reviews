Hi, my name is Heather, and I'm addicted to Sushi X. By far my favorite sushi spot in Chicago! Most consistent as far as quality of taste and appearance that I've ever seen! Rolls are so inventive, unique, and flavorful! Although I've tried just about everything on the menu, I would without a doubt recommend: double stack, honey roll, red dragon, and yellow jacket. I love this place so much that my boyfriend and I have a "Sushi X" fund....we go there at least once a week! I swear I could be homeless and I guarantee I'd beg on the street not for Colt 45, but for money for Sushi X! Coolest thing about this place is they not only rule in sushi school, but they have happy hour specials on Sundays and Mondays (Chicago-Milwaukee location) from 5-7 p.m. where most rolls are HALF OFF! It's also BYOB...does it get any better?! How cool is it to go get fat and satisfied off sushi, bring a great bottle of wine, and spend less than $40 for two people! Seriously, now I'm getting hungry for it again...
