so fun inside, or funny? interesting mix of modern minimalism, walks a fine line by beetleguese mansion! The drink I enjoyed was excellent, but I had not tried the other fair. Love no smoke no cell policy; its fun to smoke outside. Unfortunately the doorman needs some tips bout his job, at least it looks good intent and purpose. Both bartenders and waitresses make an excellent cocktail. May see a line of ugly people outside, but maybe thats just wicker park? I bet they all eventually are served, but why? Missed the back room on a weak weekday night, however, the mystery makes it even better. Is there a stage back there? do they grow wormwood?
