For a restaurant that isn't on the cheap, I was surprised to see so many children there. A fun ambiance, Shaw's is your classic Lettuce Entertain You restaurant: the food is good, but the menu isn't so creative. If you like seafood and know what your favorite fish is, go here and you will get it. I think it's a good place for parents to meet your significant other, smart casual and good food.
