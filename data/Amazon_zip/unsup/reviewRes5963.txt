Yeah, I really dig Wildfire. As soon as you walk in the restaurant you the smell of rotisserie just hits you. Aaaah. The food definitely lives up to the smells in the restaurant. The restaurant itself is very cozy with cushy booths, dark wood and intimate lighting. It's definitely a great restaurant to take a date or even to conduct a business lunch or dinner. I love LEYE restaurants...they've never failed me.
