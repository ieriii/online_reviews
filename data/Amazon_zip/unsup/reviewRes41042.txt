I have been a fan of this place for years. I swear for a few years i thought they sprinkled crack cocaine on the carne asada cause i would crave it if I was in a 6 mile radius. have ventured away from the steak a few times and I cannot rave about the others. Great steak tacos and burritos. If you get cheese in addition to your cilantro and onions on your tacos the price can get a little high for lunch but you will always leave satisfied.
