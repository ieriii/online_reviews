It took about a half hour to get here from downtown, and another half hour waiting in line on noon on a Tuesday. It seemed like it might be possible to move more quickly if we'd shown up at 1 instead. I got the vegetarian dog with everything, and it made for an inexpensive and presumably healthy lunch. My non-vegetarian friend ordered the more expensive, and much heavier, foie gras special and found it interesting but perhaps not something you'd be up for eating twice.
