I went there for Sunday brunch and was surprised to see so many children. I love children but it kind of killed the mood and my friends and I felt a bit out of place. We had to wait for almost 30 minutes for a table. Once seated, we were seated in the back where it smelled like mildew a bit. The waitress was just wonderful. The omelette was a bit dry, but the potatoes were amazing. Oh and the coffee- oh the coffee! Loved it! This place is truly a-ok. Not sure if I will be running back, but I won't be running away either.
