Now I've eatten at many places in this great land and Glenns is Da Bomb. I haven't had seafood this good in boston or south carolina,so to get seafood this great in Chicago next to a train stop well F me to tears gonna have to write home to moma about this place. Service top notch and no tux awsome,small yes but it's so south park cool.Please,Please don't tell anyone other wise I'll have a harder time getting a seat. Back home a crab leg dinner is $35 for a 1lb dinner.Hell I just spent $35 for all u can eat and started with 2lbs and great corn to. So go before the word gets out. Congrats Glenn your in my top 3 in the lower 48.
