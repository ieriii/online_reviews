You might say I frequent the city of Chicago. Over the past 5 years or so, many people have referred to it as my second home. Co-workers often think I'm from Chicago because I spend so much time there. So naturally, when anyone I know ventures out to my beloved Windy City for the first time, they always ask me "OK, where do I go to get the best Chicago deep dish pizza?" And until a couple months ago, I greeted them with a blank stare. You see, it had become a joke, we never ate deep dish pizza when I came to town, we were too busy at The Publican or Longman and Eagle, Spiaggia or Avec. But when a friend from Minneapolis met me in Chicago with only 1 request of eating real Chicago pizza? Well we had no choice, we had to break tradition, I mean he did drive like 8 hours just to hang out, right? So off our raucous group went to Pequod's after it was unanimously voted to be the best option and holy crap, were they right! I can't tell you anything you haven't already read but just know it's worth any wait you may have to endure and this really is what they talk about when people praise Chicago deep dish. Praise Pequod's!
