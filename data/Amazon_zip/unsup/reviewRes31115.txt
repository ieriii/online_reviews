The vegan strawberry milkshake I had here was one of the best milkshakes I've ever had in my life. Totally unexpected. I have no idea how they make soy so fluffy and creamy and delicious, but it works. The food I had here---not so much. I had the eggs benedict, which was fairly flavorless and swimming in a bland Hollandaise, though the whole-grain English muffins were nice. My friend had the steak and eggs, which I recommend avoiding like the plague. The "steak" was thin, tasteless and sort of rubbery. The home fries he got with them were tasty, though, and had some nice pepppers and whatnot mixed in.
