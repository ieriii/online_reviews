I did enjoy the food here. I've never had Cuban food before. I had a skirt steak dish and was happy. They are BYOB which everybody keeps talking about. We had 8 people so we were able to have a reservation, but only 6 showed up on time and the other 2 were about 10 minutes late and they gave our reservation away, but informed us we were "welcome" to continue to wait for an open table. It turned out to be another half hour. I was pretty salty about that. We brought some wine and a six pack, but since we had to wait so long we ran out of a lot b/c we weren't anticipating having to wait that long. The food was great, the waitress was fine. After the meal the same host came up to us while the ink was still drying on the check saying that he would "allow" us to stay, but we had to go back to the lounge area to finish our wine. We weren't rowdy, loud, or anything and I was on my best behavior around my wife! I almost think that English was a second language to the host and the words he was using might not be what he meant. I'm not exaggerating, like 3 minutes tops had passed since we paid the check. And there was another table of 8 open right next to us. I don't know all the details, but it sucks having a $600.00 bill and being shoved out. We pigged out on apps, entree's, and deserts. Food, A. Waitress, A. Host, D.
