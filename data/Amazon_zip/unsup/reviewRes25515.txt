yum, yum, yum. Artopolis is a great lunch place on a saturday. The spinach and feta artopita is my favorite meal on a cold fall/winter afternoon. Delicious puff pastry wrapped around well seasoned spinach/feta - its divine. I think the artopita selections are really the standout dishes at this place - some of my other items have been kind of hit or miss. (though I have not tried dessert) My only complaint - service can be really so so. And they have some odd rules like the fries are only available from 12 - 2pm or after 2pm. Sometimes it can be frustrating, but a great experience overall.
