Their Bay Beach fried rice is divine, as is everything else I have tried here. My roommate could live off of their red curry. Everyone is friendly, the food is quick (without being too quick... I like to know it's being made to order haha), & it's located conveniently off the Red line. Seating is a tad uncomfortable, the AC is a little too cold, even in this heat... & it is definitely a yuppie/hipster type place. But the food is worth it!
