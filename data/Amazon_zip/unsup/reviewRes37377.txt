I give Hopleaf 5 stars for one reason and one reason alone -- B. E. R. E.  Uh, I mean, B. E. E. R.  BEER! I mean bee-eee-eeeeeer.  By the grace of Zeus, it's like I died, arose to Mount Olympus, was granted entrance by a Hora, a hipster-wannabe "bouncer" (in quotes...I think my date could've taken him...with a Q-Tip), then I look up to peer into the face of Zeus and my gaze firmly locks onto the bounty of beer balanced upon the banks of ledges.  I could've sworn I saw hundreds of beer bottle gods gazing longingly down at the demi-gods (read: taps) along the altar (read: bar). I had seen the face of Zeus, and he handed down to me many goblets of the drink of the gods.....beer. Any beer. All beer. Whisky if I wanted. But, beer.  We would've stayed here longer, but my allergies to douchebags was acting up, and we headed out far too quickly.  I can't wait to go back. I hear they serve food here too....
