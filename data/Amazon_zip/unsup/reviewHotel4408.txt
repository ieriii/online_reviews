I stayed in a room with double queens. The room itself was big and had 2 closets. The bathroom was tiny! You could barely close the door without getting stuck between the door and the toilet, haha. The rooms were always clean when we returned, with fresh towels. One time, though, we came back and our bathroom didn't look clean. Turns out, the toilet stopped up. My mom called the front desk who immediately sent Maintenance. He knocked on our door within 5 minutes, fixed the toilet in 5 minutes. 5 minutes later housekeeping knocked on our door, apologized about the mess and the toilet and cleaned our bathroom. 5 stars for maintenance/housekeeping! This place is already on the expensive side and everything else was an additional charge (for a nominal fee). Can't they just say the nominal fee is going to be an arm and a leg? I had every intention to workout at the fitness center until I saw that you had to pay a nominal fee to get in the there. We decided to try out the hotel. And I had an expedia ticket of $10 off a night. We weren't impressed enough to return. Convenient phone/tv checkout to avoid the front desk. Starbucks at the street level. Door men who look fancy but don't really do much.
