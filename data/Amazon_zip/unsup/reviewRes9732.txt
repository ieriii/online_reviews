This is my favorite restaurant in Chicago. My favorite dishes are the bouillabaisse (I ask for extra spice) and the steak & shrimp meal. They have a great bottle of Butterfly Riesling on the menu that goes well with most dishes. Aside from the incredible food the french colonial decor is delightful and the adorable maitre de tops off the experience. This is a definite must.
