Taste: 4 Value: 4 Service: 5 Looking for a place to eat in walking distance from my hotel turned out more challenging than expected. The first couple of placed I found on Yelp were all closed. I ended up on Michigan choosing Giordano's over Chipotle. At first I was interested in getting the "world famous" stuffed pizza. After the fine print pointed out the 35 minute cook time, I had to move to something that would be ready faster. I asked the waiter for a recommendation after narrowing it down to a few choices. He suggested  Chicken Oreganato, which was on my short list, and I decided to give it a try. I also go the Italian Wedding soup. The soup turned out pretty good (4). It was not made fresh for me, but the meatballs were still juicy and flavorful while the pasta was just right. I was fearful that the pasta would be overcooked since I was eating later. Instead I was pleasantly surprised. The pasta turned out very well. It was linguine with leeks, mushrooms, and a grilled/roasted chicken breast. The meat was tender and juicy, the pasta was cooked well. The whole thing worked well. I got the lighteater plate and it was more than enough. I had to ask the waiter to confirm that it was the right size with my large plate. I'm looking forward to trying their pizza later this week. Will be sure to call in the order before heading over though.
