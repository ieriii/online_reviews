I am not a huge fan of deep dish pizza, but Art of Pizza has made me a believer. The crust is perfection, crisp and buttery without being greasy. The sauce is deliciously tangy, chunky and not sweet.  I've never had anything other than deep dish sausage and mushroom pizza from this place, nor have I ever felt the need to mess with a great thing by mixing it up. Yum.
