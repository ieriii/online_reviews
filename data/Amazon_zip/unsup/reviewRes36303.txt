After hearing quite a bit about Meli, I was very disappointed in my experience.  On a busy Sunday morning for brunch, the place was quite crowded, there is not enough space to wait. I was constantly having to dodge people as I tried to wait to be seated.  I ordered the scrambled eggs, potatoes, and the banana french toast. The eggs were runny and tasted a little odd, potatoes ok, and the banana french toast was nothing special  I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here.
