Highly flavorful and elevated food in a non pretentious setting (and no it's not pretentious by virtue of trying hard not to be). I loved almost every dish that came out and whaaaat? It's BYOB! This is not your daddy's Charlie Trotter's.If people would describe you as two or more of the following, boring, old, an accountant's accountant, staid, buttoned-up, high-strung, from the gold coast then please save yourself a cardiac and don't go. While I can understand frustrations with last minute cancellations I suggest that it's part of the contract you sign with Schwa. This is part of what you are agreeing to when you make reservations. Schwa has a unique history with its star chef and is unapologetic for being anti-establishment. Also, let us consider how many times all of us have canceled on restaurants at the last minute. A unique 5 star foodie destination that gets away with not being luxurious (aside from the flavors) by virtue of being honest and upfront about its identity.
