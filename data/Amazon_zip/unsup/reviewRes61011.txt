great place. booked fifty/50 for my birthday on a friday nite, wanted above average bar food with a good atmosphere for my small group of ten. amazingly helpful with planning & answering questions. professional, but very to-the-point...really appreciated it. my groups spans from city dwellers to suburbanites..and everyone felt comfortable. it was a great crowd. food was awesome, service was top notch, everyone on the staff was super friendly, from the bartenders to the busboys.
