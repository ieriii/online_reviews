Kinzie offers top notch steak nibblage - big fat giant tasty morsels of tender perfectly marbled steak. My bone-in Delmonico was cooked to perfection not to mention the side of sauteed spinach and mushrooms. The service was fast and staff was attentive. If you're a steak lover, then you really owe it to yourself to give this a shot. I put this place right next to Morton's and definitely over the likes of Ruth's Chris (butter, pffffft) and Gene & Georgetti's (crap service). Oh and the crab cakes are also excellent! The ONLY reason I don't give this place 5 stars is due to some ignorant Chads who block you into your booth with their briefcases like they own the place.
