I'm not sure if it was the pre-sweets-a-plenty that overshadowed my meal, or if perhaps the pasta here just leaves a bit to be desired but I can't really say I was bowled over by my dishes at The Pasta Bowl. You see, I came here following the Yelp Elite Noble Tree event where the powers that be were literally force feeding us (yeah, twist my arm why don't ya) the best treats that some of Chicago's finest bakers have to offer. It's nice being pandered to in the way I'm accustomed after all, but those bountiful bites of cheesecake, turnovers and pies really spoiled me in a way that even pasta with melty cheese and hearty marinara couldn't hold a candle to. Sampling both the rigatoni bolognese and farfalle pollo left me nothing but underwhelmed. I adore me some pasta, but I rarely indulge in it, so when I make room in my skinny jeans for an avalanche of cream, 'shrooms, meat and carbs, I need it to be worthy. Lumpy skinny jeans are not hawt!! Both pasta dishes were generous and definitely scratched the itch that my sweet tooth couldn't reach, but wouldn't have me rushing back for seconds soon. I make a mean penne puttanesca that would put these turkeys to shame *and* can be eaten in the privacy of my own home in stretchy pants. Bonus. Quick Tip: If you are going to dine here, you may want to sit next door... they serve the full Pasta Bowl menu at the adjacent Other Side Bar which expands your menu options by double when you combine it with their bar fare offerings. You know you've always wanted to try dunking cheese curds in your gnocchi sauce anyway, so go for it.
