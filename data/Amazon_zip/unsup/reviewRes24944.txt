Two of my biggest turn on's: Anything dipped in chocolate and anything smothered in melted cheese. Knowing this - and hoping to get lucky later - my honey booked us for the 5:30 seating on New Year's Eve at Geja's. From the valets (all wearing smiles and festive party beads) to the bubble machine on the outside patio that enveloped us in tiny bubbles, we felt like we were stepping into a fairy tale. Fondue is not something I would want to do everyday, but for a special holiday like New Year's Eve, it was perfect. Geja's was offering a fixed menu that started with a salad, moved onto a cheese course (with accompanying fruits, breads and veggies for dippin'). The main course was lobster, shrimp and beef with more veggies and potatoes. For dessert they served a chocolate fondue with more fruits, pound cake and marshmallows, along with a complimentary glass of champagne. The place was packed, and after first being seated at an awkward corner table that was practically being consumed by helium 'new years eve' balloons, we were moved to a table directly adjacent to the guitar player. This turned out to be PERFECT, as the husband and wife duo who took turns strumming were a lovely part of the atmosphere as opposed to being too loud or obtrusive.  Our server was fantastic, the food was great and filling and with the low lighting, sizzling pots and melodious guitar music, it made for one romantic evening. One side note: I do have to agree with earlier posts...you do come out of there stinking of oil and in need of a larger pant size.....but it is oh so worth it.
