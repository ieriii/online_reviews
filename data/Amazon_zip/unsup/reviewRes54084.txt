Eat here eat here eat here eat here.I've been to XOCO and Frontera, and I grew up watching Mexico: One Plate At A Time. Which means that I love Rick Bayless a lot, and his food soared above my expectations.Yes, it's a bit pricey, but very filling. Yes, the lines get long--the wait can be unbelievable--but 100% worth it. TOTALLY WORTH THE WAIT. Come with friends so that you can chat while you wait. I'd also come before you're hungry since you'll probably be in the line for a while.I've had both their soups and salads, and they're wonderful. Well-seasoned and very filling. The guac and salsa is also excellent. If you like hot chocolate that leans towards bitter over sweet, then try theirs--if nothing else, it's a unique experience. I'm also usually a fan of stuffed churros over not, but these ones are AMAZING. Try them. You won't regret it. The dipping sauce and ice-cream combo are drool-worthy.If you're looking for a quiet night out or a date-like place, I wouldn't come here. It does get packed. However, you should DEFINITELY come here with some friends.
