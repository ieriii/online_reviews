I liked Mayan Palace in my first visit. The one thing that I was really impressed with, and that I wasn't expecting, was the level of service. It was helpful, friendly, and attentive. Some of the best I've had.  The margaritas were very good, and our dinner options were too. I went with the chimichanga (I seems to always get these when I go for Mexican), and it was definitely tasty.  I'm still continuing my quest to try out all the different mexican restaurants around and decide which is my favorite, but Mayan Palace is in contention, and I'll go back again.
