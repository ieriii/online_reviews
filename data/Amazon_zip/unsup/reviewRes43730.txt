First off my service ruled. Let me say right off. The food was good, but lacked heart. Seemed like the Martha versions of the same culinary knowledge and pretense as the Bongo room, but unfortunately also the lame lack of pure MEANING behind the dishes. Frankly, the 15 year old tejano who gives me onion rings at BK adds more relevance to my meal than M&H did.
