We all have one of those friends, you know, the guy who shows up to a fancy restaurant, like Sprout, wearing shorts and sandals. Who takes pictures of everyone's food trying to capture the beauty of the plating. Who makes sex noises as he luxuriates in his skirt steak and eggs. Who wrestles back plates from servers as they try to clear the table before he's finished with the last bite of chocolate brioche.  Who wants to run up to Dale Levitski, hug him and thank him for the scrumptious food... and maybe even get his photograph taken with the Top Chef star.  Yes, we all have one of those friends... What? You don't? Um, would you like one? Given how I embarrassed my friends at Sprout yesterday, I'm probably going to need a whole new set of dining companions.
