This meal made my top 5 ever. What more can I say? The food and wine were so exquisite that we had the executive chef, Dirk, come out so we could personally thank him. Not only did he come out, he sat at the table and had a few beers with us after the kitchen closed. I can't say enough about this place. AS far as suggestions - order anything and everything on the menu - it's all incredible.
