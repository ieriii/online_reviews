When I think of this place, I think about my old roommate who is from North Carolina and how we loved going to this place together. If we weren't having a breakfast of eggs, sausage, and the whole lot - we'd get the North Carolina crab cakes. Oh they are the bomb, and with the hollandaise sauce dribbled on there... can we say yum-MY?! My roommate would sometimes avoid seafood because she was afraid she might be allergic to it, but she always risked it for these babies. I don't blame her. Of course she felt right at home with the sweet tea that they have here, too. Talk about a haven of southern comfort food right in Chicago!
