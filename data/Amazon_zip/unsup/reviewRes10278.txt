So the beer is good. Pizza is alright. Service leaves something to be desired. People rave about their pizza and I'm a bit of a pizza snob so I had high expectations. We went in the afternoon when they had a special on personal pizzas so my boyfriend and I each got a personal. They were average. Maybe full size pies are a bit better. I'll give it a second shot but if they miss the mark again it's definitely not the trek from east lakeview.
