I'll take Grand Lux over Cheesecake factory any day. Be forewarned though...anytime after 5pm on a weekday or open to close on weekends you're going to be waiting a while. Trust me though...it's worth it. Sandwiches, salads, entrees of pot roast...I've had quite a few things off the menu. Everything is always great, no matter what. Our last trip we split the pot roast, which was very yummy. Runner up to Mom's, I'd say.  And of course, you MUST do dessert here. MUST. Their key lime pie is perfect. Not too tart, not too sweet. My husband loves their beignets. I miss their cherry crisp, it was amazing!
