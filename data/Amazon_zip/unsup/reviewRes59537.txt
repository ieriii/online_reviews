I'm completely baffled by all the good reviews for this restaurant. I've been to this restaurant three times and I never had good food there.I came here last week for dinner and decided that it would be my last time there. We ordered some very standard Korean dishes - jap chae, yukgaejang, and ddukguk, and they were all really disgusting. The jap chae looked like it had been sitting all day. It was very limp and not fresh. The first thing we noticed about the yukgaejang and ddukguk was the rancid smell. I can give a bit of a handicap for the yukgaejang because there are many different ways to make it and most places don't make it well. But the beef obviously was not fresh. The smell was very bad and the soup itself was mediocre at best, though it's hard to really gauge since the smell was so bad.  But the absolute worst had to be the ddukguk, which is one of the simplest soups to make. The smell was terrible, the color was terrible (it was brown instead of clear), and the taste was terrible. I'm not sure what the reason was for the bad smell. My friends thought it was the beef. I'm not sure, but it's curious especially since most people come here for the Korean barbeque. The only reason to even contemplate coming here is because it's open 24 hours. But really, if the food is so bad, then why bother?
