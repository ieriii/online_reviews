Like a college bar, but instead of skimpily dressed coeds there are young professional nerds and New Haven style pizza. This place is beat up, has wires strewn about, the tables rock, and everything higher than an arms reach has a thick coat of dust. At one point not long ago, this place was probably in better shape because the bar appears modern, but no one seems to care because the pizza, super thin, is very tasty and the beer is good. We had a medium Red with Italian sausage and mushrooms (see photo). It came out on cookie sheet and ultimately was enough for 3 people if you have an appetizer too. Our server was indifferent and wasn't incapable of multitasking. She would take one request, go to the computer and then go to another table. The results were poor. Besides that our pizza came out quickly despite the fact the place was jammed on a Thursday night. My guess is that it doesn't take to long to cook since the crust is nearly paper thin. All in all, I will probably be back if I am in the mood for thin pizza, and I can tolerate eating among a herd of nerds. PS The pizza we had tastes good cold or reheated.
