Gauchos, gauchos were are my gauchos! I went to Brazzaz during lunch, hoping to gorge myself on tasty meat. While the meat itself was pretty good (although a little on the salty side), the service was less than desirable. Having been to Fogo de Chau several times, I was expecting a similar experience. At Fogo, the gaucho service was superb.  Whenever you wanted meat the gauchos were always there with their magical wand of deliciously cooked meat. This was not the case at Brazzaz. At one point, I waited for over 5 minutes for a gaucho to come by, and the main waiter had to be asked several times to bring a goucho to our table. When I am craving meat from a Brazilian Steakhouse, I expect a swarm of gauchos to meet my every meat desire. The price was definitely right, they had a summer lunch deal for $19.99. Half the price half the service? Perhaps if the service had been a little faster, I would have given this place 4 stars instead of 3.  Side note: I am hoping this review has the most mentions of "gauchos" in it (currently 9)
