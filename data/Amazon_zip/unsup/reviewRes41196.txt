Went here for a Father's Day family dinner and my family was impressed. They've raised their prices by a dollar, but I still think it's a steal to get a giant bowl of pho for $7.95 or a regular bowl for $6.95. Three of us ordered the big bowl "x-large" pho with all the traditional fixins (tripe, meatballs, tendons) and my dad had a rice noodle dish without the soup. Everyone loved their food. It's also BYOB without corkage fee, so I brought sweet riesling to counteract the delicious burning siracha. Typical Asian mom asked to be seated away from the entrance, asked about all the ingredients, and wanted take home containers for her pho leftovers. She also asked about MSG and they say "very little" is in the food, but they can't take it out, so I'm assuming it's in the broth and sauces. They put up with my family's incessant questions, were fast, cooked us a delicious meal, and charged us about $10 a person. I will be back for sure. Street parking is a breeze in the neighborhood - just go east on Argyle.
