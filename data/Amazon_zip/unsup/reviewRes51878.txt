Fennel seeds I loathe thee(s). You're the reason I don't like sausage on my pizza piece. You're a nuisance. You get stuck in my teeth. Thank heavens for Gino's East. Gino's East's sausage deep dish is pretty serious and, for the first time in a long time, I had sausage on a pizza that didn't remind me how much I hate sausage on a pizza. It is great sausage and there are no fennel seeds in it.
