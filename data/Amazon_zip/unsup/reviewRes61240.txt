I was also with the same group as Adam after the Ovarian Cancer walk and I also found Nick's comment to be in very bad taste. While I'm giving the benefit of the doubt that Nick didn't actually mean to say something like that, he needs to think before he opens his mouth.  I hope he doesn't get a table of people from the AIDS walk!!!
