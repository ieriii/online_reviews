really fantastic pizza. there were 5 of us and we got 5 pizzas - the tomato mozzarella, a special w/prosciutto, the arugula, and the quattro formaggio (there were 2 of those). each pizza was uniquely delicious. i love the crust. i couldn't stop eating my pizza and i didn't even like it as much as the others at the table. a little on the busy side, and inconsistent in terms of how long they tell you you'll be waiting and how long you'll actually wait. that combined with the fact that sometimes you wait a long time for your food and other times it comes out too fast makes this a 3 star review. very friendly service, warm atmosphere. i will be back.
