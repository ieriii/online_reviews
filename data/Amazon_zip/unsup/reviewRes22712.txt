Took out-of-town guests here after a Cubs game last weekend. Superdawgs was packed! We put the top down on my friend's convertible and ordered up some yummy hot dogs and fries and enjoyed the perfect evening weather. Our guests loved this place. I also tried the chocolate malt this time. Yum. Our car hop was a major you know what though......I seem to remember last time I went the people working there were not that friendly either. Oh well...still will go for the experience and Superdawgs!
