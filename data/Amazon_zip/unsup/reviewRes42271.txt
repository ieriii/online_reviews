EH, don't get their already made pizza. It was not good at all. We came about 30 minutes before they were closing so they didn't want to make us a pizza. As we were starving we just settled for their already made pizza and it was super lame. Sad that I couldn't try this pizza place fresh as it has such high reviews on yelp. Oh well.
