Piece is a great venue for eating, drinking and watching sports. Owner Bill Jacobs is amazingly friendly and outgoing to everyone. The location is great by the el, highway and parking is not as bad as it could be in the heart of bucktown. The hidden gem is actually going there for lunch when they offer a great variety of grinder sandwiches and individual pizzas.
