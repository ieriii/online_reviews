Love this place! cant wait to go back. today the bf and i went here after cruising some of the antique shops in ravenswood- which were also amazing and soo much fun! Anyways... we decided to stop in for some pizza and good italian food. we were not disapointed. we walked in and were seated not even 5 minutes after ( we went in around 5pm right before the BIG dinner crowd tot. reccomend going at this time) and were greeted by a very nice waiter. he reccomended somethings and then took our order- we had the "white pasta and added some italian sausage onto it- yummy! the italian iced tea was delish- the bf couldn't stop talking about it- and i had the limonata :) very tasty. we also had the antipasto very good and the meats where the right amount. then the pizza came- wow! i loved it... truly wooden oven cooked... no overwhelming cheese, the sausage was a-mazing. we did deceded that next time we would opt for a pizza with the tomato base. needless to say..we will be making another trip to this fabulous location and resturant. seemed very kid and family friendly... go get your pizza on!
