I went here for lunch on a Friday afternoon. The decor is stylishly done (particularly the stained glass windows at the back). Bartenders were very helpful. I started off with a flight of six or so beers. I particularly liked the Cross of Gold and the two IPAs. The bartender also suggested I'd like the Porter and, to my surprise I did. Lots of great beer choices. And you can take away beer in a growler. The menu is really interesting. I had the Moroccan Chicken Salad, which was totally delicious. Overall, I really like this brewpub. It's nice to drink REAL beer and not be surrounded by lots of televisions.The only down side: They have REALLY small salt and pepper shakers. I felt bad for the bartender whose job it was to refill these.
