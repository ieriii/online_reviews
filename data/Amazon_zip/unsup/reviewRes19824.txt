Had a late Monday night dinner here with a friend. We had the ceviche appetizer, soup for the each of us, and 3 rolls. The ceviche was very flavorful although the sesame "chip" was confusing. I had the niku beef soup with bits of udon. It was good. We tried the volcano, rainbow, and salmon-avocado rolls. The rainbow was the best of the three. The volcano was a little too mushy. The bill was about $60, including tax + tip, for the two of us. The decor is really nice and trendy. The meal was good but not extraordinary.
