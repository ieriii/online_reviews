Unfortunately, Gino's East and Chicago deep dish pizza are dead. It was great up until the mid 1980's, then it began to go downhill. Maybe the retirement of the great pizza maker, a talented black woman, had something to do with it ... or maybe simply the expansion into a chain and the dilution of quality. Today, Gino's pizza is unrecognizable -- and inedible. And the tragedy is, it's never coming back. There aren't even many who remember what it once was. The same thing happened to Uno's. As these places turned from great local institutions into rip-off tourist traps, the magic was lost. As for those ignorant enough to rave about what's left of Gino's, they must be either ringers, or people who love Ragu sauce on dried up corn bread.
