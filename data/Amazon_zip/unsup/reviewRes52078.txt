Gino's East was actually part of the reason we checked into the hotel that we did. The Affinia hotel is adjacent to Gino's East, so when we got to Chicago, we took our bags to the hotel, and went right to Gino's East to eat. We went during the week for lunch so didn't have to worry about the line, but we've dealt with it before. I LOVE this pizza. I don't care if I'm a tourist or not. I did other touristy things in Chicago that didn't live up to the hype that Gino's East did. The small pizza was plenty for two people, but we got salads to start with because the pizza takes awhile to make and we were hungry. I wish there was Gino's East in Kansas, because it's SO good, and yes I know they ship frozen pizzas because I've gotten them before, and they too are awesome. Our favorite is the small cheese and sausage (patty-style of course). Highly recommended to anyone who loves tasty pizza.
