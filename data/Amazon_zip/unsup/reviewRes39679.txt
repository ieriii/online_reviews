I only dined in here twice. I would have to say the first time experience was much better than the second time.  We ate there last nite. My gf picked the place for her b-day dinner. It was extremely busy for a weeknight. The waitstaffs were okay. The food was decent. The portions were definitely getting smaller since I dined last. They never came back to change our grills -- thus, from all the grease burning, we kinda had a bonfire going at the table for quite some time. We had to flag down the busboy to have our 2 grills taken away. The ventilation was not working too well -- I guess being hot out was not helping either. If you guys dont mind the drive, I would recommend Woori Village in Des Plaines (right off Dempster and Milwaukee) and Shin Jung in Mt. Prospect. The latter even offers buffet -- definitely a steal for all the meat eaters out there.
