The food and the location were great. I would recommend everythng we ate, especially the milk-braised pork shoulder.  My only complaint was how loud it was. We were stuck in the back corner and I was at the head of the table there were two people on each side. I could not hear anything that my friends were saying. It was a Wednesday night at 6:00pm and it seemed too early to be that lound.  Everything else was great.
