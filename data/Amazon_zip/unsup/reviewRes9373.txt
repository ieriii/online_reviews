Came for brunch, because I love brunch. Started with some Lithuanian Bacon Buns, courtesy of Dale Levitski's grandma. They reminded me of Chinese Pork Buns (Char Siu Bao), but crispier. Although I am still partial to my buns (har, har), these were tasty and I loved the vanilla butter on the side. Now I'm on a mission to create all kinds of compound butters. Then came the Croque Madame. Eating Buddy got the Steak & Eggs, but only cuz the Duck Hash was "not ready". Shame. We both agreed mine was better. Shared the Tropical French Toast at the end for "dessert". It was good, but nothing to scream about. I needed coffee this particular morning, but their cocktails did look rather delish (I can't believe I turned down bacon flavored vodka either), but if you happen to be in the mood for some morning boozing, definitely get one.
