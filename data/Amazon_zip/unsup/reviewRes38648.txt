Great beer selection, unbelievable build out a couple of years ago expanded this local watering hole into a viable dinner option as well. Great brisket, fries, mussels, etc. Many great esoteric beer offers to compliment one of Andersonville's finest outside spaces. Good staff too. A bit pricy for what you'd go there looking for.
