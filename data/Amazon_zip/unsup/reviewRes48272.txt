That Momma sow sure knows how to get cooked here. I probably had some of the best ribs here as well as mussels. The menu is definitely different then most so don't feel afraid to ask questions. The waitstaff was extremely friendly and very attentive. As for the atmosphere, it was unique, especially with pork art on the walls and you have to love the seating style. Definitely plenty of beers to choose from, some drafts but mostly bottles. The meal might set you back a bill or two but it's definitely worth a excellent dinner. Or you could grab a few people and join in the sharing experience. Believe there will be plenty of food to go around.
