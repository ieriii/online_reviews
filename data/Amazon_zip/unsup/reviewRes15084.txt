A friend of ours recommended this place saying it was like a North Side Gio's, which is an excellent neighborhood Italian Restaurant. We went tonight and we were very disappointed. It's old school, in a bad way. - It has a bad atmosphere - dark, no windows. Hasn't been updated for at least 30 years. - Has a sign that says parking - and it is only for their valet parking. - Food is nothing special - Chicken Marsala was too salty. Nothing was any better than I make at home. - They give you a lot of food, but I would prefer to have good food with reasonable portions.
