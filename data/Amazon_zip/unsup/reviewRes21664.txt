I had a late lunch at Mayan Palace a few days back...having tired of the much closer restaurants near my workplace. I ordered the combination #3...one taco, one enchilada and one chille relleno. I'd say I was impressed with the taco compared to many I've had, the grilled green peppers were especially tasty...though there was way too much lettuce and not enough tomatoes. The enchilada's sauce was a bit richer and smokier than I am used to, I think perhaps more "authentic' maybe even a little mol-ee, but I didn't actually like it. The Chille Relleno was very good. Gooey cheese, tender pepper, crispy and yet flexible batter. I'd say Mayan Palace is better than a lot of taquerias but still, overall, pretty standard.
