Rachel Ray did not invent the chocolate pizza! (as another reviewer said) She sure enjoyed the beer, though. According to the Cheap Trick message board, Rick (the guitar guy) had something similar on his trip to Italy, came home to his restaurant (he is a co-owner) and make up the recipe!!! I love the salads and pizza, and choice of toppings. If I liked beer more that would help, but I liked what I tasted. Friendly atmosphere. Lost a point because the young waitress was unimpressed with Cheap Trick's involvement.
