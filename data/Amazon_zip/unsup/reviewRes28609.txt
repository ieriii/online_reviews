Food: 5 stars Service: 3 stars Value: 3 stars We out-of-towners came in for a Friday lunch with no reservations after seeing Rick Bayless on Top Chef Masters. When we mentioned that we were heading to Frontera with no reservations to our hotel concierge - they laughed in our face... but we still persevered and I'm glad that we did. We were told we would have a 1.5 hour wait for a table, so we started to hover around seats at the bar and wait for people to leave. We lucked out and bet on the right folks - because we were seated 15 minutes later. Not bad since there were only three of us. I would highly recommend this on a weekday, but am guessing this is a no-go on the weekends. Minus some stale chips we got with our chips/salsa/guac - the food was 5 stars all the way. I'm surprised the chips/salsa aren't included given how small the salsa is. We shared the appetizer platter (quesadillas, ceviche, taquitos, guac) - which is huge, the gulf shrimp, and the carne asada ribeye. It was all excellent. Service was kind of dicey. Granted, the restaurant was filled to capacity (as was the bar) - but it took us 30 minutes to get our first round of drinks. After sweating profusely from our 15 block walk in 95 degree weather and intense humidity - we needed something refreshing and every minute seemed like forever. It was even harder to get a second round order of drinks in. Same with the food - this place is just slooooooow. This place is pretty spendy for fancy Mexican food. I think it's worth it - because it tasted great and the restaurant has a great vibe, but I would have been sorely disappointed if I had waited 2 or 3 months to get a reservation. It's the kind of place, where as a tourist - I'm glad I went once to check it off my list, but I'll try another place the next time I'm in Chicago.
