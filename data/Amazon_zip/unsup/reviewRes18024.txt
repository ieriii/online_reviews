I'm a big fan of Rick Bayless. He's charming, cooks great food, and has a real passion for it. I stopped by Xoco to sample some foods and was left disappointed. Ordered the chicken pozole and beef torta. Service was quick but their system took some getting used to (put name down for table, order your food cafe style, sit down and food comes out). The dishes I got were good but my boyfriend summed it up perfectly when midway he realized this was a Bayless establishment. It was good but maybe our expectations were higher. Portions were decent, if not small and prices didn't match the product expected. The drinks were delicious though. However, Rick still has a place in my heart.
