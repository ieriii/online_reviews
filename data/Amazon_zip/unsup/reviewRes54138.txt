Amazing. The only reason this place doesn't get 5 stars is because the wait can get a little ridiculous during peak times. But the food is amazing and the staff is courteous. The Ahogada is by far the best sandwich I've ever had in my life. It's the only thing I get now. Fair warning: you can't get it to go because of the soup component.I noticed someone wrote that the sandwiches aren't large... Uh, I'm not sure how much that guy needs to eat. The Ahoghada is WAY a lot of food. (You should still order the guac though as an appetizer because it's amazing.)Never had the churros yet because I like the hazelnut chocolate chip cookie too much to pass it up.Great food, great service, avoid peak times if you can.
