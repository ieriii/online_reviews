I've had some pretty memorable post hangover meals here...the wait seems like it's going to be a lot longer than it actually is but it's totally worth it. It is not your typical Chicago hot dog joint. Let's see there's the duck fat fries which are excellent. And the specials...one of the most unique and wonderful ones i've had was a spicy crawfish sausage...HOLY crap it was delicious.
