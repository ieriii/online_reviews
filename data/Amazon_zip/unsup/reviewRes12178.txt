::MAKE A RESERVATION::I waited until i had visited this place twice before writing a review. The first time I went with just my boyfriend at around 8 o'clock on a Thursday night. The place was slammed. It was a struggle to get the bartenders attention for a beer, but when i did it was worth the wait. Finally we got seated. The place was noisy. Too noisy for a date with my boyfriend. The pizza was amazing! Even though i'm a Chicagoan,i still really enjoy New Haven style pizza. After that trip we had decided it would be good for a group date. I had also noted to make a reservation next time. My boyfriend and I met a group of four up at Piece for a Thursday night at 7:30. I had forgotten to make a reservation and we all had to wait at the bar for 45 minutes. But it was no problem, the beer here is great! The dysfunction ale is my favorite. After we were seated, we had a a great time with great food. -Make a reservation, its worth it. -Great for groups. -Drink the beer. You're at a micro brewery. why settle for the standard cocktail. -The BBQ chicken bacon red onion pizza is the bomb.
