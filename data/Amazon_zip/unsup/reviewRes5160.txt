yum yum YUM yum YUUMMMM!!! Made a trip to Chicago a while back, and while Purple Pig was no Alinea, it was nonetheless definitely one of the many highlights to my trip. how do I begin? Well a little bit of the place - its really cutely decorated but trust me, if it wasnt for the fact that it is generally way way pack, I probably wouldn't be observing my environment. The wait is ridiculous which makes it a bit irritating but its well worth it and if you can pick up a seat at the bar, I suggest you do that, bc it will go a lot faster than waiting, PLUS the bartenders are SOOO awesome, its quite an entertainment to sit at the bar. Its been a while so I cant remember what we had but the few dishes I would reccommend are: bone marrow - meh - not my favorite - a lot of reviews highlight the bone marrow but maybe im not just a fan of it, it tasted like lard on bread but when does bone marrow not taste like that? But it would've been nice if they paired it with something acidic to cut the fattiness. the pig ear - IS AN ABSOLUTE MUST!!! its cut so thinly, it comes with an sunny side up egg and if you dig that (and im a sucker for sunny side up egg), you pop your yok and eat it with the crispy pig ear and kale - this dish is amaazing! again - try to sit by the bar bc the waiter would reccommend wines to pair with the food and enJOY~!
