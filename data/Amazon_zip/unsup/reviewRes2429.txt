My wife and I were caught in traffic after we arrived at O'Hare and she noticed we were real close to Hot Doug's. As expected we saw the long line that everyone talks about. It took maybe 35 minutes to get in to order. We got 3 dogs. I got the Kiera Knightly and it was really good. My wife got the alligator and she loved it. We split the Jack Daniels special dog. All were really good. After going to a different hot dog stand off of miracle mile, I now know how terrific these dogs were. Don't leave Chicago without trying this place.
