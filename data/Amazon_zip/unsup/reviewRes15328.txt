Bottom Line Up Front: It's like the most recent Indiana Jones movie. You go in expecting it to be exciting and fun... you walk out wanting to kill yourself. Let me start with the positive (trust me this isn't gonna take long). The idea of a speakeasy-type bar in Chicago is historically fitting and very cool. It's like when Mike in the movie Swingers is explaining why every cool bar in LA is so difficult to find and doesn't have a sign... great idea. Everything else sucks. Drinks are like $12. You are in Bucktown, hipster Mecca, I thought those kids were bike messengers and panhandlers because they hated their lawyer parents, how the hell can they afford this overpriced hooch? Some other reviewer described the atmosphere as "ultra sexy and sophisticated." There is frilly lace shit, low hanging chandeliers, and high backed velvet chairs all over the place. The decor made me feel like I was drinking at a French Revolution Re-enactment... OFF WITH THEIR HEADS! Unless you LOVE debutante balls and think that "my super sweet 16" is sophisticated, your reaction to this atmosphere will be that of getting a whiff of a really awesome fart. You're going to think I'm making this next part up, and that's ok, because I wouldn't believe it if you told me either. Our server's name was "Falcon" and he was in a jacket that Ducky from Pretty in Pink wouldn't be caught dead wearing. He could have been the best waiter in the world and I still would have hated him forever. The clientele were just as pretentious and stupid as my least favorite bar, John Barleycorn, they just wore Tom's shoes instead of the square toed variety. Everything about this place sucks.
