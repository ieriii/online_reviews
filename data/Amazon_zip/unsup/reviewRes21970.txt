I can't say enough about this place. I frequent there at least a few times a month. The service is so friendly and fantastic, and the food is amazing and always consistent - much better than other Mexican restaurants in Lincoln Park/Lakeview area. The tortilla soup, ceviche and fish tacos are my favorites. And I always have one of their house margaritas!
