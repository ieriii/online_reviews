Pequods Pizza is the best pizza in the universe hands down. I think I've eaten pizza at every place in Chicago and no one holds a candle to this place. They do this thing where they caramelize their crust and OMG its so good. They are a bit on the pricey side but with most things in life you get what you pay for. I brought my inlaws here when they were visiting from out of town and they agreed. Best pizza ever!!
