This place is fabulous! I read all the Yelp reviews and knew my husband's birthday dinner was going to be good if we went to Fogo de Chao, but I didn't realize just how good! The staff here were amazing: helpful without being annoying, quick, courteous, and informative. I loved learning about Brazilian alcohol from our waiter! I also really liked how all the wait staff helped us and it wasn't just our waiter...it was as if everyone working there just wanted to make sure we had everything we needed. The food was very impressive. The salad bar had all types of vegetables, fruits, cheeses, and pasta salads. The meat was melt in your mouth. The sides were nicely balanced: sweet and salty. Dinner = $49.99 per person
