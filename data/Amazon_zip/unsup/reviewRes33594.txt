$6 bucks + Sultan's = ^ _ ^ Because of the recent collapse of the credit industry, and the rising price of energy crappy fast food now costs MORE than a really tasty, and healthy meal. You have to drive to one of those poly-saturated spots to get your McNasty with Sneeze, or your 5 fats for 5. Or... Or you can come here and get the vegetarian platter! Wow, glad I did. If you have a few more bucks, and like meat the shwarerma and kefta are (like every yelper before me has said) are worth every penny. The salad bar is extensive, and if you ask one of the cute servers nicely you can enjoy good espresso for cheap too. Where it loses that covetous last star is a kinda chaotic interior, its cash-only, and the falafel and rice (with lentils) can be a touch dry... a trip to the olive oil station of the salad bar and a helping of hot sauce fixes that detail however. But seriously, how many of us are thinkin' Arbys when we've had Sultan's?
