Reunited and it feels so good...uhhhhh yeaaaahhhh...Geja's. Being 4 years since the last time I went to Geja's, I feared that this time around would taint the immaculate memory I had of the place. Given the exhorbitant amount of champagne consumed that first night, I thought maybe I was too drunk, that I imagined it was so good. No imagining here. Still the same, cave-like, quintessentially romantic place in Chicago.  I don't know how they get their cheese so gooooooey, but Geja's cheese just really hits the spot. Having tried out a few fondue kits at home, I know it's pretty difficult to get this exact consistency, and fear it's the Le Creuset pot of Geja's that I still can't bring myself forward to spring for. We got the International and I would most likely go for straight shrimp and steak next time as scallops and lobster don't hold up as well when essentially deep-fried. The array of sauces complimented the meats and veggies quite well, with brocolli and dill being my favorites. Chocolate fondue was almost too much but a romantic way to end the meal. We were supposed to meet friends out afterwards but declined because I almost killed the bubby when I nearly busted a button that would have shot him dead. Side note: Only annoying thing here are the uber lovey dovey couples. We were blessed (note the sarcasm) to sit next to a couple of barely legal nerds non-stop feeding each other fondue all night. They'd purposely miss the other's mouth so they can be of service to clean up the mess in whatever way they chose. BARF.  Not to mention they had a ton of pimples and the guy was wearing a Texas flag tie. They prob got the pimples from all that hot oil splattering on their face. Hope to be back SOON!
