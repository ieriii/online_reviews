When my small-town family comes to the city they're always asking me to take them to some place they'd never find back home. Demera is a gray pick for that. The first time we came here together my mother (the most "worldly" of the bunch) stared, hopelessly, when our food came, going the lack of utensils was merely a cruel joke. She quickly got used to the idea of eating with your hands, though, and found she adored Ethiopian food. Since then she and I have been back a few times (even dragging her boyfriend alomg, once). I am always super satisfied by the food.Seriously... Ethiopian food rocks my world. A server did tell me, once, that the enjera that Ethiopian people usually eat is gluten free and not "cut" with wheat like the enjera you usually see at Ethiopian restaurants. She also mentioned if you call a day ahead and request the real stuff they'd be happy to make it for you. I have yet to do this but definitely want to try it sometime.
