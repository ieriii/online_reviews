My first time here I wasn't crazy about it. Long wait for a table and I was on a beef diet so whatever I ordered was boring. I enjoyed my beers though. The next time and subsequent visits afterward I enjoyed it a bunch more. Great value for the spend on burgers, sandwiches and salad. I like the food & presentation, it's got great value, the selection of beers and vibe, although I often feel that in Chicago we could use more ladies, in bar settings. Great to meet up friends at or with a date. I don't think it's the best place for a single person to eat solo, however there are a few seats at the bar where you can sit unrecognized and get away with it. I often feel as though I should be pedaling to Revolution and park my 10 speed amongst the plethora of others. While I feel that way, probably not going to happen. I don't like to show off my wheels. Is it good for kids? You could probably get away with getting in there early on a weekday or weekend. Or if you threw a private party upstairs. Nights, forget about it.
