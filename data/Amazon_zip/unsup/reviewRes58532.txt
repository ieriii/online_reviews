Tonight was the second time I have been to Davanti Enoteca (means in front of the wine bar) and I loved it again.I went with one other girlfriend and we ordered the ragu and polenta appetizer, focaccia bread, squash and bean salad, and then we split a dessert (the carrot cake in a jar). It was delicious and very different. We planned on ordering the swordfish also, but this was plenty of food. Things I loved about it:-Our server was great and pointed out things he likes on the menu. He was also my server the first time I went here and was awesome then too. We ordered something and he told us to skip it because it wasn't that great...... appreciate the honesty and his good tips on what to order.-Loved the music playing...... a great blend of Beatles, Elton John, and other mellow favoritesDon't love:-The fact that the wine appears to be really reasonably priced then they add a $7 corking fee. Let's just call a spade a spade and tell us the total price up front.... I'll still get a bottle of wine. -I don't think they take reservations and it gets pretty busy even on a random Wednesday night. Space at the bar to wait is crowded.  Overall, nice place, fun atmosphere, excellent food, in a cute stretch of Taylor Street. Check it out!
