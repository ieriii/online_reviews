Food and table service are exceptional. Host/Hostess is an issue. We had a reservation, our table was wide open, the hostess told us it would be a few minutes, promptly went and stood by the bar with her arms crossed literally standing doing nothing for 5-10 minutes, walked backed to us and seated us at the wide open table. In our opinion, she just wanted to show her authority and make us wait. She ruined the experience. I would recommend the restaurant for the food but the service at the hostess stand was awful.
