Came to Chicago on a weekend trip and Gino's was recommended to a group of us for good Chicago style pizza. I've had other "Chicago" pizza, but never the real thing, so I was excited to try it. My party of 4 was seated promptly and got our order quickly. The pizza takes an hour, so we got mozz sticks while we waited. They were basic frozen (and one that came to us still was!) mozzarella sticks. When our pizza finally came the server cut it and dished it out for us. We had half supreme and half sausage (patty). I loved the sausage and the sauce. The only thing I wasn't crazy about is the crust. It was hard and bland. Even sopping up extra sauce didn't help it. This wasn't a bad introduction to Chicago style pizza for me, but I'll go elsewhere next time.
