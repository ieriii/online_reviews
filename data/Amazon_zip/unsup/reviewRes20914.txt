The atmosphere here is super hip and modern...perhaps that's what you pay for? I was rather disappointed in their sushi rolls. I had heard good things and was sorely disappointed at how much I paid for rolls that really weren't all too good.... I'm not up on my Wicker Park restaurants, so maybe this is the go-to sushi place in WP...but it rates pretty darn low in my book.
