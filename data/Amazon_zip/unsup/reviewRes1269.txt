There is very little to add to the reviews here. Hot Doug's is an awesome place to go try some crazy new (or regular) sausage dog for lunch...with duck fat fries as an option on Fridays and Saturdays. The line-ups go well out the door at lunch time, so while they manage to move everyone through quite well, don't be in a huge rush here. Doug is generally there, taking orders and being highly personable. His applying gourmet standards to hot dogs and sausages has been a huge hit, and I'm sure it will continue to remain a Chicago destination for years to come.
