Dee-licious Greek food! I'm not Greek, but I have close friends (who are excellent cooks) who are from Greece and they recommended this place for lunch. Excellent lemon chicken soup and even better artopitas! I had the tiropita (egg & cheese stuffed pastry) and my friend had the chicken artichoke artopita. They had flaky, buttery pastry crusts with delicious cheesy fillings! The potato salad (side) was pretty good too! I will definitely be back!
