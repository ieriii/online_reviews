i went here last year and somehow completely forgot about it until today.. i really don't know how this happened considering how much i loved eating here when i went. all the meats i tried were very good.. very tender and flavorful. and the sides were just as delicious (the cheese bread/puffs were really addictive)! we had creme brulee for dessert (mmm) and some sort of chocolate cake that was too rich for me (i'm not big on chocolate). i'm really glad i remembered this place cause i really think i need to go back.
