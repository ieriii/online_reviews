last night we thought we'd stop in just for a drink and a small plate or two. we weren't that hungry yet and thought we'd wait to eat dinner until later. max and i took a seat at the bar. we ordered 2 beers and had the pork rinds and hamachi crudo. both were great and immediately had us wanting more. so we ditched our plans to eat a full dinner later and decided to just order more food here. like i mentioned, we weren't that hungry so we just had the pork rillettes with cherries and the asparagus with apricots. oh wow. these 2 dishes were wonderful. and definitely two of our favorites we've had here. the rillettes went perfectly with the cherries and the glaze. it was also a pretty decent sized dish. the asparagus was amazing as well. highly recommend. service was great as usual as is the atmosphere. the publican once again, did not disappoint.
