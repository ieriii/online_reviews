We ordered so much food between 3 ladies and the bill came out to $112! Not bad for... Shrimp ceviche, two sushi(maki) rolls, half dozen of oysters (sampler), cocktail shrimp, and meat platter. Everything was so good. We sadly did not have room for any desert. Their desert menu is extensive -- including homemade ice cream! Mmm.. One downfall since I prefer to order a bunch of things at once and share amongst my friends... the table was too small for that.
