have lived down the street of this place for nearly six months before I finally tried it. I have to say I was pretty pleased with the result. I got the Dracula's Revenge along with the Cheese Curds. I have to say the Cheese curds stole the show, I went to college in Wisconsin for 4 years and these top them all. The burger was solid but does have room for improvement. I don't know exactly what it is,but there is something about the toppings that tasted a bit bland. This can easily be changed I think to make the burger taste better. I also had the "WEIHENSTEPHANER ORIGINAL" which is a great German beer. I will def be back at this place and enjoy coming here especially that it's right down the street
