FAVORITE patio in the downtown area! Best to go on a weeknight.. I went with a friend on a Monday night and it was full enough to not feel awkward, but not so crowded that we had the undivided attention of our bartender. Really great wine list and flights, the cocktails looked amazing (I will try these next time I go there- I'm more of a wine girl anyways), and decent prices, especially for the downtown area. Also our bartender, a dark-haired Asian American gentleman, was by far one of the nicest I've come across in a long time. :)
