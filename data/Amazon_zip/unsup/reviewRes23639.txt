The Tony's Three Chili's Chicken is DELICIOUS. I was a little disappointed in the Smoked Tea Duck, probably cause it reminded me of early grey tea, which is the only tea I can't stand. Overall, I recommend checking this place out. Don't be too creeped out by the giant panda images on the wall, lol.
