Don't work here if you're prone to dropping a tall stack of plates. The cute little waitress dropped a stack, and the douche of a manager wouldn't let her live it down. I'd like to slide a plate up his ass and then yell at him when he pooped it out. Other than plate dropping, this place is ok. I didn't have the pizza. I had a meatball sub which was fine. I likely wouldn't order it again. My afternoon lunch was made by the fact that my awesome boyfriend had his hand on my leg while we are eating. I'm easy. What more can I say?
