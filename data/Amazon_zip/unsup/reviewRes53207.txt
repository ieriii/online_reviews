Did I eat the same food as everyone else? Not worth the reservations and long wait. A group of 4 of us went based solely on the reviews and ordered 4 different dishes. Each one was unoriginal, bland and a more expensive version of a cheap Mexican tacqueria. Where was the raved authentic Cuban food? The only good part was the goat cheese empanada appetizer. We had much better food the day before up the street a few blocks at the small 'Conoce Mi Panama' restaurant. There is MUCH better Cuban food in this city.
