Don't even worry about the food, it's the beer you want - especially the beer cocktails. I could drink Midwestern Snakebites all day long, though they have one with Daisy Cutter from the Half Acre Brewery across the street that would also bring me back. The burger selections are pretty varied, and they are decent. I had the Big Texan, and I couldn't complain. It's not the best I've had in the City, but it can definitely stand on its own merits. Plus, you can pretty much put whatever you want on your fries - and that I did enjoy. Their homemade ketchup is decent, though the truffle oil was the best part. My favorite part about the place is that it is pretty laid back. They had some sort of art on the walls that I can only describe as Postmodern Cowboy meets Junkyard. That being said, it was pretty cool and probably would cost me two months worth of mortgage payments. But it definitely adds.
