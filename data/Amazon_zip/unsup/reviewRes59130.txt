I went into this establishment for the first time on a Wednesday morning after rush hour, thinking at that particular time of day on a weekday, I wouldn't have to deal with the crowds which pack the place on the weekends. And I was right. I was seated immediately and eventually greeted by a very kind and polite waitress. Then it went downhill.I ordered pancakes and corned beef hash--simple breakfast fare. After sitting there for 30 minutes and seeing other groups and individuals who arrived after I did get served before I did, I proceeded to ask the waitress to please bring me a to-go box and my bill, trying to hint that it was taking unusually long. I should have had my food and already eaten half of it, by then. I had an important day long event to get to across town that I was going to be late for (with an empty stomach).After a few more minutes of waiting for my food and a to-go box, I walked over to the counter with my receipt and asked a waitress to not even bring it out to my table, just pack the order to go. And then another wait...apparently, my order was overlooked, which I had figured was the case, but wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt (which is hard to do when someone who walks in after you and orders almost exactly the same thing, gets their food before you). Eventually I got my food, paid for it, and left not really upset, but definitely vowing that my first time in Yolk would be my last time. After another 30-minute ride on the Red Line, I was finally able to scarf down my cold pancakes and corned beef hash. I'd like to think of myself as a reasonable person, though, and judging by the generally positive reviews on this place, I get the feeling my experience was just an isolated incident. I may revisit Yolk, but just at a different location.
