What's with the horrible art on the walls behind the massive booths? i feel like they are hanging up elementary school art in such a dark place. That was an eyesore. The Rueben Sandwich (vegan) is amazing. Closer to my place than Handlebar but the prices are pretty high but worth it if it's a once every other month expense. The beer is good. Tried a few different tasty (high percentage of alcohol & high priced) dark beers and ended up walking home crooked. a few weeks later I went there for brunch and was seated right away. Got the breakfast vegan special of fried polenta and some greens. Polenta was the only thing worth on that plate but the coffee was horrible. Made a sad face every time i put it in my hungover body. you'd probably find me at Handlebar sipping a beer on their patio once it gets warm out than hanging around at this place. I feel like I don't belong in this place. I feel like I am hanging around a bunch of Wrigleyville folks. I didn't move there for a reason. But the staff is ALWAYS generous and kind.
