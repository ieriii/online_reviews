Last night I went to Tru for my 30th birthday...forever I've been curious about this place after hearing about the impeccable service you receive, and I wasn't disappointed. First of all, after we were seated, I received a menu that read "Happy Birthday Gina!" which I thought was awesome (yes, I am easily amused, little things like a personalized menu will make me get excited). The wine list was extensive....and definitely skewed to the expensive 'untouchable' side (ie $500+ per bottle), but had some options on there that we common folk can stomach a little better ($35-$80 per bottle), or you could order single glasses. After choosing the wine selection we were asked if we preferred a white or a black napkin - having worn a black skirt I happily accepted the black napkin to avoid that nasty white fuzz you get...amazing! (again, easily impressed).  As for the meal, it was superb - I started with scallops that were topped with a crunchy topping with caviar on top, and as a main course had some delicious venison (I've only ever had it once before in my life, and it's pivotal to have it prepared correctly - so this was definitely the place to get it!). For desert I had an apple crisp with apple sorbet - and the waitress sent out a special St. Patrick's birthday dessert for my birthday, which was also fantastic. Finally, (at this point I was ready to pop!) they roll around a little cart with various candies and treats that you can pick from (ie handmade butterscotch lollipops, little chocolate bon bons etc).  The service is absolutely impeccable - these people really know what they are doing, which I suppose is important if you're planning on dropping some cash on a nice dinner. The atmosphere definitely skews to the older crowd, and was a little 'stuffy' in terms of the low music and extreme formality - however, it was overall a fantastic experience!
