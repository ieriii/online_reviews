Oh, WHY did I eat so much here?! I felt like I got a food baby because there were so many yummy options, and it was my first Brazilian steakhouse experience. The chicken wrapped with bacon was amazing, as well as the garlic steak. They have a nice little salad bar as well. The bf and I had a 2 for 1 coupon, but one dinner alone is still really expensive, especially when you each have a drink.
