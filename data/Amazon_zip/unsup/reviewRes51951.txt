For the record I love pizza. Hot or cold, veggie or meat lovers, deep dish or thin slice.... I love pizza. While in Chicago I had a chance to try two different restaurants, Gino's and Lou Malnati;s.. and while I thought Gino's was outstanding and would go there again, I prefer Lou Malnati's deep dish pizza. That's not to say that Gino's is chopped liver though, it's still damn good pizza. We ordered the meaty legend (thank you very much) and the east supreme. The meaty legend was awesome and lived up to its name. Topping selection on this pizza was excellent. The supreme could good, but not great. I felt there wasn't enough green peppers or mushrooms on the pizza. In the end I feel that people when people ask which is the best chicago pizza, you will get 4 or 5 different answers. The real solution is to try em all!
