I was not impressed by this place at all. I had a few friends in town and we wanted Mexican food after the Air & Water show. I looked on Yelp for a place close to my house and this was only a block away and favorably reviewed. We gave it a shot thinking it would be a little nicer than where we normally go, El Taco Loco a few doors down. First off when we walked in there were only two tables that could hold larger parties (there was 5 of us). One of the larger tables was being used by two cops and the other by a couple and their baby who was in the stroller. We sat at two taller tables which were divided by a half wall. No biggie I guess. Anyway, the menu was extensive and it was definitely cheap for a sit-down Mexican restaurant. Of course you have to pay extra for everything like cheese and sour cream which may or may not be added to your meal and then you may be charged for it regardless. They will tell you it is in there even though you have dug through your entire burrito and have not found one trace of cheese or avocado. This happened to both people who ordered the "extras". The free chips and salsa were good though. The guacamole was also too expensive for the amount you get. I had a vegetarian combo and everything was very bland. Everyone felt the same way except for one friend who said her steak and stuffed pepper combo was really good. The margarita I had was ok. A little too strong and it was obviously made with very cheap tequila. Not bad for $5 though. The strawberry one my friend had was better. The service also seemed slow and unresponsive even though the place was mostly empty. We should have stuck with El Taco Loco.
