I do have quite the penchant for Cuban cuisine. So when I found out through the yelp grapevine that there was going to be another 90 miles opening, my stomach startled rumbling in excitement.  The Armitage location is closer to my home and larger in size. The staff is just as warm and welcoming as the original spot. The food, the food is just as tasty as well. I realize that I do need to start branching out. A typical meal here for me includes the media noche sandwich, sweet plantains and a chorizo and goat cheese empanada. Oh and a cafe con leche, I gotta have one of those. But there are so many other tasty sounding things on the menu, I guess I will just have to come here again and again. Which of course I have no problem with at all.
