If you're in Chicago for a conference and someone is paying for your room, it's very hard to find things to complain about. If you're paying for this room by yourself, then I'm sure you'll find more to complain about.  As far as the room being bland and boring...it's a hotel room. Most of them are. If there were dancing monkeys in every hotel room throughout the world and one didn't have a dancing monkey, then I'd be disappointed. (no monkeys were harmed in the writing of this review, by the way). I also chose the green option and do not see the points...so shame on them. Some staff was very friendly and helpful, while others didn't know which way was up. This did not make my boss happy. I didn't get any other food but if you are expecting a full Starbucks in the lobby, you're going to be disappointed. It is severely lacking in options as well as hours open, but it does have the choice of cold cereal with milk if you are looking after your carb consumption. For some reason, my room and/or alarm clock was haunted as it kept going off EVERY NIGHT at different times. Don't they check that to make sure it's off when they turn over the room- especially since many people nowadays (such as myself) use their phones as their alarm clock? The location to the John Hancock building can't be beat. Sadly, many other things can. Not bad, but not the best I've had.
