this place rocks!! came here for a bachelorette party in chicago!! 10 ladies, lookin' hot, lookin' hungry, and ready to drink the night away! the whole group chose to experience the harvest table without the meats. there are men that carry meat on sticks like the brazillian bbq places do. but we opted for the buffett only. it was very satisfying. different cheeses, soups, veggies, eggs benedict, salads, breads, etc. etc. we also ordered 2 bottle of wine to share. the atmosphere here is awesome. we sat right by the fireplace on the bar stools. the wait staff is very attentive and helpful in regards to advice on ordering. the experience here is one of a kind. i highly recommend!
