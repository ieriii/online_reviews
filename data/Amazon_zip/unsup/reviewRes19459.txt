Busy place on a weeknight so I would recommend making reservations. I mean it was packed on a Wednesday night and that should tell you something about a place. Overall the food was great and the prices matched. Our server was non-obtrusive and very knowledgeable on the cuisine. Although the one thing that peeved me was the specials blurb that seemed to last about 5 minutes and then I didn't really remember anything he had said. I think having them printed out would be nice but then again I don't run a restaurant. We started out with sesame crusted scallops and the wasabi shumai for appetizers. Looking back I would have went with the scallop teriyaki instead because the sesame seeds were kind of a distraction. They were just gritty in the mouth and provided no flavor (and then worry about black seeds stuck in your teeth). So of course we got the White Dragon and Po' Boy maki. That was pretty much decided before we got there. As my lady friend has been here several times. I would certainly recommend ending the meal with mochi. A cheap bottle of wine and a 60 dollar tab made for a nice evening out with some superior sushi.
