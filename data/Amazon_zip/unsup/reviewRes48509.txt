It's all about the swine! Paintings of big fat pigs, pigs on the napkins, pigs of all sorts on the menu. On a recent visit to my childhood hometown of Chicago, I was lucky enough to score reservations at Publican. What a treat! Large open (but very loud!) dining room with long tables where you're literally sitting next to/in between over diners - probably not the best for great catch up conversation. For that reason I'm taking a star away. There are private "pens" for tables of 4 which surround the dining room, and may be more conducive to conversations. That being said, service was excellent and everything on the menu was fantastic! Go with a group and order up to share! Spicy pork rinds, pomme frites with egg, pork belly, duck hearts ("Are those ventricles?! Cool!"), sweetbreads, spinach with pine nuts and mozarella (yes, there are veggie options)... The menu's ever changing! Great wine and beer list to complement your fat-filled meal. Great service that delivers. Mmmmmmmm......
