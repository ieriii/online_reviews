Think of this as pizza hut on performance enhancers. This is not your typical Chicago deep dish...it's not stuffed and the crust is extra thick. The pizza is a amazing...with the little carmalized cheese..whooff. They use quality ingrediants such as fresh mushrooms as opposed to canned, big pieces of fresh made ital. suasage, etc.  reasonably priced for what you get. The delievery takes for ever.
