Alright first off if you're not willing to wait for a little for a place this good than you shouldn't be going to places like this anyways. Seriously, just go to G-Nug and get out of here. Alright so this place is awesome. It's insanely loud. Seriously it gets pretty ridiculous. However, the food and service are top shelf and the pancakes are out of this world. Same with french toast and all that jazz. I had these amazing Vanilla Bean Nutella Chocolate pancakes that just about sent me to another world they were so good. It's the kind of food that is so good and looks so good you take a picture of it. This place is another one of those, super hip, super busy, super loud, sit 10 inches from the next table type of places, so be forewarned. But then again as listed above if you are the type of person that comes to these places you should be fine with that by now :)
