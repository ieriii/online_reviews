Went here for the first time tonight and had a lot of fun! A few things to note: -- The restaurant is small and mostly communal seating. It can be REALLY snug in that seating too and people can be big space hogs but the seats are easy to move in/out of once you squeeze in so that's a plus -- Plates are very small (which is a little shocking considering the price) so definitely get 2-4 to share. My group of three got 6 plates plus dessert and we were satisfied without feeling full -- The wine is really good but bottles are also pricey. We got the cheapest one...at $42. Yes, it was good but pricey Despite these notes, I was very happy with my food. The bone marrow was very good (be sure to add the sea salt and greens) and the pork shoulder with mashed potatoes was the best dish we had all night. The pig ear was also delish and the mussels were a really nice too. The only food item we had that was a little disappointing was the prosciutto balls. They were tasty but very salty and just not as memorable as the other items. Dessert: you HAVE to get the Sicilian Iris brioche. It is warm and delicious. We all raved about it. We also got the Sfogliatelle Napoletane but it was tough and kind of cakey, which my friend was very disappointed in. Really, overall I was very happy with my meal and would definitely go back. But beware, I doubt they can accommodate big groups.
