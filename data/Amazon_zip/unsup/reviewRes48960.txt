We arrived on Monday night at 9p to a packed restaurant and were seated right away at a table for two by the window. A gastropub style restaurant in beer hall decor and ambience. We thoroughly enjoyed 2 orders of pork rinds, fries cooked in duck fat and served with an aioli, 2 orders of Lake Erie perch fry, pork country ribs, waffle with pear and honey butter, dark chocolate torte and a few beers. Everything was wonderful! Best meal while visiting Chicago.
