I'm on a mission to discover the best steak tostadas in the city. Well, I can scratch Mayan Palace off the list.  The steak tostadas were short on flavor. They left me wondering where the seasoning was. They were average at best. The meat seemed a little dry as well. I was a fan of the rice and beans though. The rice was a bit on the fluffy side and not dry.  The 1/2 price pitchers of house margaritas are a great deal.  At first I didn't think they were all that strong, until I had to Trixie trot (you know, the half run/half walk in a dress and wedge heeled sandals) to catch my bus. The margaritas were tasty and didn't have that syrupy taste to them like at other places.  Overall, I'd come back for the deal on the margaritas, but that's about it.
