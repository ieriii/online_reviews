The reputation this place has is well deserved!!!! I saw they were apart of Yahoo's Best Chicken in America article and my buddy An raves about this place so it was a must that I try! Sort of small, but definitely bigger than what it looks like from the outside I have been twice thus far and each time my life has been changed (not really) The first time around I tried the Crisp BBQ and its just as sweet as it is spicy. I got it as a combo which came with fries and a drink of my choice. A couple walked in and asked if the chicken was good. I told them to look at my plate and if they sat next to me it would not be a pretty site. They gladly rushed to get their order. The next time around, I got the Seoul Sassy...Very sweet and delicious!!! I broke those wings off something proper-like (Dr. Dre - "Chronic" terminology). Seating is basically sit where there is space available. Everyone has to be comfortable sitting across from strangers when coming here...not a bad thing. If you like wings, definitely a must try!
