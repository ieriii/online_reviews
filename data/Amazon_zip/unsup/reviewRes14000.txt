Dear Lord! like I needed another place to stuff my face while I am trying to get healthier. This place is awesome! I have been here twice and My boy friend ( big beer enthusiast) pretty much ordered the entire left side of the menu as well as several beers. BEERZ I have the Bottom up Belgian Wit , and as far as that style goes it was good but not special. The boy had several hoppier brews that i cannot re-call but he seemed pleased with them. Foodz We started with the Cheddar ale soup It was good( beer- good, Cheese - good, beer and cheese great!) Then we also decided that we wanted to try the mussels we chose the Hard Cider, blue cheese, leek, fuji apple variety and ended up very pleased, i think I t could have used more blue cheese to balance out the sweetness of the cider but it was good. I had the Smoked & Grilled Tofu sandwich with Baby spinach, beer onion, sun-dried tomato spread I loved it! smoking does a lot to add depth and flavor to tofu and I would not hesitate to get this again. My dining partner got the tempeh Reuben and he liked it just so so, we have both had better veggie Reuben's. We actually had room for desert which was a special of the day and it was a cake with Bourbon cherries! so very good. The second time we went we both got fish and chips and the were pretty good as far as that goes. We also had a very attentive server! so a plus all the way around.
