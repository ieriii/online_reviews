After being blessed by Pastor James Ford's visit to Moody Church last Sunday, Karen and I decided to have Italian at Sabatino's. We have both never been before. It was such a pleasure to drive into the empty parking lot, I didn't know it was for valet parking and felt funny giving my key to the guy to park it. If I'd known, I would have just parked in the vacant spaces on the street in front of the restaurant the lot was vacant. The parking attendant seemed excited since had to be bored sitting in his shed on one of the hottest days of the year. Yet he was a very cordial fellow. We walk into this dark place, which took time for our eyes to adjust coming from the bright afternoon sun. Again, awkwardness -- it seemed too intimate for a casual Sunday lunch. We were served with a yummy serving of complimentary pizza bread and a loaf of fresh Italian bread. Karen had a huge serving of shrimp fettuccine--the "best" she had ever had, that came with a soup and salad. She had some kind of cream spinach soup that she also couldn't stop raving about. I had the Cesar salad and the appetizer of asparagus bottoms topped with lobster chunks which was very flavorful with a delicious delicate sauce. We were pretty pleased with our food choices. Our waitress was personable, very enthusiastic and informative about the food and the restaurant. All the servers were down-to-earth yet proper. Next time I'd probably order takeout or dine in with someone of the opposite sex :)
