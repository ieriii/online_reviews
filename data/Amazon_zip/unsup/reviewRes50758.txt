Big Jones is to Souther cuisine what Marigold is to Indian - meaning that it stays true to the core flavors of the culinary traditions but tightens up the execution of the dish so the preparation is more deliberate. All of us at the table shared our entres and each were delicious. The service, which I had heard could be sketchy, was solid enough for a busy Saturday night. The southern inspired cocktails are fun and tasty. Can't wait to go back.
