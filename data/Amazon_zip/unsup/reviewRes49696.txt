For every awful, overpriced place I go to in Chicago, it is met with a delicious, reasonable, incredible one! Las Tablas Lakeview is one of those incredible few! I have only been here on weeknights. With groups of 2-10 I never have a problem getting seated immediately. This weeknight habit is mostly to take advantage of the fabulous drink specials. Such as- No corking fee. Love. Pitcher of Sangria for half price Monday!- Yes, please! I always order the same thing, because it is SO good. The *skirt steak, Entrana, medium served with yucca, plantain and potato. Get one of these people! It's good enough that you'll want your own, but I'm pretty sure it's meant to serve two! It's always strange to me watching people here order one per person like they're at Friday's. This *skirt steak is by far the best thing on the menu. The marinade and seasonings it is treated with are good enough that it is a stand alone, no need for the sauces. They are good if you would like though. I have tried the *paella as well and it was pretty good. It's nice to have this option for vegetarian friends while you're gnawing on a steak. As sides I get the *salad, *rice, and *beans. They are standard fare. Some places can even mess up a salad though and Las Tables doesn't. Don't skip dessert! The *coffee here is absolutely to die for. Our waiter told us that Macondo across the street sells it in bean form and we WILL be buying it. What's best though, is drinking the coffee while eating the *tres leches cake. Absolutely sweet, creamy, balanced. I couldn't ask for more. Few things complement each other this well in the world. What did this all cost? Under $40. Take that, my favorite ever, Chophouse! Steak dinner with dessert... and I happened to have my $35 Groupon. Fantastic. The service could afford to be a little more attentive. Regardless though, this will remain a favorite for the flavor to value factor alone! I'm rounding up to 5 stars! Delicious!
