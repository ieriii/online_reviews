Great hot...errr, I mean SuperDawgs. Definitely giving Vienna hot dogs a run for their money. Gotta love the retro feel of the place, complete with car hop service right to your car window - just like the old days. Fries are excellent, too. My one complaint is the way they stuff that large hot dog plus the fries into a little box. That squishes everything and makes the hot dog - ok, SuperDawg - hard to take out of the box and eat. Grab a ton of napkins 'cause it gets messy. Still, it's worth the trip and the mess.
