I've had some very good food at Big Jones - the Fried Chicken Salad was my all time lunch favorite, and I miss it sorely. But the last couple of trips have turned me off. Service is fine, no complaints there. Our server even turned the air conditioning down a notch when we complained about the cold yesterday. But the noise level seems to be permanently dialed into the place. The music system is blasting out good music at almost painful levels. On a previous visit my wife and I walked in, felt the noise, and walked out. Their shrimp burger is a hands-down favorite of my wife. I've tasted it and it's very good. I just had to go with the fried green tomatoes, having been raised on them, and decided to try the chicken and dumplings. Folks, we didn't slice the tomatoes half an inch thick and then fry them until the cornmeal was crunchy. About a quarter inch, dredged in flour and corn meal, and fried just long enough to meld the flavors of the tomato with the breading. The acidity of all that green tomato completely overpowered the sweetness of the corn meal. But I'm not going to tell Chef Paul how to cook his food. Just ain't gonna order that again. On to the chicken and dumplings. The menu advertised it as having butter beans - another staple in my Kentucky household. These were undercooked Lima beans. Shame on these guys for trying to pull a switch like that. The chicken was very tender but had that grainy texture so much organic chicken has these days. The dumplings were tough, shapeless (and tasteless) lumps of boiled unleavened dough. The gravy was really just broth, and extremely salty. The crowning touch: the dish arrived covered in cracked black pepper. I love black pepper but this was WAY over the top. Corn bread, as usual, was great. Love the stuff. Just can't make a meal off it. I really want to like this restaurant but have to say the kitchen staff is apparently tone deaf when it comes to putting flavors together in an appetizing package.
