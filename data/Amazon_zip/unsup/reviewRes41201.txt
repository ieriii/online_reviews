When I crave asian food with out the post greasy food coma, I go here. I don't even need to look at the menu anymore. I just get the 7, 12, and 40. Its the spring roll, savory crepe, and pho noodle respectively. Its the perfect amount for two people.  The spring rolls were made to order filled with perfectly sliced meats, rolled with herbs and lettuce, and decorated with eye pleasing shrimp. The crepe was by far the show stealer. Always my favorite. Its crispy, light, and comes with -yes-MORE VEGGIES! I'm not a health nut by any means. But just a FYI, this crepe is slightly fried, made with coconut milk, and stuffed with more shrimp and pork belly. And last but not least, the pho broth is pretty darn good and being southeast asian, that says a lot. Its not perfect, but the best pho I've had in Chicago since I've moved here. I have pretty high standards for pho broth, but my friend's mom makes a killer pho... and maybe thats not fair to Tank Noodle. They're closed on Wednesdays so be sure to remember that. They're open early, and they close late. And to top it off, BYOB, it doesn't get much better than that.
