Crushed velvet handrails - need I say more?!! This place blew my mind. I filmed a wedding here last weekend so needless to say I saw every aspect of this building, at all times of the day for 14 hours straight. If you're thinking of getting married here, DO IT. I truly have never seen a more gorgeous wedding - yes expensive but WORTH IT. I ate breakfast at the smaller (nonaligned) restaurant here and I was not impressed. The staff seemed to have been working here since the building was build but their attitudes were less than great. I also did get the last 15 minutes of the buffet but still, not impressed. The food for the wedding however was RIDICULOUS, I'm assuming they didn't bring in their own chef but who knows, I could be wrong. I wish I could be more help in the food area, but the building itself is incredible. Having passed this place over a hundred times on Lake Shore Drive and never have gone it, I was impressed. The Drake keeps the old feel of a vintage Chicago hotel while beaming with style and class of the upper social standings of millionaires. I felt...regal :)
