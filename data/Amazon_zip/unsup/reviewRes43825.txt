Favorite breakfast spot in Chicago. The salmon on a wheat bagel is amazing and the granola is incredible. The staff is always friendly regardless of how early they have to be there every morning. They kick out the jams pretty well to from their iPods. I had a great breakfast rocking out to Queen and George Michael one morning. The pancakes are wonderful. Great coffee as well.
