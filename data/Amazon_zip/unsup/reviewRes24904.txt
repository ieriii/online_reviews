Blech. Just walking in the door you feel like you're stepping into a vat of oil. The place REEKS of oil, and 1975. They should hand out polyester lounge suits at the door - at least then you wouldn't stink when you left. If you equate romance with being crammed side by side with other couples into a dimly lit space with smoking oil stink working its way into every fiber of your clothing and hair, while being serenaded by wandering minstrels 2 feet from the side of your head, then by all means, have at it. I'm a huge cheese fondue fan, and have made classic fondue many times, and the cheese fondue here isn't anything to write home about, but on the other hand its cheese fondue, which is great way to start any meal, which is what keeps this place from one star. The various meats for cooking in the oil is just too oily, and its so dark its impossible to tell if something is cooked well or not... which might add to the intestinal discomfort you inevitably feel afterwards. Also, drinking what amounts to a glass of castor oil has a tendency to lube up the ol' intestinal tract. The chocolate fondue at the end is so-so, but since my girlfriend is a chocolatier I've been spoiled by good stuff, so low quality melted chocolate doesn't do much for me. I'm really suprised by how many people seem to like this place, noone I know does. I would never recommend this for a romantic dinner, and for the money there are literally hundreds of places in Chicago that would be better destinations. Maybe if you wanted to break up with someone, or secretly despised them this would be a good place to go.
