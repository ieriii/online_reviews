We went for brunch. Beermosa, duck hash, crab benedict, homemade sausage. Does it get any better than that? I'm telling you it doesn't. :) Right off the Logan Blue Line, L&E is a great addition to the neighborhood. We enjoyed our meal, ate at the bar because all the tables were full. Great & friendly staff and service. We really enjoyed ourselves!! I definitely want to come back and try some of the other dishes on the menu. It looks so fantastic. The bar is great, they have a great drink selection. I would go a bit earlier in the day or night because waiting for a table seems to be an issue. We really liked the place and will be back again and again and again! :)
