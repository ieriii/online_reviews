Let me start this review and say that I LOVE the food here. The ropa vieja is especially delicious--very tender compared to the other Cuban restaurants in that area. If a review was based on food only, I'd give it an enthusiastic five stars. However, I have to warn people not to bring a group here. I reserved a table here about three weeks in advance of a group outing. We arrived and the table had a messy scattering of forks and a few random glasses. We had to practically beg to get silverware and wine glasses for the whole party. We also had to share menus. The waiter pretty much avoided our table most of the night. It took over an hour to get our appetizers and our entrees arrived about an hour and fifteen minutes after we had ordered them. We had to bolt our food and get out for the next thing we were doing.They just didn't seem to have the capacity, or frankly, the desire to do a good job for our group.In sum, go if you have a party of one or two. Avoid if you have a group larger than that.
