huh? all you can eat brazilian bbq? what? unbelievable salad bar? huh? i can't breath from eating all the delicious med-rare meats?  Oh wow, it is THE brazillian bbq to go in chicago. Let us start with the salad bar, Proscitto, protebello mushroom salad, acrobat lady at the wine cellar, goat cheese, seared tuna, grilled jalapenos, permesian cheese from the wheel, and all the meat you can handle.... let me think....... oh yeah, it's FU@K!#G great.  I would pass on the sausage and turkey because to me it was little too salty but overall experience was incredible. Perfectly cooked meat, (nice and bloody) awesome salad bar, incredible wine collection.. what can a person say to top that?  It help being with the awesome company I was with, but seriously, i'm so going there next weekend and I will make sure I will be prepared for this this time. great friends, great meat and great salad bar... you CAN NOT beat it. try it and you will fall in love. *****UPDATE***** They give 15% military discount.
