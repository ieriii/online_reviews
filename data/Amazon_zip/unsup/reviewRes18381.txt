My wife and another couple went here for a celebration dinner a week ago. We did not have reservations (not sure if they even take them) since we just walked in, but they were able to seat us within 10 minutes on a Saturday night. The place was packed and the atmosphere, though pretty dim, was cozy like any good Italian restaurant should be. Everyone felt that their meals were fantastic, though I don't recall specific dishes. The place mellowed out pretty quickly after 10 - I believe they close at 11. Don't expect it to be a late night here, that's what the bar is for. Bring your favorite bottle of red, a few friends, and an appetite for Italian food and you'll have a hell of a night.
