I have been here a few times and it is nothing short of spectacular. The menu could be considered encyclopedic , which some may find frustrating but this reviewer finds it inspiring really. Tastes from all over Asia but a strong concentration on Vietnamese.  The Pho (Beef Noodle Soup) is really outta this world and is something I suggest a first time patron to try.. The amount of flavors they are able to pack in that broth is truly mind boggling. I believe me and my dining partner sat there and listed off a grocery list of flavors that we tasted in the soup. As for the other items on the menu they all look great and I look forward to slowly but surely getting through the extensive menu. I really cannot say enough of the quality and taste of the different items I have had there. The spring rolls are a must try! And according to my vegetarian friends that I have gone there with, they have a great veggie menu. So go and try it. I have to say there is nothing better on a cold winter day then some Pho from Tank Noodle.
