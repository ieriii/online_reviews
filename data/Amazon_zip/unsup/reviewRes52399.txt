Brazzaz is the first and probably the last Brazilian steakhouse that I'll go to.  While I thought the variety at the salad bar was great and the meats were pretty good too, I just can't justify going to eat at a restaurant and eat like a glutton for $50. A friend and I used a coupon to get BOGO dinners and ended up paying $35 each but I still can't imagine eating all that food again.  For the most part, I only liked about a quarter of the meats that they brought out. And I don't really like the traditional staple meat that every Brazilian steakhouse serves. I think the best items I got that were grilled and served by the staff walking around were the shrimp, grilled pineapple and (I think?) Portuguese sausage. Definitely glad I tried it out but I think once is enough.
