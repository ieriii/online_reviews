I grew up here! My cousin and I would make frequent runs, dodging cars like playing a game of Frogger at N Milwaukee Ave & W Hermione St (our Grandmother lived right on W Hermione St). My Grandmother has passed since and the house was sold, but that does not stop me from driving all the way from Romeoville to Milwaukee & Devon!!! There is NO other hot dog place that can top Superdawg... EVER! Their shakes and malts are to die for. The pickled tomato is just like a cherry on top of a sundae. Of course, I've had everything on the menu at one point or another and everything is just awesome. My favorite part is the old fashion drive-in where you park, order from your menu board, then they come to your car with your food and hook the tray to your window. The staff is just awesome, the food is great, the atmosphere is to die for, and they even sell souvenirs! If you've never been and live within an hour radius.... GO! It is a 1-3 a year treat for our family of 6. If it was just my husband and I... we would be there at least once a month :-) It does look a little run down... but it just adds to the atmosphere of the good ole' fashion drive-in's. This place is at least 60 years old!!! That alone shows they are doing something right. Oh... and if you put ketchup on your hot dog - you need to get out of Chicago and go to New York where you belong ;-)
