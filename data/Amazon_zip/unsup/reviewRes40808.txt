i have no idea which of the three la pasadita's this is a page for, but i dig the sit down one, where you get chips and salsa, a giant styrofoam cup of water (sorry, environment), and table service.... i have to stop myself from eating their tacos for dinner every night. they're simple, but so is perfection sometimes. and the black sauce? please fill my coffin with the black sauce when you bury me, i love it so.
