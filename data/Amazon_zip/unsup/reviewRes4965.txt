braised baby artichokes, fingerling potatoes, asiago & salami toscana prosciutto escarole bread balls fried brussel sprouts with thyme, lemon & chili flakes pig's ear with crispy kale, pickled cherry peppers & fried egg roasted bone marrow with herbs mussels with pancetta, creme fraiche & marjoram chicken thigh kebabs, fried smashed potatoes & tzatziki K & I's constant partake in pork no matter what city we're in coupled with a craving for bone marrow made this cute little place in the heart of downtown a clear no brainer. new american foods centered around their theme "cheese, wine & swine" pretty much sums up what the entire menu is about. designed as small plates to be shared all parts of the pig are cooked, fried, cured, diced up for uninhibited consumption that will leave a layer of pork fat on your lips glistening bright as if kissed by the night's love. we're 2 very americanized girls with non-discriminating "I like anything that tastes good" attitude came as a surprise as we could sum up the flavors in one word: salty. no doubt we don't regret making the effort to visit here but other than the bone marrow once is all that's needed.
