Their motto: There are no two finer words in the English language than "encased meats," my friend. And they prove it. I used to live 1 mile away, now I live 4 miles away. Winter or Summer, there is always a line. The duck fat fries are not really what they are cracked up to be. But imagine foie gras dogs, ostrich, and every other type of meat you could imagine, in a sausage casing. With brie, Gorgonzola, and any number of other fine cheeses. And you can even get a Chicago red hot or Polish, it you don't mind waiting in line for 1/2 hour for it. I vote them Best Sausage in Chicago, by far..
