Who wouldn't love Fogo 2 Go's Decasa Salad; blue cheese, chicken, ample amounts of onion and tomato covered with a great balsamic vinagrette ... this is all topped on a pita which soaks up the dressing and makes an amazing dinner for only $5.65! Problem is getting your order correct!!!!! I live down the block and regularly call-in there, my order is never right, three times I have had to go back frusterated because the order was not mine or my oreder was reliant on the "scattered" order taker who inevitably messed it up! I recently sent my daughter to go pick up our dinner, on credit since we encountered 3-4 mess ups in last two weeks, the cashier was not aware of the credit and demanded the payment,. My daughter, a now horrified teen, was really embarrased.! I had to call and remind the order taker of the discrepency in their record keeping....The freshness of the ingredients and variety of pizza is remarkable, but either the computer system for imputting orders is flawed or it is the staff! TIP: Check your order before leaving or walk-in and place your order ....
