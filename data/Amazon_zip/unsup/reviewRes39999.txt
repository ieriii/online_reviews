I totally dig Longman & Eagle. The dim lighting so dark that you need to hold a candle to the menu in order to read, killer cocktails made by bartenders that give you evil death looks when you try to transfer a single old fashioned to your table, where there is no shortage of quintessential bearded hipsters, and a menu so kick ass that you don't know where to start.  After much deliberation we started with the pretzel that comes with some deliciously tantalizing lick-the-bowl sauce. Please order that if only for that dipping sauce! Next for me was a creamy onion soup with morel mushrooms. Now this was shut your mouth good. So good that I have plans to go back next week just for that damn soup. I also got a few bites of the white asparagus salad which was light and heavenly. I ordered the slow roasted cauliflower for my entree which was tasty, however, not worth the price tag. My friend had the braised veal which was like heaven on a plate. Crispy on the outside and juicy fatty goodness within. I would highly recommend that dish if you umm aren't counting calories...and why would you if dine there, ahem... As for dessert, I have to be honest when I say it kinda sucked. The banana chocolate bread pudding was boring and the poached apple was simple in a bad way. I confess we ordered it for the bacon ice cream but the ice cream was oh so disappointing. Think plain vanilla with chunks of fatty chewy bacon....not crispy delicious bacon but chewy. Still sound good? Fine, order it but remember you've been warned! All too often do I have off the charts meals only to end on a sour note. L & E's dessert program could defiantly use some revamping. See you next week? I'll be the girl surrounded by empty soup bowls.
