location pretty much rocks. the elevator system is beyond wonky. enter on huron, take elevator to third floor. walk to a different elevator and wait. hopefully you aren't in a rush or have to use the restroom as i waited for 15 minutes for an elevator. lame. housekeeping wanted me out at 11:30 am and checkout was at noon. i know they had to clean...but chill. valet service was slow. they said it would be 20 minutes to get the car, it turned out to be more like 40. rooms were quaint and the service was quite friendly.
