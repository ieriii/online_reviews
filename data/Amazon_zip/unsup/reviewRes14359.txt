The best cuisine of any brewpub in the city, hands down. Fresh ingredients. Local sources. Try the big pretzel, as the cheese sauce that comes with it is unlike anything I've ever had. The burgers and pizza are incredible. Fish and chips are delicious, too. The beer just tops everything off. There's always something on tap worth trying, including several guest taps that are always lively.
