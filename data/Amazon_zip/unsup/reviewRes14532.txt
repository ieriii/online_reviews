I absolutely love family run and operated business and 90 Miles is exactly this. It is a very small cute place but they have tables and chairs set up outside which is great. Upon our arrival we were greeted by the nicest owners and staff. So many of there sandwiches look delicious, my husband ordered the cubano and since I am not really a pork fan, i got the ropa vieja. Both came with plantain chips and we also ordered a side of fried yucca with the garlic sauce. We sat outside and the food was out in no time. I took one bite of my sandwich and I was in heaven. Its was so good and even though the juice from the sauce was spilling out, the bread never got soggy which is a plus. My husband loved his too but I think the best part was the garlic sauce the yucca was served with. We were both fighting over trying the get the last of it. The entire meal really hit the spot and it was pretty inexpensive. I can't wait to go back since I initially wanted to get a smoothie too but found that there was no space in my stomach for it it. PS-I love it when the owners come out and talk to you. He offered us some of the hottest hot sauce which was good, but really hot.
