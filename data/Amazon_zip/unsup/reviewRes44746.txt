Great place for pizza. And a pretty good location, too. Be careful not to order too much. A couple slices are almost too much. The service at this location seems to be very odd. The first time we went, we waited for 40 minutes just to get drinks. And then another 40 for the pizza (and I know it takes a long time to cook). Another time, one of the waiters (not ours) kept staring at us and I'm still not sure why. It doesn't matter though. Its great pizza. (Just order the deep dish cheese and you'll be happy)
