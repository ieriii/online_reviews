Picture it - New Year's Day, 2010, Wishbone. 11:51 AM. The first day of the year isnt half way over and I'm already prepared to bust my new year's resolution. Just looking at the biscuits and gravy were 1500 calories, but they looked/smelled and tasted delicious. I hold off on the bloody mary (too much champagne the night before), but having had them in the past, I can say YUM. I settled for the Savannah Omelet. Everyone at my table enjoyed their food and the service was great. Dave, our server, was friendly and funny. He was busy but was really attentive when we needed him to be.  For a packed (I mean, PACKED) brunch, big tables were getting estimates of 25 minutes to wait, not bad. I love the fun, friendly atmosphere. I'll be back!
