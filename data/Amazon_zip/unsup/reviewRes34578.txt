I've had better brunch. I expected my bacon waffle to be Mmmmm, but it was only so-so. And the scrambled eggs that complemented the waffles were too dry. The orange french toast was really orange cake. It was too sweet overall. An orange yeasty bread would have tasted better. On a better note, the waiting area is a plus especially when it's cold outside. I'll order different items on their menu and give them another chance.
