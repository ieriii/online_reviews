After braving the Chicago River Architecture cruise in 40 degree weather (and brief flurries) tea at the Drake Hotel was a welcome (warm) activity for my mom and me. We were seated right away with no reservation and slowly thawed out while taking in the ornate room and lovely, live, harp music. Warming up with a wide assortment of tea, amazing snacks and beautiful surroundings- I could not ask for anything more!  For about $30 each you get your own pot of tea (no need to decide on one to share, everyone gets their number 1 choice!). 4 types of finger sandwiches (one of each type per person), a piece of sweet bread (like banana) a (warm) scone and all the lemon curd, strawberry jam and Devonshire cream you can imagine (I used all of my willpower to not eat the lemon curd by the spoon full). The meal is completed with beautiful offerings from the pastry chef. You can also get champagne to compliment your meal and complete your outing. I love how accommodating and consistent the service is. Our pots were toped off with hot water frequently, the snacks were brought out almost immediately and the server was always around to answer questions and grab us anything we needed (and to take a picture of the mother daughter outing). I do want to mention that each time I am here I see men enjoying tea as well and I like that. It is not just a mother's day activity- it's for anyone who wants to indulge in a delectable nibbles, tasty beverages and beautiful atmosphere in the middle of the afternoon!
