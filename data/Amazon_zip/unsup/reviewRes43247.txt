I'm not sure how to feel about this restaurant. We've only had delivery from Art of Pizza twice, and the first time, it was the best pizza I've ever eaten. When we got the same pizza a week later, it was medicore at best (undercooked and with strange cafeteria-quality meats). The prices are exorbitantly high for Chicago style pizza--$26 for a single pizza with no breadsticks or drink. Plus, they close at 10 p.m., which is right around the time that most of the people I know--including myself--START craving pizza.
