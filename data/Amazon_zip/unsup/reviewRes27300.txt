ive right around the corner from pequods, so im loyal to this place. but besides the convenience factor its seriously the best deep dish/pan pizza ive ever had. I recently discovered ordering extra cheese to it makes the pizza even better! Im a creature of habit and almost always order my pizza with pepperoni and extra cheese, sometimes ill venture out and get mushroom, sausage and spinach. Either way, you can't go wrong! The crust is a carmalized cheese, which happens due to the pan they use (or so i read somewhere) its nice and crispy. This place gets slammed on game nights, especially during hockey season....actually i think its safe to say its slammed every friday/saturday/sunday night. The pizzas typically take 30min to make so call in ahead and make your drive or order when you get there and enjoy a beer or two at the bar. They serve thin crust as well, pretty good, but i go here for the pan/deep dish...i tell everyone visiting or new to chicago that this is the plac to go to for good chicago pizza. Oh just to add pretty decent lunch special, i think its $5 for a personal pizza and drink.
