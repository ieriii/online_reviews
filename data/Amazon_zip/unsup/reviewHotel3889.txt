When I opened the door to the room, I immediately smelled mildew. It was so humid in the room, you could see water damage to the picture hanging above the bed. The bed was also horrible. The mattress was shot. When you sat on the edge it would make a loud creaking noise and you just sunk in it. The bathroom was in bad shape too. Tiles were cracked and broken. The shower head shook so bad while the water was on, the wall plate came loose from the wall and fell around the shower head. The staff was unpleasant as well. While we attended an event in one of their event rooms, a server stole our camera off the table. They have a security department, and apparently this happens all the time.  It's a great location, so if you are going to get drunk and rowdy, don't plan on sleeping, and don't own any valuables, this is the place for you.
