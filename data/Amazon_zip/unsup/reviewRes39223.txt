This place is totally beast. I'm not thin enough to be a hipster, and frankly I don't really know what it means to be hip. But, I do like to eat food and drink beer. So, I guess I'm as hip as the next guy. I went here with my girlfriend on the way back into the city from O'Hare on a Sunday night. It was a great idea: on a crisp October Sunday night we walked in and sat right down. Baller. Given the selection of various woodland creatures on the menu, we decided to split a bunch of "small plates." The goal was to eat an entire menagerie of cuddly forest critters. We came pretty close: frog, scallops, ox tail, beef tongue, pigeon, and pumpkin. It was an adorably delicious array of animal parts! I just checked the website and one menu item is duck testicles. I'm devastated that I could not demonstrate my total dominance of yet another animal when I went because this was not on the menu. Animal privates aside, the service here was fantastic. Our waiter was friendly, prompt, and extremely knowledgeable about the beer, wine, and liquors on the menu. He suggested the Great Lakes Octoberfest and it was delicious.  The food was also really tasty. Caveat: small plates really are quite small. We had 5 and it was expensive and didn't really fill us up. We wanted to try new things, but next time I think we'll get entrees. I'll definitely be back.
