My girlfriend and I chose to try this place out for a Friday evening out and it was great. I normally do not go to tapas restaurants but I must say that all of the recommendations our server Ben (fantastic service, ask to sit in his section) made were tasty and beautiful to look at before I ate them. In particular, I enjoyed the dates and the braised rabbit agnolotti (pasta) was unbelievable. We ordered 9 dishes including, cheese and desert, and left more than satisfied. The red sangria also made me smile. Iron Chef, Jose Garces, really knows what he is doing (DUH!).I would have given them 6 stars if I could I will give my business to Mercat a la Planxa again and continue to send others their way. Ben's service, presentation, and the overall experience I received was phenomenal. Nice job!
