One of my top 10 restaurants in the US. I went here a few years ago and was impressed, so I returned again when I was back in town. Great cocktails - we all had the Jameson and ginger beer cocktail on special. Great food - we split small plates. The brie fondue is AMAZING - ask for extra bread. The pot roast poutine far exceeded expectations, and desert was outstanding. Great ambiance and service. A server removed our fondue after we had asked for more bread, when our server realized what happened, he bought us a desert despite protests. If you're in Chicago, you must go to the Gage. If I lived here, it'd be a regular spot.
