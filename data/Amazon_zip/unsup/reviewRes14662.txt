Yes it's small, but good things come in small packages. I believe 90 Miles makes the best Cuban Sandwhich in Chicago. Writing about it, makes me crave one right now.  I have only been to the one on Clybourne, but I hear their Logan Square location is just as good.  Staff is friendly, and their is actually a small parking lot.
