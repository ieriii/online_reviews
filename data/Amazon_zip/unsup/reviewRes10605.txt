As out of towners, we asked many people for suggestions. Piccolo Sogno kept coming up as one of the best. The patio was stunning, a sanctuary in the city. The food was good...however our overall experience made the evening outstanding. The attention extended by Tino (Martin) made everybody feel special. He helped us choose a delicious bottle of wine, made suggestions for our meals and we were happy with everything he/we chose. We would definitely go back next time we are in town - but if you go, make sure to ask for Tino!
