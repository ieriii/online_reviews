I grew up on Calo Pizza so I am biased. But what I didn't know until I became an adult was just how good the Gnocci Gorgonzola is. Holy cow, this stuff is great.  Over thirty years we have had a lot of experience with Calo, and the vast majority has been very good. I still miss the old decor, and I wish they still gave out the relish plates for free, but life goes on.  This place is a very solid choice.
