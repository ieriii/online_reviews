Yummy Hot Dogs. I got got the "Keira Knightly", which is a slightly spicy dog. I don't get the reference...is it bc she is hot? Well it was fabulous. I like their "everything combo." The celery salt is a really nice finishing touch. I heard that the line gets long, but today was my first attempt and was a successful one....I guess bc of the snow. Great dogs, better than flub a dub chubs on Broadway. Hot Dougs has way more sausage selection.
