I thoroughly enjoyed my experience at Las Tablas. The wait staff was really friendly and helpful. He gave us a good suggestion on wine and the best part was that he wasn't overbearing on us, yet he was very attentive to our needs. We both had some combination of the skirt steak but my date thought the steak was a little chewy. (maybe it was suppose to be?) Some of the previous comments mentioned that this was Tango Sur without the wait, and I think that's a fairly accurate statement. I give this 4 stars because I think Tango Sur was a little better, but I would definitely come back here for round 2.
