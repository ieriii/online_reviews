ahem. they be like AMY, can you teach me how to dougie?  you know why, cause i eat like a fatty. all i need is some fries and foie gras and for you, you, you in the long line to get lost! i could rap some more, but no need for nauseousness before you overstuff yourself with hot dogs.  my advice is this: drag yourself out of bed on the morning of a particularly potent hangover. gather your friends and wait in line for the requisite hourish. when you finally get to order, you'll be ravenous, and that grease will do wonders for your stomach. share with friends (especially the foie gras dog), and don't skip the duck fat fries. half of the fun is passing around a million hot dogs and trading bites. when my friends and i finished, we didn't eat for another 10 hours. and that's how you dougie.
