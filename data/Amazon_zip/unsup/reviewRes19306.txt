My boyfriend and I came here on Sunday evening for a nice sushi dinner. I had made 7pm reservations, we were seated immediately. I had never been but had heard great things about it. Our waiter came, took our drink order and we ordered a appetizer- tempura shrimp. It was average, fried shrimp, nothing special. We then ordered our entrees. We each got 2 rolls- while everyone else was being seated , served (rather quickly mind you) nearly 40 minutes had gone by, no sign of our waiter nor our sushi. I saw a platter sitting at the end of the sushi bar, and every waiter looked at the tag, the tray and walked right past. It was nearly 50 minutes by the time our server realized it was ours and brought it to us. Neither my boyfriend or I are ones to complain, he was a OK server, only came to our table roughly 3-4 times. The sushi was delicious, and definitely would give that 5 stars. But, the service, SUCKED. It was terrible.. he never came to refill our drinks, we both had unsweetened tea, and practically forgot about us. I'm not sure of who our server was; but, he was terrible.
