finally managed to make it to Gilt. This is after having gone there twice. Granted, its a nice place, and to be sure, the lower level is cool, and private. But the place is totally loud and packed. I'm not a fan of lounges where you can't hear yourself speak. The saving grace was the fact that there was no TV in there - shocking, for a city like Chicago. The table wine was $10 a glass - and not great, really. Also, I sat in their 'lounge area' - which is a dingy little make-out corner in the back left hand side of the room with lounges. And there is an AC on top of your head to freeze you when its 80 degrees out. Therefore, by and large, good ambiance, bad wine, loud place.
