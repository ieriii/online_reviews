Hands down, my favorite brunch place in Chicago. And I've had a plenty of brunch in this fair city. The only reason why I knocked down a star is the ridiculous wait. And the fact that the days they don't have a wait (weekdays) they don't offer a few key items that make brunch here so delicious (chocolate tower french toast) Omelets are always good and the potatoes on the side are difficult to resist. Their eggs benedict hit the spot as does their breakfast burrito. The white chocolate pretzel pancakes are delicious as is their chocolate french toast. They often have great specials as well. Word of caution, the sweet fare tends to be pretty rich and sugary. Luckily the french toast and pancakes can be ordered in single piece serving, which is great for those of us that are trying to avoid clogged arteries and diabetes before we turn 40.  I like sitting at the counter unless I have a large group. A lot of the tables up front are kind of a pain since they are cramped and by the door, but sometimes you have to sacrifice your general comfort for some amazing brunch.
