Oh yah, I love the place. It can get a bit crowded at times but for the most part the people who come there are there for the music and atmosphere so you don't really mind it. Every now and then theres a table thats just a bit too loud when the music is playing but the highly trained waitress'quickly put a stop to it with their sonic shush of justice. I saw one shush out a candle from 30 ft. True story. I wouldn't lie. Order up a drink, sit back, and take in the history of the joint. Just think, Al capone walked through those doors at one time and sat in one of those very tables. Pretty cool. If you enjoy jazz you have to check out Kimberly Gordon on sundays from 11 to 2. Great voice. Definitely a place to check out at least once. Whether you check out the poetry slam, the jazz or just out for a drink. I'm Cesar J and I approve this review.
