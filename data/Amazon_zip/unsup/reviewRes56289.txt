BYOB!! Also, the service is incredible -- the staff is very welcoming and attentive! Their bubble teas and smoothies are fantastic. Tasty fresh fruit and perfect tapioca bubbles. Also, they can make their smootheis/bubble teas w/o added sugar for those who prefer a stronger fruit taste. FISHERMAN'S SOUP is INCREDIBLE!!! :) The pho is great, the bahn sandwiches are great, the crepes/pancakes are great, the fried bananas and ice cream are delicious ... on and on.  It's great for groups and parties.
