Sat at the bar and got served a bad plate of oysters during oyster fest. The plate of oysters I was served smelled so bad that people at the bar several seats over complained about it. Told this horror story to a couple friends and it turns out that a girlfriend of mine dined there 2 weeks ago and ate sushi at the bar. The entire group got horrible food poisoning. Overrated, overpriced. Much better seafood in Chicago.
