When in town for the National Restaurant show last May, a good friend recommended that my business partner and I dine at Carnivale. This was an absolutely wonderful suggestion! We were well taken care of. The food was beyond fantastic and mouthwatering. The balcony where we sat, overlooking the beautiful restaurant was very romantic! I would love to bring my husband there for a special occasion. I can't wait to return in May of 2011!
