My girlfriends took me out to Meli's for my birthday brunch :D (I have awesome friends) and since it was supposed to be a surprise destination, I had no chance to yelp it! I LOVED IT! the food was amazing - I would do brunch here every week, a very classy look and feel with get this - wedgewood silverware. I was Impressed (with a capital *I*). Try the skillets if you are not calorie conscious, great french toast and some real cool smoothies. Go now!
