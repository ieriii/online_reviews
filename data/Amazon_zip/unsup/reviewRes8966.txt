Great food, fast delivery. If I were rich I would order a feast. But alas, I can only eat so much Baba Ghannouj. The Rib Eye and Chicken breast came so highly recommended on GrubHub that I took their word for it and ordered it for delivery. It came on a bed of dill rice and I ordered extra pita and feta. I also ordered a small hummus. The food came in about 45 minutes. The Chenjeh and Chicken were tender and juicy and still warm as if the two miles between my apartment and Noon O Kebab didn't exist. The dill rice was a little heavy on the dill, but still not too bad. They gave me so much it lasted three days. The hummus was perfect, creamy, not too bitter. This is probably going to be my go-to place for Persian now.
