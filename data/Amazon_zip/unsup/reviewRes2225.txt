Its a great hot dog, but this place is not Alinea.  Is it worth a 60-90 minute wait? Not for me, but for others with nothing to do. Dougs is a victim of its own success, lines are good, but his are ridiculously long, as a result, I do not make the trip to this out of the way neighborhood for a hot dog.  A Chicago red hot can be had just anywhere. Dougs may be marginally better, just marginally, but certainly not worth the long lines.  As Yogi Berra said " Nobody goes there anymore, its too crowded"
