Went for lunch, and don't think I ate again for 2 days afterwards. The absolute best place for a meat lover to gorge him or herself. Avoid the chicken and stick to all of the beef, pork and lamb.  Go there hungry and get your money's worth. A very good salad bar makes this a surprisingly good option for the veggie lovers.
