The customer service is terrible! It's like it's what they're going for they're so good at being bad it! If that makes sense. My sister and I went in there to get food for the movies, their fries (which was supposed to come with a truffle aioli, delicious sounding) and I got their hot dog. Neither had ANY condiments when we got to the theater. Those are 2 foods that require them! The girl that took my order had a disgruntled, I-don't care-nor-like-this-job attitude that seemed perpetuated by the nonchalant manager who kept walking off while a long line of customers meandered around. Then, after the movie, my sister wanted to go back in to get some snacks for her and her man. OK, I could go for some cheese myself. We're checking out and having a very pleasant chit-chat with the cashier. SHE was very nice, and welcoming, and doing a good job. I'm waiting to sign my credit card receipt, which is stalled by HER manager walking up to her and sticking a receipt in her face. She says "I uh, didn't do that" and then he flips it over to show her something that must prove that she did it or something. Meanwhile I am still waiting to sign my receipt. The manager couldn't even wait to reprimand her! THAT IS POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE, FOX AND OBEL! It showed a complete lack of respect toward me, the growing line behind me, and the poor girl who was doing a good job! If she screwed up at least give it to her in private. Sheesh. AND, let people with carry out know they're are no condiments and where to get them. And make sure you put them on if they're supposed to be there.
