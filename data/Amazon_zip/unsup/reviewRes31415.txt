I would eat here everyday if I could afford to. It's close to me, I love the food and especially the desserts, and the specials change often enough to keep me coming back to try new things. Things to get: any of the cheesecakes (choc. chip is my default); a peanut butter cookie dough shake; the reuben or the dagwood sandwich; and the vegan mac and cheese (or the chili mac if it's on the menu). I've never had anything I disliked here, though I've always thought the ravioli dish was too small. Big plus - the margaritas are delicious and pack quite a punch.
