As avid sushi eater, I'm pretty tough when it comes to completely impressing me on great maki rolls. For the value, atmosphere and quality of seafood, you can't go wrong with Coast. The fact that is is BYOB is also an added bonus. I would recommend making reservations in advance but if you didn't, the wait is worth it! I come there at least once a month and I'm always drawn to to the White Dragon Maki roll. My other favorite rolls is the Volcano for a kick of good spice and their spicy tuna. I think I've had all their rolls to date and there isn't one that I would classify as bad. The appertizers are also great. I'm particularly a big fan of the aparagus beef and tuna tartare.
