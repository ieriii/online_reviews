What a tasty place. Like another one of my favorite restaurants in not too distant area, our meals arrived heaping with vegetables. Now I like fruit veggies just fine, never have avoided them, but I tend to prefer, you know, the stuff thats really good (meat) or the by-product of vegetables and fruit (beer, wine.) What can I say? I'm a dude. In this case I found myself gobbling up most of the veggies and leaving most of the meat to be boxed up when we left. They were just too good to leave for later. Don't be fooled though these probably aren't the most healthy things you'll eat, they came prepared in a fair amount of oil and seasoning, but they sure where tasty. The one complaint I had was the service. Once we got a waitress everything moved along quickly. But we were sitting for 10 or 15 minutes before anyone brought us any water, which was a little disappointing since we'd been waiting 20 minutes for a table in the heat. After we got our water it was another 10 minutes or so before anyone came to take our order. On the plus side our appetizer (ceviche) came really quick. I'll concede they were probably about as busy as they could be but on a hot day I'd have preferred someone dropped two glasses at the table without so much as acknowledging us than waiting for someone to get water and appetizers for us
