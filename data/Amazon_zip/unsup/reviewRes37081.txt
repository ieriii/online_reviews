Hop Leaf gets PACKED on weekend nights, but rightfully so. It has a huge selection of hard-to-come-by beers and the set-up is very nice in a vintage sort of way. It's a little pricey. I guess they can price it their way since they wear the king crown of Chicago's best beer bar. N.B. - They're around the corner from Too Much Light Makes The Baby Go Blind, and I recommend you make a night out of it.
