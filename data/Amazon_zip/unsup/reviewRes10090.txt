It took me over a year to finally come back and give Piccolo Sogno another chance. I'm glad I waited, so that I could go to the experience as open and fresh as possible. I'm glad I gave them another try. This time, they spoke the language of fine dining quite fluently. Even poetically at times.  The prosciutto and mozzarella was wonderful. The fettuccine with veal ragu was excellent. The custard dessert was one of the best custards I have ever had.  And the service was both descriptive and attentive. That was the best part of all. This time we felt welcome and taken care of, like our business was greatly valued and that our needs were of the highest concern. I look forward to going back in the future, hopefully taking in a pleasant summer night on their patio.
