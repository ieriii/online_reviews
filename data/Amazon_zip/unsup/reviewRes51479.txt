I love this little Garcia's outpost. The margaritas are deadly strong, giant and tasty. The couple of times I've been bold (stupid?) enough to drink two, I've spilled on myself or my date. The complimentary salsa is addictive. That said, it's also the only healthy vegetarian option on the menu. Be ready to eat four pounds of cheese otherwise. But by the time you're halfway through that second margarita, the fat content of your meal will be far from your mind!
