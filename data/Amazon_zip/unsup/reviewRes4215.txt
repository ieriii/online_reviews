Hi! I just went to Schwa and had a fantastic meal. It was on a Tuesday and I had a 5:30pm reservation. It was well worth the day and time. This is a place for people who really appreciate techinque, flavor and cooking in general. It is BYOB, the chefs are the servers and the place is very intimate. This shows my age, but I went to the original Daniel in New York City which is now Cafe Boulud. But the original space is a lot more intimate. Schwa is on the same par. The drawback is, u have to be strategic about getting reservations. If u haven't been there before, but, trust me it is well worth it , if u r really into food. The chefs are into their thing, not the trappings "of a 5 star restaurant":although the food is 5 star. So if u r a bit of a food renegade u will absolutely love this place!!!!!!! If u r expecting the service of Trotter's or Alinea forget it!!!!!!! It really just depends what u r looking for. They r kind of "in your face" with the music, which is alternative rock, which I appreciated and think kind of goes with the cuisine....but if u r picky about music forget it!!!! If u saw the movie Mostly Martha, in the original version, obsessive about food, they cook it perfectly and in innovative ways using post modern techniques for a very reasonable price relative to their competitors. I hope this commentary puts the negative reviews in perspective. Different cups of tea for different people, but these guys know how to cook and have fun doing it! If u don't have a sense of humor then don't go to this place.
