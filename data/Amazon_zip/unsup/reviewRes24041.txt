this is the best restaurant in chinatown, by far! and it's one of my favorite restuarants in chicago. i go here at least three times a month and still crave the food. the menu is massive, but when it comes down to it, the menu consists of 15 or 20 flavors in different combinations of meats and seafood.  if you go there, don't order the usual american chinese crap like sweet and sour chicken. be more adventurous -- and ask the staff for help if you have trouble deciding. if you've never had hotpot before, you should try the all-you-can-eat hotpot -- it's not the best hotpot in the world, but so far, it's the best i've found in chicago. in terms of entrees, my favorite dishes are (i'm not sure what the english translation is, but this is my best guess): the cumin lamb, boiled beef in spicy broth, sichuan green beans, and three bean curd with pork. the specialty of the house is fuqi feipan (the first dish listed on the menu) which is a combination of beef and tripe -- it's definitely for the adventurous eater but it's spicy and simply delicious!
