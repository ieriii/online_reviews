BYOB - yes. Good service? - Not really (but that's not why you go..) Good food? YES Good times? Great for group? Entirely. Go. Just go. Stop reading and get out the door. Barely even matters what time it is, chances are they're open. Prepare for great food, to smell like a campfire, and a billion small bowls all over your table with a bunch of things you can't really identify (eat them anyway, don't be a wuss). Now go! Enjoy!
