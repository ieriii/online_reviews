I have been going to Sultan's Market since 2002 or 2003! I love it! The prices haven't increased much over the years and they still make a great Spicy falafel sandwich! What I really like now is that their menu explains what is vegan or veggie friendly! Your sandwich is never the same depending on who is putting it together (I always get the spicy falafel) - I mean that sometimes they use more spicy sauce or you might have more hummus than the last time you were there. That's okay with me because this place is original! You can watch them put your meal together and often if you want to add more of an ingredient they are very accommodating! They also have a good selection of drink options. I am a fan of the aloe water! I've only been to the wicker park location and it's cool to see how much is has grown over the years. Remember to bring cash to pay for your meal! One time I forgot and had to use the silly ATM in the front :( booooo ATM fees!! Overall for the price you can't go wrong! The food is yummy and in the summer weather they have a nice outdoor seating area. I have never tried the salad bar, but it always looks delicious! Overall I would recommend this place. I have been going to it for years, back when it was a hidden gem in wicker park!
