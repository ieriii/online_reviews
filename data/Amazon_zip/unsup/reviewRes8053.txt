Yelpers, you've never steered me wrong! I was just browsing through nearby restaurants, and this one caught my attention. I went right at lunchtime, but even though it was crowded, it was quiet. The" salad bar" deserves a better name, like "meat, cheese, and general deliciousness bar", and it's HUGE. The waiter suggested a guarana soda that was incredible (kind of like a tastier ginger ale). The meat is the real selling point here, so I'll go on and on a little bit. You get a little card to flip back and forth, green means "GO". In seconds, a guy in a cool Brazilian outfit will be over with a hot skewer of meat, cooked whatever done-ness you prefer. You don't have to try all the kinds, but I did to start, and didn't find any I didn't like. The best was hands-down the filet mignon, followed closely by the boneless ribeye. They were hot, perfectly done, and not overly seasoned, which came as a pleasant surprise. The service was great, but not too overbearing (they pushed in my chair, swept my crumbs and refilled my glass, but didn't hover). The manager came over near the middle of the meal to thank us for coming in, even though they were pretty busy at that point. I have been to many restaurants at this price point, and never had such a wonderful experience. It was delicious food, exquisite decor, and exceptional service that made my trip to Fugo de Chau one to remember!
