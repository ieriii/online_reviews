Sunda is one of my favorite places to eat in Chicago. The ambiance, the crowd, the food, its just a great combination and never fails. The Chilean Seabass is definitely one of the best dishes here - a must try. It comes on curried cauliflower puree and is just mouthwatering and well balanced with the right amount of flavor. Corn Fritters are very tasty, great for an appetizer. I was very skeptical about ordering the Brussel Sprout Salad but was blown away by it. It was actually yummy and I finished it wanting more. The Oxtail Potstickers are interesting - nothing too amazing unless you are an oxtail enthusiast. The Garlic Noodles with Blue Crab are really good, very flavorful and comforting. Sunda, here I come again!
