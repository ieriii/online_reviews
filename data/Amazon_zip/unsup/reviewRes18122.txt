Full disclosure, I'm not much of a beer girl so I think a lot of the allure of this place is gone for me. I got a mixed cocktail, something cherry vodka which was excellent. My house burger with cheese and truffle fries were ok but certainly not spectacular. The total was inexpensive enough, under $25 for my meal and drink.  The real star was the service. Our server was attentive, helpful and thoroughly pleasant. Then again that seemed to be the normal operating speed in Chicago o be honest. I'd recommend this place.
