After having some great BBQ in North Carolina my husband found this restaurant. We had dinner with a group of friends, the first impression of the restaurant when walking in is one of a more high end restaurant. The decor of the restaurant is very nice, tables are spaced a bit apart and they offer your choice of napkin (black or white). I ordered the BBQ ribs and they were outstanding. I decided to try the regular ones and was impressed with meatiness and taste of the ribs, they are also very generous with the BBQ chips that they place on the tables, when are bowl would get empty they would quickly replace the chips. Overall everyone enjoyed their meals and I will be back again. This is a great place to go for a date or with a group of friends, I highly recommend.
