Note this is a review for the lounge. Friday night after work me and a couple friends met up here for some drinks. I expected this to be shotty service and a played out theme. This gem has been calling my name since I moved here but I never answered. I bucked up big Friday and made my move. Now, I'm more of a "rob roy" or "gin and tonic" guy. However, I had the pineapple/cilantro martini. Let me just say...what a treat that was. I eneded up with 3 of those and before I know it, i was flying high. The chicken tender appetizer they offer is pretty tasty. I'll go back here for drinks after work again, and maybe for a night cap but this place seems like somewhere to start and end your night rather than spend the whole time here.
