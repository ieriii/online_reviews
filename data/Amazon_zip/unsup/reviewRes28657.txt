My girlfriend took me here for my birthday. We got there a little before the 5pm opening and were near the front of the line that continued to build behind us. They opened the doors 5-10 minutes late, and it was really cold, so that bothered some people, but I was pretty excited. We went expecting a multiple hour wait, but were told 25 minutes, so we got some drinks at the bar and were seated pretty quickly. We tried a few different types of margaritas, which were all delicious, my favorite being the Blue Agave. The best thing I ate all night, and one of the best bites I have ever had, was next: Sopes Rancheros. What a great appetizer. The shredded beef and sauce on the cornbread-like boat was absolutely incredible. The other appetizer we had was disappointing, the Queso Fundido de Pollo Ahumado. The smoked flavor of the chicken was a bit overwhelming and the cheese was very drab.  Our entrees, Pollo en Mole Amarillo and Falda Asada "Brava", were both very good. The flank steak of the latter was my second favorite thing of the night. Oh, also the salsas were absolutely delicious, definitely worth getting. We ended the night with the flan, which tasted very standard, nothing to differentiate it from other flan I've had previously. Overall it was a great experience. The lack of a 5th star can be attributed to only one real "wow" and the cramped atmosphere.
