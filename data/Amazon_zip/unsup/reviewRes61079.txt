First I would like to complement the prices, in this area you have the ability to make subpar food and charge premium prices, this is was not the case at Garcia's. It's a great Taco joint so don't expect fine dining here but the food is just straight out good! I had their tacos (Steak (don't expect prime cut meat here but the handle it perfectly, great example of doing the best with the least), Chicken (well seasoned could be dry at times), El Pastor (straight forward) and they have superior Langua tacos if you're into that) taste authentic and food comes out fast.NOW, on to the burrito.... GREAT size, they do not cheat you on anything here! Perfect burrito for a late night stop when you might have had too much to drink or you if you are just really hungry, on the western side you can order and sit down while waiting for your food or sit at the bar and have some of their house tequila that is made by Garcia's and the family that owns it. The guy who works the late night register might look intimidating but he is awesome! And whatever you do you have to have a horchata!!!I pledge my allegiance to GARCIA's
