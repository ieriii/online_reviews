As a new resident of Chicago from Los Angeles, I was on a mission to find legit Vietnamese food. I was out sick from work and desperately needed Pho delivery ASAP. I stumbled upon Simply It's menu and promptly ordered Pho Bo (beef pho), Goi Coun (Shrimp Springrolls), and an Avocado smoothie (for those of you who thinks that's gross, don't knock it til you try it). Half an hour later, not only did my pho arrive neatly packaged and piping hot, but the owner actually threw in extra veggies AND upgraded my smoothie to a LARGE AND gave me a mango salad for FREE! The delivery person said he knew I was sick and wanted me to feel better. WTH??! Who does that?! I was completely blown away as to how nice he was and called back to say thank you.Now...the PHO. It was exactly what I needed. Tasted delicious and was STILL good hours later when I ate the last half of it. Portions are great (enough for 2) and they do not skimp on the beef! Spring rolls still tasted freshly rolled even after delivery, too. Don't forget to get extra Peanut sauce and chili! It is delish!Try it and say hi to the owner, he's awesome!
