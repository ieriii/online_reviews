hit or miss...but more hit than miss. light food can be had. outdoor sitting nice. last week's host looked and acted like he worked for a small town chain cafeteria....yesterday's champ was real good. last week's waiter brought two wrong items (for which we paid)...yesterday's was good. i have been going to le colonial for a few years now, starting with their restaurant in san francisco...i know what not to expect, so i'm fine. y'all too. set your expectations at about average, give or take and y'all's expectation will be met.
