100th Review! When your friend tells you that there is still an hour long line in the middle of Chicago winter, you know this place has to be good. I can't say that I loved hot dogs until my last trip to Chicago and I tried Portillo's Chicago dog, and it was love at first bite. So I now have a new love for meat in a tube. Doug's was a quick bus ride, and as expected the line was wrapped around the building. With 4 of us eating, we all decided we would each order 2 and all share. We stragetically planned our meal, and of course with duck fat fries. Duck fat fries, what? Holy fried goodness! These were delicious, not oily or greasy at all. Perfection! I have to say my favorite dog was the Pecan-Smoked Jalapeno Pork Sausage with Mustard Girl Horseradish Mustard, Fried Tortillas and Chihuahua Cheese. Oh man, I'm still dreaming of it. The following is my other favorites, in order... Bacon Cheeseburger Beef Sausage with Cherry Coke BBQ Sauce, Smoked Cheddar Cheese and Crispy Fried Onions Smoked Portuguese Linguica with Saffron Rouille and Aged Iberico Cheese, The Teuben: Swiss Cheese-Stuffed Corned Beef Sausage with Russian Dressing, Sauerkraut and Swiss Cheese. Doug, I love you and I can't wait to come back!
