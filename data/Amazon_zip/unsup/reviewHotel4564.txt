Stayed here for five nights on a recent business trip. Overall, I was pleased with my experience, mainly because I paid $70/night through priceline. When I arrived, I was greeted by a friendly receptionist and I felt like I was not treated any differently just because I had booked through priceline. I requested and was able to get a queen-size bed and a room away from the El. While the view from the room left a little to be desired (my view was of other hotel rooms about 100 feet across from mine), I didn't hear any street noise or the train. However, I did notice that the walls were pretty thin. I could hear people having phone conversations next door as well as hallway noise. The room was a little on the small side, but clean and well-designed. The location is excellent. It's two blocks away from Michigan Ave and the Art Institute. Three blocks away from Millenium Park. Entrances to the Red Line are one block away. I won't comment much on the lobby, because that has been commented a lot here...needless to say, it's pretty impressive. As with most pricey hotels, they nickel and dime you here. Internet is $20/day and I believe there is a charge to use the gym facilities. If you can book this hotel for cheap on priceline, then I highly recommend staying here. I do not know if I would pay full-price for a room here though.
