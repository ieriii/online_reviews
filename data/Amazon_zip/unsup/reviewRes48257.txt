This place is awesome!! I wish we had a place like this in Houston. The food is great and the beer list is extensive.  Of the 14 dishes that my party (3 guys) shared, only 3 of them were so-so. The rest of the dishes were wonderful. We all agreed the best item was the Pork Belly. Get it, you won't regret it.
