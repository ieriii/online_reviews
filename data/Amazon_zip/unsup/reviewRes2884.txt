Like Tru very much. Service, of course, is impeccable (but for this much money it better be !) We went a bit early - 5:30 and ppl didn't start getting in until about 6:30. Not sure if there was music, but I remeber it being so quiet when we came in, that literally even wispering, all waitstaff could hear what we are talking about. AKWARD! We asked for a vegeterian option, and I must say they prepared the menu well. The food was VERY VERY good, but for some reason there was really nothing that I trully said wow about (except for the dessert)- out of all our courses I remeber only a few. Nontheless everything was good and I could not say that I really disliked anything. Now the dessert was AMAZING. It was nothing new - vanilla ice cream with little fried apple cakes drizzled with some kind of a sauce. I have never in my life eaten such good vanilla ice cream - so delicate and well prepared! After dinner we had two drinks. Mine was a Flip... Flop ... something like that and it was not that good at all... not sure what the flavor in there was, but I was not a fan of it. My friend's tasted like a very well prepared pinapple martini. Overall I would say I'm glad I tried it, but I don't think I'll be going back every week.
