This place is great! And the no corkage BYOB if you spend more then $15 is the best. Next time I go, I'm filling up my bag with beers. The waitress recommend the supper white tuna sashimi, and... WOW amazing! Super white tuna is my new favorite. The staff is great and the place is very nice. Good place for a date. The place wasn't busy at all when I went on Sunday. The only thing Blue Fin has over this place is that Blue Fin has half priced drinks on Thursday. But the sushi is just as good and I am just as likely to go back.
