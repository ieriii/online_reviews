ehh. The main reason there are 3 stars is cause i started to get a little sick shortly after i was chomping down on a chicken schwarma sandwich. And thats only because it had red and yellow peppers. AND, when your allergic to them you kind of quit what your doing. Then you start sweating. And then. It's no good. However, I will come back and try something else that is not spicy. I have to say that the carob brownie and aloe water that i did purchase were excellent.
