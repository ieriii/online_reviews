Greek Islands is a super lively and fun place to be. Food is great and the energy the restaurant has is the best in Greek Town. The cold spread sampler with Taramosalata, Melitzanosalata,Tirokafteri is so yummy! I am not at all a fan of Greek wine nor do I know anyone who really is but of course there is a full bar. Opa!
