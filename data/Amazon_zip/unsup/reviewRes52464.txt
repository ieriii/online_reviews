Yes- its another one of those Brazilian Steak Houses, but how can you put it down. You cant, Brazzaz has one of the better salad bars in this category. Things like Shrimp salad, lasagna and fresh mozzarella was all over my plate. But as hard it will be to not fill up on all of these delicacies...SAVE ROOM. The meat...oh the meat, its coming. Unbelievable cuts of filet wrapped in bacon, Top Sirloin, Lamb Chops,Giant Shrimp...and don't forget the Grilled Pineapple to help you digest it all before the next round...all with just a flip of the circle. Brazzaz has great service, great drinks, great ambiance, and great food! Sure it might be a little pricey, but you have to suck it up and go... If you love meat...you are cheating yourself if you don't!
