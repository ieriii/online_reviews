i will start by saying i used to frequent garcias often and i recommended it to anyone looking for mexican food... however, since the remodeling, it no longer has a place in my heart.  it is SO SO SO loud! the acoustics are HORRIBLE. i can't hear the person i'm sharing a meal with but i can hear the conversation from two tables away. it was so annoying. conversation pretty much ceased - and not because the food was so good we didnt have time to talk. service - garcias has always been eh - but now that its so much larger its like they cant handle so many customers at once.... they have way more bus boys/waiters now (which is good) but most of the time they are just standing there.... the food quality has gone down too - but my boyfriend said it always sucked. i guess now that i no longer like the place, im more inclined to give in and say its blah! chicago has waaay better mexican food! ive given the new look a few tries now, and last night i just decided that was it. its not worth it anymore....
