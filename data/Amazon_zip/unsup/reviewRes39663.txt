One star for the extensive whiskey menu, and the rockin' bartender. Nothing more. I was excited to go here, not so much because of the hype (which I tend to ignore), but because of it's proximity to our home, It's right off our (Logan Square) train stop, so what a great spot to meet or just decompress on the way home. We went on Sunday hoping to avoid the crowds the first time around, and it worked. Sat at the bar, perused the long list of drinks and the short, concise list of "Bar Snacks". Okay. Something to munch on would be nice, and the Welsh Rarebit served with pretzel sounded nice, but my companion is watching his fat intake (that cholesterol will getcha!). So we see about ordering 1 order of the dip and add on an extra pretzel...sounds pretty simple, right? I thought so too, guess I was wrong. I explained to our bartender what we wanted, and he put it in the system. A few minutes later a woman (who was acting in food runner and perhaps managerial capacity) came over to get clarification -- yes, I said, we want ONE order of the rarebit/dip, and an extra pretzel.  She nods and turns around, we go back to our conversation... and then TWO rarebits arrive. Now, I can understand that it's a fairly new place and perhaps not all the kinks are worked out, but it's not *that* new, and is an additional pretzel really THAT complex to accomodate? We were brought two orders which we (a) didn't need, (b) didn't order and (c) weren't that tasty. The dip was very heavy on mustard; the pretzel was lukewarm to cold. Getting charged ten bucks for two orders of what should have been a simple bar snack with a small adjustment, I'm not a fan of. We asked the bartender to mention in to management; he knew where we were coming from and apologized for it, but didn't offer to take the additional charge off the bill. Maybe they should stick to serving liquids.
