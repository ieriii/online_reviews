I'm a little late on the Bayless train, but finally got a chance to try XOCO this week. Caldos and churros and chocolates...oh my. Everything is delicious! Even though it was crowded, the people working there were friendly and helpful which made navigating the crowds much easier. I came here around 1.30pm on a weekday and was seated and served within 15 mins. Can't wait to try more of the menu.
