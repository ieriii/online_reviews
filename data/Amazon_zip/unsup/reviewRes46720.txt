I am new to the city and I'll be honest, I wanted to go here because the name made me giggle. After my husband and I walked through the Lincoln Park Zoo lights, we stopped here for some dinner. We both got the salad bar, which was probably the best salad bar I had ever seen. Everything was really fresh and tasty. I will definitely go back and get a real entree. The only complaint I have is that there were a ton of kids there with no parental supervision and they were really loud and obnoxious, the management really should have told the parents to quiet them down.
