I had the good fortune of coming here on Sunday to celebrate my birthday. I am glad my brother and sister-in-law suggested Carnivale because it is some place I probably would not seek out on my own. To start, this place is HUGE. I loved the high ceilings and over sized lamps. When we arrived Sunday night sans reservations, the hostess said, "Well you get the best seat in the house." It was dumb luck but this seat was GREAT (all by itself on the second level, looking over everyone). To start, we got the ahi tuna and guac and chips. Both were fantastic. I could have eaten the guac with a spoon (and actually did since the chips were REALLY salty). Two of us got the skirt steak (which I tried and LOVED. I am still kicking myself because I didn't order it) and two of us had the pork special with rice and plantains. The waiter said it was his favorite dish and it WAS very tasty with lots of flavors. The plantains were cooked perfectly - I think they were my favorite food item. However, my favorite thing of ALL was the Carnivale Martini. It was the perfect combo of tart and sweet (love that pomegranate juice). The ONLY thing was the service was a little slow. I like slower service as opposed to "rushed" but when it comes to drinks, no dice. Our drinks took too long and some of us were tempted to order two at a time. All in all, an excellent birthday experience. I do love the waiters' mini-ties too. Hot.
