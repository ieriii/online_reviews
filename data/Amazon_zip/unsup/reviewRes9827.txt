I've been here twice now- once for lunch and once for dinner. First off, the patio is gorgeous! Definitely really romantic, and one of the nicer dining patio I've seen in Chicago. The service is always top notch, the bread is DELICIOUS, and the pastas don't disappoint. I wasn't blown away by the meat entrees that I tried, so I'd definitely stick with the pastas. Dessert (some kind of puff pastry with chocolate) was really unique and good. Definitely recommended for a romantic, tasty meal- and if it's warm, ask to sit on the patio!
