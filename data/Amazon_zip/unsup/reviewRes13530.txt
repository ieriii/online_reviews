I absolutely LOVE this place although I was surprised by the not-serving-fish-during-brunch thing (hadn't been in a while). It makes sense though, especially when it's super busy. The quality of the fish here is out of this world. It's ALWAYS cooked to perfection, with my personal fave being the seared yellowfin tuna. OMG I am drooling just thinking about it. The potato pancakes are amazing and don't forget the jumbo cocktail shrimp. Jumbo is an understatement. Everything here's delicious, including that seafood salad! Service is excellent and the brunch is solid, even though you can't order the fish.
