Okay. So you waited in line for two hours. For a HOT DOG. But you forget all that once you reach the front of the line and are greeted with Mr. Hot Doug's smiling face. And he should be smiling. Not only does he make one mean dog, but he's got hundreds of people who will spend the equivalent of three lunch breaks just to get one. And it's worth it. Smoked gouda, foie gras, and truffles-oh my...ingredients like these make you pine for a hot dog like you never thought possible. And the best part (aside from the duck fat fries)? Leaving with a satisfied smile as you hear someone say, "is this really the line?"
