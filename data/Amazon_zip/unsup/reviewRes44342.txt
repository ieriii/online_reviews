I could not agree more with the reviews that say that the service here is simply craptastic. At a few points during the meal, I almost went up to the sushi bar myself to carry my OWN food out because the waitress was so freaking useless. I thought maybe it was just an "off night" and was possibly due to the fact that Wakamono was so busy inside, but I see from other Yelpers that this was not a unique experience. Their one redeeming quality as far as service goes is that they have an excellent bus-person who kept our waterglasses filled and our table cleared of plates (which is great since the tables - at least the ones outside - are postage-stamp sized). The thing that really irked me about the service was while we were placing our order, the waitress was waving and smiling at someone at Pingpong across the street. Are you kidding me? It took about 20 minutes to get a glass of wine, 30 minutes to get our edamame and sunomono salad (excellent here, I love it), and then, of course, the food came out right away after our apps arrived. Uh, thanks, assholes. The sushi's good. I have no complaints as to the quality, and the order did come made with half of the usual amount of rice, like I asked, so props to the sushi chef. The rolls are not particularly huge, and I think this contributes to the fact that I think it's not the best value for sushi in Chicago. For two people, we paid about $70. We both had a glass of wine and were comfortably full (not 'I'm-gonna-barf' full) after our meal... as mentioned above, we had a couple appetizers (edamame and sunomono) and then split 4 rolls between us.
