Since my array of food consists of pizza, tacos, burgers, pizza, and um pizza this was a step outside and oh hell to the yes this place was real good. Costa Rica what what!?!  Me and my friends were the smart ones to go on a Saturday night so we had to wait inside the door while people maneuvered around us as this place has big time carry-out thing going on. They have a small dinning room with capacity of 30 but it was jammed to about 65 which probably wasn't up to fire codes, but who's gonna snitch? Once we got to sit I got real hungry as hot plates of chicken and steak kept whizzing past my nose. Went with the Steak Sandwich with grilled onions and Lizano sauce which was is slightly sweet and spicy at the same aka yumtown. The sandwich was pretty large and served on a ciabatta type bread so was quite satisfied with that. The one drawback was after hearing everyone on here jazzing about the shakes I decided to get a Passion Fruit one and well it just kinda tasted like a lukewarm vitamin water with a piece of fruit in it. I tried the famous oatmeal shake too and that didn't exactly wow me either. Maybe I'm a shake snob, who knows but I'll remember to skip the shake next time. Overall Irazu is a nice place to go if you're looking for something different eat than the usual staples of Chicago. Would like to go back, no doubt.
