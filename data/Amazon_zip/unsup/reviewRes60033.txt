ate at las tablas and overall it was simply an OK experienceall around the experience left something to be desired.i went during a sunday afternoon and the place was not that busy but the service was not that goodyou had to wait an extremely long time for everything, including glasses of waterthere was no apologies for the lack of timeliness from anyonethe empanadas were too heavy in my opinionand the steak was simply okthe food was not anything to brag about and I had heard many things about this placemaybe i chose the wrong items. so i asked a friend that had been there before and she told me what to choose.went back there during a weekdayagain, the place was not busy and the food took so long that we asked them to wrap it togo, ate it later on that night, and by that time it was simply ok, but it was old, and it was steak, so go figure.oh well, not trying a third time, then I would be the fool.
