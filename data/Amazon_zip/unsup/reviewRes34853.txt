I've dined in and taken out from Sushi X and must say YUM.  Their Buddah roll is incredible for a vegetarian option and a must when I eat here. Everything else is pretty tasty as well. The Thai Stick is a another great option if you wish to try something different. Friends of mine swear by the Crab Rangoon Roll, I just can't get into cream cheese in my sushi. It's just wrong in my opinion.  The downside to Sushi X is that it's a tiny restaurant inside and you might have to wait if you go during a busy hour. But on a plus side, they seem to add new rolls to the menu every few months or so.  Absolutely worth the visit in my eyes.
