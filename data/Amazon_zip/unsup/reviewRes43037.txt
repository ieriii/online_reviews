Used to love this place... still love the food. I've ordered MANY times to provide lunch for my whole office. The chicken is amazing, the pizza is unusual and the garlic knots are to die for. Just got off the phone with the RUDEST, MOUTHIEST JERK ever. I've spoken to this guy there before, after which I opted to order on line - but today he called to verify something on the order... I'm going to miss the food... but if the owners don't care enough about their restaurant to hire people with a smidge of manners for customers, I guess that's up to them. I asked his name and he told me it was none of my business. I called back to cancel the order (because I didn't trust that someone who was that rude to me wouldn't do something to alter the food) and he said, "Good. Better for me. Your credit card was already charged." Can you believe that?????? There are TOO MANY restaurants in Chicago, too many GOOD restaurants for me to spend another penny in one that doesn't know how to treat a (good) customer. Bye.
