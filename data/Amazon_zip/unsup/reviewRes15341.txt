We put our name on a list and waited for about 90 minutes at a bar a block away. Once we got called, I headed over to get the table while my wife paid the tab at the other place. Apparently you've got about five minutes between the point you get called and the point you need to appear -- and you will only be seated when your entire group is present. It took my wife more than a few minutes to settle up and walk over, so our table vanished and I was told to head to the back of the line and that'd "it'll be awhile." They get two stars since the service -- despite not letting me in -- was really polite and classy and the place sure seems cool on general principle. Just a little too cool for me, I guess.
