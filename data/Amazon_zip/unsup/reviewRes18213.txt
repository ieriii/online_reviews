Well, I had such high hopes for this one. First of all, the service is GREAT. The server we had was really knowledgeable about the extensive beer and food menus and was able to offer great suggestions to us. The food overall was amazing - we had the the fried cheese curds (ORDER THESE), my friend had the Legends of the Daal, my gf had the Slow Burn and I had the Red Dragon. The food tasted great, the burgers were perfectly seasoned and the fries were great, too (I had the truffle fries). So, great service and great food. Why the 2 star rating? My gf and I (the ones that had the burgers) later on had raging stomachaches and by way of deduction, we think it is because of the beef patties since our friend had a vegetarian sandwich. Sucks because the place is great and other than the fact that we both got really sick, it was a great place.
