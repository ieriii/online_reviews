I know one person that hates Hot Dougs, but he's a sociopathic maniac. I'm gonna write this review in fragments. Okay. - Doug, good dude. - Game of the Week. The Mountain Man. Antelope, Buffalo, Elk, Venison (boar, deer, caribou, etc). All together having a wild time in your stomach. - Excellent beverage selection - Chubby people - Thuringer sausage named "The Don Rickles". That's all I needed. Eat here sparingly, so your body isn't angry at you. HAIL DOUGS!!
