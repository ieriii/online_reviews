Maybe it's my low blood pressure, which gives me a food-high after I eat, but this place made me and my stomach happy. I stopped by for lunch today, and after much deliberation I ordered the roasted vegetable panini and their banana-nut/maple syrup shake. The freshness of the vegetables was astounding, not only in their taste, but in their vibrancy of color. They had a little brochure on the table expounding on the benefits of their eggs, which are from a local, soybean-fed, ''free range" type farm.   The panini arrived fairly speedily, and was accompanied by red skinned potatoes. I normally don't order potatoes, but these were delicious, and not at all greasy.   The shake was hella expensive, at least to me, but in my savory vs. sweet quandary it was a good compromise. It was fairly tasty but I was expecting more maple syrup. One thing I was not expecting was this strange ice-creamesque/whipped cream/butter stuff on top..however it was quite good.
