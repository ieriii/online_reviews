The Gage, at best, is just alright. It's riding the gastropub trend with a largely hit or miss success rate. I've been 4 times, and the food has ranged from good to boring.  The last night I was there I had venison carpaccio which was pretty tasty, though an extra quail egg would have made the dish far better. I then had a ribeye which was overpriced and under flavored.  I was most disappointed last time by the general experience. My date and I came in at 10:30 and were seated in the back room next to another couple. The woman from that couple threw her napkin down, made some sort of furious comment and stormed off. Next thing I know, a waiter is convincing me why I want to be seated a few tables away. The whole thing was absurd and insulting. Before I would go here because they were open late and had passable food, but that experience sealed my original judgments of the place. It just isn't very good.
