First of all, this place has an extremely great spot on Michigan Ave. It's really nice when we sit by the window overlooking the street. Dessert here is a 5. I love all their desserts. My favorite is the Warm Rustic Apple Pie. It is delicious. Their cheesecake is good too!  Food is a 1. Cheesecake Factory has much better food. (The 2 restaurants are affiliated.) Even the bread is better at Cheesecake.  Portions are average and the food is overpriced. For food go to Cheesecake Factory. If you are craving dessert while walking the Mag Mile, this is a good option! If you want a good meal for a good price, I suggest looking elsewhere.
