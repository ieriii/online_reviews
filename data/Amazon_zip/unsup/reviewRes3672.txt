I was casually walking through the shops nearby and decided I wanted to eat somewhere new. I'm relatively new to Chicago and I've been a couple a places, so when I saw Crisp...I just new I had to eat here. I got their fried chicken and it was AWESOME! I wasn't sure which one to try at first so I ordered half Plain Jane and the other half was Seoul Sassy. And OMG! I was kicking myself for not getting it all SS. That sweet sauce with the fried chicken was the BEST I have ever had. I will always go here for their chicken every time I'm in the area. GO EAT THEIR FRIED CHICKEN! ^_^
