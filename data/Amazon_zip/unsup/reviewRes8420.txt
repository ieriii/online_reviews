I've been to Spacca Napoli on numerous occasions... I try to get there at least once a month for lunch or dinner. The Chef/Owner Jeff Goldsmith is ALWAYS there... personable, tending to the patrons and making sure the restaurant is running smoothly and that everyone is statisfied.  I love the atmosphere, small, casual... kid friendly, but not to a point of mayhem...  Great Neopolitan pizza... the Pizza Margherita is fabulous... the Tre Pomodori in the summer... and some of the specials with Arugula on it... refreshing! (for pizza)  And to top it all off, they serve Lacrima Christa del Vesuvio.   I really love this place. Definitely one of my favorites...
