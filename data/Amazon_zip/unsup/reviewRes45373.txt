Finally! Finally, finally, finally! If any one word is going to define this review, it is finally. Finally, I have a place to go watch Bears' games and enjoy a damn fine brew on a Sunday without having to cab around town.  Finally, there is a place that rivals the Kerryman and Fado's for feel of an Irish pub, and surpasses them with relative ease.  Finally, a bar that serves good Irish food (oh my mouth waters for you, oh corn beef and cabbage), good appetizers (I love you artichoke dip), and good old American fare with an upscale twist (I am going to cheat on you artichoke dip with meatloaf and mac & cheese).  Finally, a bar that knows that it takes more than 30 seconds to pour a Guinness properly. Finally, a waitstaff that treats customers like friends instead of a renewable commodity. Finally, bathrooms that don't require a HAZMAT suit ... (for both the men and women -- and no I haven't been peeping, that is word of mouth). Finally, a bar that is both visually stunning and has taken the time to put forward a good beverage and good food. Finally, a bar where you can watch the game but aren't overwhelmed by flatscreen TVs. Finally, I have a place I can call my own in the East Lakeview area. P.S. Is it possible to be a groupie of a restaurant?
