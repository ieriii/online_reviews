Key Yelp: An Institution. And the fries that cradle your dog or burger....its almost sexual! Review: When I lived in St. Louis we would come to Chicago for holidays, summer weekends, etc. I read about Super-Dawg in Zagats and once we found it we were hooked. Ironically, since moving to Chicago-land, I have not eaten there. However, I now get why it is so special and kicks the butt of your common corner Chicago Char house. There is an attention to quality food and detail that exists no where else and the drive-in ambiance definitely pays off. Not sure if the dog is Kosher or not, I know its not Vienna..but its very good. The food packaging is awesome in the little colorful retro boxes. The burgers taste great and are never overdone like many of the places around here. The dogs are special because of the the sour tomato slice...a staple of the kosher deli...substituted for the traditional fresh tomato wedge on a traditional Chi-Town dawg. The fries are crinkle cut but very very good....always hot and fresh....never a limp fry in the bunch.  For any folks visiting Chicago who have access to a vehicle and are in the Northwest part of the city you really should go....it ranks with Nathan's (Coney Island) and Pinks in the triad of The Great American Hot Dog Kingdom. G-d Bless America!
