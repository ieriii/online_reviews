Coast - Newsflash - you are not the only BYOB sushi restaurant in Chicago. Was your sushi above average? Yes. Quite good, actually. Unfortunately, your customer service was so poor, it negated your sushi skills.  I realize patrons should not excessively hold up a table on a busy weekend night with drinking and talking, but when dessert is verbally offered (we had to ask for a menu), followed by "and just so you guys know, we have another reservation for 6 that needs your table in 20 or 30 minutes." ARE you kidding me? Have that discussion with an appropriate table who may be done with their meal (including dessert and coffee) but are opening another bottle of wine, NOT a group who progressed through their meal in a timely fashion and haven't even seen a dessert menu yet.  I see I am not the only person with this complaint, so maybe consider extending your reservation time slots. At the very least, educate your wait staff on proper customer service. Unlike what our waitress told us, we were NOT informed of this *timed dinner slot* when the call was made for the reservation. No big rush to return any time soon.
