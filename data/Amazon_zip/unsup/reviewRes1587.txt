Holy F this place is amazing. Whatever you need to do to get there GO. Don't b*tch about waiting in line, it's annoying and I'd gladly take your place...I've waited in blizzards, sub-0 weather and blistering hot summer days with drunk Cubs fans and you don't see me complaining. I recommend the red hots and whatever Doug has on special, preferably alligator. And don't forget your CASH.
