A blast from the past! At Superdawg Drive-In you roll up in your car and place your order from a menu posted outside. In a short while a perky young member of the staff brings your burger, fries, and milkshake right to the car. I'm always wondering when 'The Fonz' is going to roll up on his motorcylce while I wait for my food! On a nice day you can sit out at picnic tables but if it's raining you never need to leave the car! Superdawg is a great place for those late night muchies with hours until 1AM Sunday thru Thursday, and 2AM on Friday and Saturday.
