I come to Chicago a lot, and ALWAYS manage to eat at Meli every visit. It may be the best breakfast I've ever had! My only problem is that I have to decide on one entree when there are dozens that look great. The coffee is always good, as are the freshly made juice blends (but they are pricey!). I've had their caramel banana pecan waffles (!), Western omelette, whole-wheat pancakes and symphony crepes (!). I always come away very impressed. The fresh, in-house made marmalade and strawberry preserve are both amazing. The waffles and crepes gave me a bit of a sugar-overload, and I couldn't finish them (but that was to be expected after reading their description). But what I could eat of them was stellar! The wait may be long, but it's definitely worth it!
