I'd been to Topolobampo before, but hadn't been to the more casual side of the place before. It seems like such a fun restaurant, the decor is really bright, the kitchen's right there and you can look in (to some extent) on the hustle and bustle going on there. The service was attentive, with the waiter swooping in to refill my diet coke whenever it looked even remotely low. The guacamole was really good, the avocado was nice and fresh and there was just a hint of chili powder in it for some spice. The tortilla chips were also really good, they clearly had been freshly made and were nice and salty. We also got one of the ceviches, which was nice, although I didn't really have enough of it to pass judgement. I had the Tacos al Carbon with steak and that was great. Nicely seasoned steak, spicy sauteed onions and peppers and a dollop of that guacamole served with fresh tortillas...Mmmmmm. It also came with a dish of pinto beans served with pork, which brought back fond memories of my favorite taqueria in Sacramento's beans (oh taqueria Jalisco, how I miss you...). I tried my cousin's duck tacos al carbon, and they were delicious too. Her sister seemed to be enjoying the catfish tacos she got, too. Everyone was happy.
