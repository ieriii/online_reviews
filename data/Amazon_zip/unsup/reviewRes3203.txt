The food was absolutly wonderful!! We ordered the Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ. We got 5 of each and we paid $19. The wings were huge so no complaints on paying $19. When The only slight complaint i have would be the staff. having never been there before we didnt really know what to order or how. There was no menu by the registers so we just kind of asked. Despite the menu issue i will be back and i suggest others try it!!!
