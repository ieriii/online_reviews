I frequent The Gage on a weekly basis for lunch. There are several fall-backs if you are not impressed with the daily specials. I recommend the Fireside chicken sandwich, fish and chips or the curried mussels. Desserts are ever-changing, but if you are there in the Fall - definitely go with the pumpkin pie ice cream sandwich! The staff is amazingly friendly and never appear to be "at work"  If you enjoy beer, spirits, good food and great service, this is a must. Lunchtime could get quite busy, i would recommend reservations, but seating is prompt if you do not have reservations.  The outside seating area is ornately decorated with beautiful flowers and shrubbery, but could be quite noisy, as it is located on Michigan Ave. A definite must for all who pass by!
