This is a nice hotel in a good location. If you are going to Chicago to specifically visit the American Girl Doll this hotel is ideal. It is about two blocks away from the store and the rooms at this hotel are suites so they're perfect for families That wasn't the case for us, but I think a point worth mentioning.  I liked that we were in close walking distance to everything on Michigan Avenue but yet not right on that street. The staff was friendly. The best part about this hotel was the price. We booked online at Priceline and paid $95 for the room. Can't beat that! They get you on the parking, $55 for 24 hours with in and out privileges but let's face it, who is driving their own car around when they are visiting downtown Chicago?  In the grand scheme I guess that is the rate you are going to pay for overnight hotel parking in a major metropolitan city so there really isn't an alternative if you have a car.  I would definitely stay at this hotel again but next time I come to Chicago I want to take the MegaBus. By no means am I a cheap person but I absolutely hate paying high prices for parking. Anything over $20 a day sends me into a tizzy.  If I could I would get rid of my car altogether but the city I live in does not have infrastructure to be car free :( OK, no more ranting!
