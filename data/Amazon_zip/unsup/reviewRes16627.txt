So I do love this place's ambiance and decor..its just a fun place overall..for a girls night out or even a date... Our server, Michael was awesome! He was so pleasant and really dead on about his thoughts about things..i wanted to try the sangria but they were out :( that was a big bummer.he did say there was a frozen white sangria...but kinda hinted that it wasnt good..he brought over a tasting and holy crap..if you like the taste of pure alcohol, frozen..or maybe cleaning products..then its for you...however the lemon meier drink and the coconut mojito were outstanding!! The guac was really really really good. I had the Gnocchi...which was not bad...but it just felt weird to be at a brazillian restaurant and the only options being a pasta dish or a vegetable dish with a bunch of veggies thats about it...you'd think by now they would have at least something else...especially since many people have said that vegetarian options are scarce here... now dessert on the other hand was amazing..the coconut cake was absolutely amazing.... i think i'll be back here for some drinks/apps, or desserts...it really is a fun place..i will warn you though it is really pricey...though valet is only 5 bucks which is awesome... I'm sure ill be back!
