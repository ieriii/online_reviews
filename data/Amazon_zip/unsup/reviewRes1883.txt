The Bomb!!!! Well worth the wait no matter how long. A must for locals and Chitown visitors alike. Duck fat fries...are you kidding me? Sublime!!!! (Friday & Saturday Only) Encased meats really do rule the day at Hot Dougs, my friend. The duck with assorted other things in the encasement that Im not even sure what they are, served with bleu cheese...fogettaboutit!!!! The traditional dog is on the menu, but should only be ordered as a side order to the gourmet dogs. You must eat at least three dogs per visit, no questions asked! Group eating is the way to go, because by my estimate, if you go in a group of 5-6 you can pretty much order every thing on the menu and share a little of all! Doug, you truley are an artist with the encased meat product....All Hail Doug, as we are not worthy!!
