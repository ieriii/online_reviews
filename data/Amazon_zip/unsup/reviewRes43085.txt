I was here for a birthday party and really loved the upstairs bar with its 1920's speakeasy feel. But I was pleasantly surprised to find that is was also a bit mixology bar. The bartenders really take their time with making the drinks and were able to make interesting drinks off the menu using some of their unique extracts.  And were knowledgable about what tastes could suite what palate (great suggestions!)It has an easy going lounge environment that is not too "stuffy" or too "divey".  It was a great experience and I will definitely partake in a drink at this bar again, if I am in the neighborhood. The only downside was the large bar/lounge downstairs is cash only and not available for parties larger than eight.  To rent it out costs $3000, a little steep and difficult if you are entertaining a lightly larger group....but other than that an excellent experience.
