Mia Francesca was excellent. I arrived after a long flight, hungry and exhausted, only to be wisked away to a delicious little joint just around the corner.. Where the staff are kind, the portions are enormous and the flavor and experience, classy.. A great date night followed by a great night date. :) Start at Mia Francesca to have a night to remember.
