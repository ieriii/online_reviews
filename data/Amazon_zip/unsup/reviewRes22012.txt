When I was in Greece, every last meal from breakfast to lunch to dinner was served with the same giant loaf of sesame bread and a greek salad with feta. Towards the end I found myself shouting "ENOUGH!" at the waiter before I stomped away in search of a cup of water with actual ice cubes in it. Being in Greek Islands and seeing that damn sesame bread brought up mixed emotions, and true to form, the restaurant delivered mixed results. I should start by saying that the sesame bread here is better than the kind I had in Greece. It was soft and fluffy and tasted great with olive oil and pepper. I ate like 5 pieces, hypocritically. The flaming saganaki and the cold calamari and shrimp were excellent appetizers. The cheese was hot and caramelized from the flames and the seafood was very fresh. In terms of entrees, the spanokopita was lackluster. It was made in a large pan and sliced to order so the pastry became somewhat soggy and cold. The leg of lamb also fell short; it didn't have enough moisture or spice to counter the fact that it was really. freaking. gamey. On the other hand, the moussaka and grape leaves were great, and many other items on the menu looked enticing (alas, my stomach was only so big). But for somebody who doesn't have a sentimental connection to Greece or a passion for it's food, I don't know that this place is necessarily a "draw."
