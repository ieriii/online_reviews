I came for a training and stayed 2 nights. The food that they catered was semi decent but nothing mind blowing, but that could have been because of the menu the facilitators chose. The decor in the lobby is funky/retro/neat but the rooms were tiny!. There was barely any space to pass between the dresser and the bed. Also the bathroom doors weren't real doors, they were more like shutters. And as others have complained, you can hear everything that's happening in the hallways and the rooms next to you.
