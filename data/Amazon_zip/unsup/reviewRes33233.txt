I'm not Czech, or Romanian, or of any eastern European descent, but I grew up eating a dish which consisted of meat and rice stuffed in a cabbage leaf. Many eastern European countries have their own version. The version from my childhood was served in the basement of a Byzantine church once a year as an annual fund raiser and called "holubky." I've been craving it for 10 years which is what found me at Little Bucharest. I was over the moon with my Sarmale, aka holubky. Over. The. Moon. Did I mention that it came with polenta and herb crme fraiche? It was a much fancier dish than the one I remembered, but I wasn't complaining. My companion was absolutely jealous of my dish and I didn't blame him. He ordered the pork schnitzel which was underwhelming itself but the horseradish spaetzle, bacon, spinach, red pepper coulis that came with is was delish!  The waitstaff was super friendly, the owner bought us a round of drinks (Thanks again!), and the inside was super cozy save for the rather loud techno music. Weird. I am going back--no doubt about it!!! There were too many things on the menu that were *almost* tempting me away from my beloved cabbage rolls. Seriously, you MUST try them!
