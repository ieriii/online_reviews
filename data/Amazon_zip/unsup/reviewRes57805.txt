After the first visit I was hooked, and have returned twice more.Very good food, served well by friendly staff, in very pleasant surroundings. The wait staff visits often enough to take care of your needs but does not hover or smother. One of the family owners visit each table to be sure all is well. Excellent ingredients are prepared and served in imaginative ways. Each dish tasting as the best it can possibly be.
