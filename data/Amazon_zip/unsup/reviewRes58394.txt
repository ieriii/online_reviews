4.5 stars!(dinner review)have had dinner there several times. Each time it's great fun. Creative dishes, great atmosphere, high-end service. What you want in an upper-midrange experience. You can take the in laws there, entertain clients, go with friends. I have heard stories of uneven service, but we've not experienced that (quite the opposite, actually. ours has been top notch).It's also fun just sitting back and saying surprise me and getting anything.They're willing and able to accommodate dietary restrictions and are very attentive to them.Love the cheese sammich :)can't wait to go back!
