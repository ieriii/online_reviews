I loved it. I work in Kentwood, Michigan right, and this guy comes in just randomly and I tell him that I'm visiting Chicago in a week. He's like, "Dude! Reserve a room at the Hotel Felix!" So I go home that night and I am looking around at hotels in Chicago and sure enough Hotel Felix seems legit. Fast-forward... I get to Hotel Felix and it is awesome. Fountain follows the revolving doors as you enter. Dark granite and contemporary furniture are all very welcoming to the eyes. Front desk is very gracious and helpful, and get me checked into my room a few hours before check-in (Major Plus, master hospitality). The rooms are great in terms of looks and comfort. Even the shower has a very comforting home away from home feel. Everything they advertise on their website is there at your disposal. I don't recommend it at all though because I want it all to myself. ;) Enjoy. Have fun! I will DEFINITELY be using this restaurant as my home-base whenever I visit Chicago in the future.
