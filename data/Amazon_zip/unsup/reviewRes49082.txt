i don't really understand the beautiful people comment, but then again i went at 5:30 on a tuesday so it may just been the time of day/week. the service was amazing! our waitress was extremely knowledgeable and brought me different wines to taste even after i had already picked one. we had an oyster sampler and a tuna dish. that and a few drinks turned into a very pricey meal for us but we would definitely go back.
