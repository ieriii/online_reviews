This was by far the best deep dish pizza we had in Chicago. The crust is absolutely perfect, the sauce was soo delicious and the cheese - the cheese is what really takes their pizza to the next level. My husband and I found ourselves thinking about this pizza for days after we had it so we ended up finishing off our trip with one last trip to Giordano's. I absolutely love Chicago but Giordano's makes it even more worthwhile.
