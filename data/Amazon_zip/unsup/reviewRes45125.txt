After reading so many reviews online, we visited Anteprima on 1/1/08. The server seemed knowledgeable and the menu offered a variety of options. The soup that night was a chicken soup and was very tasty, probably the best part of the meal. We ordered the Spaghetti and the Calamari Entree. The spaghetti was a bit oily and a bit dry. For dessert we ordered the chocolate hazelnut tart and the orange cake. The orange cake was horrible, I have never eaten a sponge, but the cake had less moisture in it than cornbread, with a slight bit of orange syrup/flavoring. The chocolate hazelnut tart was mediocre at best. Our server was very kind when he made it over to the table, but even with the restaurant dead, took 10+ minutes to order. If you visit often, and he knows you, you will get great service (if not, you will wait patiently as he spends an excessive amount of time servicing frequent diners). Unfortunately, will not be back, overrated, not sure how anyone can love a place that has extremely bland food and average service.
