I had a chance to meet the owners of Simply It/ Viet Bistro through a Vietnamese cooking clinic that a friend of ours told us about, that they had put together up at their Viet Bistro location off of Devon. It was awesome! We tried their cooking and it was delicious. The head chefs and family were extremely friendly and my wife and I met some wonderful people at that event.  My wife and I on our date night on a Friday and decided to try Simply It after hearing great things about the restaurant. The food was excellent. They atmosphere really nice with a nice step away from the busy bar life off of Lincoln. The walls had nice tasteful artwork across the room to complete the vibe of Simply It. The staff that works there are very friendly and helped make the dining experience.  We tried the crepe shrimp dish and the dumplings as an appetizer and it was delicious. The crepe was almost like a lettuce wrap concept and the food presentation was great. We then ordered a spicy shrimp dish (awesome), mixed vegetable dish over crispy noodles (great sauce) and they gave us a lemongrass chicken dish which was also tasted great. It was also BYOB which was great and they brought out a nice wine chiller for your table as well. The staff was always there to help you out by refilling your drinks, clearing the tables and making sure that everything tasted good.  We had a nice chat with the owner and family during dinner. They are very very friendly and my wife and I had a blast that evening.  We will definitely be coming back and I have recommended it to several other friends already!
