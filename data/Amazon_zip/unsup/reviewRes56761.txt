I have nothing but love for this place, its people and its food. Everything that's good about a neighborhood pizza place can be found here. This is the best pizza outside of Italy and by far the best in the country.I have nothing more to add that hasn't been already written, but one thing: The quality hasn't declined at all after Jon opened the expansion. Keep up the good work Spacca. We'll support you.
