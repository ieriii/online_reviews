To go to Tru and give it anything other than 5 starts would be churlish. I went with my Wife last night, the food is exceptional, certainly as good if not better than Trotters. Without pontificating about the various courses I would just say go try it, but make it for a special occasion. The tasting menus are about as good as it get. The bill's not bad either, about $250 a head. If I were pressed my favourite restaurant would still be Everest, the view gets it for me. I would go back again and fully intend to. Chicago certainly has some fabulous places to wine and dine!!
