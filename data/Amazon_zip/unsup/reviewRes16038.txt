Foccacia at the beginning of our meal was warm and soft...extremely tasty. I had the Ziti Al Vodka...amazing! My friend had the rack of ribs for 10 bucks and he was very satisfied. We drank the Rustico Chianti...it was wonderful and then tried the homemade tiramisu for dessert and loved it! I will go back to this place again and again. I thought the prices were pretty reasonable. Nice ambiance.
