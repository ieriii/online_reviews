I've never had dinner there, but it's by far my favorite lunch place in the neighborhood. I'm a HUGE steak guy so I know that when I go to a steakhouse and order the chicken, it's no joke. Do yourself a favor and swing by Kinzie for lunch. Grab the blackened chicken sandwich on their pretzel roll and I guarantee you'll go back. What they say is true. Once you go blackened, you never go back!
