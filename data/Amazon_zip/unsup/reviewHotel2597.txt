So, I went here as entourage with my hot DJ friend. There was some confusion when we got there as apparently there were 2 DJ's booked in the same time slot by different promotors. Luckily the other guy was super cool and since my girl had confirmation that she was to play in the main room he let her set up and go. Supposedly there is another room somewhere but maybe it wasn't open that night? I don't know, the logistics of the place were kinda confusing... Victor Hotel gets bonus points for a kinda sexy style, and free vodka drinks until 11pm the night we went. It loses some points for nowhere to sit (unless you're bottleserviced up) and weird video screens on the walls showing naked women's shilouettes with bright psychedelic backgrounds, it just didn't really fit but maybe that was the night. I definitely agree with previous posts that someone's experience here can vary a lot depending on who is throwing the party. Some consistency wouldn't hurt, guys... Little bit of a weird/random crowd, but fairly friendly people. Now let's talk about the staff. Sean the bartender is not only smokin' hot but VERY ATTENTIVE. He took great care of both of us and looked good doing it. Thumbs up Sean. Big thumbs up. I wish I could comment on the price of drinks but we didn't pay for any..... sorry! Don't know if we'll be back but it was a fun early night and Lumen is right around the corner for when you need a little more excitement.
