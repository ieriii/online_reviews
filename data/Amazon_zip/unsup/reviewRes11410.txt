Like Lauren H., I'm giving it three stars instead of two for the beer. Worrying Ale is a fine beer. The pizza is ok, but not nearly the best to be had in Chicago. I was there for a friend's birthday party last night. Her husband called a couple weeks ago and said that there would be 12-15 people coming. Whoever he talked to said that they don't take reservations on the weekends, even for large parties. They suggested showing up around 6:00 if we wanted to eat around 7:30. Not only did we not sit down until 8:30, but a whole bunch of large parties apparently had reservations and got tables way before us. Not cool.
