Are you kidding me? I thought I had already reviewed this place! Basically, I love this place to death! Their juices are super fresh, super tasty. Their homemade jams and granola are also really really good. To top it all off, their food is delish! The prices were a little more than what I'm used to paying for brunch, but their portions are HUGE! I always leave here stuffed, yet wanting to come back for more. In each of my experiences, the lines had been out the door, yet we were either seated right away or only had to wait maybe 10 minutes before being seated. The tables are pretty tightly packed, but that just means you can peak over at what your neighbors ordered to help you decide what looks good on the menu =P I've only ever tried their breakfast food, but this is what Meli's is known for! You wouldn't go to a brazilian steakhouse and order salad, so don't come here and get a sandwich (although I hear their sandwiches are very good)!! I recommend any of their platters (nummy cheesy oozy goodness), and their specials are always good as well. I highly highly recommend Meli's. However, if you want would like to come here for a weekend brunch, I suggest not being in a rush as the lines here can get a little long (but that's further proof of this place's awesome-ness). Love it!
