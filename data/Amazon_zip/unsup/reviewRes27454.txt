I definitely want to go back! I went in for dinner quickly before a movie across the street. We were limited in what we could order because we only had 30 minutes, and their pan pizzas take 30 minutes to bak. We got a thin crust pepperoni pizza that I thought was delicious! I prefer thin crust personally, but if we weren't so rushed I probably would have played around with the toppings a bit more. When we arrived it wasn't overly packed, but by about 6:30 there was a bit of a wait for a table. It seems like a really fun atmosphere. It's small and the furniture is old and dated like it hasn't been changed for 20 years. It's a refreshing break from all the super modern bars that care more about the design of a glass or plate than what's going in or on it.
