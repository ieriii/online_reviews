The beer selection is a total mindfuck but that's the virtue of a real beer bar. If you want food then you have to cut through the crowd to the other side of the restaurant. The vibe is totally different in the restaurant section that the res of the bar. The food is good too! The mussels were pretty damn good. But people - lots of people, in fact - go there for the beer. The crowd is very well behaved, all things considered. The bartenders know what they're doing, don't let the retro 50's greaser look fool you! The only knock is that it gets crowded. You can try the upstairs, of course, but it can also get packed. Most of the time you can find space for a party of less than 6 to fit in the space though, which isn't too bad really.
