I hadn't had Chinese food this good in a very long time. Ordered: ma po tofu, fu qi fei pian (spicy beef and tripe), water boiled beef, and pork clam soup Strongly recommend: water boiled beef, pork clam soup Water boiled beef: Really good flavours, really tender beef. It's probably very spicy if you are not used to eating szechuan food. Pork clam soup: Somewhat of an odd combination. Even though this is a clear soup, it was packed with flavours. I would have never thought of combining thick-cut pork with clams, but they worked wonders together. Ma po tofu: I'm pretty sure they used the wrong type of tofu; the tofu chunks were mostly intact, whereas I was expecting a more mushy texture. The flavours were really really good though. Fu qi fei pian (beef and tripe): Again, really good flavours; beef very thin, a lot of surface area for sauce; tripe had very good texture, just the right amount of chewiness.
