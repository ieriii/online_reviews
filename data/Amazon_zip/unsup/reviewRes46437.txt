This place is almost identical to cheesecake factory, it may have the same ownership I think. Big menu, big portions, sort of pricey, but its actually not too bad considering the type of place it is and where it is. The volcano/fudge cake thing is awesome, try that at least once. My big problem with this place is no matter how big the menu is, I always have a hard time ordering here, and when I get the food its nice and big, but doesn't really knock it out of the park for me. Food isn't bad, but there is no real wow factor. The fried chicken, is actually large chicken breasts (no bones!), sigh, there is no truth left in the world. But nevertheless because of location and presentation it remains a decent place to take a group (particularly a group from out of town), the views are good out the windows. Don't be put off by the crowd in the lobby, its never a long wait here. 3.5 stars, rounded up because more often than not, its a place that a consensus of people will agree to when downtown. This and cheesecake are like the deluxe versions of those greek owned diners that populate Chicago.
