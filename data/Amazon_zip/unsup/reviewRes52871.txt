I like their food and it's BYOB! They have this big enclosed patio which makes this a really great place for large gatherings or bday parties. You definitely have to make a reservation for that ahead of time and don't be surprised if you still have to wait a while to get seated (the big groups that come before you are too busy chattering away...it's BYOB, remember?).
