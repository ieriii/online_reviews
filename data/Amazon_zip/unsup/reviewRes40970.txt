My first pho experience and it was a great one. Went here with a big group that was easily accommodated at a big round table. Great food with huge portions and byob to beat. Tried some pre-made spring rolls as well as the make yourself. The make it yourself version were amazing although my didn't look nearly as good at the one the waiter made. I got the standard pho #40. It came with a plate of veggies piled high to add in, literally piled 6' high on a plate, basil, cilantro, jalapenos, bean sprouts and more. I could barely made a dent in the soup and took enough home to eat for a large meal the next day. I loved that the menu had plenty of pictures of the dishes, it really helped me decide what to get. I can't wait to go back and be more adventurous and tumble down the rabbit hole of yummy vietnamese cuisine.
