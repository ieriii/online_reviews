I always find myself in a conundrum when I go to Piece. Their beer is delicious and I love having a tall cold one (or two) before dinner, but as I eat through their scrumptious pizza I always find myself wishing I hadn't had that beer so I'd have room for just one more slice. Piece straddles the line between traditional and inventive pizza, and they handle both with ease. The quality of their ingredients is top notch, and no matter how simple or complicated the toppings you choose, you will have an amazing pie.
