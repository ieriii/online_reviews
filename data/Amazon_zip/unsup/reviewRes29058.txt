Pros: -BYOB, no corkage fee -Banana spring roll dessert was good -Chicken satay appetizer was good -Waitress was sweet Cons: -Host was a bit of a diva -Not much meat in the entrees -Not the most flavorful dish I've ever had (Sauteed veggies with chicken) -Having to stand close to diners' tables while waiting to be seated was a bit awkward What I liked - which may not be good news to some people - is that they really know how to spice things up. I ordered my entree MEDIUM thinking that I would just add chili paste to my liking. However, they packed on the heat. My mouth was burning. I liked that aspect, but other than that, the food didn't have much other flavor. The prices weren't over the top but not as good of a deal as Sticky Rice. I'm glad I tried a different place other than Sticky Rice, only because it confirmed just how much I like Sticky. I would recommend this place for the appetizers or dessert. I probably would not venture over there again. It was just mediocre.
