horchata is superly superb, portions are large, enchilada good, tostada good, taco good, torillas good, the seasoned skirt steak in the fajita was super tender and good. they give you free chicken soup with carrots and potatoes and thats nice cuz it was FREEZIN outside. and its open til midnight on weekends so super convenient. portions were very generous, basically ate nothing all day then ate this and im still full.
