I can't help but feel this place will go out of business soon. The cheese section seems 1/2 what it was 2 years ago. The place seems a lot dimmer (saving money on lighting?), and the whole vibe just seems kinda sad. That being said -best lox in the state (pricey but worth it) -nice beer selection -best bread in the city -nice dessert selection - great cakes/pies -nice place for lunch -nice selection of gourmet foods (honey, spices...)
