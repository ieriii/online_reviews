The food is great here. The chicken is fantastic and the pizza's are all great and unique. I personally love the crust.  The pizzas are decently sized for a couple of people but are a little pricey but well worth paying the extra bucks if you want fresh ingredients and a unique pizza. I ordered the chicken dinner a few times as well. The chicken is great. Its nice and slightly chard and the seasoning is awesome. The two times i did order the chicken they where out of pitas. Its a small thing but I really wanted a pita with this dish. I have ordered the black beans with bacon and mash potatoes on the side. The beans where fantastic but the mash potatoes didn't taste far off from a box of instant mashed potatoes. Delivery wasn't too bad when i ordered. It took about 45 mins. which is what a pizza usually takes. However, I don't know what it is but each time i get the pizza delivered its slightly warm or chilled never hot! Overall its a great place to experience and try out. The food is unique and really flavorful.
