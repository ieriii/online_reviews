This place is awesome!! We went on a Tuesday night and had to wait ten minutes for a table so we wandered over to the bar to order some beer while we waited. I got the Victoria && highly suggest ordering it!! It's an English IPA and totally delishh! At our table we ended up ordering: The Piece Green Salad: Oh my god YUM! Gorgonzola, tomatoes, pecans, lettuce, cucumbers, pears && onions. So good!! A medium white pizza with spinach: Friggin' genius! && the portion size is REALLY good! We couldn't eat more than half of it. Oh and we got more beer, OF COURSE.
