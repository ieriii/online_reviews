Perfect combination: Yummy food from a Bayless restaurant without the usual Bayless price! Had the Choriqueso Torta for lunch and it was absolutely delicious! It was perfectly crunchy on the outside and warm and cheesy on the inside. It was balanced blend of spice and taste and neither overpowered the other. To avoid the crowd I went a little after the lunch hour (around 2pm). I only had to wait in line for about 20 minutes, but as soon as I stepped in 20 people stepped in line behind me. Lucky day! I can't wait to go back again to try the hot chocolate. There were people around me who ordered it and all I could smell and remember the decadence that is Xoco's hot chocolate that continues to haunt my mind. Go Xoco!
