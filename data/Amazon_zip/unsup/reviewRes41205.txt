As far as fine dining goes, Bonsoiree is a very good deal - I just didn't click with everything that was served. Didn't think the food was quite good enough top to bottom to justify having ZERO selection on the menu - You eat what the chef wants you to eat, and you have NO say in the matter. I don't like that attitude especially if you can't back it up. There was this scallop gratton dish that was so ridiculously good I still remember what it tastes like a month later. Probably one of the best courses I've ever been served. There was also the absolute WORST dessert I'd ever been served in my life. A "cookies and milk" platter that consisted of a shot of sour yogurt, a mealy green cookie that tasted like tea and had the consistency of a Snackwells. This other moldy-looking green cookie that I almost spat out, and a black and white cookie that tasted like flowers. Flowers for dessert? Seriously!? Who wants to eat that?
