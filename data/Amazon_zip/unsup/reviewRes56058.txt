AHHH Superdawg I LOVE this place. Born and raised in Chicago, Ive tried all the standard joints...and this one will always be my fave. Their beefy hot dog is soooo good. The fries are so crispy and delicous. And the shakes are THICK. Yeah yeah, maybe its a little pricier but youre getting what you pay for. If you have people in from out of town, bring them here for sure.
