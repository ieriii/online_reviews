Amazing mussels vindaloo. Downside: only one long thin slice of bread was served with it. Upside: when I asked for more, they brought 5 more slices (and these were big long ones too) to the table. Checked the bill: zero charge for the extra bread. Good food, great service. Left a 30% tip. Would definitely come back here to check out the rest of the menu.
