The Marinara pizza is a simple yet flavourful option for vegans. No cheese, just tomato sauce, fresh basil leaves and peppery chunks of garlic. The waiter asked if I wanted to add any vegetables on top; I opted for mushrooms. They were good quality mushrooms - perhaps crimini - not just your standard white buttons. I managed to eat the whole pizza, but generally you would probably have some leftovers to take home. Reasonably priced and a treat for the taste buds. The complimentary glass of prosecco while waiting for dinner companions to arrive was a nice touch.
