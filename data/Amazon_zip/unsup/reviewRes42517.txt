This place is very trendy: It's got an urban, wild wild west thing going on. Without the traditional dinner table set up, the ambiance and set up are cool. A bit loud inside, but it all adds to the ambiance. Dishes are meant to be shared and if you go with 3 people - 2 dishes and an appetizer are a perfect amount. For the appetizer, we ordered the toast with roasted garlic, olive oil, & balsamic. This was delicious! This had incredible flavor, especially if you like garlic. They somehow managed to roast their garlic in a way that made it very un-garlicy, and more sweet. I would recommend the paris mushroom & truffle pasta over the ricotta gnocchi with sage & brown butter. The gnocchi was not bad, it was just a bit heavy. Without being too salty, the mushroom and truffle pasta had great flavor. Happy eating!
