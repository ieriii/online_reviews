WORST SERVICE EVER !!!!!!!!!! I've been here several times, just because it open late and my friend like the food here. Food was pretty good, but I still give them only one star because of SUCK service. Server never revisit the table until the end of the meal. They seem to rush us to order and pay. After getting bill, I and my friends wanted to pay cash. While we were still working on our bill, the waitress stand right at our table, waiting us to pay the bill. I told her to give us a minute, I think she didn't really understand that since she stood still. We gave them exact change and intend to put tip on the table because we weren't done yet with calculating. She counted money right away, and ask us "no tip??" What a rude service is that !!!!! I don't think we even need to leave tip because we didn't get any kind of things that called "service"
