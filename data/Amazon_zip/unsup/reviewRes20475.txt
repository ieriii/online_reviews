This is one of the best sushi restauarants in Chicago. It is BYOB and they deliver. The atmosphere is very nice. I love the decor and the seating. The food is absolutely delicious. I think it has the best dragon roll. It can get very crowded all the time, so you should definitely call to make reservations.
