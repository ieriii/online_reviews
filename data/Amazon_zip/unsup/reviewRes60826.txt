First let me start out my review by the way my experience started out at zed 451... On Tuesday morning I called to make a reservation and spoke with Maria and she had squeezed my party of 2 in for saturday night even though they were all booked up. She did us a huge favor :-) When we arrived on Saturday night we were greeted with nice hello and welcome what it seemed like every host and hostess in the house. One asked us what brought us in that evening and I said our name and to my surprise the young lady who asked us was the receptionist who took our reservation. She escorted us to our seat by a window that only looked out onto clark street but it was window seat none the less before we sat at our table she took us on a quick tour of the harvest table as she remember it was our first time going there. We then started the harvest table which my fiance and I loved. the mushrooms are tasty, the bottom sirloin was juicy and mouth watering. The ribs with the orange sauce were amamzing the meat just fell right off the bone. All the chef's were extremely knowledgable about the meats. Our server was so polite and was on top of our wine drinking he offered one of his favorite reds and one of his favorite whites and to his advice we each had a glass of the Seven daughters white. Wasnt our favorite but wasnt the worst wine. We also had dessert we had the chocolate chip cookie which was the best cookie I have ever had. We had a wonderful time at this resturatant and will recommend this place to all our friends!
