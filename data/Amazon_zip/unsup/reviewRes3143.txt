i'm a fan, and don't eat here nearly enough! you definitely have to be in the mood. but their wings are phenomenal!! seoul sassy is great but i can't eat too much of it (too saucy) - but their other flavors are damn good too. lots of meat, lots of crispyness but not too fried, lots of flavor. if you want wings, i wouldn't bother going anywhere else. the bowls are great too, but i'd stick with wings fo sho. (at least the first stop) great for takeout to eat at home with a few friends, or if you're staying there - belly up at the picnic tables and make friends!
