Went to Gino's East last Fri night with a group of friends. Even though there was a line outside we were seated within 10mins. Overall, great ambience and service. We had the house salad and 2 deep dishes (spinach and sausage). The house salad was very mediocre and salty. The deep dishes were terrible - soggy middle and very dry crust. It looked like someone scooped tomato sauce into the bowl of crust.  Save you money. There are much better places for deep dish.
