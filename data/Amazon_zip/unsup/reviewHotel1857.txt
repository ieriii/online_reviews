In every way but the service, this is a three-star W. After staying at the Lakeshore location with its drool-worthy views and conveniently located Bliss spa, the City Center one was just kind of eh.  That said, the staff did everything they could, both before and during my stay, to make sure I was happy. I e-mailed the manager to ask for a quiet room and request a room upgrade. Done! The Spectacular room was definitely a great size for a room in the middle of a big city, and I loved playing with the big squishy plum-shaped pillow. Other pluses: * Fantastic lemon drop in the lobby bar (it was $14, but it came with a pint-size martini shaker full of lemon drop on the side, so it was really more like two $7 martinis) * Super close to the Blue Line El stop (so convenient to O'Hare!) * Better-than-average room service food * Late checkout * iPod sound dock Although I still prefer the Lakeshore for its views and lack of train noise, the City Center was definitely a pleasant surprise based on some of the negative reviews I read here.
