Fox & Obel's (http://www.foxandobel.com) was opened as "Chicago's answer to Dean & Deluca's". If you're not familiar with D&D's, what that means is that Fox & Obel is an upscale, gourmet supermarket. They stock the freshest fruits, meats and vegetables; have a marvellous in-house bakery; do great sushi -- and you absolutely must come here to drool over, and buy from, their gourmet deli. My favorites from the deli include their single-serving turkey mini-meatloaf, their truffled mashed potatoes, and their Thai vegetable salad. Their cheesemongers are very knowledgeable, with rare and exotic cheeses you might not find anywhere else in the city. They have plenty of organic and vegetarian products, but be clear : this store is about gourmands and quality. They sell house-branded items, such as their spice collection. They have the biggest collecition of olive oils and balsamic vinegars that I've ever seen, as well as a nice beer & wine section. They carried Vosges chocolates long before the company became the hit chocolate darlings they are today, and the store not only encourages suggestions but often puts them into action - or onto the shelves. If you're not local enough to enjoy shopping here, then at least stop in for their wonderful baked goods, or enjoy a meal in their caf. They also have private space available for catering events, and additionally, they host a wide variety of culinary events, ranging from cooking classes to food & wine tastings to celebrity book signings. Yes, the store will impact your wallet, but the quality is SO worth it. I love this store - and my parents love this place so much that it's always on the "must-do" list when they're visiting from Florida.
