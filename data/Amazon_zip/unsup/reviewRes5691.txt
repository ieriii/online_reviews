This place is terrific. Came with a couple of friends and enjoyed a glass of wine on the terrace as we waited for 30 minutes for a table. The place was packed on a Friday night. When called in, we were placed at an awkward seating at a communal table outside - after which complaining they soon moved us inside. We stayed for a while and had a ton off the menu, including the burrata cheese, roasted butternut squash and pumpkin seeds (my fav!), milk braised pork shoulder over mashed potatoes (solid), chicken kebabs over smashed potatoes and tsaziki (mediocre), roasted beets with whipped goat cheese, fried deviled egg, and for dessert the espresso soft ice cream, olive oil soft ice cream (great with a sprinkling of salt) and the chocolate-marshmallow-banana panini. Topped with several glasses of wine the bill came to ~$45 pp, and I thought well worth it.  Great food, and surprisingly not too bad of a tourist trap given the location.
