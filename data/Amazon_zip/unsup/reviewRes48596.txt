Was it the 20-minute wait for our drinks upon sitting? Or was it the family styled sharing that lagged any sort of smart cohesiveness? Maybe it was the over-cooked shrimp and sausage dish, or the bowl of mussels so tiny they needed some spinach to beef them up, or maybe it was the waitress allowing us to under-order for a group of 13. Could it possibly have been the poor sound acoustics (or lack thereof?) that had voices bouncing from floor to ceiling the entire night? Whatever it was, the Publican isn't, and despite 900+ reviews that give this restaurant row darling 4 out of 5 stars - I found the entire evening underwhelming.
