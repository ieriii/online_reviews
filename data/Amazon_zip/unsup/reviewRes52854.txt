I'm always a little baffled when I have a thoroughly "meh" experience at a place with super high average reviews, but here goes... We held our bookclub here last Saturday night. I had a feeling it would take awhile to seat a party of 6, which it did, but that was no problem. A waitress offered us glasses for our BYOB wine while we started and were able to grab a table out front while we waited. Eventually we were seated on the patio, which is adorable. 90 miles was really, really loud - to the point where I could only hear the people seated immediately next to me speaking - but the music had a fun Cuban beat. We started with a variety of empanadas. I only sampled the guava and cheese one, but it was stellar. So far, this visit was off to an amazing start and I was already composing my 5 star review in my head. Unfortunately, no one's entree lived up to this promising start. I ordered the much raved about ropa vieja. All I can say is you people all need to go order it at Conoce Mi Panama then come back and update your reviews. 90 Miles' ropa vieja was okay, but very bland and definitely suffered from the fact that I recently dined at Conoce (which has mind blowing ropa vieja). The rice, beans and plantains that came as sides were very good. I wasn't the only one with this reaction. My friends at the table who ordered the tofu plate and vegetable plate also found their dishes bland and disappointing (And note, the veggie dinner really, really is just a plate of grilled veggies with rice and beans. My friends were expecting something more creative). I will say the sangria mix we ordered was great and all of the staff couldn't have been nicer. I dunno Yelp, I think you got this one wrong. For my future cravings for this sort of food, I'm sticking to Irazu and Conoce Mi Panama.
