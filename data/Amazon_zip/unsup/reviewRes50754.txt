I've been to this establishment numerous times in the past 6 years or so. I have ONLY tried breakfast food. I love their "red eggs" or their wishbone omelet, and that's it. When we go here, it is ONLY for this breakfast. Pancakes are nothing spectacular but I order them for my younger daughter. We have always had decent service, not waited a very long time, and had general good vibes of this place. I am giving it only 3 stars because the CROWD SUCKS. This place is ch auk full of "bad parents", who think it is a playgroup for their whining, annoying, lack of disciplined kids. I have no idea why this place draws the mom crowd with bad kids...but it seems to, because every time I have been there...I have been super annoyed by some table full of kids. I have three of my own, and I am the first to admit they have not always been the "perfect angels" at a restaurant, but I am attentive and take care of situations immediately. My kids also know how to behave in public, unlike some of these kids who are allowed to do ANYTHING they want. I hate to give a restaurant bad rating just because of it's patrons, but sheesh.....it seems to attract all the yuppies who have undisciplined children and they all come in with GIGANTIC strollers that take up space everywhere. I am also giving it just 3 stars because I have tried a couple different things off the menu and never cared for anything except the Red Eggs. Therefore this place is fabulous for this one food dish...and that is why I still brave the annoying crowds to get a taste of my Red Eggs from time to time.
