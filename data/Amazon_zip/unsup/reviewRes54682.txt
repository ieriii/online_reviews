We were looking for a place that could have good and fresh sea food and not overpriced. Here we found it. We have been four times now, and we will keep going. Nice stuff, cozy place. It has live music on the weekends. pretty cool. I always go for oysters and crab legs. I tried the calamary and the crab cakes and they are ok. But the crab legs and definitely the oysters.....mmmmm. Delish!!
