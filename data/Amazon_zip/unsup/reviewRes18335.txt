The burgers are spectacular. Everyone in Chicago has their own burger preference and I'm open to changing my mind, but so far this is the best burger in Chicago for me (and I've tried quite a few). I've tried several of their odd combos and have never been disappointed. I highly recommend the Elvis -- you might not think peanut butter and bacon on a burger would be all that great, but you'll be very pleasantly surprised! They grill the peanut butter first to cook off the oil and then it just makes a very tasty complement to the burger's juices and the bacon's crunch. The beer list won't disappoint, the atmosphere is great, and we've always had excellent service.
