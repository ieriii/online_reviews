I am going between two and three stars here. We had a larger party and were accommodated without everyone needing to be there all at once, which I always appreciate. The first server was nice, but it took about 1/2 hour to make our drinks. She did come back and update us about 25 minutes in, but still a long wait for what we got. We ordered most of drinks off the standard menu, and they 'surprised' my hubby with what I can only call a whiskey chocolate milk. I found the taste to be a little odd and would not order that ever again. Decor is very cozy but the in the front part, the seats are very open and everyone can see you - I suppose if you sit there, that's the point. Just not my style.  Closing the tab was also tre annoying. We each had one drink and were there for about 90 minutes. Perhaps the price of the drink includes a sitting charge? Also, our server changed while we were then and I hate that since you don't know who is getting your mandatorily included tip (hate that too! I know how much to tip, thanks). They also don't allow multiple cards on a bill, so be sure to bring cash. Most drinks run you $12. Bottom line - if you like beer or using your cell phone without being harassed, pass and go to Blue Line down the block instead.
