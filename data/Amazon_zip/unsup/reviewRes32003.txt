Go here to impress someone you like...or someone you want to like you!! :) Dress to the 9's..... my fav's to order (I've ordered other things besides these): Black Cod Crispy spicy tuna or Kobe Salad with pork, ahi tuna and mango I think it is special number #9 sushi roll. **Ask for recommendations...and really interrogate the server to let you know what is outstanding -- not what everyone orders. Yes, there is a difference. **Make reservations in advance any night during dinner, otherwise you will wait in the crowded bar drinking ice filled drinks for $14+ each. They are good......but I think a little deprived of liquid. **I'd skip for lunch. Been there done that. Overpriced for average asian inspired dishes. Service is slow for lunch which is weird because we needed to get back to work! Go for the scene....Stay for the food.
