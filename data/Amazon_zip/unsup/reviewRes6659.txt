A group of friends and I went here for my birthday dinner on a Sunday evening. I was pleasantly surprised to be able to get reservations just a few days ahead of time since I had heard how good Chicago q was. And it was GOOD. Those comp chips and pickles are no joke. We ate them all and and could have gone through another bowl of each. The chips had an awesome BBQ spice on them, and the pickles were spicy, sweet, and so delicious. I could sit at the bar with a drink and just munch on those and be a happy camper. We got the hush puppies for an appetizer, and they were awesome. Crispy outside, soft and fluffy inside, and the chipotle mayo dipping sauce had one hell of a kick, but it was really good when used in moderation. For dinner I had the pulled pork sandwich, which is crazy huge. You will NOT go home hungry, that's for sure. It was served on a giant pretzel roll and a huge chunk of delicious cornbread. And the pork is served plain so that you can sample all 4 of the awesome sauces they bring out. The honey mustard and traditional BBQ were my favorites. They were kind enough to bring a plate of cookies with a candle and cold glass of milk since it was my birthday too. The chocolate chunk cookie was really, really good :) Also, our waiter was great. Service is definitely a priority of this place. Overall, a really good meal! I'll be back.
