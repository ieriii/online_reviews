This place doesn't need another 5 star review... but I love it. I have to say, I've never paid for a meal here which may be why I love it so much. I had a boss take out group here and I've been with visiting family members. All have picked up the check. I know you're not supposed to fill up on the salad bar but everything is so good and so fresh! If I didn't love meat I could dine just on the salad bar. They even have hearts of palm which I never see and adore. The side dishes you get are fried plantains, mashed potatoes, polenta, and these amazing bread things. I hate bananas and their mashed potatoes are just ok, but the polenta and bread are addictive. I try to avoid them so I don't fill up on them but we've already established that my willpower is nonexistent. The meat is why you come here... it's never ending meat. And it's good meat, nothing cheap. People just walk around with meat on skewers and cut you slices. If you see a type of meat you'd like to try you can request that they send that person your way... they're usually there in under 2 minutes. The staff works really hard and they make them wear terrible costumes so kudos to them. I need more people to visit me so they can buy me dinner here more often.
