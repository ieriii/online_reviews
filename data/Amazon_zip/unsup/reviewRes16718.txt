I'm so glad India House is here. There aren't really any Indian restaurants in this area so it's nice to have a place to get my fix. Both times I've come here, I've had a great experience although they were very different.  The first time, we came on a Friday for dinner after work. The mood was somewhat romantic, although I was just there with a friend. We were totally overwhelmed by the gigantic menu so we asked the waitress for advice. She recommended some naan for us, as well as two vegetarian paneers. Everything was awesome! We barely finished anything, and were SO stuffed afterwards. Yes, it was a bit on the pricey side but we did get so much food. Most recently, I came here with a group from work for lunch. We chose to do the buffet option and I was overwhelmingly impressed! I know Indian food is great for vegetarians, but this was amazing. Out of the 13 or so options, only 3 were not veggie friendly. I wanted to try everything, but I couldn't fit it all on my plate! Everything I tried, I loved. I couldn't tell you what it all was, but everything I had was incredible. Definitely a great lunch option!
