I liked this place! We stayed for a wedding in December & the Allerton staff were really fun, and professional! The ballroom on the top floor is absolutely beautiful, but can feel a little small when there are lots of guests. I was sweatin' on the dance floor & bumping into everyone, so maybe it's better for a small wedding but we all had fun. Beautiful room though. Wedding organizer should have handled the reception bar set-up better too for a hotel on THE Michigan Avenue. It took a while to get a drink because there was only one bar for so many people.Another thing that could have been improved on was the main/only entrance. It's just an entrance with no grandeur, but when you get up to the 3rd floor the hotel comes to life. The elevators are ridiculously slow. It's an old, historic hotel though, so if you know that going in, the quirks are really endearing.P.S.  My bed was great! So comfortable, and the room was small but clean and well-decorated. Room size was not a big deal. It was comfortable, pretty, & clean, AND I had hot water, unlike some other guests in previous posts. I'd stay at The Allerton again in a heart beat. I'm sure they'll keep improving as they get feedback.
