My third time here, this time was for my birthday/graduation and I still love this place. Lamb chops, beef ribs, filet, garlic steak...all so good. Great mash and plantains at the table, and the salad bar is so fresh and delicious. The service is also always impeccable, and a guy in front gave us the lunch price deal even though they don't do lunch on Saturdays. I also got a free strawberry cheesecake too. Great food, great service, great atmosphere. Meat heaven.
