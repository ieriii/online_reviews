After hearing nothing but rave reviews about brunch, I decided to check this place out. I was impressed with their wide selection at the harvest table. I was really looking forward to the chicken and waffles. Sadly I was disappointed with the buffalo chicken and waffles. Other than that the meat selection was on point and the wait staff was very friendly.
