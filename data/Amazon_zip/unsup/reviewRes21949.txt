This spot is definitely a must try at least once! The traditional drive-in of talking into a menu box and having servers deliver a tray filled with food to hang on your window is an experience that is a rare find in America these days.  Since I don't live in Chicago, I can't agree or disagree that this is a traditional Chi-town dog. But I can say that the dog was pretty good; the uniquely packaged dog, filled with fries definitely hit the spot. The pickled tomato was interesting, definitely something that I wasn't expecting. Although it is a bit out of the way and not really in traditional Chicago, it's definitely worth the trip to experience at least once. And the over sized hot dog man and wife on the roof is a nice touch.  If I'm ever back in Chi-town, I'll definitely make another trip.
