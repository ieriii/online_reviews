My husband and I have eaten at this reast. 3 or 4 times over the last few years. It is always outstanding. Last weekend I had the homemade pappardelle noodles with prosciutto ragu and it was outstanding. Everything we've ever eaten here has been first rate. Serivice is friendly and nice. My only criticism - is that it is a very crowded space. It's a little hard to maneuver around the reast. at times - but totally worth it.
