I loved the dinner I had here. I had the braised beef appetizer on plantain, and the ceviche sampler. The ceviche was so fresh and light tasting. It was the highlight of the dinner. The decor was fun, and huge! Service was great .. OuR server recommended some things we normally wouldn't have ordered and they were great.  Will definitely come back.
