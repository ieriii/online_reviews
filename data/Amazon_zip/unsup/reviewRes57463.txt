Plaka in Athens, Greece is my favorite Greek restaurant. However, if you cannot make it to Athens, go to Greek Islands. My parents started going to Greek Islands when they were dating. Now, over twenty-five years later, my family and I go to Greek Islands regularly. Starting when you pull up for the valet, which is free by the way, I'm always greeted by the smiling valet service. Depending on the night, you may have to wait for a table, but it is worth the wait.Olive oil with delicious, crunchy, and soft bread and water is immediately set on the table. The service is always wonderful and I have never had a bad experience. All the food is incredible. Thankfully, we all share as a family, so I do not have to decide on only one thing to eat. The following are my favorites and they are all incredibly delicious. Saganaki (Flaming Cheese- a must appetizer)Calamari (Squid- perfectly done)Mousaka (Greek lasagna)Avgolemeno (My favorite rice soup)Traditional Greek Salad (Clean and crisp)Combination Plate (A little bit of everything that I love... Arni Fournou, Mousaka, Briami, Rice Pilafi- Amazing)Rice PilafiArni Fournou (Lamb)Garides (Shrimp over rice and an amazing sauce)Briami (Mixed vegetables)If you are in Chicago or Lombard (they also have other locations) and you want great Greek food, go to Greek Islands!
