We were invited to join friends here on a Saturday night. The restaurant was very busy but we got great attention from the staff. Two of us decided to each order something and share. I didn't have my reading glasses and, as soon as I was served, asked what the small white items were on my salmon. When I learned it was scallops - something that I am deadly allergic to - I attempted to pass the plate to my friend. The wait staff immediately jumped to as the plates were very hot, and insisted that they were redo the order. My friend loves scallops and kept that dish while I was happy with the steak but the manager came to the table and insisted that they would supply me with another piece of salmon, plain. The only thing that I did not like about the restaurant was the amount of tourists showing up dressed to mow the lawn.
