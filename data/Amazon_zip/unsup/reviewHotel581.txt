From the minute we pulled into the entrance to the time we pulled out, we experienced incredible customer service. Our room was beautiful, unique, white, cool, crisp, hip, trendy, minimalist, soft, and stocked. The sheets and bed were so comfortable that we slept til 10 each day...among other things ;-) Very cool hotel. They really remade this into an instant classic.
