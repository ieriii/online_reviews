Update: Sultan's Market seemed to have taken a turn for the worse since my last review. Service... it's always been, shall we say - terse. Now it's as if the don't care anymore. Food...always fresh with generous portions. Now the servings are skimpier and I can pretty much count on it being limp and cold. (The lentil soup is the only exception :)) Again, I really don't they care anymore. I guess nothing lasts forever.
