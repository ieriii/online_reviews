I've been meaning to come here for awhile. Everyone keeps raving about the oatmeal shakes. Well, I didn't have the oatmeal shake. I did have something called "Lava Juice" which was a watermellon/lime juice concoction. It was a really hot day and I could've had a whole pitcher of that. So refreshing and wonderful. I was a little disappointed with my meal. It was just "eh" (shrug shoulders). My friend (who is costa rican) got something delicious though... it was some sort of dish with green plantains, fried and served with dipping sauces (one was some kind of garlic spread). Those were delish. My advice: pick a sunny day, grab some sunglasses, sit on the patio, get some lava juice and some of their appetizers and enjoy. The meals are unremarkable. Sorry Irazu.. .I want to love you. Maybe I'll get a milkshake next time and you'll change my mind.
