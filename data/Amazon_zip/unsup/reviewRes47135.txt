Best of the best. When people ask me what my favorite restaurant in Chicago is - Uncommon Ground is my answer. I know you could have more adventurous culinary experiences in Chicago, but my criteria includes the whole picture including a solid company mission. Uncommon Ground is the quintessential green restaurant - first organic rooftop garden complete with bees, they favor local farmers and produce, they give back to their community in multiple ways...the list goes on and on. AND the food is tasty. There's also good coffee, and good alcohol to round out the menu which is important to me. Plus, they host a slew of special of events that are fun and educational - like beer dinners and movie nights. The only thing to make it more perfect would be an emphasis on baked goods and particularly gluten-free - but that's my own bias. Otherwise, it's a great place for a satisfying meal and a great place to patronize because they are doing good to the world, too!
