OPA!  Best saganaki I've ever laid my lips on. The presentation was as expected with the high flame presentation right at the table. I love that shiz. I love Greek food, and this place tops my list. The gyro meat was perfectly seasoned, and cooked as I like it with the crispy edges. The food never stopped coming. Every time I thought I was finished eating, a new entre came out. I love hefty servings and options and they have both. I have never really loved baba ganoush (always ordered it just so I could say it) until I had it from this place. I don't know what they put in it, but it's like buttah. We were with a very large party in the banquet room and we had plenty of servers and they always kept our plates and glasses full.
