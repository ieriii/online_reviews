Drooling again, sorry, gotta wipe up my keyboard. I wanna go back to those duck fat fried cheese fries. And that chicago hotdog, with that fresh bread and lettuce, mustard mayo. ketchup. What I don't wanna go back to is that freaking line. I didn't think it would be that cold outside and the line so Long. The only time I can drop by is the same time those other people can drop by. You guys try staying outside in the could. Doug's - you better open up another local branch. I can wait for that. I can't stand going there and waiting in line out in the cold. I feel like a hobo lining up for a good meal.
