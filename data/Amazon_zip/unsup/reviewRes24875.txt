Went to Geja's. Yes, it was good but not as good as everyone says. I think the experience is great but I am not sure if Geja's is as great as people make it out to be. It was so dark that I almost ran into poles going to the bathroom. Luckily we went during the week so we had our space. The tables (other than the booths) are so close together! I would feel really akward eating here on a crowded weekend night. I have been to Melting Pot and thought that was a better experience. It was well lit and had more choices of cheeses, chocolates and oils.  Ordered 2 premium dinners which included cheese fondue, salad, chocolate fondue, and dinner fondue (chicken and shrimp; beef and lobster) along with 2 glasses of wine. Total with tip was $128.
