THE place for jazz. Everybody else posting here pretty much nailed the decor and ambiance. A total step back in time. Now mind you, this is traditional jazz--piano, brushes on the snare, upright bassist...Never got that into jazz in its purist form--try the underground wonder bar in gold coast for the contemporary form with alot of energy. Unfortunately, lots of jazz snobs telling you not to talk. I mean , I like to hear the music too, but I also don't want to just sit in a library either. Sometimes the whole room just sits in absolute silence--kinda weird especially if you want to talk with your date.Gets pretty crowded the later it gets--you might end up standing. Poetry slam on sundays--kinda like sitting in someone's living room and playing charades..it's fun though, really! Lots of parking on the streets, but don't park too far and just get to the venue as this is definitely not the kind of neighborhood you just want to sightsee in..be careful! Great place, a must see on everyone's list.
