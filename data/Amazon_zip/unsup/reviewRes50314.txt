Partner and I rode our bikes to Andersonville Saturday morning for breakfast. This was our first time to Big Jones; it won't be our last. The space is beautiful; the service is impeccable. The food is unique (to this part of Chicago anyway) and delectable. Partner loved his crab cakes and I enjoyed my Chaudin (porcine meatloaf). My one, and only, critique is that my breakfast was just a tad salty to my (salt-sensitive) taste. I think it was the red eye gravy which dressed the chaudine. Our server was most enthusiastic about the establishment and it was very apparent that it was a genuine enthusiasm. I appreciate that. While the price point keeps it out of our regular rotation it's definitely a destination spot for aspecial breakfast/brunch.
