Today was my 3rd time to Zed 451 for brunch so obviously I loved the place. Today was a disaster! I invited 3 friends along, 2 of which had never been. We had a 1p reservation and were IGNORED trying to be seated while others were being seated and many tables sat empty, 20 minutes later finally got a seat. So there is a 'Harvest Table' and then passed items. The Harvest table was not replenished and some items were never available even thought the server raved about them. We received the passed items in a terrible order, such as, 'now that your finished eating how about some of our fabulous bacon'. We were passed over for the crab cakes with poached, eggs, turkey, and buffalo chicken and waffles. That is quite a few items AND we requested out server have them sent over multiple time and never did! The server with the steak got meat juice all over the table and my dress and just walked away. My friends had to beg for refills of coffee and ask for the fruit to be replenished, it was unacceptable and embarrassing!Never again.
