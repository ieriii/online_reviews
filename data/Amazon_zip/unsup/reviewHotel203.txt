Great location and price. However beware of pullout like most sofas this is a horrible bar thin mattress. As a sofa it also is lacking just sitting on the plastik short sofa will give you a back ache. Hilton should be embarrassed! I've slept in other suite's sofa pull outs that are so much better. There also isn't one comfortable chair in the two rooms. Also if breakfast isn't included, head to the Westin for fresh baked goods, or cross the street down to the Pantry for your cereals, milk, juices, sodas and frozen goods (microwave in room) as well as liquor items. Basically its a standard hotel, standard service but a block from the Mag Mile, close to the bus line - cant be beat!
