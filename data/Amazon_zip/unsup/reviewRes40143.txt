Only great experience with food but service is something else. I feel like Apple and AT&T haha!! My friend experience was a year ago. About 24 appetizers, yes, it is a complement!! Many dishes are interesting, especially raw meat. Grill menus have never disappointed me and friends. But please, this is Chicago, speak to us and suggest new customers something. New customers need to bring your friend there with you otherwise you might not enjoy and get first experience there. Best time to go is 6pm or during the day cuz not too crowded. The rating I gave is about foods.
