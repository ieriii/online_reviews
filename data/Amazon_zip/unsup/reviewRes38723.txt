I understand that some people gave reviews of this place factoring in the forty minute wait. When you see this pizza, you understand that it is physically impossible To make this masterpiece of cuisine in less than forty minutes. When we went with our group of four Chicago novices, we got seated immediately. Our waitress came by an warned of the forty minute cooking time rigt off the bat, so we ordered the cheesy breadsticks while we waited for our pizza. The breadsticks were th perfect mix of crunchy outside and soft inside, and the cheese on top was browned properly. It came with tomato sauce for dipping, which you could tell was going to taste reat on the pizza. When the pizza did arrive (medium pepperoni and onion) the waitress served each of us our first slice. It was literally about 2 inches thick! The cheese was perfectly gooey, and the crust complimented the whole thing, and wasn't overcooked at all! Overall, a flawless execution by a Chicago institution.
