After reading all the good reviews my husband and I decided to try this place out. This restaurant has no air conditioning, it was so hot that we had to order our food to go. The food was fair, the servers were friendly and helpful. This place definitly has a Miami feel. Don't think I will be going back...no Wow factor here
