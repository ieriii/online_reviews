oil, meat and veggies. For me, this is always a winning combo when we're talking about dinner. Gejas is small and crowded and dark, but it's also a lot of fun to cook your own food. I came here with a group of friends and we had a fun time. Know that you will leave smelling like oil and for goodness sake JOIN THE EMAIL list if you have any desire to get a good price. They send me "free dinner with the purchase of one dinner" certificates ALL the time. In the mail. Over e-mail. doesn't matter. Do it - and you get half-priced dinners whenever you want!
