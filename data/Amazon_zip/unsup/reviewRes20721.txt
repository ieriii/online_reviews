i've been meaning to update my review for a while now.  the Gage has always been one of my favorites, and they've gotten better and better over time. the menu changes frequently, and there always seems to be something new and interesting to try. pretty much everything on the menu is done well.  i still think this is one of the best restaurants in the area.  don't forget to try the whiskey tasting.
