I was def. impressed by this place; had a chance to check it out 2 weeks ago. Wow on the line too!! Can't believe how many people were there. anyways enough about the line; seems like a line will always be there on a weekend. So be prepared for that. The gourmet toppings on the sausages are ridiculous; excellent quality and they know what works with what! simply put the wait in line is def. worth the trip. To avoid the line go early; way before they open!!
