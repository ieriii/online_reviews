we found this place because of that one show on tv...."dives diners and drive-ins" we are very very pleased with the food here.  the sandwich called "Pepito" was so freakin good.  also the empanadas were very tasty too.  we r going again this week n taking some friends.  i'd highly reccommend this restaurant. :) enjoy.
