I have come here a handful of times. (I would frequent this place more often if I had more money).  Every dish I've ever had here is MAGNIFICENT! I've been here twice for New Years Eve and two other times just for dinner/lunch. The service is good as well as the decor, but mainly, the food is gooood!! Even their chicken fried rice is awesome! A few dishes I've had here that are good are the Banh Uot, Bo Loc Lac, Bun Thit Nuong, which I recommend.  They also participate in Restaurant week, so try it out!
