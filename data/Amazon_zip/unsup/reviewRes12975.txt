I have been going to Texas de Brazil for quite some time, but the last visit will surely be my last for awhile. The service was fine and the food salty. I love the salad bar, but that is really the only thing that stand out. At the end of the meal the waiter didn't accept my coupon for reasons I am still unsure of. I filed a complaint on their website and was given the same useless coupon I had tried using in the first place! I could not believe the lack of interest they had in keeping me as a customer. I'd much prefer Fogo de Chow in the future or maybe ZED451.
