WOW!!!! Staff super nice and welcoming!!! Cute little location on Clybourn, perfect for carryout. It reminds me of the Cuban version of Potbelly's. I had the Lechon sandwich, it definitely hit the spot! I heard a lot of good things about it, so slightly apprehensive on how good it could really be. It did not disappoint. I also had the empanada (beef)---Delicious. Definitely not a diet spot, meaning it's slightly but not overwhelmingly greasy. My friend is a vegetarian and they have the option of Tofu sandwich and grilled cheese. Tip: Call in your order, it'll save time especially during the busy hours. Try it!!
