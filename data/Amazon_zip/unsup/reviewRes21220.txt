If you want something a little nicer than your typical taco joint, but don't want to give up quality, this is your place! We shared some chips and guacamole and the veggie enchiladas. Both were really quite good Their house salsa is really great as well. It has a very nice spice to it! My favorite part are the wonderful margaritas! This is by far my favorite drink and I'm always on the lookout for the best in the city. Mayan Palace's are definitely at the top of my list right now! They're half-off on Tuesdays, so stop in! :o)
