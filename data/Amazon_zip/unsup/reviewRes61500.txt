This place is on my top 10 list for pilsen. I'm never a morning person but when i can be having sleeping problems and get $3 breakfast at 7 in the morning, or i can be coming home around 9pm and get a late dinner for about $5. that is key. also i noticed is the complimentary soup i had was plain noodle soup. usually i get chicken noodle soup and i don't eat meat so i turn it down but there's no chicken in this soup! also their salsa is hot, not as in spicy but warm. i've never had warm salsa at mexican resturants either. they even have a vegetarian part on the menu, which is very rare in a mexican resturant, let alone in pilsen. on top of it all, it is connected to a little store, so if you want to shop for some stuff, it's right there. overall this place rules, especially if you're poor and healthy.
