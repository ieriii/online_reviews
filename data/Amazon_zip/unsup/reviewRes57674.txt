Really good, inexpensive, traditional mexican. Can be a little greasy. Everybodys mom makes it better, but this is as close as you are gonna get. The outside of the place is very cute painted. You get chips and two kinds of salsa when you sit down, the prices are pretty low tamales were $6 and came with rice and beans. A good place overall and polite service
