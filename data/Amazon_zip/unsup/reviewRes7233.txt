Overall, we love Sapori Trattoria's great service and delicious food. It is a fun place to go on a date. Our wine or water glasses were never empty and every staff member was courteous and polite. We were seated promptly at our reservation time. My favorite menu items?  Pumpkin Ravioli and the Asparagus Salad w/Goat Cheese. They also mix very strong delicious French Martinis if you like those! It is a cute little place overall. However, it can get pretty loud in there if you're dining between 6-8p but if you come a little later in the evening it calms down and the atmosphere is more relaxed. The backroom is much more quiet but during summer I think it is more fun to be seated up near the open windows.
