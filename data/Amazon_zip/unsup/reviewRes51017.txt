My friend Casey and I had a great dining experience. It was my 36th birthday and our waiter took excellent care of us. We ordered the Tuesday special, Fried Chicken and it was delicious. It came with cornbread and mashed potatos and greens. Plus, we enjoyed the Tuesday special of $5.00 Margaritas. I highly recommend the Pomegranate. It was yummy! To top it all off our waiter treated us to a slice of red velvet cake. It was a great dining experience and a memorable birthday! I also have been here for brunch a number of times and recommend that as well. They have awesome fried green tomatos too. This has become one of my favorite dining destinations!
