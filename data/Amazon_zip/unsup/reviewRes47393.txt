I've eaten at Lockdown 3 times now. The first time was carry out, and the food was amazing. The second time, my friends and I had dinner and drinks there, and again, I was very pleased. Last week, I had a friend at my apartment and thought what would be better than Wine and a truffle burger? Sounds fantastic. We received our food in half the time Grub Hub said it would be here, and it was looking to be a great night. However, I ordered my burger medium, and what was delivered was raw on the inside. I don't mean rare, I mean raw. I'm a life-long fan of red meat, and I eat my steaks nearly purple, but this was beyond the point of consumption. Nuking it would have ruined the cheesey/shallot toppings, so I was pretty disappointed. Since I've had 2 out of 3 great outings here, I just knocked it down to 3 stars. Here's hoping it was just a bad chef, or a really busy Thursday night.
