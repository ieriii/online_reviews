I took my parents here as a thank you for bringing me some furniture from out of state. I have to admit I expected more based on what I have heard about this place. I know this is the new location..the ambiance honestly reminded me of like an Olive Garden. I would no longer describe it as 'cozy' or a 'hole in the wall' as it used to be referred to. We ordered the variety empanadas and my dad had never had any before so I was excited for him to try it out. They were very average.  I wish it was still BYOB...I know it is during the week but not on the weekends - that is annoying for sure. Minus one point on that alone.  We ordered a bottle of wine, which took 20 minutes to get to our table and the waiter seemed to have difficulty with English (he tried really hard and I give him credit for that). He brought the wrong bottle of wine to us - luckily I caught it before he opened it. Then he dropped my credit card in his apron and I thought I was crazy because I kept looking for it everywhere. These things happen... it's not a big deal but it's certainly not the service at Trump Tower. We split this one dish that was basically 1 of everything on the menu (ribeye, skirt steak, chorizo sausage, all of the plaintain varieties, grilled shrimp, ocotupus, calamari, etc). It was HUGE HUGE HUGE amount of food. The meet was definitely the best. I think the ribeye and shrimp were pretty good. Nothing overly memorable though. I think it was like $60 for the dish which is a lot but there was so much food and variety we were ok with it. I didn't have one but the drinks they were making at the bar looked amazing. My parents seemed to think it was good. Maybe I am becoming jaded with all of the options in Chicago. The food wasn't bad..it just wasn't..awesome. I wish I had taken them to Coobah.
