I loved loved loved this place!!!! I was taken here for my birthday as a surprise back in May by a really great friend. I had been wanting to check this place out for almost a year I think, ever since I saw it featured on check please a while back. We had the 7 course with the duck duck goose added on. I should have written this review months ago so that I could have all the dishes fresh in my memory, but I just barely started yelping last month....I just remember enjoying every single dish. Everything was absolutely delicious and beautifully presented. One little cute unexpected detail I remember is that one or two of the dishes were to be eaten with chopsticks...being (half) asian it just made me smile. I will definitely go back, most likely for their no menu sundays....cuz i love surprises ^_____^
