I came here a few weeks ago w/a friend on a Saturday night. I was doing a vegan cleanse (I'm also gluten free) so I was looking forward to having some yummy food. We were both there a few years ago & had a somewhat pleasant experience so we were looking forward to a good dinner. But dinner wasn't only good, it was great! Our server was also wonderful! There was just something about her I liked, she was genuine- not overly peppy but very friendly in a down to earth kinda way. I had the gazpacho which was okay but my dinner was so delicious! I had a portobello sandwich on gf bread & it was outstanding. The vegan cheese tasted like cheese! I don't think you should eat any kind of cheese on a regular basis but I would pick this cheese over the hormone & antibiotic laced kind when I feel like indulging. I chose the mashed potatoes & gravy as my side & it was yummy! Next time I'll ask for extra gravy but lesson learned ;-) We also had vegan shakes that were unbelievably delicious! If you're used to dairy milk shakes, then no, these may not taste the greatest but if you're like me & haven't had dairy in months, than the vegan shake is going to satisfy your craving. Again, it's not something I would recommend drinking every day but it was so tasty! I craved the whole meal for weeks after this visit & now that I'm reliving it, I think I may have to visit again this weekend! Oh & I've been here with carnivores who will eat anything & everything and even they found the food tasty so give it a try, meateaters!
