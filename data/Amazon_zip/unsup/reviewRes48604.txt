Publican is the quintessential new-age Chicago eatery. Coming from Portland I've learned to take a what-the-heck approach to dining out. You may not know much about the place or even be able to decipher the menu but that just doesn't matter. Its family style so what you order everyone eats. It comes in courses so its a fantastic place to go with friends, have fun, chat, etc. The trout was amazing, Octopus was *not* what I expected and equally amazing as well. The waffle for dessert is to die for. And I can't write a review without echoing other sentiments: GET THE FRIGGIN' PORK RINDS. Yes, that good. I'll recommend it, I'll go back when I'm in Chicago and I certainly won't forget that dinner at the Publican. (Shout out to Melissa for the recommendation).
