Had the Wild Boar Sloppy Joe. Wasn't too fond of the fries but it was a large portion. I also enjoyed the the Clam Chowder!!! I wanted more of the Chowder. Everyone ordered several items that included Lobster Tator Tots, Bone Marrow and Pork Loins. Everyone enjoyed everything. I would definitely come back here during my next visit to Chicago.
