The Diner is a vegan's dream. The vegan shakes are to die for. I love the biscuits and gravy offered at brunch. The seitan caesar salad is a wonderful light meal, the "chicken parmesan" sandwich is flavorful and filling. The desserts can be hit or miss, but I love the cocoa chip cheesecake.  I don't generally enjoy their wines, but my husband likes their beer selection. He's also a diehard fan of the Philly "steak sandwich."
