My wife and I just ate here last week for the first time. It is a really nice place to eat! The portions were very sizable, as I would expect from an Italian restaurant, and the price was actually quite affordable. I had ravioli, which was outstanding.They seem to have a pretty extensive wine list for those who are interested. Overall, it was a very satisfying dining experience. The wait staff was friendly, and residential parking was ample within a block, not to mention they offer valet service if you choose that route. We'll definitely go there again.
