My head was spinning from the high alcohol content beer and other drink consumed during my meal at the Publican. I need to go back. Highlights: Oysters were fantastic -- creamy, cool, oceany and satisfying. Watermelon and tuna thing; tuna crudo- nice combo of sweet and savory and the textures were nice together. I'm not doing this place justice with my crappy review but I'll definitely be back. The room is beautiful, service was great, the beer list is extensive. We had a nice little bottle of something called Innocent Bystander at the end which was delicious.
