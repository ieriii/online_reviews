Today we had Aventura de viernes for our Adventure Friday outing. I had been here before with a school groups of up to 85 students so I thought a more intimate visit might be fun. We got a delicious nibble to start and 3 kinds of salsa plus chips. Our gringa mouths couldn't handle any of the salsas so they brought us a special one, perhaps Salsa de Wimps but at any rate it was much appreciated and super accommodating.  We all had the combination plate with probably the best tamale I have ever had in my life. The beef taco was yummy, the tostada delicioso and the enchilada too picante for me - my daughter got hers cheese only and it was much less fiery. We all had a pop, sat and talked and paid the bill plus a 20% tip for 10.00 a person. (Cash only) Wow, magnfico.
