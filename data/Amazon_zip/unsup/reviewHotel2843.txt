If you're using Google maps, it will probably direct you to the service entrance. The main entrance is fairly obvious, but you might have to go around the block to find it. Really nice view from most of the rooms, either of the river and lake or of the city. If you're someone who likes to exercise, this hotel is literally one block from the paved lake-side trail. The trail goes all the way down to the museum campuses (and the yacht club and Navy Pier). There are also rental kayaks and bikes available just below the bridge...so you can literally find stuff to do right outside your hotel door. The hotel gym is ample and there is evidently an LA Fitness nearby, which I saw pop up on my Yelp app. I walked by one other gym. I was disappointed in the quality of the towels, but the bed was fantastic. Spacious suite, with not only bedside outlets for your phone (and desktop outlets for your laptop) but TWO ipod/phone radios so I was able to listen to my own music. The stars were lost due to cleanliness. In the hallway (26th floor) there was a half-eaten cookie and TWO dental picks which stayed on the ground for well over 24 hours. That is just foul. In our room, there was a gummy worm on the floor. We only brought gummy watermelons. Again, foul. However, we did not receive any bug bites, which I always worry about when staying in a pricier hotel in a large city. Valet is quick, taxis are always right outside the door. Lots of restaurants within walking distance.
