The fianc and I went to Big Jones tonight 'cause I had a major hankering for a good Mint Julep. Yep, they delivered - it was delicious. BUT, items from the bar take soooooo loooong. Thirsty, hungry fianc was not pleased. And our server did not take our order until she delivered our drinks. Grrr. Didn't they know I was hungry and had someplace to be? But then the food started coming out. First was three cornbreads with butter, So yummy... with a smattering of whole corn kernels in them. There was a slight red pepper feel on the tip of the tongue and the cornbread was so soft and moist, it almost fell apart as you were picking it up. Mmmm, divine. For an appetizer we had the Cheddar-Herb Croquettes. Nice flavor and texture - it's served with Green Goddess dressing (I could drink that stuff by the mug full it's so good). The fianc's entree was Shrimp and Grits (Laughing Bird Caribbean white shrimp, house tasso ham gravy, creamy grits). OhSoGood! He was a bit dismayed with the smallish serving size, but I think that by the time he was finished with his meal he was perfectly satisfied, and not the typical "oh, I ate so much it hurts." The flavors were amazing. He may have even had room for dessert, which *never* happens when we go out! I had the creamy cucumber gazpacho soup and the Roasted Fresh Hearts of Palm salad (cane-glazed pineapple, pea shoots, spiced peanuts, fried shallot, boiled peanut-ginger vinaigrette). Deeeelicious - and the perfect choice for a warm and muggy day. So based on this experience I'm giving Big Jones a fourth star. They need to get the bar service a little better coordinated with the pace of the meal, but the food was spot on. I will definitely be going back! Oh, and they have Metropolitan Brewery beers on the menu. Love to support our local brewery!
