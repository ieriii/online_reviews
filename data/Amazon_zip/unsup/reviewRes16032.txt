My family and I were in Chicago for the night and the manager at the hotel recommended this restaurant for dinner. And we were not disappointed. We ordered a salad and two pizzas (one thin crust and one stuffed). First came out the free bread that comes when you order and goodness, that pizza bread or whatever you call it was SO good. If that's all I had to eat I would have been more than satisfied. I'm not sure specifically what salad we got, but it was on top a piece of bread(a crostinni I believe). It was good but it was way big-we easily split it between the 4 of us and it was still a lot. Then the pizzas came. The thin crust was very tasty-the flavors of the cheese, sauce and crust all blended and complimented each other very well. The stuffed crust was really good too but I could only have a slice otherwise I think I would have gotten sick of it. We definitely had some leftover pizza afterwards. The meal was definitely filling, but it was some seriously good, tasty Italian food and I could recommend this place in a heartbeat to anyone. Also-we went to the restaurant around 6pm, so in the midst/start of dinner time rush and we all couldn't believe the incredible service at Calo's. Everything was delivered super quick and by the time we realized we needed water refilled, our waitress was there with water. So on top of great food, this restaurant has top-notch service too, which is definitely a plus for me.
