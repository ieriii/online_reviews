The menu here is huge!! And it's cheap!! And the portions are huge too!! My faves at this super casual place are the pho with oxtail (with added meatballs, yum!!), the bun (noodle salad) with pork and egg roll and the Bnh Xo.  The spring rolls can be iffy here because it seems they pre-make them now so it's not as fresh as they could be. If you want bahn mi I'd probably steer to you Ba Le. But the grilled pork dish with the rice and fried egg is a pretty good home-style food if you're in a porky kinda mood. They also offer fruit smoothies with the tapioca balls and fresh squeezed sugar cane juice. A downside to this place is if you have a small party they might seat you in a large table where you could be sharing with 2 or 3 other small parties. On the upside it's like $10 a person for a very filling meal!!
