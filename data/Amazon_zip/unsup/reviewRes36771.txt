I've never been in the restaurant, I've always ordered in...and so far I haven't been disappointed. I ordered through grubhub last night, I was given an hour delivery time...got my order in 20 mins. Yay!!! Anyway, chicken pad thai was yummy, as always! Crab rangoon was also great! I wanted dessert so I ordered Thai Taro Custard. It was on the small side, but it was good, not too sweet! Wish it was a bigger portion!
