I'm a sushi newbie, and this is my new favorite sushi place- it has a huge variety of different kinds of sushi on the menu, including the amazing white dragon role. Definitely not cheap, but not that bad considering it's sushi, which is usually pretty expensive. This is the perfect restaurant for a date or with a big group, and it is BYOB. Try to make a reservation if you want to go on the weekend, because it can be hard to get a table as a walk-in later in the evening.
