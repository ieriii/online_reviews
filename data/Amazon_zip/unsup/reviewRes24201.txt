Aaaah. This place is ok. It's huge. HUGE. I had the lamb with potatoes. It was edible and I ate it. It cost 16 bucks which was too much because tasted like it should have cost 12 bucks. We had a terrible bottle of Greek wine and the waiter bumped me a lot. Why was he always bumping me? Could he not see where I was sitting? He was like a waitstaff zombie constantly filling and re-filling the water glass I hadn't even taken a sip from. I suppose that I appreciate the effort but I also appreciate not getting a plastic pitcher to the face every time i turn around. Regardless, my friends and I had an enjoyable if overpriced evening. But if i were you, I'd pick one of the other restaurants in this part of town. The one with the roof deck or something. Most seemed to have free valet. And they probably have a more focused menu. I felt like my food was just pulled out of a big vat of similar looking foods and not prepared to order. Judging by some of the other reviews here...i fear I may be right...
