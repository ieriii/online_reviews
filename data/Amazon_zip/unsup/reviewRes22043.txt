Tried Irazu for the first time--certainly won't be the last! In a world that forces you to chose between Americaned Mexican food or high end Modern Latin, Irazu offers something different. It's down home Costa Rican food in a fun atmosphere for very reasonable prices. As others have said, the Oatmeal shake is delicious. The flavor profile is similar to horchata, so if you like that you'll love the shake. The empanadas are great, doughy, fried triangles of deliciousness. They're small and cheap, so try a few as appetizers if you're with a group. We tried the veggie burrito with chorizo (for some reason the staff recommended adding meat to the veggie rather than ordering the meat) and it was great. The portions are huge, so bring your appetite or a to-go box. We also tried the Pepito Sandwich, as featured on Diners Drive-ins & Dives. The flavors infused into the pork were unique and delicious, and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a great sandwich that's a bit out of the ordinary. My only star deduction was for the fact that the service was a bit slow and distracted. They were friendly when they came to the table, just kept us waiting a bit too long between trips. Also, the salsa verde they bring with the chips at the beginning is long on heat and short on savory. It would be great to add to a sandwich or burrito, but didn't quite fit the bill for chip dipping. Oh--and bring cash and your own beer. If you're in the mood for a fun, casual meal with some unique flavors, Irazu is a great choice.
