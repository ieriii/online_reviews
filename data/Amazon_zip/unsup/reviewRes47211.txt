the best burger i have ever had. i had to take half of it home because it was as big as my head. no joke. they cook the burger how you want it cooked (they know what medium rare means). the macaroni and cheese is to die for, the fries are for real, and they make damn good tater tots. they have awesome specials every day of the week (tuesday is half price burgers). they have a great beer selection. they have a cool theme. they play great music. their servers are genuinely friendly. their patio is beautiful (and big, because they have 2). everything about this place is just great. go forth and ingest lockdown's burgers and beers. you will not be disappointed.
