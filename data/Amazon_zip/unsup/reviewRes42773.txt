Definitely a good change of pace delivery place, but nothing earth-shattering. Their magherita pizza was decent. High quality cheese and tomato was slightly overshadowed by the incomplete preparation: the pizza could definitely have used more time in the oven.  My assessment? That Fogo 2 Go has promise. I'll definitely try again, and see if the pizza prep last time was an honest mistake or a disturbing trend.
