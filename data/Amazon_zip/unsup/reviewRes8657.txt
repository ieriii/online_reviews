eh- it was ok. we got 2 pizzas, one was kind of bland. the one that we did enjoy was the one with prosciutto on it. our appetizer was great, tasted very fresh, i think it was the caprese salad. i mean i guess you can't really mess that up. it's bread, mozzarella and a slice of tomato. the space is cute. lots of couples having date night. while you wait, the hostess gave us some complimentary apps. as we were leaving the owner gave us some complimentary cannolis. maybe ill come back in the summer to take advantage of the outdoor seating. but definitely nothing memorable.
