so, a couple things good and a couple things bad here. i'll start with the bad so that the good leaves a lasting impression. it's a heavy metal bar. i get that. but the grandma in me [how'd she get there?!] doesn't like the music SO LOUD. i like to be able to talk to my dining/drinking companions. i get they're trying to rival kuma's and some people are in to that scene. and don't get me wrong, it's very fitting for being across from empty bottle. but it would be dishonest of me to say that sometimes i do go elsewhere because of the volume. but on a good note; i really dig their food. i've had a bit of everything - even their mac and cheese that some guy was eating at the bar that he allowed me to have a bite of [their clientele is very friendly]. come to think of it, i think someone brought in pizza from village pizza that i also ate. hm. interesting. anyway. food is good and fresh. they have a great selection of beers and even some outdoor seating. they might even have a touchscreen if i remember correctly. and who doesn't love to touch some screens...
