Always a great meal here! If you haven't made reservations, I've always been able to get in by sitting at the "bar" area. They still have a few tables and booths there so it's not really second-rate at all. Any steak is great, they are cooked in butter and no place else has a steak like it. I recommend the bone-in ribeye.  YUM! The sides are huge (get the mashed potatoes) and the creme brulee is excellent too. When you do sit in the dining room, the waiter calls you Mr. so and so (from your reservation), which is always a nice touch. Great service, my diet cokes were refilled with new ones before I was done with each one. For lunch: had a salmon special from the inside cover... It was amazing and 14 bucks. It had the best creamy red sauce and had fried scallops (small but lots) to boot. Desert: chocolate mousse/cheesecake is amazingly good. Every steak lover HAS to try Ruth's Chris!
