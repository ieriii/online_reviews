This place has a special place in my heart since it's in Bridgeport where I grew up. Every time I come here, I just get these pangs of nostalgia. I really like it here. This is one of the places my sister and I go to for brunch on the weekends. The food is consistently yummy, the coffee is good and the soups (I'm a huge fan of soups, no matter the weather) are comforting and tasty. The environment is so open and airy. It's a huge plus that they remodeled the space next door to them to enlarge the place. I really hate walking into a restaurant and it's all stuffy and gloomy. Nana's always gives me the feeling of warmth. Sure I have other options within walking distance of me like Yolk or Bongo Room. But...I'd rather drive all the way to my old hood where the wait isn't over an hour for 2 people and I can eat without someone hungrily leering at my food or impatiently waiting for my table.
