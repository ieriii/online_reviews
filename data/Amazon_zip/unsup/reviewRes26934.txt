I have had better!! A lot better!!! First my order was messed up I ordered a Pepperoni & Sausage and got Pepperoni and Green pepper!!!. Went back and they got me another one only the sausage was not cooked in the pizza with the cheese but just laid on TOP!!! won't be back there ever again. Bad thing I love good pizz and will travel for it( I regularly go back to the south side to my fave thin crust pizza place.
