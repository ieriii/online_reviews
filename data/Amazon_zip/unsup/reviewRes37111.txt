5:16pm on a saturday after the cubs game, stopped by based on great reviews.  Crowded, yet seated fast. Delia took our order promptly, recommended Belgian mussels, duck Ruben and CB&J. My friends loved the mussels.  The Mac and cheese was rich and sinful, fries delightful, potato chips a bit heavy on the seasoning.  Duck Ruben was tender and tasteful, the Cheese and Date sandwich was wonderful.  Overall great service, wonderful beer and outstanding food. Final comment, did have to chase down a waitress to pay bill after waiting a long time after finishing meal, would have been nice to see her more during the meal for another beer.
