I eat here about once a month. Great local place in the Gold Coast, especially if you want something moderately priced. The wine and beer selection are pretty solid as well. My favorite part is the atmosphere - good music, good wait staff, and friendly crowd. Their menu rotates but some of my favorite things are the Cajun Chicken Penne, the cheese plate, their soups, and many times their seafood specials. Minor criticisms would be they are a bit heavy on the butter and sometimes their creativity over extends their talent. That said a little extra butter can be nice and I would rather see a changing menu that takes risks than something stagnant and boring.
