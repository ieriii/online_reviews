I love Glenn's. I've been coming here the past year and a half because of their selection of food and mostly because of the all you can eat king crab legs! It really is a nice, casual and cozy place near the brownline Montrose stop and parking isn't ever really an issue. I usually come on Tuesdays for the all you can eat crab legs. They are usually quick with filling you your plate once you are almost done and it comes with corn, coleslaw and potatoes. Come hungry! The crab legs are sweet and meaty. I have tried their porkchops which was really tasty, however I just discovered today that they took it off the menu. I also have tried the ribs which are tender and good. I have also tried the new york strip sandwich and one of the fish dishes which I enjoyed. The only reason why I'm giving them 4 stars is because it is a small place and tends to get crowded. Sometimes they take reservations, sometimes they don't. The service is always really good too! They really should think of opening another location or expanding.
