Actually I wanted to give a 3.5. They have really good appetizers. Service- okay, a bit slow but fine. I would have given them a 4, only disappointment was hyderabadi style lamb curry. I really expected hot and spicy hyderabadi style lamb curry, it was too mellow. Rest of the food was good and yes complimentary basket of naan and dip ok makhani sauce was awesome. I will go their again surely but I am not drooling over the place.
