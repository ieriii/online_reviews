Took advantage of the Tuesday night coupon with 10% off your total bill (check their website for the dets). Had heard some rave reviews about the Naple's style pizza here, so found my way here with my roommate from high school to check it out! With the main side of their restaurant full by the time we arrived at 6:30 PM, I was worried we wouldn't be seated... but their smaller side of the restaurant was empty so we were seated quickly. 45 minutes later, the whole restaurant was full and there was a waiting line to get in. Get here early. Even on a Tuesday.  Mozzarella in Carrozza - Appetizer that was essentially a friend mozzarella sandwich with prosciutto in it. I tasted the mozzarella, didn't get much flavor of the prosciutto. My dinnermate loved it, I was fairly iffy. Likely go with another app next time. Pizza Funghi e. Salsiccia - Fresh ingredients can make or break a pizza for me, and this was no exception. The sausage and mushrooms were wonderfully fresh, and tasted phenomenal. Pizza Bianca - Buffalo mozzarella with basil, and I was expecting this experience to be somehow more... enlightening. I had heard so much about buffalo mozz versus non buffalo, so perhaps I need a side by side comparison. Good pizza, but not a repeat. Crust - Spacca Napoli really shines at making the crust of the pizza. In what I've been told is true Naples style, the center of the pizza is ridiculously paper thin, while the sides are perfectly bready. And while I personally prefer a slightly crisper crust, it was pretty obvious that quality of ingredients used for even the crust were phenom.  Verdict: A total of $50 after tax and tip even with 10% off for two non-alcoholic drinks, two 10-inch pizzas, and an appetizer. With pizza prices averaging $14 a piece, this is definitely more of a splurge, but is high quality pizza I would be willing to enjoy once a month or so. Nice job Spacca!
