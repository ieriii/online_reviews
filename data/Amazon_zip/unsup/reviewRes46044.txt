What a fantastic place to eat. Hard to believe this place is owned and operated by the Cheesecake Factory corporation. I've gone here numerous times when visiting one of my all-time favorite cities. The food is always excellent (and largely portioned) and the service always shines.  The wait can get VERY long...we went out to dinner once and waited 2 hours, got there at 8 and didn't get seated till a bit after 10. The food was great, but we didn't get to leave chicago to head home till about midnight.
