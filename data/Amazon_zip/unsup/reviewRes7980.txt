Hey mambo. Mambo Italiano in my mouth!  Seriously the most truly authentic, rich creamy mozzarella to be had in all of the city. I believe the words out of my mouth were the mozzarella is so fresh it must be straight from the cow. LITERALLY so decadent you had no idea cheese could be that way. The flavors and doughy/crisp juxtaposition that occurs with the pizza is just freakin' nuts. Its out of control with just your true italian pizza experience.  My boyfriend and I saddled up with a bottle of wine here one time when we came and it was just a reminder of what are the most delectably fresh italian foods can be like in Chicago. A clean atmosphere for the whole family too.
