Yeah, lots of long reviews here to tell you what it's about... This place is great by me- I come here pretty often. I've never had any serious problem with the service that wasn't more funny than annoying. They're generally normal/nice. I love this place for what it is.  I will add that the big floor seating tables toward the front of the place are not for those with long legs... The table top is THICK wood, leaving little room underneath for folded up legs, big feet, etc!
