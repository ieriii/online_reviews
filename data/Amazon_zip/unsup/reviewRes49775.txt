I ate here with nine of my friends just recently. Among their appetizers, the beef empanada was really good. The Aborrajado, hot plantains with guava and melted cheese, was also pretty yummy. The fresh fruit drinks and mojitos were excellent. Meanwhile, the Colombiana soda was way too sweet. I had high expectations for their Churrasco, which my friend raved about. It was cooked to the requested medium doneness and had pretty good flavor. However, it was a bit salty for my taste. The quality of the beef was ok for the price, but certainly not prime grade. I wish there were more fried yuca on the side, one of my favorite foods. The good thing for us is that we were there on a non-busy Wednesday night and, probably because of the size of our party, the wait staff was very accommodating of our outside beverages and dessert. This allowed us to 1) enjoy pretty attentive service, 2) not-so-surreptitiously bust out various Belgian ales and other alcohol (my friend brought in a freakin' mini-cooler into which we rotated our next alcoholic beverage periodically), and 3) enjoy Sweet Mandy B's chocolate cake for which the wait staff kindly provided us plates. We tipped them well for our shenanigans. All in all, a very enjoyable birthday dinner!
