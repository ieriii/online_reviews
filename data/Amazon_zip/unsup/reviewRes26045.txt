First time here! Very cute and romantic atmosphere. It was a darker and more intimate setting. I liked the ambiance. The staff was very friendly even as we were the LAST customers of the night. They let us order at 11pm when the place closed and did not act put off. The food was great - really enjoyed the cheese and dessert items. The main course was great, but I don't enjoy cooking with the oil. That's just my personal preference though. I would definitely recommend it and go again!
