Great food at a great price! I almost always get the chorizo scramble (delish - and ONLY $5 - holla!), but everything else I have tried is tasty too. Machacado and tacos and this pork stew thing are stand-outs. The weekend wait can be craaaaazy, but the line goes surprisingly fast. AND once you get seated, you get FRESH, hot chips and salsa - plus a FREE little appetizer for each of your party. Ok, that makes the wait worth it! It's usually a small meat dish as appetizer, but it definitely helps with the hunger pangs. :) I def recommend it here and suggest coming off peak hours should you come on the weekends.
