We have gone and waited over an hour in the line outside as people laughed at us driving by and no matter how long you wait in line, when you get up to the counter Doug is so nice taking your order and so relaxed you forget your mad and hungry. The Duck Fat fries are addicting there is no sharing once you start you will not stop, also they sell Green River. On the sausage front Doug can really do no wrong, so have an open-mind for anything when walking into here.
