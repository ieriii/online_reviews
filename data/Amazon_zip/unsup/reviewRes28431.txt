I rarely write a review unless it is exceptionally good or quite disappointing, and this restaurant fell in the later category.  To start things off, this place is way overpriced for what you get. It appears to be attempting to position itself as an Alinea, and having eaten there I can say, it isn't even close. If you can believe it, the pricing is almost the same as Alinea for much less of an experience. In addition, dishes were tiny, and did little to fill you up. What's more, the dishes were mostly disappointing (the deconstructed french onion soup was terrible, with most other dishes being uneventful and lacking in taste/creativity). We did the "tasting menu" which brought our bill to over $300 with a couple of cocktails, which was nothing more than a waste of money (went to Gilt bar the night before, spent $70.00, and were impressed by every dish and went home with a full stomach and a contentment knowing that we got to try some interesting culinary creations). The kicker was the "truffle butter popcorn" at the beginning the meal (only a "meh"), which made me think "oh, this is a nice touch", only later to find out that my 5 bites from the tasting menu would have more than paid for a 5lb. tub of Garrets...and it would have been better. Maybe this place used to be the cat's meow, but it was a far cry from it on this occasion. The drinks were decent, but nothing you can't get at another upscale bar in the neighborhood. If you go, I would encourage getting the dishes (versus the courses menu), but even that was wildly overpriced for what you get.  I must say I walked in and thought "wow, I can't believe it's more busy on a Saturday night at 8pm", and I left saying, "no wonder this place isn't busy". If you end up footing the bill, consider yourself warned.
