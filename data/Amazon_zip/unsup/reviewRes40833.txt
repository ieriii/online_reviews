Yup its a diner- but a good one. Clean and has tons of variety. Mind you, the dishes are super huge and the Pho is pretty amazing. I had the marinated beef Bahn mi and it was super yum, very fresh, great mix of flavours. They also have Thai ice bubble tea, the fun orange one :) Service was a little slower than Im used to in diners but the place was pretty packed. I would recommend the shrimp with fried rice, the pho and the bahn mi here, with bubble tea to help it all down :) With one appetiser and an entree, with a smoothie or a tea it comes up to about 20. I had the sandwich and the tea and mine was 8$
