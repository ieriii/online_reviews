Steak as it should be. Started with a garden/house salad with balsamic that was pretty standard, but that just made way for the enormous filet (done perfectly medium) that followed. It was about the size of 4 decks of cards. The steamed broccoli and mashed potato sides were really well done as well. For dessert we had the flourless chocolate cake (very dense and dark, almost too much so) and a cheesecake that was the size of a small frisbee (huge, topped with a tangy sour cream and totally delish).  Solid solid dinner.
