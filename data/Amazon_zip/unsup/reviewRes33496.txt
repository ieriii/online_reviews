On my ONE day in Chicago, my (very new) friend Meggan brought me to this extremely excellent place, which remains in mind as the tastiest falafel sandwich I have had to date. Generous portions too! and only $3.72, if I remember correctly. Meggan kept the repeating the price like a mantra. The atmosphere was nice, cozy, and they had pleasant music playing. The food was ready right in front of me and made to order. I recommend Sultan's to anyone. If you like falafel, prepare for an excellent one. If you've never had one, it's a great place to give this delicious dish your first try!
