Really Chicago? Is this the pizza your famous for? I hope not. No, I know not. I recently moved to Chicago, though I had visited several times in the past and had much better pizza......though still searching for the best I remember (don't remember the name of the place). Anyway, this is not pizza I would want to show off to visitors. It was sub-mediocre. The tomatoes in the sauce didn't taste cooked long enough, the "butter" on the crust did not taste like real butter. We got salads to eat while waiting for the pizza and the lettuce was so limp I could hardly eat mine. The server was a choch. Won't return.
