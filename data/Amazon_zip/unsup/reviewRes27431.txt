I loved my dinner last night at Graham Elliot. We started with an interesting cocktail at the bar (The London Calling) and then were promptly sat for our reservation where champagne was waiting for us (we were celebrating). From all the reviews we decided to try 3 of the 4 "hot" dishes- the risotto, the gnocchi (OMG), the scallops and then for cold the beef tartare (so so good), then we just shared the skate for our entree. And of course we had the brownie dessert with peanut butter and caramelized banana- my three favorite things in one dessert= heaven. Everything we had was delightfully presented and the flavors were perfect. The highlights for me were the beef tartare and the gnocchi- the truffle oil and the fried egg on top just made it so delicious and the gnocchi themselves melted in your mouth. The skate entree was also really good served with a sweet raisin chutney but the polenta at the bottom balanced the sweetness nicely. We'll definitely be heading back to Graham Elliot again. Lastly- I loved the environment and I think the Chef accomplished exactly what he'd set out to do- an unpretentious but still upscale feeling environment. The chef was also walking around greeting tables. Loved it.
