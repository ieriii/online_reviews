This restaurant has become my favorite restaurant in Chicago over the past year or so. I love the elegant feel of the dining area, the upstairs bar is chic and relaxed, and the outdoor balcony is perfect on a warm summer night. I love thier shrimp, eggplant, curry dish, it is out of this world! It's perfect for a romantic date, or a night out with the girls. The staff is friendly and helpful when ordering, and they will offer great suggestions if there is something on the menu you are not familiar with. I am not big on asian food, but this place has a very different flare with the french influence. I highly recommend you try it! OH, and the leeche sangria is worth the trip alone!
