catering from simply it was simply astounding. calling the restaurant a few days in advance the catering was so easy as pie. the man on the phone took my order of what i wanted, the location, place, and time. a few days later i called back the day before just to confirm everything was alright and my whole order was repeated to me as if i just called in only 15 minutes ago. food came on time, and let me tell ya, it's just delicious.we had only a small party of 15 peeps all of which were really hungry people i got several half tray orders of an assortment of beef skewers, lemongrass chicken, eggrolls, grilled lemongrass beef and shrimp springrolls. everything tasted so fresh, and most importantly to my appetite none of it tasted frozen. this place is just great, simply it is simply astounding as said before. i'll have to come back for their lunch specials and plan my next party here. it's just that astounding.
