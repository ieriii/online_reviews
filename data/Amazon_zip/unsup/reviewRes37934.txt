5 star for pizza minus 2 stars for service. I was reluctant to get deep dish again because my experience at Gino's East was no bueno. To my surprise, Giordano's wasn't as heavy as Gino and was more flavorful. I was pleasantly surprised and am now a deep dish convert. Though pizza is good, the service here is atrocious! Probably the worst service I have ever received in my life. There was a table of teens sitting next to us who had been there since 1PM and still didn't have pizza by the time we left. (We got there at 2:30 and left at 4). Yeah atrocious service.
