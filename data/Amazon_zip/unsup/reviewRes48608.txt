Definitely the place to go to if you live by the mantra "that wherever Anthony Bourdain goes, I follow". This is the type of place that works very well with a group of hip foodies with semi-deep pockets, who don't mind shouting over the table to have a conversation, and who are not afraid to sit next to fellow diners (the majority of the seating is banquet style which means that your party of 4 is now a party of 50...not too many individual tables). Groups work well here because the food is served family style (not "buca di beppo" sized portions though), so sharing a number of dishes will allow you to get adventurous. I had duck heart for the first time and loved it...probably wouldn't have ordered it for myself. The deep pockets are needed because they only carry top shelf hooch and serve hip euro-peasent food at aristocratic prices. If you go, you have got to get the Basque (fish) stew. The seafood is fresh tasting and the broth is wicked good. When you are done with the sea creatures, dipping your bread in that liquid heaven is a meal in itself.
