I was here about 3 months ago. The food overall was good. But the manager/owner of the establishment was very rude. A young woman who saw something in the kitchen that horrified her went up to the counter to complain to the manager/owner. My bf and I were sitting right next to the counter and this girl just kept complaining in English about how she was going to call the health dept. and the police. She told him that he was rude because he was speaking Spanish and refused to speak English. She was Mexican/American and explained that she wasn't going to speak to him in Spanish just because he didn't want to take care of the situation that happened in the kitchen. It left me wondering what had the woman seen in the kitchen that was so horrifying and disturbing? The food was good but it was crowded and everything was greasy....I felt like it could have been rats, insects, anything.....Disturbing....that woman complained for over an hour screaming and pleading with the owner/manager to make him take responsibility for the situation. I most likely will not be going back...
