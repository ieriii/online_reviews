Solid little Italian place in Lakeview. Went here with the boy and the father (who's Sicilian) while he was in town. We all got various pasta dishes and they were all very good. The house wine was a little expensive for my tastes, but you can't go wrong here overall. We went on a Friday evening without a reservation and it was packed. I recommend a reservation for you all.
