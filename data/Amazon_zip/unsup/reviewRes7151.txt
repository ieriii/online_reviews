Dined here last night with my aunt and girlfriend. Can honestly say that I spent most of yesterday afternoon reading every review under the sun about this place, and based on all the 5-star ratings I was excited to check how BBQ on the Gold Coast stacked up. Having had my share of excellent BBQ (St. Louis, KC, Memphis, Texas), I can come off as a bit of a snob. Hey, I disclosed it in advance. We each ordered an entree then did sides a la carte. Pickles and Potato Chips - FREE, endless, and addicting! These were a stellar way to start the meal Pork Shoulder/Pulled Chicken - tender, slightly smokey (not enough, IMO), and plentiful Poblano Cheddar Cornbread vs. Honey Butter Cornbread - Go with the sweet cornbread. It blew the savory out of the water. Baked Beans w/ Kobe Beef - sweet with a kick, expect to sleep alone later Bruleed Mac-N-Cheese - meh, just okay. a little dry for my taste Key Lime Pie - BEST KEY LIME PIE I HAVE EVER HAD! Touch of mint + homemade whipped cream + graham cracker crust + raspberry sauce plate treatment Service was quite attentive. Manager offered to get my aunt another glass of wine. Server assistants/bussers on top of refilling waters, boxing food, and clearing plates. Only complaint: Our waitress, while friendly enough, did not offer any advice/navigation of the menu to 3 bewildered first-timers. Next time I will try the ribs! The space is inviting, open kitchen gives a cool vantage point, but it gets LOUD to the point where I had trouble hearing my dining partners. Wood trim walls and ceilings + hardwood floors = poor acoustics We will return when the weather warms so that we can take advantage of the outdoor patio. Very convenient location just steps from the Clark/Division Red Line!
