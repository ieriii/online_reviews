I stopped by yesterday to have lunch with a friend. I have been here once before but a while ago. I love the food! Everything is wonderful,some of the food is spicy but it is not a spice that stays with you it is just kind of an after thought. I always have to get the Sambussas Sampler. This time I did the Messob Platter. Every thing was so flavorful! I cant remember all the names of what I ordered but you can't go wrong! The service each time i have visited was not the best. This visit there was a large table of 7 next to us who sat and ordered after us (2) and got their food before us. The server had fumbled up their order and was taking a bit to get it figured out. About 5 minutes later she brought over our appetizers. Just as we were wondering if we were forgotten about over in the corner, Our food came out. Despite the service we had a great lunch. Will be going back or maybe just getting delivery.
