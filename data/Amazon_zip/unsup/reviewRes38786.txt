Life changing experience, from a beer drinking perspective at least. God bless my brother in law for inviting me here for a few beers about two years ago. Prior to that time, I considered ordering Newcastle to be splurging. Wow were my eyes (and taste buds) opened that day. Walking in and seeing the beautiful bar with so many exotic tapper heads I was quickly intrigued. Sitting down only to be handed a menu of 10+ pages of beer was over the top. Realizing that all beers were poured into their proper glassware, gotten from a wall of glasses, was icing on the beer cake! I was in beer heaven! My complaint, and this is definitely a "rich man's problem", is what beers to drink in the little time I had there. I walked up to the bar and gave the bartender my beer drinking resume. He could not have been more helpful. He walked me down the path of some damn good beers (a lot of trappist dubbel ales, which have become my absolute favorite). After about five beers (and two hours), I had to unfortunately leave and to this day have not returned. I've gotta get back there....
