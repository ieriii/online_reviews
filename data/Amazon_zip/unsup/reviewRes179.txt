Disappointment in the food. You will not get the best meal in your recent memory here, not even close. With a couple of exceptions, it was NOT innovative. It wasn't even about fresh ingredients, no not really. Sometimes, it did more to confuse the tastebuds than anything pleasant. It borrowed shamelessly from other cultures, and the outcome paled in comparison or was completely wrong. Seriously, the ignorance. But could the average diner even tell? I could rip into some of the 'bites' in more detail but it's not worth it. The homage to Escoffier was the worst for me - the squab was lukewarm, which is oh so ironic. The stone soup, while a cheeky idea, was medicinal. Not to mention, 3 out of the 4 waiters were just reciting the same descriptions all night. The only thing they had down was the pace of the service. Again, it's another reminder that our culture buys into experiences that ultimately leave us feeling unsatisfied. This was just a big masquerade, no substance. C'mon Grant - who's watching over your kitchen?! Keller said if you can taste the seasoning, then you've overdone it. Well, every other dish was salty. There were also inedible 'artifacts' in two separate courses that we had. Ugh, the lack of attention to detail is insulting.
