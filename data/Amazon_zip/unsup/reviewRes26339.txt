Went last night with a friend. We arrived shortly after they opened. We ordered cheese fondue with extra veggies, 3 glasses of wine and each had coffee. Apparently that was not enough as they practically pulled us out of the booths to get rid of us. We were there about 90 minutes, but while most booths were full, the tables were empty and nobody was waiting for a table.  The service seemed rushed all along, but while we were drinking our coffee the waiter or bus boy asked us, literally, ever 2 minutes if everything was alright. We repeatedly said yes, thank you, but he kept interrupting us and asking.  Then, he just stood a few feet away and stared at us.  We looked at each other and both realized we were getting the bums rush.  Contrary to other reviews we were not offered more food.  If this is how they treat you early, on a Wed, on a very cold day, be sure to order plenty of food if you go in during the weekend at 7 or 8.
