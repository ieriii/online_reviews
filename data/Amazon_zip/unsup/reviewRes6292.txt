Great place to eat. They tell you its like Italian tapas but slightly bigger and that's mostly true. But, unlike tapas, an appetizer and entree will likely fill you up. Also, I highly recommend the burger. Good value as well. Two people costs around $40, if you don't drink, and I had a little bit to take home, as well. One piece of advice, they bring every dish out separately. The S/O and I each ordered a different entree for our main course. However, they brought hers first, waited for us to eat it, then brought mine. So we ended up sharing a little bit more than we intended.
