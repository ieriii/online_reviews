Definitely a great restaurant - I always love starting with the ceviche and then moving on to a meat dish for my main course. The ceviche is always amazing and the main dishes are also good although my cochinita pibil the other day was not great (every bite really needed to be soaked in the sauce on the bottom to get the required saltiness and flavor but my initial bites - as was the consensus of the table next to me - were quite bland). I'm not a fan of the long waits for a table and high prices (including the margaritas) but you'll definitely get top quality ingredients and very good food for your time and money.
