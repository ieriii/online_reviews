went last weekend for the first time and had a very nice experience. I was initially overwhelmed by the wine selections, but my server (can't remember her name) was very helpful. Stayed and had dinner. I had the trout with an almond/pepper jelly and my partner had a pastrami sausauge. Both were outstanding. Keep up the good work
