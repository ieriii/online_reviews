Tru is our favorite special occasion restaurant! We've been here a number of times and have never been disappointed. The food and service are top-notch, the decor is sophisticated and elegant. Most recently, we spent New Year's Eve at Tru and the dinner went beyond our expectations. We had the 8-course tasting menu with wine pairings. The "wine" pairings were divine, including everything from sake to a 1976 Bordeaux.
