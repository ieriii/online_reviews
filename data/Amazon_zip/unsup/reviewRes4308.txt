It is kinda hard to believe that I've lived in Chicago my whole life and i am finally just making it to the historic Green Mill. It definitely did not disappoint. I started with a friendly bartender who treated us with one of his original martini creations. Before the band started, we settled into the stage area which is perfectly set-up for enjoying live music. The band was very good as we enjoyed the tunes and libations. I will say that the star of the show is the atmosphere. Walking in from the frosty Chicago weather, we were greeted with a warm, classic aura. From the wall murals to the towering statue next the stage, everything fits together so well that patron and resident beauty Holly Michaels was heard to remark, "It transports you to another time". Indeed it does, Holly.
