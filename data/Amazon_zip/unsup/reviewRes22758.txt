REVIEWING OLD FAVORITES #2: BEEF + GRILLED ONIONS = HAPPINESS If there's one combination of flavors on this planet that never fails to make me happy, it's the simple yet magical pairing of beef and grilled onions. Add avocado to this pairing and it's almost sexual. Hence the pleasure that is induced by Irazu's pepito sandwich. Think juicy rib eye steak, buttery caramelized onions, and cool creamy avocado (request this as an add-on), all intertwining on hot, crusty bread. All for around $6! It's crazy to think that only a block away people are paying the same thing for crappy fast food at McDonalds.
