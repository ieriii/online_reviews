I came here on a Sunday night for a first date. It was a really large open area in the main dining room, a liked the decor and ambiance. The wine list was pretty bare but we made do, this is more of a tequila place after all. I could tell this place wasn't brand new, some older styles I noticed. The food was good, didn't blow me away. Had the guac, shrimp ceviche, gnocci and strip steak. All were about average with the steak being the best but still nothing memorable. It was pretty empty in here as well, not a lot of people. I probably won't come back here since there are way better restaurants in the city.
