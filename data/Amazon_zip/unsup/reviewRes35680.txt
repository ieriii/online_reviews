It's places like this that make Chicago a great place to live and eat... Awesome Peking duck... Its the best $32.00 you could spend. Fit for a final meal. Steamy buns....Crunchy duck skin, uber clean tasting duck as big as a small turkey day turkey. Service is great for what this place is -the most glorious ghetto food ever! The bathrooms were the clean and by far the cleanest restrooms of any Chinese restaurant I've been to. Beijing duck, crunchy pork, steamy buns, solid old school fried rice, good honest, and GOOD SERVICE. TOPS FOR PEKING DUCK!!!!!
