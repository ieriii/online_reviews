Fried chicken isn't really something I'm gonna eat on a regular basis, but I give major kudos to this place for creating a niche and doing it really well. 1) Don't go to this place if you have to, say, go try on clothes afterwards. The minute you walk in, you are saturated with the smell of the sauces, and it's gonna take a while for that to wear off. 2) The space is small but cute, with bright walls and communal tables. At 2pm on a Saturday, it was busy but we had no problem getting a seat. 3) The owners and staff are really helpful. Walking by the other day we stopped to look at a menu. A worker quickly came out with a to-go menu and let us know they also deliver. When we ate there our total was $8.12. We gave the cashier $10 and he gave us $2 even back (which of course we put in the tip jar). They now take credit cards. 4) It's cheaper to get fries and a drink added then to just order a side of fries. And they have diet root beer - bonus! 5) The food itself is damn tasty. We shared the Seoul Sassy sandwhich. The sauce was excellent, though I'd ask for no cheese next time (it didn't add anything to the flavor). At $8 for sandwich, fries and drink, it's a quality, tasty and inexpensive meal.
