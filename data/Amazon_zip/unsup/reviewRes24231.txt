I used to live in Chicago and now I visit at least once a year. When I do visit, I always go to Greek Islands for lunch. The food is amazing, and as a Greek American I think that it is pretty authentic. I always sit at the bar whether I'm by myself or with my boyfriend. Like other reviewers stated, there are only men who bartend/serve tables. For some reason I always sense an attitude from the bartender, but since he's been like that for the past 3 years that I have been going here, I have gotten used to it.
