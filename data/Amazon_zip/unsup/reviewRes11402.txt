This place would get 3 stars if it weren't for the wait. We were told it would be 30-40 minutes and had to wait an hour. The pizza tasted good, but the cheese and toppings all fall right off, making a mess. The edge of the crust is nice and crispy, but the rest is soft and slimy. The large size pizza is giant and oval shaped, making for horribly long slices that are awkward and messy to eat. I got the "Dark Bier" to drink, which was actually pretty good. Overall, it's decent pizza, but decent doesn't cut it in Chicago!
