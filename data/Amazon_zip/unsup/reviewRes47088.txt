This place has a welcoming and cozy atmosphere but I've never had great service there. The food is quite good for the most part (especially the pumpkin ravioli) but it's way overpriced in my opinion. None of the specialty drinks taste especially special and the fact that they literally serve hot chocolate in bowls makes me postal. It's just way too gimmicky and awkward. Nevertheless, this place fills a stark void in its location for a hip, inviting gathering spot, and the live music selection is notable.
