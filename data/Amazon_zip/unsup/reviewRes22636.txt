I guess I don't really get the hype about this place. Or maybe I'm just not into Chinese food. Either way, our experience here was pretty blah. The wait is long during the evenings, so prepare to stand around outside (there's no room at all inside). The restaurant is cramped, so be wary of the jerks that bring their kids, strollers and other accessories (they're definitely in the way).  The menu is enormous, which makes choosing a meal difficult. We decided to order three different entrees to share and that seemed to suffice. Most of the food was blah - some overspiced to oblivion and some just tasted blah. I guess I just didn't see the appeal of this place, but I left with a belly full of warm food, which is OK in my book. I definitely won't go out of my way to eat here again and if I ever find myself in Chinatown, I'll probably go somewhere else on Archer.
