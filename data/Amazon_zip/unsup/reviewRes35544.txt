One of my favorite seafood spots in all my travels. Always a good mix of fresh fish and shellfish. Crabs are excellent and they offer a great variety. Fresh sushi and sahimi. Nice wine list, great service, and easy to get to. Two sides as one is restaurant and other is more bar like. Good food either way
