Love the pizza. Carmelized Crust.... DUH. Two slices leave me comatosed. Love the choice of beer. I like to hit pequods Monday- Weds. Less of a crowd and wait. PS you can call in and have it start before you get there. The only issue I had was I didn't feel like my server was very attentive. She was dancing and talking about music videos with the hostess. I'm NEEDY sometimes!
