I think that the pho here is bipolar. One day, it's flavorful and not too greasy. And another it's so bland you have to douse it with hoisin, sriracha and lime. And yet another, it's too greasy that you feel your heart stopping with every spooful. But they do load the pho with meat, no shortage here! I'm adventurous with my food so I always do the sliced beef, flank, soft tendon and bible tripe.  The appetizers that are worth trying are the banh xeo and the self wrap spring rolls beef and shrimp. We have fun with the self wrap spring rolls. You drop the hard clear sheet in hot water, it softens, load it up with your choice ingredients, dip in sauce, pop in mouth. YUM! Nix the boba in your bubble shake, it's gross. I've had it several times (yeah yeah, I should of learned my lesson the first time). It's either overcooked or old; all the pearls are sticking together or falling completely apart. And they taste weird too.
