My favorite sushi restaurant in the city!  Great selection, fresh fresh fish! We sat at the sushi bar the night that we went (there was no wait) and it was very fun! The chefs were very professional and creative. The atmosphere of the restaurant is great; a bit dark, romantic, chocolate brown tones. Very very nice.  The BYOB makes the place even better; we brought beer and they kept it chilling in the back in the fridge. Our waiter was very attentive while taking our order and coming back to refresh our beverages. All in all, best sushi in Chicago. They also deliver! Fast, quick, and still fresh when you receive it. They even try to plate it well instead of just shoving it all in a to-go container.
