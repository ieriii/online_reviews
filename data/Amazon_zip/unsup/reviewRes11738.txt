The BLT Benedict was superb! I also tried the banana pancakes, stuffed with bits of bacon. The sweetness of the banana creme glaze and the saltiness of the bacon was a great compliment. I cannot wait to go back to this brunch hotspot in Wicker Park! There's usually a wait and I don't think they take reservations, but you can walk around the neighborhood while you wait. I would wait all day to be served an amazing brunch. The staff is also very attentive and friendly.
