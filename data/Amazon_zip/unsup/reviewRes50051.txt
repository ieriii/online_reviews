While I enjoy certain aspects of the Fifty/50 (cheese fries, boneless wings, and PBR especially). There are other aspects I can live without. I have been to The Fifty/50 on a few different occassions on different days of the week at different times. I have to say that I prefer going there when the bar is dead. You get better service, can sit down, and actually enjoy watching the various sporting events. The nights I have been here when it has been crowded have been less than fun. It takes forever to get a drink, the music is ridiculously loud, and the service leaves a lot to be desired. During the summer, their outdoor patio is pretty awesome and I love that you can watch the games from outside. The bar itself is pretty cool looking and having different levels definintely makes it a little better on crowded nights. I realize this review is all over the place but that is pretty much how I think of it here in my head. I am either super psyched to go here or have to get dragged in.  If you are torn about going here, definitely go here on a less busy bar night to eat, you will not be dissapointed with their food!
