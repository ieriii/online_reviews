It was sure nice to be greeted by Luis as my taxi pulled up on a toasty 97 degree day. I didn't have to touch my heavy bags anymore thank goodness as he promptly intercepted my luggage and led me to the second floor lobby. I know previous yelpers quibbled about having to take an elevator to get to the lobby, but this is not atypical in city hotels. Besides, it adds another level of security, when it prevents any Tom, Dick or Mary from the street from gaining access. The lobby was small but well appointed. Typical of a "boutique" style property. I was a bit nervous that at 9:30 a.m. I was going to get the "That's a bit early to check in Ms. *****, and we have no rooms available." But alas my fears did not materialize and I was on my way, key in hand, to my 14th floor room.  The double double was super clean, cozy, and had floor to ceiling windows. It had a good feel, and I was happy with the room and the little extras like the Keurig coffee machine, robes, slippers, and trendy toiletries. The rain shower was also kind of cool as it had a large panel of glass as its wall so you could shower with not only views of the room but the outside as well. Perfect for exhibitionists or voyeurs. If you happen to be a bit prudish, of course, there was a drape that would give you the privacy you needed. The service here was top notch. I had some special requests that were carried out immediately and with great care and concern. The location was perfect in many ways. It was close to great restaurants, sightseeing, shopping, etc, and it also had convenient places nearby like Starbucks, CVS and WholeFoods. Folks interested in this property should note it is not categorized as a 5 star property in hotel terms, but the experience you have here could certainly be rated that high.
