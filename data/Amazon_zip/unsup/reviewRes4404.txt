Great Jazz bar, if you don't get stabbed on the way in. Ok,maybe the dicey neighborhood is changing, but watch it outside here at night. Lots of hoods, thugs, panhandlers.  Great hang. Elling, Barber, all the legends. Even that Swing Shift orchestra ain't bad. For people who still like music in their music. Have a highball, or a rob roy. Toast to yesteryear.  Then take her home, put on some Coleman Hawkins, and show her what "jumpin at the Green Mill" is all about. Proud of you, Green Mill.
