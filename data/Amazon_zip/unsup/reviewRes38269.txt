Just stopped in for a quick brunch. Great waiter, very helpful for two people with major jazz bar blues from the night before. We don't order coffee and pizza much in Florida, but this was a necessity on this day. The place was a fantastic Chicago stop. We ordered the assorted appetizer platter filled with just what the doctor ordered. Fried cheese, fried mushrooms, and fried zucchini! We finished off the meal with a deep dish pizza filled with a great crust, spinach and pepperoni. Yum! All the cobwebs were gone and we headed off to the plane with big smiles.
