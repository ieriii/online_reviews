Diner, duh! A vegetarian institution from '83. They're oldskool without the cardboard hippie food. Now mostly vegan with some items having a vegetarian option, HA! The sandwiches are killer and of course their vegan milkshakes are the bees freakin knees yo. Cute summer patio, booze, & excellent service. They are starting to introduce raw entrees which Chef Jo totally roxit. They are big community supporters, I can't say enough so i'm just stopping here.
