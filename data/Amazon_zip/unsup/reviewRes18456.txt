Just as Dorothy learned back in Kansas, some of the best things are in your own back yard. I learned this, too, on my first visit here on a Friday evening. Craving that Friday night burger and a beer I was. So I proceeded here undeterred by the memory of the former boite, Feed The Beast, and with many recent recommendations from friends and others. Well, this place is like the Oz of Brewskies. So many beers available on tap, and scores of others, domestic, craft, Half Acre from across the street. And many at prices like $4.00 or $4.50. I tried a variety myself: a darker ale, a ginger-tinged lighter ale, and the Half Acre IPA offering. I ordered the Evil or Devil burger with roasted Garlic, feta cheese, olives and roasted peppers. Sometimes, a burger is just a burger, but this one was one deliciously fresh flavor pairing. With the standard fries, which were delectable and a reasonable amount. So, a burger with fries and three beers for $24.00. This is less than I would pay at my even-more back yard burger spot, Rockwell's Neighborhood Grill. The staff and bartenders were great (I ate at the bar.) The other patrons were friendly and engaging, and I enjoyed the music, and the general din on a warm Friday evening. Even Mr. Muscled Loud Guy to my left with the his greying tee, and Radar from M.A.S.H cap, who by the way knew he was loud, and his buddies were at least talking food, steaks and Anthony Bourdain rather than, say, sports. Finished with great food and good conversation, I closed my eyes, clicked my heels twice, and was back home in a flash. With a very satisfied tummy, and some leftover cash in my wallet. Bad Apple is a good value, and fun experience, and a very successful gastro pub. Simple concept. Beer and burgers. But nicely and creatively executed.
