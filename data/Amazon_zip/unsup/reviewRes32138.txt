i'm bumping Sunda up to 5 stars due to my experience last night. have friends visiting from out of town so wanted to take them to this hot spot, after them having heard me rave about it. they were NOT disappointed! everyone loved all their drinks and food. i finally tried the cocktails - all super delish! i especially liked the crushed punch (not on the online menu) - it was like a light, refreshing watermelon juice w/a kick of vodka! the peared sake and go go berry cocktails were very good as well. love the beer selection - Tiger beer from China and San Miguel from the Phillipines are two goodies.  new dish i tried was the Wild Asian Mushroom and Asparagus Toban - superb if you're crazy about mushrooms like i am!! this is moved up to the must-haves list at Sunda, along with the pan-seared tuna roll and the firecracker roll (like last time). at the end of the meal, the manager came over to ask about the food, etc. he was very nice so i told him my feedback about the bathroom signs - that they need writing, not just those weird pics. he said they're working on that because he's heard the same from several customers.haha greatness!
