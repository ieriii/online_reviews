I couldn't decide between 2 and 3. Sushi was yummy but not excellent. Ambiance and atmosphere was great. Service was awful. Our waiter came once to take our order and once to give us our bill (after being done eating for over 20 minutes). Nothing great. Probably will go there again just for convenience. Will give the downtown location a try.
