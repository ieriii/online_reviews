Sultans is my favorite eatery in Chicago. The price to taste ratio is incredible. I've only had their falafel sandwiches and lentil soup but it's too delicious to give up by being adventurous. Cash only (they have an ATM, I believe the fee is $2) Competitive seating Parking available One star docked for our delivery experience (ordered and received two sandwiches, paid for three-- the receipt was hidden in the bag somewhere and the delivery guy ran off before we could check our order). It wasn't even too horrible of an experience but does keep me from giving 5 stars. Sultan really deserves 4.5 stars.
