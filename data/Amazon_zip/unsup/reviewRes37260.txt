I have champagne taste and on a soju budget! Living 2 blocks from this market has its points. Even thought I shop at Trader Joes and H-Mart 90% of the time, I really enjoy going to this market. However, I do NOT recommend it for your day-to-day stuff. I do recommend the DELICOUS Breakfast they have (usually go Sunday mornings), I recommend the Eggs Benedict with Truffles! The cheese selection is nice, however they hardly EVER have "free samples!" - (unlike Whole Foods). I bought a few things, including a small dessert... and spent $50! Oh well, Quality is great though.
