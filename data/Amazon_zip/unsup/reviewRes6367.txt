I have been in a cooking and eating slump for a long time. You know, when nothing seems to excite you? Maybe it is winter? Maybe it is being on a budget? But that all changed when I dined here! This place is amazing!  Suddenly I was inspired to cook. Perhaps because it's simplicity reminded me of Italy? Instead of saying "I can make that", I was saying "I WANT to make that".   I hate to even write this, because the quality and taste of the dishes do not even compare, but the menu reminds me of Frasca on Paulina. But I must stress that the food is SO much better! I read about the Homemade Ricotta served with Honey and Toast and I didn't remember it was from this restaurant. When it arrived, I immediately remembered, as how could one mistake the mason jar. This Toast course was so deliciously satisfying that I could eat this for every meal.  The other standout for me was the Giant Rigatoni. It was perfect with it's Roasted Tomatoes and Bits of Sausage. I was just blown away .  I can't wait to go back and try more dishes. I actually think I might venture in bringing my Italian Father here.... (He complained for weeks about the last Italian restaurant I brought him to).
