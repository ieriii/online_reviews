Stopped in to see how Doug and his delicious wieners were doing. I tried the tuben which was a Ruben hot dog. Holy crap was it good. It came with Russian dressing and sour crout. I have also tried the buffalo dog, the Thuringer, the classic Chicago style dog, chili cheese dog, and a corn dog. If I had to make one recommendation it would be, DON'T PLAY IT SAFE, because whatever you decide will be the best hot dog you have ever had, and why not be adventurous.
