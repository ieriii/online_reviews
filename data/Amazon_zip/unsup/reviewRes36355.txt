Two words - Godzilla Roll! I had been meaning to try this place out for a while, as I drive/or walk past it at least 3 times a week. I finally decided to check it out for dinner last weekend, and was blown away. It is located next door to a Somali restaurant that I frequent, but never wandered two doors down...glad I finally did. After looking over the massive menu, we decided to start with the Godzilla Roll and an order of Crab Rangoon...Probably the best sushi and Crab Rangoon I've ever had. Now I've been to A LOT of [Asian] restaurants, so that is saying something! Not only was the sushi delicious, but the presentation was definitely a beautiful site. Of course, I went with my usual Thai Iced Tea, which was great. Pretty standard, but there are times where I've had tea that tasted sort of chalky...theirs didn't. As my course, I went with the basic red curry w/shrimp. I generally go for something a bit different, but when trying a new restaurant I tend to go with the classic dishes for my first visit. It was pretty good, although I will say I didn't like that they put eggplant in the curry. Either way, it was tasty. The bf got the Bay Beach rice dish which was also tasty. I'm not a huge drinker, but they had a special of 3 glasses of wine for $10. Not bad! Well - it's safe to say that I'll be back. Possibly for dinner tonight. Ha!
