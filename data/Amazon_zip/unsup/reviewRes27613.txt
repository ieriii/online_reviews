Let it be known that this place has the best PAN pizza.... not deep dish, not suffed, not Chicago Style.... the best PAN pizza. Remember the days when you were a kid and in the "Book-It" club and after 4 stars you got a free personal pan pizza from Pizza Hut? No? Well, I do. It was the best thing ever as a child. Well, Pequods' delivers the best for us adults that rememeber those days. I never thoguht burnt cheese would taste so good until Pequod's delivered it to me! FYI---The Pequod: The name of the boat in Moby Dick... I had to ask the bartender b/c I never read it.
