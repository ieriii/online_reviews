We usually sit at the bar when we eat here. Jimmy and the other boys at the bar are very entertaining!! It's also a good place to meet up with friends for some happy hour apps! We've had the oysters -fresh, plump, and salty! The charcuterie plate is pleasing as well as all of the selection of outstanding cheeses.  Pick some flights or get some recs from Jimmy and his buddies. We've ordered the flank steak as entree and it did not disappoint. The champagne flights are awesome! This place is a good way to find out what wine/champagne you like and what cheese you like! It's really all reasonably priced and the service is excellent.
