This morning we had a really tasty, inexpensive breakfast at Milk and Honey. We'd never been there before, but we'll definitely be back. I had the breakfast panini and my boyfriend had the oatmeal with a side of scrambled eggs and bacon. Everything was great. It was a little funny that the girl poured the "freshly squeezed orange juice" from a sealed gallon jug, but who cares? I loved it and, Diane S., I ain't white.
