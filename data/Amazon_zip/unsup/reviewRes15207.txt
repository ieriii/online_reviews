At first, I was a bit hesitant about going to the Violet Hour, it looked to fancy and pretentious, I'm the type of girl that is comfortable in my sweats, but likes to dress up once and awhile within reason. The Violet Hour has to sign, nothing so it's easy to miss i.e. just like the speakeasy's of the 1920's. I was walking pass a wall with graffiti when my friend told me this was it. Really? What? We waited in line since the place is very small and intimate. When we got inside, I was impressed, darkly lit, cute, laid back, that's what I like! The bartender was hilarious and friendly as we ordered drinks. Cocktails were $12 which is totally reasonable and they were delicious. I like my sweet girly drinks so I had the Pimms #5 that tasted just heaven. I could spend hours there just chatting and talking with people. When we were ready to leave for the next adventure, one of the staff helped us on where to go. Who does that nowadays? :) Great place, great people, great times.
