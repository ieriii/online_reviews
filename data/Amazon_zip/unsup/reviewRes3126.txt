I shall start by saying that I have lost count of the number of times I have been to Crisp. My addiction with this eatery are the barbecue wings with fries. Oh my word! The Seoul bowl also goes over incredibly well with me. The rice and the ground steak in a sweet, but not saccharin, sauce is delicious. But the spicy barbecue wings that are plump to food bliss really keep me coming back.
