My best friend and I visited this place for dinner after hearing rave reviews from a local. We were seated immediately. Since we didn't want to order two plates of BBQ short ribs, we had the kitchen cook it for us. I was afraid they were going to char the meat, but it was cooked perfectly and bonus: we didn't smell like BBQ smoke afterwards! We also ordered a seafood pancake, which was delicious although there was very little seafood to be found amongst all the green onions. The side dishes were plentiful and delicious. The service was adequate, but fairly slow. They do have a parking lot, but it's super small and not easy to squeeze into a spot. All in all, I'm sure I would go back again with more friends to help chow down the delicious food.
