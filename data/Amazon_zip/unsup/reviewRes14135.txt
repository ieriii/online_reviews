I came to Revolution Brewing Company this summer with a group of friends for dinner. We started out with the charcuterie platter, and I got the Wisconsin cheddar soup. Both were decent. Nothing to write home about, but OK. For my entree, I ordered the pizza that was the special. When it came out, it had mushrooms on it. Mushrooms were definitely not a topping listed on the menu, and I don't like mushrooms. I sent it back and they brought me another one, but by the time I got my new pizza, everyone else was pretty much done eating their meals. To compensate for the messed up pizza, the waiter comped the dessert...that my friend ordered, not me. There are lots of great breweries in Chicago, so I probably won't go out of my way to Logan Square to go to Revolution again. The beer was good, though!
