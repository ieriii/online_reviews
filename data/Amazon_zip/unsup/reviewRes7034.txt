Went here for a buddy's birthday last night. Service was very good, even if our waitress was a vegetarian and was lacking in the suggestions deparment. They did make up for it by being oddly receptive to my friend's request for their wifi password so we could look at pictures from a bachelor party he went to, but I digress. All three of us had brisket sandwiches, and all three of us finished our brisket sandwiches. Sides (cornbread, fries, coleslaw) were all good too. If it was socially acceptable, I'd probably come here, exclusively eat the pickles and chips that come before your meal, and leave. Don't get me wrong, I'd tip, but I have a feeling this would still be frowned upon. Also, it just occurred to me now that we mentioned it was our friend's birthday and they didn't bring him out anything. You know what, screw it, I'm going back just for the chips and pickles. A lot of people seem to have commented on the prices but I think this restaurant does a pretty good job of catering to clientele in the surrounding areas. It's called the Gold Coast for a reason. Basically, if you want BBQ served on a tin tray, you've come to the wrong spot. But, if you're looking for pretty good BBQ and moderately fast internet, Chicago Q has got the goods.
