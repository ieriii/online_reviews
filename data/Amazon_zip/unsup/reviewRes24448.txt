The vegetarian burrito (no cheese or sour cream and it's vegan), vegetarian salad, and the oatmeal shake are all delicious. The patacones with garlic oil and black beans are really good too. The server told us the zucchini, pineapple, and black bean empanadas are vegan, so we ordered one of each - they are all very good. The service is always very nice and friendly here. If I could change one thing, I would want Irazu to mark items on the menu that can be prepared vegan, not just vegetarian. BYOB and cash only.
