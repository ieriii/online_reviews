Can I rank 4.5 stars? Graham Elliot's is great. The food and service are wonderful. It was a creative, unique experience that I am pleased to have enjoyed. But, for the price tag, that's what I expect. The one negative would be the attitude of the host. We had an 8:00 reservation. At 7:20 on the accident-ridden expressway it became apparent that we would be late. We called. He said, "I'll hold the table until 8:10, after that you lose the reservation." We arrived at 8:15 and he gave us quite a bit of attitude, but sat us. My boyfriend made the reservation as a birthday treat, and must have mentioned it when the reservation was made. I would have preferred the host said nothing rather than his sarcastic, eye-rolled, "happy birthday" as he sat us. Beseides his bad attitude, we very much enjoyed our meal. I would be pleased to return on another special occasion sometime.
