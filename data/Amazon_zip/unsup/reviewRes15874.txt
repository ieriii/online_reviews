This is our go-to place for special occassions and we've never been disappointed!  The service has always been friendly and accomodating, and the food delicious. I don't know very much about wine, but always think when I'm eating good Italian food I need to pair it with a good wine. My servers always have great suggestions, and promise that if I don't like what they recommend, they'll get me something else. (I've never had to ask for anything else.)  One suggestion: you have to ask for oil and cheese if you'd like it with your bread.
