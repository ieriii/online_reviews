This was the first place we stopped to eat when we came to Chicago. I was worried because we arrived right at lunch time (12:30), but we didn't have to wait very long at all (about 20-30 minutes). I ordered two regular fries and Doug told me to just save money and get one large. Then I ordered a large drink and he told me to just get a small since they had free refills because he's "not too big on upselling". The food was really good, but I'm not sure I would have waited two hours for it.
