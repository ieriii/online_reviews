This place has a great beer menu and great bar food. The Anti-hero IPA is a standout . The diverse crowd is always fun and having been there over 10 times in the past year, I can say that the crowd is pretty consistently fun. A plus is the fact that even though it is in Logan Square, the hipster vibe has not taken over this place so it will survive all ironic movement currently sweeping other gastropubs. The service is really good for a bar/pub/restaurant and very friendly. I can't remember the name of our server during our most recent visit but he had a great vibe and knew his beers as well. Actually, he made the entire meal very fun and my out of town guest commented on how he wished more servers were like our server. Nice job!The food was really good for a pub and actually some of the items were really good for a restaurant! Yes, get the popcorn and you won't be disappointed except that the portion is a bit small so order 2 servings (trust me on this). You won't be disappointed as the menu has something for everyone. Love the burgers but I have had a lot of the menu and have loved it all. That is actually my favorite part of Revolution: every time I have gone there, I have tried a new beer or food item and have always been really pleased. That is not typical with many other places I have visited and that is why I keep going back here.
