Wow!! This is such a unique restaurant. I was quite nervous dining here as I am definitely not a sushi fan but because we were here for a business engagement, I had to pick up my chopsticks and give it my best shot. So glad that I did! The food here was presented very creatively and the flavor combinations were surprising but delicious. My favorite dish was the Kobe beef with the rice. The beef was so tender that it just seemed to melt away with every bite. Add great service into the mix here and this restaurant ranks close to one of my favorites.
