How is Violet Hour? I wouldn't know - despite reassurances that I would be called when my table was ready, and checking back after an hour of radio silence, I never heard from the charming folks running the door. My spirits were seriously dampened, as I had high hopes for the cocktails and chill atmosphere, but luckily my group found refuge across the street at Big Star. P.S. Pretty sure people have peed in that large beaker-vase-ashtray thing by the door. I'm sad it wasn't me. Maybe next time, VH.
