Hot day last Monday. Went in for dinner about 6pm, and the coolest part of the restaurant (the front) had no table service. Server tried to put us a a tiny table the size of a postage stamp, squeezed in the back of the restaurant, packed with people, and about 20 degrees warmer than the front. Now who thought that it was a good idea not to have table service in the coolest and most comfortable part of the place. Wasn't gonna fetch my own food just to stay cool, and certainly wasn't going to sit at a cramped tiny table and swelter just to have someone bring my food to me. Too many places in Andersonville to choose from to be comfortable. I walked!
