We've stayed here several times and I've been to a number of events here as well. Beautiful decor and great service. Nice touches - even on the small stuff. Quiet - even on the night President Obama won the election!!! The rooms are nice and spacious (loved the little living area - made me feel like we were in Manhattan) and although the bathrooms are a little smaller than I'd like, they are modern and sleek.
