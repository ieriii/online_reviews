I'm rather unimpressed. I first went to a Ruth's Chris Steak House in White Plains, New York. I was more than unimpressed when I took a tour of the kitchen, and foud the "chefs" were just unpacking pre-cut and sealed steaks from plastic wrap "to guarantee the same experience at all locations". Foo. This trip was many years later--I figured it must have been a one-off. Not so much. The steaks were good, I'll grant that. Except mine was overcooked, even though I stressed the fact I really, REALLY wanted very VERY rare--Blue, to be precise. I also love lobster. I didn't want to order just lobster at a steak joint, but they offered a (miniscule) 8 oz. tail as an option with a steak. Ok, WTH. Except it was cooked within an inch of rubber. Seriously, I debated whether it was still food. Meanwhile, we got nickled and dimed to death. By the time we were done, it was $600 for four people. No joke. Now, I don't *mind* $600 for a really outstanding meal. But Ruth's Chris puts itself out there as a #1 restaurant--and frankly, didin't meet the bar, but certainly BILLED as if it did. If you want to be a world-class restaurant, for Ghod's sake DO IT. My Dad was an executive chef; I most absolutely know what they SHOULD deliver. They didn't. Find someone else.
