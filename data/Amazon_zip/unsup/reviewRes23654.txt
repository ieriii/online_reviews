I was pretty impressed with Icosium Kafe when I visited for the first time last night. Excellent soup, prompt service, and the crepes themselves were good, and enormous! Tremendous value here as well; huge crepe + small bowl of soup for $8.50, or you could get a huge bowl of soup for a mere $2.50! Good stuff!
