The BEST falafel in the city....at both locations - I love this place - baba ganouj is to die for & their lentil soup, wow -- close to being as good as mine! A great little spot to pick up something enroute, or stay in for a casual hang with friends, Sultan's has been on my 'go to' list for years. Maybe this will be another night for some tabouleh in the bathtub.
