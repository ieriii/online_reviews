At first, I was extremely annoyed that they did not take reservations. When I got there (15 degrees out), I had just arrived at the airport, cabbed to my hotel, cabbed to The Purple Pig, and then was told the wait was about an hour and a half. Since this was my first night venturing about Chicago, I decided to take a brisk walk... Unfortunately, it was about 9:30p and everything around had already closed shop... The Magnificent Mile was still magnificent, though. Adds a bit of romance to the city when you pass by Cartier in freezing weather while starving your bottom off... (o_O wtf? I know...) When I got back to the restaurant, I was promptly seated, my order was taken the moment I was ready, the food was perfectly timed so there wasn't too much food sitting on the table getting cold. This is the type of establishment where you order 2-4 small plates per person and share amongst the table. It's a great way to nosh on a little of everything. Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg - SPLENDIDLY served in the cutest little pork shaped bowl. The textures were amazing and the pop of the salt in the pickled peppers mixed with the crunch of the crispy kale and richness of the runny fried egg was mouthwatering to say the least. Potato and Speck Croquettes with Calabrian Chili Aioli - I don't quite remember this dish as one that stood out, but it wasn't bad... Jamon Serrano with Oyster Mushrooms & Fried Duck Egg over Grilled Bread - I love anything with fried egg and bread, so I had to order this... Again, amazing, but if you were to get just one fried egg dish, I'd go with the pig's ear. Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes - buttery, creamy, awe-inspiringly tender pork, fluffy clouds of mashed potatoes... I loved it. Now I realize why they don't accept reservations... If they did, I probably wouldnt be able to get a table until 2015. It's worth the wait. Trust me.
