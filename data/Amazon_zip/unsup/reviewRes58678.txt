First time visitors. The wait was very long for a Wed night, and it took forever to have a waiter show up. But, once ordered, the food was out super quick. Menu items were classics mixed with the very unusual - which you'd expect for a Chinese restaurant. The flavors were only OK. Kind of disappointing. The meats used seemed to be of good quality. So, for us, we will keep looking for our favorite' chinese restaurant.
