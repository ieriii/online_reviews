I wound up staying here recently while attending a conference. The conference hotel (The Drake) was full, and while there was a Westin just down the street (I usually stay at Westins), the particular Westin in question had horrible reviews. I'm glad I stayed at the Knickerbocker. The rooms were nicely appointed. The bed was VERY comfortable (and I'm quite picky about such things). I didn't eat at the restaurant, but I did visit the bar twice. Both bartenders were really friendly - when I asked if they had a preference for one wine over another, they articulated a preference and then (to my delight) gave me a small pour of their suggestion. In one case I didn't like the suggested wine and they gave me a taste of a different wine. They both treated me like I was an old friend/regular. Very friendly - very laid back. Exactly what you want after a long day of business. The hotel was a great value relative to the other hotels nearby and the staff were great.
