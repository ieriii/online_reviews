When my friend the lacto said it was worth her, um, "symptoms" to eat here, it only confirmed what I already knew. Pequod's is the best pizza in chicago!  I haven't been to the redone location (after the fire) and my 5-star rating is based on the pizza alone. My favorite includes olives, mushrooms and spinach, and lots of sauce. The caramelized crust is incredible. Go here. Lactose intolerance is no excuse!
