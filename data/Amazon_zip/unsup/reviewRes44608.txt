Wow! For those of you familiar with Tartine in San Francisco, consider Alliance to be Chicago's version, less the attitude! Ordered an almond croissant and a vanilla latte and was very pleased. The cakes looked awesome, just like the ones you see on Charm City. Alliance has seating and wifi available in a room next door. The guy at the counter was great but seemed more like he should be working at a skateboard shop which added a "cool" dimension to the place. I pledge that I will visit here the first Saturday of every month despite the minor inconvenience that we live 2 hours west!
