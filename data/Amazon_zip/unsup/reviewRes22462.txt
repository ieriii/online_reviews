I was expecting to be blow away by the "best chinese food in the city." Maybe we ordered wrong, but I thought everything was good. Nothing was great--except maybe the green beans! I thought I would love the dry chili chicken, but it was very dark meat and extremely fatty, which made it much less enjoyable than I hoped!
