Beer selection is still excellent, that's not going to change. On the other hand, the last few times we've been, we left disappointed in the food. Several items were overcooked and several things were so salty that we could barely finish them. I'm not sure why things seem to be slipping in the kitchen, but I hope it gets turned around. I'll keep going for the great brews and hopefully I can give a better report on the food soon.
