I have dreams about this pizza!  Its one of those places where you eat it, and its not super memorable, but a week later, you're craving it. The atmosphere at gino's is very cool, and being able to write on anything is fun.I don't go to chicago much anymore, so I mail order it. It costs around $70 to have two mediums over nighted. They come on dry ice and you just bake them yourself.... When a good pizza locally is $20 each, the price for this quality of pizza is not bad. We do it once or twice a year and its a big deal around our house when the big styrofoam box shows up on the front door!This is americana at its best.... I love "chicago style pizza" or "new york hot dogs"  Gino's and giordano's are the best !
