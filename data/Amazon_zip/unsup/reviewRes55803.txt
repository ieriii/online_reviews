4 stars due to the overbooking. Why have reservations if you're overbooked and running an hour behind? That's the huge downside!However, the food is to DIE for, so it's worth the wait every once in awhile. The prices are very fair and the atmosphere is nice....You will also get a free appetizer (pizza bread) but it's a nice touch while you wait. The portions are huge, you will get soup, salad and a pasta dish with your meal..I can almost taste it right now. If you're going to make the trip, go early and don't bring the kiddos..it's not kid friendly at all. You'll be glad you went
