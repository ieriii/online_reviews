Great service, okay food. There is nothing special about this place other than it's new and it has some well known investors. We expected a lot more from a place that has been talked about for a while. The sushi was okay but nothing outstanding (and we've eaten at a lot of sushi places), the entrees were very salty and just bland without the sauces. Nothing pleased our pallets. To me, it was similar to a Ben Pao or PF Changs.  I do have to say the service was outstanding. Then again, I don't go to a restaurant hungry for amazing service, I go for the food to taste good.  Loud atmosphere for the trendy folks. If you're looking for a romantic evening out, this is NOT the place. Overall, I wouldn't come back here unless it was for a party and I had no choice in the matter :).
