Currently salivating on my keyboard thinking about XOCO's churros and Cubana sandwich. I relied on the recommendations of my fellow Yelpers and ordered the Cubana sandwich. What ensued was a little fiesta of flavors in my mouth. The pork was so incredibly tender; it could've dissolved on my tongue like a Listerine strip. The cured bacon had great maple flavoring, but wasn't too sweet and balanced out the sandwich nicely. Yummy avocado and cheese rounded out the ingredient medley and the sauce on the side just kicked it up a notch. Oh the churros. I just want to curl up with one of those bad boys and lie there forever surrounded by fried dough and sugary goodness. Seriously, I could eat those everyday. While the price point seems a little high ($16 for a sandwich and guac) the ingredients are so fresh, the portions large, and the flavors so complex that you won't mind shelling out a few extra dollars. Go here immediately. Seriously? Are you still reading? I said GO!
