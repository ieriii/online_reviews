Not really a good experience. Food mediocore at best, service was horribly slow. Server couldn't even get the saganaki lit. Had a Groupon, they added 20% on the taxed amount. (Should be on the sub-total, who tips on taxes!) Just pretty much a painful experience for the price. The music was good. We won't be going back.
