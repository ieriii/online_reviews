Dear Brazzaz, you are like that moody, bi-polar girlfriend. Yet, during those week-long silent treatments, the thought of those lofty highs where you make us breakfast in bed everyday are what keep us from kicking you to the curb. Hence, the four stars. We've been to Brazzaz three times now, the first time was on a Friday night and BLEW OUR SOCKS OFF. Every single cut of meat was cooked juuust right and I had never tasted meat that was so mind-blowingly flavorful. Even their selections are the bar were good... excellent mushroom risotto, all-you-can-eat sushi and oyster? Closet fat girl's dream. I think I gained three pounds instantaneously that night. The second time we went for a Saturday lunch, and it did not live up to the glory of the first. The selection was considerably less, the meat was overcooked and well... bland. Thinking that it was just how lunch was and maybe they just serve mainly the leftovers from the night before, we went again a third time. This time we chose Saturday for dinner at 10 PM, half an hour before they close since it was the only time we could get a reservation. Failure yet again. Maybe we came too late and no fresh meat was being cooked? I feel like an abused girlfriend trying to blame herself. But we will never give up.... that first time was just THAT GOOD. I refuse to believe that I will never again taste meats of that immense selection that good ever again. So, Brazzaz, if this is a ploy to take all our monies (and you have taken lots... back to the gf reference), you win. But we will you at least be good to us again? Crossing fingers... will be back soon!
