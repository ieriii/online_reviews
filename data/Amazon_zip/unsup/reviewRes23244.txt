Good coffee, good crepes. What more could you want?! (Did I mention the coffee is amazing?) I had a delightful brunch with about 6 of us (including myself) and we were in and out within an hour. I had the strawberry and nutella crepes, and not only did they cure my hangover (tee hee), they prompted a long lost love for the art of creperie. Super nice staff, nice eats. I will be returning!
