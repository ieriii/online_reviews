This place left a bad taste in our mouths and it was not because of the food! There were about seven of us who ordered, six of whom ordered sushi that sat 20 minutes on the counter before it was served "fresh" to us, and that was after we ASKED for it! Not to mention that Wakamono's restaurant door was kept open because they had a space by the street for diners so imagine all kinds of bacteria swarming in on that succulent raw seafood, eh? Where is the FDA inspector when you need them? When we complained about the food sitting on the counter, the manager (maybe even part owner) insisted it was restaurant policy and that the customer is not always right! Wow, this guy must have graduated from Hitler's school of customer service. Someone should feed him sushi left on the sidewalk and we'll see if he'll eat it, because that's practically what we had. Wakamono wasn't exactly huge that it took you three steps from the sidewalk to the counter where our sushi was. Our mistake was sucking it in and just eating because we just didn't want to argue with pea-brained dimwits. Too much soy sauce can damage logical reasoning apparently. Oh, and the food, as far as sushi goes, is just okay. So for anyone looking to try Wakamono, bring an FDA inspector with you. I bet you that you will either get rewarded with a free meal or a hefty sum for reporting an unsanitary establishment. Otherwise, it's not worth your money or your time.
