Man, really? 4.5 stars average? Has nobody who reviewed this place ever been to a "real" bakery before? They get lots of stars for service but only 2 for the food. Very mediocre, especially for the price. If I'm going to pay that much I'll hike up to Lutz's or Dinkels.I'll admit the outdoor seating is great, when available.
