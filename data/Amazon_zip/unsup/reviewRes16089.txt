Ok Violet Hour-- We need to have a status chat I'll admit it- I really thought this was going to be a casual relationship- Someplace I only go when Jason E. drags me there...But your nice/attentive/welcoming staff and a few delicious drinks (romeo and Juliet..mmmmm) have finally melted my cold dead heart . Do I think it is the best place, with the best bartenders, with the absolute best drinks in Chicago? No- But the drinks are inventive and good...good for a quiet night out and not so much for a bender. Its for those nights when I want to be left alone with my company in a very adult way...which is nice. That being said- I've never had to wait in line- if I was a plebe I probably wouldn't make it as often...but as it is now I'm happy to come back over and over again.
