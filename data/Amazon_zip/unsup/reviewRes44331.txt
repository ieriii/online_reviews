Stop #4 on the Cupcake Crawl. I really liked the cozy side room adjacent to the Alliance bakery, but I felt bad that everyone else got kicked out for our private cupcake party! It worked out well though as we were all able to sit down and chat and sample some of the delicious cupcakes Alliance had to offer. For our first chocolate cupcakes of the day we had the chocolate chocolate, and the hazelnut with chocolate frosting. Both were excellent, and you gotta get a forkful of frosting with the cake to balance it all out right. We also tried the carrot cake one which was nice and moist, but not as good as the carrot cake we had at Sweet Cakes. There was also a big container of coffee for those who drink such things, and the guy who helped us out was very cool and friendly. A great way to end the great Cupcake Crawl 2007! Thanks Rob! Update: We went back for a treat, and I was kind of disappointed with my strawberry lemon cupcake, so I'm moving my 5 to a 4. There was nothing special about the lemon cupcake, it tasted like it could have come out of a box and I had hoped for some more lemon flavor. Also the strawberry part was all in the pink icing, which again did not taste that much like strawberry. I guess it was too subtle for my taste buds.
