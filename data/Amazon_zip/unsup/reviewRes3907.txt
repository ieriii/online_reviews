CRISP STOPPED CARING Yes, that's right, Crisp has officially taken a dump. One, pricing is getting a bit out of hand; it used be somewhere around 6.99 for a Steak Bowl (all it is, is seasoned beef and rice) and is now costing around 10 bucks. Two, they give you less of everything; steak bowls used to be stuffed to the brim and had at least 2" thick of beef. The wings USED TO BE, dare i say, pterodactyl sized. Now, everything has been sacrificed for greater profits. The wings look fairly generic in size (i used to love steroid sized wings). Three, their neo-hipster staff needs to drop the $hitty attitude. If i ask for extra atomic sauce for my steak bowl, just give it to me, don't hassle about 50 cents, that is completely petty and classless. Just stop with the attitude in general, that guy "John" who used to manage the place would have never stood for any of that "ironic shirt, PBR drinking, thick rimmed glasses" crap. It is so unfortunate to see a restaurant I once treasured, completely lose its way. Also consider, this review is coming from someone who allocated several hours to essays promoting Crisp to the food network and other local news organizations....my stomach is empty and my heart is broken.
