Stayed here for my sister's wedding. The rooms were nice, and I hear we got quite a discount on them. There was a computer issue that resulted in us being placed in an occupied room - and then a second time the desk receptionist misheard my name and put us in my aunt's room. They were extremely apologetic and gave us a $40 voucher for the hotel restaurant as compensation. It really wasn't that much trouble for us, though. If you join the Kimpton InTouch membership club (free), you get free wifi connectivity in your room as well as Raid the Minibar privileges, which allow you to get up to 2 items, for a total of $10, from the minibar for free. The hotel has a lot of great lounge areas, and the 312 restaurant is good as well (separate review for that). They did a fantastic job with the cocktail hour and reception, and everything else was great. I've since lost a key to my car, and I've called them numerous times to check back if it's been found, and their lost and found office is fantastic.
