our first visit to Zed was more than fantastic. We enjoyed more than a dozen different dishes prepared by the chefs with unbelievable service. Our server, Kevin, paired our meal with an unbelievable wine and was nothing but attentive. The experience at this place paired with the service was nothing but outstanding. The food is well priced as is the wine. Our server was able to suggest something in our range of style and price with minimal effort. This restaurant is a must for all.
