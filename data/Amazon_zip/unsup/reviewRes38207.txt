The only thing I liked about this place was the Hoegaarden I drank. This place sucks only because they kicked us out for having a large group. We started out small but more friends showed up and the waiter told us they couldn't accomodate our group and told us we had to leave. WTF??? We were already there at two tables, we just needed a few more chairs. What happened to satisfying the custy? Gitdafuckouttahere! I thought bars welcomed alot of people to make more mulah? My review is based on this experience. I never got the chance to taste the food or other beer. My friends ate but I don't know what their thoughts were in regards to the food. We paid and had to leave. I won't be going back.
