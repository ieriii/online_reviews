Hard to believe, but I've been in Chicago for over 6 years, and the only deep dish pizza I've had was at this particular Giordano's. It was also for my first date with my girlfriend during freshman year of college. I don't really remember the rest of the date, but for some reason the food and the experience there is still vivid in my mind. I could probably still point out where we sat that day. ANYHOW.... I remember the food was great. It was my first time having deep dish and I loved the combination of the meats, vegetables, cheeses, sauce and particularly the crust. It was a really filling meal, freshly baked (takes approx. 45 min) and yum-my. The service was friendly and polite. The atmosphere at this particular Giordano's was also very nice, tucked away behind a bunch of tall buildings. The inside was large with a lot of space, yet there were enough people so that it didn't seem too creepy. I remember the experience was quite romantic as well. Maybe I was just in love...hahahhahah (she's probably ROTFL while reading this).
