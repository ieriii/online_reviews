Dingy, dirty and very poor location... DON'T DO IT! We chose this hotel b/c it was close to the convention ctr and the pictures looked nice. Don't fall for it... you'll be seriously disappointed. It's worth some extra bucks and a short taxi ride to choose another location. The service is non existent. All the staff we encountered moved at a snail pace and had a serious "I don't care" attitude. Our room key stopped working, we had to wait until the manager got out of a meeting to fix it. The rest of the desk staff stood around chatting about stuff. Hello, we're paying customers, interrupt the damn mtg and give us some service. The rooms are dumpy and dirty. My co-worker checked in to her room to find that someone had urinated in the toilet and didn't flush.  Really?! There were stains on my bathroom floor and I would call the decor "contemporary dingy." The location is ridiculous. There are no restaurants or bars for blocks... w/ the exception of the sorry restaurant/bar in the hotel. In both the bar (they call it a lounge... HA) and restaurant, it felt like a bunch of neighborhood friends were hanging out. The bartenders were chummy with their buddies and didn't give us the time of day. We ordered one cocktail and two beers. The bartender brought the cocktail and forgot the beers for almost 20 min. My co worker went to go ask only to find the bartender singing karaoke. Good thing his buddies stopped by for some fun!!
