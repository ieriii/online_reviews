Came here for a Yelp Elite event (THAT'S RIGHT PLEBS) and tried to eat my weight in fried appetizers before I realized we could also order off the menu. The atmosphere here was really chill - the waitresses were attentive without being overbearing, and they made us feel really welcome, despite the fact they were doing all this for little more than the vague promise of some extra publicity. The warden burger was a huge cheese-filled monstrosity. The billy kid salad made me rethink my status on greens. For someone whose life revolves around the death of animals lower on the food chain as much as mine does, that's saying something. Mac and cheese was disappointing, as it is wont to be. It always sounds a lot better than it is, like sex in the shower or masturbating on an airplane.
