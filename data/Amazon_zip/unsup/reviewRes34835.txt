Clearly I need to stay out of River North. Or River West. Or whatever the hell neighborhood that is. Seven years ago, when I lived a mile away, Sushi X was my favorite sushi place. It was intimate, fun and the rolls were fantastic. The menu was small -- the basics and a few creative bigger rolls. I remember miso soup in tea mugs. It was like going to your own club and having sushi. It was perfect. Fast forward to 2010 and my fiance and I are in the neighborhood for an event and decide to stop in for some sushi (i.e. I say, there's this great sushi place that I used to go to). So yeah, the decor has not changed at all. And for that I'm grateful. Because everything else has. Instead of a tiny, awesome menu, it's a gigantic behemoth -- with a Trixie on the cover. I mean, it even said, "this month's model -- Trixie! -- with a ton of cooked rolls, cream cheese and tempura. We had three rolls and none were that great. The Venus Fly Trap has Sriricha -- cock sauce - -in it. and somehow wasn't even spicy. The Yellow Jacket was too mango-ey and saucy. The spicy scallop was pretty good. And the service? We had to ask for a wine bottle opener -- and they gave us one with only one arm. And it took 45 minutes for us to get our sushi when there were maybe 12 people in the whole restaurant. This place is now my Sushi Ex.
