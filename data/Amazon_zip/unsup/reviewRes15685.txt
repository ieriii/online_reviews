Used to be good, but has changed. I used to order from calo all the time, as a true, authentic italian restaurant, different from the american style pizza. They have changed their pizzas recently and they are greasy and just like any other place. They actually delivered a pizza margherite to my house and it was just cheese, with lots of grease and a side of basil, no tomato. A side of basil! Terrible in my opinion. I may as well have ordered from Dominos. I had to throw it away. I am disappointed that I will not order from there again. I used to love their pizza.
