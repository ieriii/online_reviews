If you're looking for an amazing atmosphere with great food, unlimited meats & salad bar, impeccable service and selection of wine, look no further.  By no means is this 'normal', but I frequent Texas de Brazil about 3-4 times per month. The managers, servers, meat carvers and hostesses treat every customer as if they are their most important. The couple of times I have been unhappy with a new selection of wine or meat, the management was more than happy to offer their assistance. If you are going for the meat, listen carefully, DO NOT fill your plate at the 'salad bar'. The various dried meats, cheeses, specialty and salad items might look really tempting, but they will get the best of you and, before you know it, you will not have room for their amazing selection of meats! A couple recommendations: Try their house special "Picanha" and their flank steak. All of the meat items are amazing, but those two get me every time! Compared to Fogo and Brazzaz, Texas is the top of the tier. The other places' selection just doesn't add up...not to mention neither of those places has the amazing Wine Wall with wine-angels doing acrobatics! If you don't want to wait a long time, definitely go on a weekday because the weekends get pretty crazy busy with waits in excess of an hour.
