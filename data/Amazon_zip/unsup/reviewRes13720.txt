90 Miles is a great place to get some tasty Cuban style food. You can't go wrong with the goat cheese and chorizo empenadas, and the sandwiches are very tasty as well (I enjoy the media noche and the croquette sandwiches the most). The Ropa Vieja (sp?) was quite tender and tasty also - well worth having. Don't forget to have some tasty coffee while you are there too! The only detractor to this particular location is that it is quite small inside. If you really need more room for a group, you can always go to the other location where they have a lot of tables. However, I like the people here better ;) Well worth visiting!
