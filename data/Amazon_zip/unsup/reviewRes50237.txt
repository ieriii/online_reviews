good food.. but expensive, staff is always pretty nice I used to go on trivia nights.. until I realized the winning teams are always cheating. Somebody needs to check these people using Iphones googling all the answers, they don't even try to hide it, they just do it out in the open.. you would think getting perfect scores for the whole night would be a dead giveaway to the host but its acceptable I guess. Pretty girls seem to get ahead as well, even when they answer incorrectly.
