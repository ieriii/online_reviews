Based on the good reviews here and its proximity to our hotel, my friend and I came here for lunch. We shared the turkey club, which was good. The potatoes o'brien that came with the sandwich were a little off--they just had a funny taste to them. The tuna melt was ok--it too had a bit of a funny taste. The bleu cheese dressing that came with the salad was truly strange--it looked like chunks of bleu cheese drowned in oil. It appeared toxic. We literally couldn't understand how a human being could look at it and think it was fit to serve to another human being. We flagged over our waiter and asked for a new dressing; the ranch was much better. Speaking of our waiter, he was neither nice nor rude. He didn't smile once or bother with normal pleasantries. It was really odd and not all that pleasant. All in all, we were pretty disappointed.
