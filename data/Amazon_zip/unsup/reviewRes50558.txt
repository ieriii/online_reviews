I had a great experience here when I came last Thursday. I got a coupon for "Buy One Entree, Get one Free" at the Yelp Fantasea event, so I figured I had better try it out!  We started out with some Fried Green Tomatoes, they were great. And then they brought out some Corn Muffins, which I was not expecting, but was quite pleasantly surprised to get! My friend and I both decided to get the Shrimp and Grits, which were also really good. There was some mushrooms and some sort of meat (I wasn't quite sure what kind) mixed in with a sauce. There was quite a bit of shrimp in the dish also, which made me quite happy!  Our server was very attentive, we were there about 7ish and it wasn't very busy, so that probably helped. But, she was very nice and made sure that we enjoyed everything.
