This is a great introduction to Chinese food and to Chinatown. I understand that it's kind of an icon here, and I can see why. The menu is absolutely, intensely HUGE -- thank goodness I had Suz C and Chan (again) to help place our order, or we would have been there all night waiting for me to decide what to try. We had Tony's Chicken, baby pea pods, crab rangoon, spicy cabbage, a spicy lamb dish, and a dish of green beans cooked with chiles and other spices. Oh, and a duck dish. Have I mentioned yet that we got all this food for $22 a piece including tip (4 people)?? WOW. Ok, the food is absolutely, intensely GOOD. Best ever? Perhaps not, but damn, it's up there. The only disappointment, Deb and I agreed, was the crab rangoon. The duck was fair but not particularly spectacular either. The lamb dish we had was quite good, nice and spicy that warmed up your mouth but didn't make you cry. Thank goodness, because I forgot to wear waterproof mascara . . . ha ha Clean, good feeling about the place. And it's busy. Serv ice was good. Another note: go early if you want to spend the evening checking out the shops and other things in the area -- most places in Chinatown close at 8 or 9pm, even on Saturdays. Overall, a good experience. I would definitely eat here again.
