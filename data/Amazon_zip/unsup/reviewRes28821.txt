I went for lunch with some coworkers (had a reservation; we were seated promptly and courteously). The atmosphere is bright and noisy, with colorfully painted walls and artwork. If you're the type who feels a bit of sensory overload (as I do), you should opt for a later lunch; it was noticeably quieter by 2:00. We shared the ceviche trio as a starter, which for me was the highlight of the meal; very crisp fresh flavors in sweet and tangy marinades that complemented the natural taste of the seafood (cod, blue marlin, shrimp, and calamari) without overwhelming. Be warned that because of the soupy nature of the ceviches (served with tortilla chips) they are slightly awkward to share and are ideal for 2, not more to share. I would have happily kicked back the leftover ceviche juice like a shot, but held back because I was with our company president. (Sigh.) For my main course I got the fish of the day which was salmon, grilled perfectly, medium rare. I would have like the fish as it was with little adornment, however there was a cheese and mushroom sauce ladled (overly) generously over the fish. The sauce was fine but reminiscent of a watered down cheese dip with mushrooms mixed in. It just wasn't the ideal complement for the salmon. I enjoyed the accompanying arborio rice as well as the green beans, but wanted more than the dollop of greens provided. (Healthy Hedonist likes her veggies!)  To complete my meal I chose the hot chocolate, and unfortunately the supposedly "Oaxacan" style hot chocolate was overly milky with just the faintest hint of cocoa and a pinch of cinnamon on top. This did not taste at all like the intensely cinnamonny hot chocolate I've had in Mexico, nor like the cocoa-rich concoctions typical of a fancy restaurant or good coffee shop.  A James Beard winner can surely pull out a better cocoa to end the meal on.
