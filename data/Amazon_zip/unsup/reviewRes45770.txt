Took a few out of town guests here tonight... despite it being a holiday weekend and post cubs game this place was half empty. We were seated right away and yet it took the waitress 10 minutes to come get our drink orders, we were ready to order but she went away for another good 10 minutes... My friend didn't get his caesar salad and we eventually received our food in good time. The waitress - who had been neglecting our refills - asked if everything was ok and I mentioned to her that we didn't get a caesar salad to which she responded "I'm sorry" and took off... (the salad was not on the final bill) and mind you our refills were still being neglected and yet the restaurant wasn't busy. I did see the waitress conversing with her co-workers instead of serving her tables... really lame service. The saving grace was the delicious food. I am hoping this lapse in service was a one time occurrence ...
