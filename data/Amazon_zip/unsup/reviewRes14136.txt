This place is awesome, and what is even better it is in Logan Square. I've wanted to go here sense Wednesday but the 3 hour waits were just not working for me. Finally last night during the Superbowl I called in to see how long the wait would be. To my surprise there were tables open, so we got down there as fast as we could. (No reservations taken) Atmosphere: modern, woodsy, with a touch of elegance. The best part is you could see where they brewed the beer! Beer: Hell yeah, I got the Iron Fist Pale Ale and the bf got the cross of gold. Both awesome, but I prefer the pale ale.  Food: American Classics gone amazingly right. Working man hamburger was big and flavorful. BUT the flemish beef stew is out of this world. I will be craving that for the next week. Do not forget about the garlic cream cheese mashed potatoes. I can not wait to go back to try the applewood smoked wings. YUM!
