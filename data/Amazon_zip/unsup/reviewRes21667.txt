I stop by here few times a year and this place had been consistent with their service and food quality. I guess the service remain the same since some of the waitresses had been working there for about 20-30years. Very friendly ladies I think the main reason why I go out of my way to visit Superdawg would be the "food to car window" experience and looking at some of the classic cars. It makes me feel like I'm living in the same era as the Fonz. heh
