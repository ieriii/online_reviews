What a beautiful space but it was practically empty on a Thursday night at 7:30. I opted for a light bite at the bar. The food was really, really salty. Not sure if it was just my selection or if the kitchen likes to overseason the food. There was really nothing compelling about my whole experience which would make me want to return.
