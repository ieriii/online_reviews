A half an hour to get drinks at lunch when the place was empty. The sushi is pre-cut. This is so wrong: the fish all gets stale exposed to the air. Particularly unforgivable for a place that's empty at lunch. Pieces were some of the smallest I have ever been served. No uni at lunch. Diameter of rolls was comparable to my thumb.
