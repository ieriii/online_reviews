I really did not like my experience at Tru. The atmosphere is weird. It is so bright, that you feel like you're in a lab, not a 5 star restaurant. there is no music. There are 3 servers waiting next t your table, so you can't have a private conversation. It is too uptight. The food was nice, but not spectacular.
