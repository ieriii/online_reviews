I love that tons of non-vegetarians have written reviews about this place, because it seriously IS NOT just for veggies. My single favorite item is the sweet potato quesadilla (with dairy cheese), but my omnivore friends, especially guys, love the Dagwood sandwich and SWEAR it's real pastrami. Make sure you leave room for dessert, especially the ridiculous shakes. One of my favorite instances here was when I brought my younger cousin, who was scared of "funky" food but then realized the DIner was all about comfort food. After lunch she kind of whispered to me, "I'm not trying to be judgy or anything, but why do so many vegetarians have so many tattoos?" I told her it was in the handbook.
