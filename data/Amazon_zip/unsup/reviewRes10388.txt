I'm happy to report that after a return visit last night, I am still a fan! There were apparently some changes to a few dishes since my last visit (i.e. the peach salad no longer was dressed with caramelized peaches and the fresh ones which were plated last night were almost too tart). However, aside from the peach salad deviation, everything was again wonderful - service, fare and price. No complaint whatsoever - but, I will admit that the ravioli and pasta with veal ragu are some of the best I've ever had. And once again, the patio was perfect.
