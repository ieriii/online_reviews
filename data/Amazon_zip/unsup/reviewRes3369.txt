Justin B and I stopped in tonight. We have a tendency to do these mini "taste of Broadway" evenings where we grab a few things from various restaurants. I'm embarrassed to admit that this was our first foray into Crisp. We were looking for chicken, so went with an order of 10 of the Crisp wings (Korean BBQ sauce) for about $12 after tax. Um, holy crap. These things are ridiculous. We ended up only eating two each b/c they're HUGE. I think we've been ruined by bar fare chicken wings, b/c these are actual wings - drummy + wing = Crisp chicken wing. The sauce is sticky, sweet and HOT, a fantastic combination. I licked my fingers after the first one but couldn't manage the same after the second, my mouth was too on fire, albeit it pleasantly on fire. We will be back ... and back ... and back again. I'm thinking these will be the hit of our Super Bowl party ...
