This is the spot to get Chicago deep-dish. It is the best. There is no comparison to Giordano's and Lou Malnotti's is not my favorite either. Gino's is the spot. I had it twice in a four day trip. Just go with pepperoni, eat the crap out of it, and smile knowing that you've just done your taste buds a huge favor.
