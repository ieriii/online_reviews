I was excited by the prospect of Southern comfort food, but ended up being profoundly disappointed. The food presentation was sloppy and the food itself was not anything to write home about. The kicker came at the end when they charged extra for a disgusting dipping sauce that I never asked for. Restaurants that do things like this have no character, and hopefully their clientele will take note.
