I think this is a great little breakfast place. They seem like they are ALWAYS packed around brunch time though so if you're planning to brunch with a large group, it may be a little while. When I went there were only two of us and we were seated within five minutes and we got there just before noon. The chocolate chip pancakes are bomb! They have this one menu choice that is one pancake, one piece of toast and two eggs, the perfect amount of food! Why do we always feel the need to stuff ourselves silly? We're a fat country as it is so it never hurts to cut down on the portions. And this really was the perfect amount, I even had some left over. Oh and I was able to add chocolate chips to my one pancake selection! SO amazing. The service was fast and friendly which isn't surprising seeing as they had like twenty people waiting to be seated. Nevertheless, I didn't feel rushed out the door which was nice. They're not too expensive and they had a great variety of brunch cocktails. Definitely give this place a whirl and get the chocolate chip pancakes!
