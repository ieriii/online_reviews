The only reason I'm subtracting a star is because of the often VERY long wait at Wishbone for brunch. Luckily my friends and I got there at the "sweet spot" time of 10:30 on Sunday morning following St. Patty's day drinking. We didn't have to wait at all and got a nice table by the window. Every time I've gone to Wishbone, the service has been great. You can order coffee if you're forced to wait at the front of the restaurant. There are also great smoothies and tea options for non-coffee drinkers. I've ordered many different things from the menu but on Sunday I went for the crunchy French Toast. It was outstanding! They roll the French Toast in corn flakes before cooking it. So the pieces are nice and crispy and I even thought they were a little sweeter! The fact that this place is always packed is a testament to how good it is. The staff are very accomodating and do a good job of keeping everything running to ensure that table turnover happens quickly. But they don't pressure you to get out too fast. It's just a great joint. Maybe I should try it for dinner sometime!
