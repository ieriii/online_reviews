I was there for dinner this evening. Overall I'm pretty happy with the quality of the pizza here. I will give them credit for speeding up the ordering process. If there is a wait outside they order your pizza right away for you and get it started cooking (the deep dish pizzas take 45 minutes). Upon sitting down at your table you might only be there 10 minutes and your hot fresh pizza is delivered to the table. Here is the big problem that I have that many might not notice. I went there with my girl friend and we ordered a large deep dish pizza. Half sausage / half pepperoni then garlic on the entire pizza. The big surprise to me was that they actually used CANNED garlic on the pizza. By canned garlic I mean it was not a fresh garlic clove that was then chopped up...nooooooooo...they have us garlic that you buy at the store (like garlic in water). We are in one of the worlds premiere locations for pizza and you are going to actually not use fresh garlic?!?!?! To me this is just completely uncalled for and makes me wonder what other non fresh ingredients they are using.I can't decide if I like the pitchers of water on the table. Is that to make things easier for us or is it just due to a lazy service staff?? The table next to us was 4 people and the pitcher of water on their table didn't even fill all 4 glasses. They then waited for ever to get someone to actually fill it up. Luckily it was only the two of us and we didn't have to deal with the same problem.Overall high quality pizza...just to me (a person the eats out all the time) I was expecting better quality in terms of the ingredients. I could have given this a better rating but I personally think this is a big deal.
