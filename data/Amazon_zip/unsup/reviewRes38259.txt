yup- I know EVERYONE goes and EVERYONE thinks they know beer cause they have drinken here. It's a broad beer menu, but not deep. It's a good place to start drinking really good beer, but after you are at it awhile, you have had nearly everything on the menu. The best time to go is EARLY ( 5 pm or earilier) not on a weekend. You will have the place to yourself for a while that way, and it will be quiet enough to actually talk. and the friendly knowledgable bar staff will treat you nice.
