I read in many reviews that this place has the best deep dish pizza. Hm....I'm not from Chicago so maybe I don't know what GOOD deep dish pizza is, but my guess is that this isn't it. I was pretty disappointed with the pizza. Slices were cheap, and we all ordered pizza by the slice bc we didn't want to wait long for a pizza to come out. Maybe the pizza had been sitting for a while but it was lukewarm and definitely average. It wasn't gross or anything but I had been expecting something really good. I had Lou Maltnati's on a trip prior and the pizza there blew this one away.  I still can't believe people think this is the best ....
