I've been to Carnivale several times since it opened many years ago, and always have a great time. I think that the ambiance and decor are phenomenal - there's nowhere else in the city that has such over the top and grand decor that just bursts with color and wows you when you walk into the dining room. The mixed drinks are yummy and almost make you forget that you would ever want a bottle of wine - and why would you when you can have a prickly pear mojito? I've always had good food and tend to order meat her over the fish just because. Desserts aren't quite as good as the rest of the meal, so don't worry too much about saving room. This is one of my favorite spots for groups - yes, it can get a little loud on the weekends but on the other hand you don't have to worry about your group being "too loud" either.
