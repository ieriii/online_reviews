We had a party of 9 and truly enjoyed ourselves and the experience that is eating Ethiopian - a first for all of us. We did family style platters, meat, fish and veggie, asking for an emphasis on vegetarian for two that were in the group. We also did the sambusas for appetizers, all of them and the dipping sauce were amazing! Because the food had such great flavors and there was plenty of it, I want to give 4 stars.  However, I think the experience was good 1) because of the compnay 2) because it was new to us and 3) the variety in the platters allowed us to try a ton of different flavors.  I don't know that it was the restaurant or atmosphere itself that made it so memormable, as other areas lacked, and are what made me give 3 stars. The service was slow and the waitresses need to smile more! Also, their corkage fee was high - almost to the point that they should just not even say that you can BYOB, especially when they do have their own drinks anyway. $8 per bottle of wine, and $2 per bottle of beer. Which tacked on $32 to the bill. Ouch. Not really worth it, unless you are a wine/beer snob and have to have your particular brand :) All in all, I think we will give them another try - or at least Ethiopian food another try, if there is another place to go. It was a fun, delicious adventure. Next time though, we'll keep the party size down and not bring our own.
