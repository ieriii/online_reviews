I was really looking forward to experiencing this restaurant. With an early reservation, we sat at a comfortable table in the window and enjoyed watching the foot traffic on Rush. The service was pleasant and let us linger. We tried two appetizers: a veggie roll and a tuna dish. I could have just dined on the tuna appetizer, served with crispy fried chips. The sauce for the rice paper roll was flavorful, but the roll was bland. I had a shrimp dish served with asparagus and scallion. It was just ok, really no better than any decent asian restaurant. My mango bellini was yummy and the creme brulee nicely crisped on top to give it that smoky marshmallow flavor. Maybe this place is more about the atmosphere than truly outstanding food. If I am going to spend $120 for two at an asian restaurant, I want to be wowed by the food.
