We don't have these restaurants near my hometown so having just moved to the area we wanted to try it asap as we had heard bout how good it is. My first trip to Grand Lux was very satisfying! From the ambience, to the service, to the food, to the dessert... EVERYTHING was wonderful here! Even the little bad of chocolate chip cookies I grabbed to-go on the way out were delicious! This place just makes you feel satisfied in every way! Can't wait to go back!
