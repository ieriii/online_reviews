Pizza was good. Thin crust, cheese kinda slid around, a little week on toppings, but it was still pretty food. As Ben B. put, "I wasn't in love." The beer was very good. Had a Worryin' Ale and a Flat Top Stout, and tried a little of my friend's Full Frontal Ale. Worryin' Ale taste like a typical English bitter, the Stout was very tasty as you can taste chocolate afternotes -- I thoroughly enjoyed both beverages. Today, service was good, but we went at 6:00 with almost no one there. All in all, decent pizza, very good beers, just don't go here on a Friday or Saturday.
