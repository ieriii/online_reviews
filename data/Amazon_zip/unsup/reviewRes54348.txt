This is definitely one of the better deep dish pizzas I've had in Chicago. The crust is like no other spot you can find in the city. My favorite here is the sausage by far. I'm not a big fan of some places that put an entire patty on the pizza as a sausage topping, I prefer the pieces scattered all over the top. Great spot and cool atmosphere in a very laid back setting. The service was good too!
