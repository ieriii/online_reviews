Perfection on a plate!I love this restaurant, my boyfriend and I are always searching for new breakfast spots Meli Caf does not disappoint, even though it may be crowded the wait is usually not long. The service is excellent the food is delicious. I've tried the stuffed strawberry & apple French toast they seem like a sugar high but believe me it's just the right amount of sweet, the Mana Mou skillet is so good, and the pancakes are light & fluffy. This place quickly became my go to spot for breakfast, next time I go I'm trying something new so far everything was been scrumptious.
