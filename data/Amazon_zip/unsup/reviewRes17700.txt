Damn you, you pretentious Lincoln Park trixies! Stay out of my 'hood and my favorite spot in MY neighborhood. You have your watered down safe spots - now go back there. The worst part is seeing all of those "Deer in the headlight looks" LP'rs give the neighborhood once they reach it. Yeah, Wicker Park is cool - you are not, face it and leave. Anyways the drinks here are by far the best. They are experts at their craft. The mixologists take time to perfect each hand-crafted drink, constantly measuring and tasting. If you ever have a chance to sit at the bar, do-so. It's wonderful to watch them create. Besides the emergence of the Lincoln Park (plastic) crowd, it's the best place in the city. Once the Lincoln Park-ites leave, it'll be 5 stars again.
