I've tried quite a bit of Ethiopian food, both in Chicago and other cities, but Demera takes the cake.. or umm, the injera! One, the people here are really great. We had quite a large table, half with no experience in this cuisine. They patiently explained stuff and helped us figure out our best options. Two, the food is excellent. Spicy yet flavorful, and so many vegetarian options! What a refreshing change from the times I've had to pick two from the three veggie options in a three page menu.. The lentils and the beets were the highlights of my plate. The bread is sour if you try it by itself, but with the sides, it is like a flavor explosion in your mouth.. Parking is not very tough around here and it is also close to public transport. Give this place a try, you won't be disappointed. Demera now ranks number 1 on my Ethiopian spots.
