I liked it. It was an enjoyable lunch, I didn't order anything extrodinary, but that's my fault. The service was very friendly and the prices were fair.  My friend ordered a milkshake and she said it was the best milkshake she has ever had . . . so I don't think you could go wrong by trying it out for yourself.
