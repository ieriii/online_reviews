451 degrees Fahrenheit is the point at which paper ignites... huh... I'm trying to decide how this best fits into Zed's setting. I mean, there is a lot of wood in the facade, and I can only imagine what would happen to the 20-foot wood-paneled atrium out front if a disgruntled patron smashed a glass of Blue Label against the wall and dropped a match. You may be wondering how such a beautifully dressed space like Zed451 could bring thoughts of pyromania... let's count the ways. 1. It should not take 45 minutes to get a round of drinks, no matter how busy you are.... what's that? Your drinks are "hand-muddled"... well then I suggest keeping extra prepped ingredients on hand, or at least have another person helping the bartenders... and come on... two bartenders on the roof deck... are you kidding me!? 2. Are they trying to play up their name... I mean, the main dining room is only a few degrees from bursting into flames.  3. The food is mediocre at best, and the service strives for that -- at best! And you're charging me $55 a person... I'll spend an extra 10 per head and get the fabulous tasting menu at Takashi. 4. Upon speaking with the manager about the above mentioned issues, he said that he would "take them under consideration." Thanks for nothin', buddy! Save your time, your money, and your sanity.
