I walked in a [crab leg] virgin...and left a man. Boy, oh boy! I now know what I've been missing. For almost three-quarters of my life I was allergic to shellfish. Then, by the miracle of [insert idealogical figure], my allergies vanished!! My girlfriend and I took my mum here for a late Mother's Day dinner on, you guessed it, the all you can eat Alaskan King Crab night. I heard that Glenn's gets PACKED with reservations, and we didn't have one...BUT, they save the outdoor patio for walk-ins, and we lucked out! Didn't wait more than ten minutes. The wait staff greeted us, sat us, and informed us of the blackboard specials. Everything sounded delish, but we came on a mission: crab legs. My mom's a seasoned pro, but the gf and I are the rookie of rookies, so the wonderful staff gave us a quick tutorial on different techniques to approach these monstrous beasts. The one that worked? Napkin in each hand, crack the legs at the joints, use the knifing tool against the inside of the leg, and shake the meat out. You're started out with three legs, then they bring out one/two as you finish up, then they keep asking until you say "uncle." The legs are served with some delicious cole slaw and corn on the freaking cobb...smothered in butter and topped with parmesan cheese. Oh my goodness. This was quite a meal. The crab legs are priced at market value, so the cost may change week to week. I'm interested in the other weekly special [AYCE shrimp] and some of the other blackboard specials, so I'll definitely be back. But I will say that I'm quite upset that they no longer have the AYCE bbq ribs [insert big ol' sad face].
