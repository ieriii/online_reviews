I don't think you could possibly get a better food than this for these prices. Sultan's Market is fast, delicious and veggie-friendly at great prices. I don't really know what more you could want from a Middle Eastern restaurant. I came here twice in the week I was in Chicago, and I'd probably come here all the time if I lived in the city.  The felafel sandwich was delicious, filling, and slathered with hummus. The spinach pie was buttery, fresh and fantastic, and big enough that I could have eaten just that and it would have tided me over for a couple of hours. The chicken in the chicken shawarma was moist and the sandwich was excellent, though the sauce on it was a little too liquidy and made it break through the pita by the time I was finished. Definitely would want to stick to the felafel if I was going to eat this on the go. Also, the chicken alone was a bit spicy, so if you don't like things to be really spicy, stick with mild.  The prices here are excellent! On our first trip here, my girlfriend and I got 2 spinach pies, a felafel sandwich and a chicken shawarma sandwich and spent just over $12! I loved Sultan's Market. Loved it enough that since coming back to Boston, I've been keeping an eye for felafel good enough to compare. For the price, I don't think it exists.
