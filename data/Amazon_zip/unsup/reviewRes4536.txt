A few impressions on my first visit to the Green Mill.  1. It's larger than life reputation led me to believe that this place would be huge... it's not. There are less than a dozen or so booths and a few tables and then some bar stools. It would be hard for this place not to be packed. The intimate size creates nice sound quality and a legitimate need for patrons to be quiet. 2. The old school booths, wall decor, and stage really boost the places charm. Nothing fussy about the place, you can come in a t-shirt and dirty jeans, or get dressed up and nobody will notice.  3. The bathrooms, which you enter as if you were on stage, have the same white bar soap and pedestal sink that my grandparents used to have. Very nice.
