I have been to Fox and Obel numerous times because it is located 1 block away from my home, but whenever I go, I ALWAYS leave disappointed. The majority of my visits are to get a quick bite at the cafe, which ends up being far from "quick" as the staff is extremely slow to serve the food. My order is screwed up about 80% of the time as well, and as everyone already knows, the prices are outrageous, especially for the service and quality that you get. If that doesn't already dissuade you from eating at the cafe, one time I found a large green bug in my salad that blended right in except for its movements (yes, it was still alive). I've been content with the grocery store part of Fox and Obel (except for the prices of course) and the service in the grocery store has been great as well. However, STAY AWAY from the cafe.....it is horrendous.
