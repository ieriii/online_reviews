it was ok. very crowded on a saturday night. byob. nothing spectacular. only two bathrooms in the whole place--which is kind of hell considering the fact that it's huge..not badly priced. softshell crab was very greasy--i'd definitely pass on that. fresh fish. perhaps a better option for carry out.
