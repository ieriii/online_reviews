Okay...took my mother-in-law here with my husband and parents for her birthday a few Saturdays ago. Our waiter was really bad. He was not attentive, seemed more concerned with the tables around us than with us. We had to flag him down to ask for water, to take our order, and when they finally brought the candle with the cake out for my mother-in-law it was several minutes after we had already received our desserts. Unacceptable. It should have come out well before everyone's desserts.  And the cake: I made the reservation through open table with a request for a cake or something for her birthday. I then called AGAIN to confirm that they had the received the note about the cake. But I still had to remind the waiter... The food here is really great and the wine and drink list is vast, but I would like to see better service for the buck here. And I HATE it when they make you wait for the rest of your party. My parents were in traffic and were late and we had to stand at the bar for 20 minutes because they wouldn't seat us. Come on people! We would have happily ordered appetizers...heck, it took the waiter that long to remember to tell us the specials after we eventually sat down!
