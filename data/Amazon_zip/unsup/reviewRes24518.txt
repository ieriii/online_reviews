Overpriced, expensive, and dated - complete with plastic coated menus.  Needs a refresh.  Loved the cheese fondu, but this was really the best part.  The hot-oil meat fondu was frustrating as it was impossible to keep the oil hot enough to properly cook the meats and veggies.  I would have been happier if I could have just ordered a large cheese fondu with cured and cooked meats. There's no reason at all to have the oil fondu at all.  We left smelling of stale oil. For the price, we could have had a much better time elsewhere.
