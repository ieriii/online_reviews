I love Calo's. Dining in, picking up or delivered...it's great. Recently, I ordered from there a pizza an entree. I called, the driver was very lost despite me ordering from Calo's for delivery for years and came about 90 minutes later. When he came, the food was so cold. Now who wants to spend $50 bucks on cold food. So I sent him on his way with the food and decided that me and my friends were going to have to buck up and eat frozen pizza since we were starving. I called Calo's, explained that the cold food was unacceptable and that I sent the driver back. The order taker apologized and said a warm order was on it's way and on the house for my long wait. Now that is service!!!! Thumbs up Calo's. It's understood that mistakes happen when ordering food for delivery but you are definitely a restrauant that corrects mistakes.
