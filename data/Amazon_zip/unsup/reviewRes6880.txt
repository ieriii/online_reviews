I was pretty happy to find this small Italian restaurant. I am rather picky about my pasta and how it is cook and the first time I was here i was not disappointed. Food: The sauce was really well prepared. First time here I had the lobster raviolis, which were really well done. second time around I had this seafood pasta dish. The flavors were definitely there, but my pasta was way too over done. I believe this was due to the fact that it sat in the soupy base. But I wasn't too upset over it Environment: First time I was outside, although it was a bit warmer that day, i did enjoy it, 2nd time around, we were upstairs, which was alot warmer feeling environment. I actually really enjoyed it especially that day. Overall: The food here is good, the sauce is well made, the prices are decent, the service is good. This is definitely a place i would come back to. See you soon Sapori!
