Walked in to a pleasant greeting from the staff, as I paroozed the abundant menu of fine sammies and burgers my face lit up, the chef offered me some homemade chips as I made my choice, the Border Patrol Burger was excellent, great grilled flovor, nicely seasoned, big bold flavor, HEAVENLY!!! and 80's metal in the background. I have found a second home.
