I have been going to that place for 6 years now! In my opinion,the best korean bbq in town! We go there with family and friends from Chicago,as well as with extended family from abroad. It is one of the must try's of Chicago. I admit, they can get quite busy and then the service suffers a bit but usually they are able to accomodate your needs of extra sauce or napkin etc. 5 stars all the way!
