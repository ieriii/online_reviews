Very cool place - my friend told me that I had to visit when I went to Chicago. I went and I'm glad I did. The artist that was playing the night we went was some strange Russian lady who didn't speak any English; and her performance was mediocre. But I'm not judging the place on a random act I saw there. Instead, it's the entire establishment; one that alone holds historical reverence based purely on the decor alone. You feel like you just walked into an old speakeasy during prohibition - and actually, it was one of the places Al Capone would visit (and sit with his back to the wall). Not much else that I found nearby (as it was a hike up the Redline to Uptown), but worth it just to visit the place.
