It was hard for me not to contact the authors of some of the one star reviews directly. When HUNDREDS of people have reviewed that something is good, and one or two randoms say it's bad...well, odds are those individuals are insane.  I mean, yeah they don't give "5 star service" here because it's a COUNTER JOINT that charges $3 for a sandwich! They are nice enough in the sense that they don't throw it at your face or verbally abuse you, so for the prices and food quality, it's totally adequate. They could best be described as very busy and slightly indifferent. Get over it! Also, to the person who commented on the prices in comparison to what they would charge for it in the Middle East: are you kidding me? How can you compare labor and supply cost to that of the Middle East. Why don't you try comparing it to what is actually around it and is actually an accessible alternative in the immediate future? What do I care what you paid for it on the other side of the planet earth? All I need to know is that I don't think it's worth a trip there to save $2 on a sandwich and that if I went up the street, I'd be paying more for any other sandwich.  Sultan's is good. Period.
