Wow. I got delivery from this place and paid $121 for 2 steaks and a meal.... for two people delivery on a Friday night. And you know what? No complaints. Can't wait to go back. The food was that damn good! What kind of place will you pay $121 for delivery for and *not* bitch about something? Paying that much just makes you feel like your entitled to complain about *something*... not here. You won't find a better steak in the city, and the potato was pretty damn good too!
