Good food. I had the Pasta Fagioli which was fine, but not too well seasoned. The entree again was good and inventive. A Gorgonzola stuffed Gnocchi, but too me that is more like a Ravioli. It just wasn't my preference to have Gorgonzola in every bite, I would have like to have a little more Gnocchi in my Gnocchi. One excellent thing was my server. I was dining alone and Juan seemed fine to let me go as slow as I wanted. He didn't rush me just to turn the table. On a side note - interesting choice of music to play. for a classic Italian restaurant, I did not expect to be hearing American pop through the meal.
