We had dinner here, last night. Everything was outstanding. The moment you enter this restaurant, you know you are somewhere wonderful! The staff greeting is in the most friendly fashion. Everything is beautifully arranged and well planned. The food is of exceptional quality. The service is caring. We think this is the finest addition to Chicago dining, and look forward to many more terrific meals here.
