The best patio in Chicago - huge, totally enclosed and wonderfully appointed. Even if the food was terrible, this place would still be on my summer rotation. But the food is very good generally. Wine prices are reasonable. The grilled calamari is a stingy portion. Sogno is like a trip to the Tuscany, but it only takes 20 minutes to get there.
