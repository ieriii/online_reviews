A friend recommended Sunda to my girlfriend and me a few weeks ago, and, given that we hadn't had a fancy dinner in a while, we decided to go.My first impression of the place was that both the dining room and bar were very well done. It is certainly a modern, stylish place, but not to the extent that it feels cold or unromantic at all. Additionally, the service staff at the front of the restaurant was incredibly welcoming.Unable to pick just a few items from the menu, we wound up getting cocktails, three appetizers, two main courses, and a dessert between the two of us. The cocktails were solid, but the food was delicious. In particular, the duck/daikon/egg salad appetizer was incredible. It had very strong Asian flavors, but it was not overdone at all. The duck (and there was an incredible amount of it for the price) was ridiculously soft, and the daikon was prepared to perfection. The chef's signature sushi (I forget what exactly he calls it) was the perfect mixture of textures and temperatures. The only small dish I would not wholeheartedly recommend were the oxtail pot stickers, which seemed slightly underflavored. Perhaps if I hadn't had the incredibly rich duck first, however, this wouldn't have been an issue.Among the main courses, the sea bass was truly sublime. My West Coast friends always complain that it's hard to get good fish in Chicago, but Sunda has certainly proven them wrong. The beef ribs were good too, though, for the price, not exactly anything to write home about. For dessert, we got the "Ridiculous," which is essentially tempura-ed ice cream. It was definitely tasty, though perhaps more of a novelty than anything else.All in all, it was a great experience. In addition to the great atmosphere and food, we had an incredibly helpful waitress who put up with our flip flopping ordering tendencies way more than she should have had to. I would definitely recommend Sunda for a date or for a classy night out with a group of friends.
