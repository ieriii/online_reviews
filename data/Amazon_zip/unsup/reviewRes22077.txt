I know everyone says this, but there is a reason why...........OH MY GOD, that oatmeal shake. It is amazing! I had driven by once and thought Irazu looked interesting and had never had Costa Rican food before, so naturally it went onto the "places I am going to try one day" list. My friend wanted to go to lunch and I gave him 6 options. This is the place he picked (thank you, Brandall). We sat in the area that is semi porch-like, not quite indoors or outdoors, but screened in. I have to say that I felt like I was on vacation the entire time I was sitting there. I did not want to leave and had to practically be pulled off of that chair. We split the Costa Rican sandwich and steak burrito and they both had a special sauce (I am not sure if it was unique to Irazu or Costa Rican cuisine in general), but it was delicious. Just like Jenny T., we ordered the hot peppers on the side and did not end up even touching them. The service was great. Our waiter was very friendly and we were able to sit for as long as we wanted. I am convinced this is the cure for anyone with seasonal affective disorder. Cheap vacation. I cannot say enough good things about this place. **BYOB
