OMG. This place is pretty dang (my G-Rated version of what I really want to say) UNBELIEVABLE.  We showed up around 11:30 on a Sunday and were told we were going to have about a 2 hour wait. Yup- we did. Luckily they have a nice little bar that serves, not only strong delicious coffee, but strong delicious adult beverages. I decided to order the rasberry & pear mimosa. AMAZING. i seriously could bathe in these things. Finally when we sat down, I had the hardest time choosing what to order. I went with the SPINACH, ROASTED RED PEPPER AND FETA BENEDICT and i couldn;t have been happier with my choice. So fresh and the flavors were spot on. I also tried my friend's RED VELVET PANCAKES and they are definitely representative of the Hype. I wish I could have eaten more but that just means I will have to go back. 5 stars for the food (0 stars for the wait but it's worth it). i suggest you put your name in and visit the fun little antique shops around the area. Can't wait to go back!
