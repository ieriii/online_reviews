How could you not love the basmati rice with saffron... I think they are true culinary gurus over here. Persian food is so delicious, and you just keep returning to try different dishes. My favorite dish is the lamb shank... make sure to get the baba ganoush as an appetizer to open up those taste buds. And not to forget the Doogh (no, it's not proncounced dog)! It's kind of a watery yoghurt mixed with salt. It goes well with the rice and meat. Gonna try the Khorest Gheime next time.. a curry with yellow lentils and tomatoes. The service is always friendly and they have the right decor to set the low key ambience.
