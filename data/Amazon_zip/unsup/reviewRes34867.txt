Best delivery sushi near downtown, hands down.  I've ordered from here at least 2 dozen times and the sushi is always fresh and delivered on time.  Godzilla role is pretty much the anti-christ of sushi, but it is really really really good.  I haven't dined in the restaurant, but I am always entertained by the anime that they play on the wall projector while I am waiting for my pick up order. Probably not the best place for a relaxing sit down though. All in all, they have proven themselves time and time again and I will remain a regular well into the future.
