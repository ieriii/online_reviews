Wilde's has three things going for it; A. Decor- the decor is on point giving it an old Irish spot feel B. Service- waiter was really nice and food was out fast, but also busmen were just as fast to take it away. Not as cool. C. Magic Hat- oh yeah #9 is flowing like wine Wilde's has three things not going for it; A. Bar food- I was expecting food with a little more sophistication given the ambiance and price of the establishment. I asked for no mayo, cheese or condiment of any sorts. So he put the molasses sauce on the side, which was very considerate, but still had Thousand Island dressing on it? B. is for Bass, hard to make a Black and Tan when you don't have any Bass on the tap. C. Price- 12 clams for an oily, corned beef sandwich and fries, cole slaw needs some serious flavor and maybe more than a thimble size portion. Definitely a place I would take the duke when she is town for a bite, with a #9 on the side and might even be a cool nightlife spot even though the location is a bit Boysishtownie.
