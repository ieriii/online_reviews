When you first opened and a couple years the follow the place was the best thing to happen to the lakeview neighborhood. Recently in the past year however I don't ever consider going, a menu change that took my pork chop off it and suddenly everything tasted like butter. I'm not sure if there was a chef change but something happen and the place is not the same. Its too bad.
