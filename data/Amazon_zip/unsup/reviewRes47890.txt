You come here for the rooftop experience... point blank! Don't be expecting the best service or appetizer selection or drink prices... but what you do get is to enjoy the summer on their wonderful wooded patio. The blackberry mojito was a hit with my friends. We also ordered the fondue platter which was a good deal for $15. The only problem was that is was a bit windy and the tealight for the cheese kept blowing out. The steak and the sausage were mighty tasty on their own and the marinated veggies were great in the cheese. People watching was great up here and a good way to take in a beautiful night!
