They do take out now and their caldos(hot soups) are excellent. I had the seafood soup. All the shrimp, fish, fresh cilantro, onions and potatos are simmered when you order. They also box up the ingredients separately from the broth so I nothing gets over cooked while in transit. How great is that!
