So my friends told me about Crisp. How the fried chicken is sooo good- so I was imagining a fancy KFC or Popeyes. Was I wrong.  I'm Asian. I like Asian inspired foods and I like unique flavors. And oh my goodness. The Crisp fried chicken is for reals! For some background....I LOVE Great Seas for their chicken wings (if you know what I am talking about...my review might have more sway with you) - and I LOVED Crisp! I had high expectations going in - and I was thoroughly satisfied! Yea...it's crazy in there...but to me...that's a good thing. =) They offer take out too. My fiance and I split their dinner special - a whole chicken w/two sides. We got the rice and korean vegetables.  Don't expect a super clean/romantic place. But do expect good fried chicken! I also met the owner...such a nice guy and you could tell....he was genuinely happy that people like his place-
