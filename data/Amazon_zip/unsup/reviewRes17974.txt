sorry violet hour. we were craving your drinks and yummy bites. however, despite the wonderful drinks and lovely atmosphere, i am so disappointed by horrible door service. we arrived at violet hour around 8:00, had our names and phone number taken down, and were told that we would receive a phone call in an hour or more for our "reservation". we went to eat tapas at "people" and we were there for a little more than and hour. we decided to head to violet hour and figured that we would probably not have to wait that much longer. mind you, my friend had her phone out the whole time and watched that thing like a hawk so that we would not miss their call. we waited in the small cramped hallway of violet hour with no phonecall no service. after about 30ish minutes of waiting in this small corridor, my friend asked the doorman how much longer it would be for people who put their names down. she came back and said that he would take care of us. 20 more minutes passed and nothing. groups of people were able to walk in before us and we were so confused. i finally went to ask the doorman when we would be seated and that we had reservations, he showed me the list with our names crossed out and said he had called, and told me to get back in line. at that point i said fuck it, and we left. he never called us, she was holding her phone the whole entire time, and then he tells us to get back in line and wait after about 2 hrs of total waiting time! im so disappointed. sadly i wont be returning any time soon and i wont be recommending anyone to come here after what we experienced. i cant believe we wasted so much time waiting, and to be treated like a 'nobody'.
