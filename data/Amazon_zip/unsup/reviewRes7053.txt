Ok so after reading a bunch of reviews here I couldn't wait to try this place out. 1. After being a little late for our reservation we were greeted with a snotty attitude and stuffed to a secluded seat upstairs 2. The stuff about meat falling off the bone? I'm not sure we ate at the same restaurant. 3. Brisket was dry The only good was: 1. Our server--she was nice 2. Pickle appetizer--This was nice.
