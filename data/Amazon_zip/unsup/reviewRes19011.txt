Nice space and great beer selection. Service was friendly. Limited menu heavy on the burgers. Black and blue burger was good, but the accompanying french fries, though "fresh cut," were a soggy unattractive clump of greasy starch on the plate. Tried the poutine, which I have not seen elsewhere Chicago, and it was pretty good. This has the potential of being a sort of Hop Leap South, but they really need to figure out the french fry thing.
