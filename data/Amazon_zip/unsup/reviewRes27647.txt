Pequods pan is awesome. I go with just cheese and it has more than enough flavors. The caramelized crust or cheese or whatever it is, is nothing short of amazing. The sauce is on the sweeter side, which works well for this particular pizza. I have ordered delivery and eaten at the restaurant and both were terrific. When you order delivery they cover it the pizza with foil and then put it in the box, keeps everything fresher, a nice touch by Pequods. FYI, I wouldn't quite classify the pan pizza as typical Chicago style deep dish, but it is just as good. They also have a great beer selection if you eat there.
