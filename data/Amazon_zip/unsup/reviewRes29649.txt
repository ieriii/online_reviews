i tried the farfalle pollo on the suggestion of other yelpers. it was good. very creamy. they use a lot of butter and a lot of cream. that's okay though. my friend ordered the gnocchi aurora. it had WAYYYYYYYYYYY too much cheese on it. it looked pretty good after he peeled the cheese off the top. so be warned: if you order the aurora, ask for no cheese or just a little cheese.  order the farfalle pollo; it's $7.95 and the portions are large. you could probably eat half of it and save the other half for later. (i'm on a road trip! gotta be frugal)
