My measure for restaurants is always first rooted in the food, quality/execution versus price. If food falls right in the middle I'm happy, if the food is fan-freaking-tastic and I don't have to pay (Grandma) then 10 stars, if you're the Gage then 3.  Everything about this restaurant is just slightly overpriced, starting with the cocktails and beer. I guess that's the Michigan Avenue syndrome. We had oysters, the crisp potato salad (this portion was GIGANTOR, I should mention that) and the pork chops. All good food, nothing that inspired.  I think the Gage is a good restaurant in a locale where there are very few. I also think if I went back (which I plan to do) I'll just stick to experimenting with the great beer list and having a burger (which looked ABSOLUTELY worth its $16 price).
