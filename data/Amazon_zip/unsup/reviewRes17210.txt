I order the tandori special got the chicken soup. They also gave Nan with the dipping sauce which was yummy The waiter didn't have to much personality I needed help in ordering since my first time having Indian food. If it was not for the yelp reviews I would not have known how to order. When the food came to the table.. IT WAS HUGE.. so much food.. it was very tasty, I could not even finish the food.. But I did save room to order the mango ice cream, it was really good. I can say the resturant is very good, I could not give it 5 stars because of the lack luster waiter , who just didn't have any skill in waiting on customers..
