A beautiful summer Sunday, an early morning and the hope for an afternoon nap, a desire to stay outside instead of going home, and a boyfriend with a plan lead me here.  My boyfriend suggested we go to a Costa Rican place he liked and this was the plan as we rode east on Armitage, but instead we landed at 90 Miles. It was closer to our destination, and a place neither of us had been. It was a gorgeous day, so we chose the patio. The food was phenomenal, the service, too. Every one on the wait staff seemed to share the work. One took our order, another brought our food, and about 2 others asked us how we were enjoying it. "Fantastic!" we'd exclaim. The proprietor was greeting us, too. Everyone had smiles, the good food spread the good mood.  Yuca Fritas started it off - garlicky and buttery! I enjoyed the tailapia sandwich and he had the Ropa Vieja dinner which came with the best black beans we've ever tasted. I've decided that naps are overrated, and we've pledged to go back every Sunday this summer to enjoy the patio and try all the food on the menu. I can't wait for next week.
