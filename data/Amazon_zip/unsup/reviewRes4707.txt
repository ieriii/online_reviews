Yes, a late night spot with great food! Salt-Roasted Beets with Whipped Goat Cheese & Pistachio Vinaigrette- this was very good, I never caught on the beets and goat cheese, but they go very well together. Calamari with Fregola, Radishes, Cucumbers & Pistachios- nice cool salad type dish, very tasty and everything went well together. Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg- I was imagining more to this dish, ended up tasting like fried flour.. not much crunch you would get from pig ears like i hoped. Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs- You can't go wrong with this if you already love bone marrow, I've seen a few reviews stating how the bread was too buttery or how fatty it was... it's bone marrow, the fattier the taste, the better the smear! Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes- the meat was cooked nicely and the mashed was pretty good, overall it was an okay dish, wasn't my favorite.. maybe I was full from everything else! Pork Sweetbreads with Fennel & Apricots- Fried sweetbread.. need i say more? So good. Service was good at 1AM, food came out great, I wish I had more room to order everything else on the menu... I will definitely be back when I'm back visiting..
