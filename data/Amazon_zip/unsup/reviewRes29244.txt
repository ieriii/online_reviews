Came across this place after deciding not to stand waiting forever for more casual fare at next door's XOCO. It was a very cold winter morning and we had been walking for several miles, so two empty chairs at the bar was a very welcome sight! I had the seasonal mojito (made with apple cider) - YUM! We ordered the seviche nachos (can't remember the name of it) and they were A-MA-ZING! Our main course was less noteworthy, but still decent. All in all, I'll definitely be back - is it worth a 1 hour wait, not quite sure about that answer yet.
