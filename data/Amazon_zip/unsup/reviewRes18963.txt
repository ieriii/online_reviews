The veggie burger with goat cheese is amazing! I love the chill atmosphere - even on a Saturday night at 9:30, the wait was about 30min for a table. The servers are great and friendly, and the beer is incredible and reasonably priced (a welcome change in Chicago). Fries could definitely use some improvement.
