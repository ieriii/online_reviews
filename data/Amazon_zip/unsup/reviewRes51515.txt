If you want a delicoius burrito and a great margherita, then this is your place! For being quite inexpensive, Garcia's makes great food. The burritos are literally the size of a human head, and every single time I've ordered one, it has tasted awesome. The taco salad is also really good. They make really really great margheritas (that are also realllly strong!). The chips that they make themselves are also really good, and they will refill them multiple times so it's hard to not fill up on those! So if you need a cheap but yummy dinner and are in the mood for Mexican, I defintiely recommend Garcia's!
