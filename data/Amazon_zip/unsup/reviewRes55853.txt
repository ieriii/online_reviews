We've lived in Andersonville for 5 years and have taken all of our out of town guests here for Chicago deep dish. Tonight they messed up our pizza order - forgot the pepperoni (the manager claims there was pep, yeah, no way - 3 adults agreed there was no pep and even the waitress saw no pep). We had two small children with us and instead taking the waitress up on a remake we decided to eat it and avoid impending child chaos of waiting another 20 minutes for a fresh dish. Then the bill came - $1 off of an incorrect order on a $80+ tab (2 pizzas, kids meals, 3 drinks). When we asked if they could make it right (maybe discount us the $3.25 per topping after 1 topping rather than the $1 for the first topping? Comp one of the drinks or a kids meal?) the manager was extremely unhelpful. We'll be taking our family and Chicago guests somewhere else for deep dish. So sad. I really liked that place, but it only takes one bad experience to turn away loyal customers. I know I'm being picky but we ordered all of our pizza from them and dined in regularly. It wasn't about the $, poor customer service by the management is inexcusable.
