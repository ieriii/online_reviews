This review is for the bakery items. An acquaintance brought in the most mouth-watering array of bakery items from this shop that I felt I just had to comment on it. From chocolate to flaky pastries, everything I tasted was just divine. The ginger bread muffins and coconut macaroons are also incredible. This will be a great place to pick up impressive bakery items of all kinds! I can't wait to visit the restaurant!
