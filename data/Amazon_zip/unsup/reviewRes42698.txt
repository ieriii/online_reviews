I stopped in Fogo today for a couple quick slices and was very pleased. I tried the BBQ chicken pizza and liked the sweet BBQ sauce that was drizzled on top, and the chicken they use is excellent. They specialize in Brazilian style grilled chicken which is most likely what they use on their pizzas. I was warned that the Buffalo chicken pizza was really spicy but I thought it had an average heat level (think Tabasco, Franks, Crystals, ect...) It was really tasty though and had really unique ingredients that you would not expect in pizza like small bits of celery, carrots, and even some blue cheese! Of course it still had mozzarella cheese on top but it was nice to try something different! Service was quick and friendly, and I look forward to going back to try their other items soon
