Don't go here for cool atmosphere, even though you'll find a great, low-key, hip feel. And don't go here for the phenomenal drinks even though, they are, in fact, phenomenal (my favorite is the Templeton Rye Manhattan, but they have amazing Mezcal and specialty drinks). Go and keep your palate and head sober, fresh and clean, at least until you've tasted each course of Rick Bayless's menu selections. Amazing chicken taquitos, pork meatballs, and cream spinach appetizers; delicious entrees and beautiful, delectable desserts. We went there last October and experienced absolutely amazing main dishes on Mexican Independence Day; went back two days ago and enjoyed the food even more. Be prepared for the noise and energy, but take the food slow. If you pace yourself the menu changes so you can enjoy new things, but when you find a favorite go again soon so you don't miss it!
