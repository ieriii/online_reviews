I went there on a Sunday night with my girlfriend. We both had heard nothing but rave reviews about the place, so we were excited to try it.  Our first course was the griglia mista. It was calimari, shrimp, and octopus with a light olive oil dressing. It was fresh, tasty and very smoky from the grill, but nothing spectacular.  Next, we ordered the paglia e fieno con vitello. You could tell the pasta was handmade and the veal ragu was super flavorful. They were also very accommodating when we told them we wanted to split it, which the waitress did for us tableside. Next, we also shared the rosticciana. The short rib was melt in your mouth delicious. I wasn't so crazy about the green underneath, but I did not let that detract from the main focus of the plate. Again, they were great about us wanting to share and just divided the portion back in the kitchen before it was ever brought out. We finished the meal with a hazelnut chocolate cake served with hazelnut ice cream. It was very rich, as expected, and was served piping hot so that the chocolate center was oozing out with every bite.   All in all, I was happy with the experience. The service was A+, but I wasn't blown away with the food like I was hoping to be. I'll give it another shot in the spring when it's nice enough to sit outside on their patio. I was happy with the price though. For an appetizer, two entrees, dessert, and a bottle of wine, it was only $100 before tip. Not too shabby.
