Love this place. Its my favorite sushi place in the city - and I've tried many. I also used to live in Southern California land of awesome sushi. Service can be spotty when they're busy but the rolls are spot on. Order the White Dragon, Volcano and the Pauper (which is not on the menu). Also, try the dessert called Mochi (spelling?). I'm not a huge dessert fan, but this is just a bite of interesting-ness. Great atmosphere and its BYOB!!!! They limited this recently to 1 bottle between 2 people. I'm not sure why they changed this - but I do know they weren't that strict on it last time I was there. Make reservations - or you'll wait forever.
