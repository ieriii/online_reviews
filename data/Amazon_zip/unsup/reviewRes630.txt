Best meal of my life. Can't possibly describe the courses and do them the justice they deserve. Had the option of adding a white truffle risotto course and was not at all disappointed. If given the option, you must have this dish! The presentation was really impressive without feeling too flashy or like a show. Amazing. Worth every penny.
