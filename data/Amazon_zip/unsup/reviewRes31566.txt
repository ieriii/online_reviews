simplified version service is slow when compared to other fine dining steak restaurants. Food is OK. i give it a B B+ at best. Sides might be better. Similar to Ruths Chris. Steak comes out on a hot plate... But i prefer Ruths over Mastros. Best thing they had going for them was that quantity. i didnt hate it but it wasnt memorable either. prob will not be going back My steak pref: SW at the wynn. Bone in filet at Joes seafood. Those set the bar for me.
