I've heard so much about it, i wanted to try it out. My first attempt there was a small line outside, so we decided to bypass and head some where else instead. the second, well me and a GF stepped out the train after work and said what the heck. we had a lovely time, the whiskey cocktails were tasty and ambiance not too overwhelming. its good to go to a bar and not have to hunt for a chair. i did not really notice any of the people so i cant say it was pretentious. our bartender was very friendly, and we had good conversation. yes, it was pricey. but we knew that going in and well for a perfectly balanced cocktail, to be treated like a grown up and given excellent service it was worth it.
