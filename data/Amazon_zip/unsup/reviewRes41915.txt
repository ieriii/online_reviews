Having been an avid fan of this joint, I feel the need to voice my disdain! I made birthday dinner reservations for a 7:45 Saturday night requesting a booth if possible. Upon our arrival we get the old "we are a little backed up will call you in 15 minutes". Ya no big deal! Like clock work we were called in 15 minutes and led to our booth where someone else was sitting and the waters were being placed on the table. WTF! Anyway, the seater leads us in a big circle and we end up back at the front desk where a mass of confusion seemed to set in. Courteously I waited another 15 minutes and no one was solving our problem. As a matter of fact no one seemed to even know about our problem except us. Happy Birthday baby!!! Now I am slightly ticked off and grab the coat tails of the only person that looked like they knew what they were talking about! He was in the middle of helping the girl who lost control of the check-in with her computer. She looked like she was playing video poker and was on her last "dollah". After another 5 minutes we were led upstairs and sat against a friggn wall in a corner. Uncool! I think I am done with this place for a while. When you spend two hundred on dinner you should get more than a meal!
