I'm no sushi expert, but I've tried a lot of sushi in my lifetime. First off people, stop complaining about them not having wine glasses. You're going for the sushi and plus it's freaking BYOB! No corkage fee. From the outside, it looks pretty ghetto, and I will admit that on the inside, it's not very big BUT they are known to be more of a delivery/to-go restaurant. (**Couple yrs ago, they were awarded 1st place for best take out sushi restaurant**) Sushi X keeps it real with quality fish and they don't skimp on the meat (unlike ahem...COAST :T), everything is super fresh. I highly recommend spicy tuna (my fav), godzilla roll, honey, and rainbow roll. The Service is always on point and they hook it up with an industry discount every time I'm in there. They also opened up a new location with a bar in lincoln park. I still have yet to check that spot out. Now...with that being said... go get ur grub on! ;)
