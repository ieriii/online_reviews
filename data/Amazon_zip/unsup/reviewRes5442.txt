Stayed at the Hyatt on Wacker and after we checked in , decided to find some lunch. As always, I pulled up Yelp on my phone and buzzed through nearby restaurants. First page, nothing grabbed me, second page, scroll, scroll, The Purple Pig .4 mi. away!  Lets try it....being around 2pm I figured the lunch rush might be over, it wasn't, place was pretty busy , but only had to wait 5 minutes. Ordered a bottle of wine for the three of us, and a fine Belgian beer of which I can't remember the name, Saison I believe, for myself seeing as we were on a mini vacation!  Waitress recommended ordering a few different things and sharing, which we did and thoroughly enjoyed. Including a 3 cheese sampler from a list of about 20, beet type salad served in a bowl with a whipped goat cheese, and toast topped with serrano cured meat and a fried egg. The most interesting was the bone marrow, which I had to try simply for the sake of trying. Did I love it? No. Did I hate it? Nooo....somewhere in between! Without a sprinkle of sea salt that accompanied the dish, somewhat bland.  Overall, we all the loved this place, really cool vibe, service was helpful and pleasant. Had a couple of other samplers that I can't recall due to the long weekend of eating and drinking, but we liked it enough to go back for dessert on Sunday evening, which was also awesome!!  Will go back on my next visit!!
