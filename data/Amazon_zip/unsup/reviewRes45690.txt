We wandered into this place just for a drink before a show, and I wanted to stay in there for hours! It's always great to walk into a regular-looking place and be wowed by the inside. Besides the beautiful wood and glass decor, there's plenty of space...in fact spaces within the space like a library area and a cute little 2nd bar in the back. For the duration of our one drink, service was great. I'm looking forward to returning for a meal.
