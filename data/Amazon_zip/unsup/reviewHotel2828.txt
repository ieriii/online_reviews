Hello. I'm only writing this review for the pool and the lobby, since that's the only part of the hotel I really visited. This was due to the fact that my own pool at the Hilton Garden Inn (just around the corner) had a broken pool and they let us use the one at the Embassy Suites. Now, the lobby of this place is cool. It's one of those open atrium hotels where all of the rooms look out on the central atrium, so it's really nice and open. However, just an FYI, the pool sucks. Sorry, Embassy Suites. It smells like a stinking cesspool of chemicals in the pool room. The water in the pool has detritus floating around in it. The hot tub is so dirty that it is foaming out of control and the water is yellow-ish. The floor was soaking wet and kind of dirty, so you felt nervous about putting your bare feet on it. All in all, I was so grossed out by the pool and the hot tub, the the most exposure I would give myself to it was putting my feet into the hot tub and watching the foam stick to my calves and imaging microorganisms burrowing into my skin. So, don't come here for the pool.  Otherwise, rely on everyone else's comments regarding the rooms. That is all I have to say.
