There are so many documentaries that chronicle good Hot-dog places around the United States; they often stop here - as I did. Blown away is an understatement. I don't like hot-dogs, in fact, I am disgusted by then. But they have an amazing veggie dog that I heard about all the time when I lived in the area. Went there, tried it, and then went for some more... for the next three years. :) The place is great. My only hassle - so many people know of this little gem! Given any day of the week, you are expected to be in a packed place. No surprise when you see the line from the store and down and around the block. I'm serious. Go and enjoy!
