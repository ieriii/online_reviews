My boyfriend and I practically ran to Irazu after seeing it on Check, Please! (oh come on, you know you love it), but it didn't completely live up to my expectations. He had the veggie sandwich, and I had the veggie burrito. The burrito was very bland, and not unlike something I could make at home. We had a side order of the sweet plantains, which were delicious at first, but after a couple of bites just tasted strange. I will brag about the oatmeal shake though, which I LOVED (and immediately ran home and experimented making my own until I cracked the recipe). The service was very slow, but we had an outside seat and that made it fun to people watch. Nonetheless, it could be a great restaurant but an off night for us. I would possibly try again, but with the experience I had I wouldn't whole-heartedly recommend it.
