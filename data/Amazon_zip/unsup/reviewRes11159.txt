THE BEST BREAKFAST I'VE EVER EATEN!!! This is my favorite spot. I no longer go anywhere else. First, let me say that any place that serves eggs benedict with REAL HOLLANDAISE SAUCE is #1 in my book. No powdered, just add water, at this establishment! How people can say the food is mediocre is beyond me. It's always fresh and hot, and the creativity with the pancakes and French toast selections blows me away. Plus, the menu changes with the seasons, so there's always something new for excitement.  Yes, the wait is LONG if you get there after 10am. BUT, the food is so worth it, and Wicker Park has so many cool stores in the neighborhood to check out, that it doesn't much matter to me. Oh, the "rude host" is actually the owner. And, he's actually VERY NICE!! (and, no, I do not know him personally....)
