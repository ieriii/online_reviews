Art of Pizza makes my favorite true stuffed pizza in Chicago (FYI like nearly every other pizza restaurant/consumer:  stuffed is different than deep dish). I am a little tomato-phobic and hate chunks of tomato in sauce so I am very picky, but Art of Pizza's sauce is great and slightly sweet. The crust is delicious, and of course there's no real way to mess up cheese. I've also had the pan pizza, which is good, but the 5 star rating is really for the stuffed. You've got to try it over one of the popular Chicago pizza chains.
