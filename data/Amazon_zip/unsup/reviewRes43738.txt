My date and I dined at Kinzie on Saturday, July 30th, 2011. I had eaten here with friends several times over the years (service was good then too) but the service was so good this time around that I had to submit a review.  We were a bit early so we had drinks in the bar. The bartender poured a great drink and was attentive. When seated for dinner, our server, Paul, was fantastic. He was prompt, personable, and attentive throughout the meal. The General Manager, Theresa, visited our table to inquire how the meal was going and if there was anything she might do. Kinzie is for some, one of the lesser known, but truly great steakhouses in the city. If you are looking for a classy, non-pretentious evening, with GREAT food and service, I would highly recommend it!
