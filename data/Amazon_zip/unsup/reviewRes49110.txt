This is possibly the best restaurant I've ever been to--at least considering that beer and meat are my two favorite things in the world. Their beer selection rivals or beats even the best pubs like Map Room. There's hardly an ale in the world that you can't order at Publican. There's also hardly an organ in a cow's or pig's body that you can't get here :-) If you're not adventurous enough to try some thymus gland, intestines, or heart--this place may be a little too extreme for you. That said, even their more traditional meals (like the 1/2 chicken) is pretty amazing. Prices are pretty high for the relatively small portions too. That'd be the only drawback in my mind.
