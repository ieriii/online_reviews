For all the hype surrounding this place I'd have expected to feel like I was sitting in Miami or Cuba eating the most delicious food and experiencing fun, friendly people. Well, not so much the case. The pulled pork dish was very good, but the others were just ok. The croquetas and the bruschetta appetizers were good, as well as the empanadas, but the empanadas were a bit dry. I think they need a dipping sauce. If there was supposed to be one, it was not provided. The plantains were sweet and cooked well, but just like everything else, it just was. They didn't rock my socks off, granted I had flip flops on, but I digress.  They are BYOB which is nice, and the patio is huge, so that was a plus on a summer night. My only real complaint is that our waitress was lazy, and slow. The restaurant was not full to capacity, and every time we asked for something from her, she wandered around and after long waits would come back. We had a waiter originally that she replaced, and he was awesome. He gave us great recommendations, knew the menu well, and was very friendly. It was explained a shift change happened, and now we had someone else... He ended up still being around, and we asked him what happened and that we would have rather had him, but he laughed and said he thought he would have been able to leave when his shift changed. Anywho... the service/lack thereof was annoying to me. I know it's a relaxed atmosphere but actually behave like you care. We had a table of 5, and we were all very nice and jovial with everyone, so there was no reason we should have had to wait as long as we did for everything. Since I live over towards the lake, I'm not sure if it's worth a taxi ride out here again.
