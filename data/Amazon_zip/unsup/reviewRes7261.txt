I've been searching for some great BBQ in Chicago for a long time. I finally feel I have found the spot at Chicago q. They do things the right way, you can see the meat is slow cooked by the smoke line in the ribs. The meat comes to the table with no sauce on it to hide any shortcuts. The sides were large but still very good. The sauces can stand up on their own, and it was nice to be able to combine a few together for a unique taste. "q" is not cheap but I feel it is fairly priced for the quality of food and service. Very nice atmosphere, we will definitely be back!!
