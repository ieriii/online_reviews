i love that there's a refreshing new place in andersonville! the menu is tastefully eclectic and offers enough selection for different tastes. there could be more vegetarian options over all, but i found plenty to froth over, especially the EGGPLANT SANDWICH. aw man, even my die hard veggie sandwich snob friend loved this! our other friends loved the chicken dishes and did i mention the EGGPLANT SANDWICH? the desserts were good...i think they're still working on them. i know that BJ makes their own everything so they must be working on perfecting the fried ice cream batter cuz both times i've had it, it was too corn mealy & salty (?!). the missippi mudpie is to die for, though! i managed to just about lick this plate clean. i love that there's tea time at BJ. our waitress didn't know a thing about any of the teas and kept having to ask the kitchen for any kind of info on them, but they have a nice selection of teas. i would have appreciated a tea timer or more info about the gorgeous budding flower bud tea i got. the first cup was *so* delicious but since neither the server nor i knew anything about this tea, it quickly became over brewed and any amount of water couldn't dilute that "burned" tea taste. oh well, nice presentation, though. maybe more herbal teas on that tea menu would help, too - they had only one herbal selection, but many light caffeine choices like white teas. overall, i just love this place and plan to return often. the owners were super sweet, our servers were gracious and the place is just gorgeous!
