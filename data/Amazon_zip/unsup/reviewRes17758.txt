No matter what the food is amazing...but I have to admit the wait can be a pain on the right ot rather wrong night (theplace is pretty spacious but still the wait can be pretty long sometimes once it was about 45 minutes) ....Whenever I go the servers are pretty nice. Sometimes I wonder if I choose the right dish, but when it comes its always great.
