After all the negative aspects and experiences that I heard about the Congress prior to my stay, I have to admit that it exceeded expectations. Sadly, that's not saying much. The room itself was fine - nothing spectacular, I had no issues with plumbing and a lovely view of the lake. The carpeting and tiles obviously have not been update in quite some time, so it almost has the look of a motel. The room was probably the best part of my brief stay. The front-desk service was very rude to me during my check in. The former employees that are still on strike make for an awkward entrance into the hotel during the afternoon. Not recommended.
