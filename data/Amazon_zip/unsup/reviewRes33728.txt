EHHH... There are far better brunch places in the city, I don't get why Yolk gets a lot of hype. My theory is that there are so few in the loop/south loop area, and in that area where there are lots of hotels and touristy parks and colleges, people hit up Yolk because its nearby. Seriously people, its just overpriced breakfast after a long wait and they wanna rush you out the door afterwards... but make you wait for centuries to get you your check. What kind of brunch is that? Not a fan.
