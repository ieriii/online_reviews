Wanted to grab some good home italian cooking while in the windy city. We ordered the lobster ravioli which was to die for, I melted into my chair with the first bite, with only ummmmm, ahhhhhhhs, soooo good for the next 30 mins. You couldn't have taken that plate away from me without getting hurt, and I was this close to licking the plate. The staff was nice and we were seated in a short amount of time even with no reservations. It is rather noisy but it adds to the the big family feeling. Make your way there as soon as possible!
