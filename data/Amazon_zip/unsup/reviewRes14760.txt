The food at 90 Miles Cuban Cafe was fantastic. We got the Cuban sandwich on sweet bread and the Bistec sandwich. Both were brought out quickly and both had great taste and complexity. I preferred the Cuban sandwich over the Bistec, but my eating partner liked the Bistec more. The Cuban sandwich had a lot of pork and the sweet bread provided a great contrast to the saltiness of the meat. We also had the croquettes - they were fried perfectly and had a nice almost creamy finish. The staff there was also really helpful and nice. Just as a note, the inside isn't very big so if it's crowded you may not be able to sit inside.
