I ordered from the Pasta Bowl $9 catering menu for a Christmas luncheon, so I can't speak for the dining in experience. For the most part, Pasta Bowl was great - it was very reasonably priced and all-inclusive, Jay was very flexible with the menu, the meal came with salad, bread and drinks, and the food arrived on time.  But based on the reviews, I was expecting larger portions. I doubt that the dining in portions translated to the catering portions per person. In fact, I was sweating for a while, wondering if we had enough food. We came a little short.  We ordered the farfalle pollo, and rigatoni bolognese, and despite the reviews, I actually liked the rigatoni better - it was a mouthful of creamy, meaty goodness. The caesar salad was very good too, with fresh parmesan. But I'm sure dining in would be a different experience.
