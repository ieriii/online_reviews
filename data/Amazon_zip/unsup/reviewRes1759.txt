The bread - regular hot dog bread The sausage - a little bland, maybe so we can enjoy the toppings more? The toppings - Great, delicious, unique We ordered 3 sausages, foie gras, Saucisse de Toulouse and the uber garlic which was the celebrity of the day. The sausage was a little bit on the bland side, but the delicious toppings made up for it. Maybe that was the intention? I don't know but the hot dog as a whole was good. I wish I lived in Chicago so that I can try all their specials.
