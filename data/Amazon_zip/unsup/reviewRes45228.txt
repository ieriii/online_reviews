My husband and I wanted to treat ourselves to a nice day off and we ended the evening here. It was absolutely wonderful. No wait! Not that crowded, although it is pretty noisy. The bread sticks might be my favorite thing about this place. We had the sample anti-pasta platter and ate every morsel. I had pumpkin ravioli and he had ox tale ragu and pasta, we hardly spoke as we savored every bite and both of us had big smiles on our faces. Great wine selection. The only complaint was from Luke, he didn't feel the torta Della Nonna was the real deal, but I could care less b/c it tasted like heaven. Amen!
