Just ordered delivery from here since I was craving Pho and I usually get Pho delivered from Hai Yen. However, my past delivery experience was not great. Loved how fresh the food is from here. It's amazing. A lot of Asian restaurants don't use really fresh ingredients, but Simply It does! Also, it was a nice surprise to get complimentary oranges with my order. There was also a letter of thanks from the owner which was really nice. I didn't know they were struggling until I read the letter and checked it out the article on Time Out Chicago. Try Simply It since they deliver. Your food will arrive hot and fresh!
