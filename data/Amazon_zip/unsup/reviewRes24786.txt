My boyfriend and I went on a Tuesday night. We liked the atmosphere and our server was very nice. However, we both agreed that we were happy we tried it...but wouldn't rush back.  The food was good, but not great. Way too pricey for what you get. We got a bottle of wine, which was very good. However, because it is fondue and you are cooking at your table, you smelllllll by the time you leave. Therefore, do not plan on going out after!
