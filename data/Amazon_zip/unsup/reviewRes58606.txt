I'll try to make my complaints brief and to the point. Honestly nothing we had was good and I actually felt ripped off.My friends and I had been trying to plan for weeks to go here just to try what they claimed is Montreal Poutine. There version was the biggest fail at poutine I have ever witnessed. My drunk friends at 6am have made better poutine with McDonalds fries. The gravy killed it, it was sweet and disgusting.The spinach salad was bland with barely any dressing.The veggie burger was terribly boring. Boring bread, boring patty and boring sauce. I tried it simply because it was advertised as being made in collaboration with Sage Francis.The biggest insult on the veggie burger was the fact that my caramelized onions were ice cold!! I took a bite and could understand why something was that cold in the burger. Turns out it was the caramelized onions, i was disgusted. Do they just make a whole batch, refrigerate it and add it to burgers? If you're not going to make it to order at least have the decency to heat them up.I tried the truffle oil fries, they were ok, I don't know what truffle oil is supposed to taste like but I don't even know if I tasted anything other than regular fries.My iced tea, I had to send it back, it was barely yellow and the only flavor was the lemon i squeezed in it.Service was ok to say the least, after sending back the iced tea i settled for water which was only filled once after our waitress brought the check.I would not recommend Bad Apple, if you want good burgers go to Kuma's and if you want good Veggie burgers with actual caramelized onions go to Earwax. The menu looks sexy and interesting but it is an epic fail.
