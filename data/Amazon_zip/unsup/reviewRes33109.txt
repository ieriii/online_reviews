After reading some of the reviews here, I've come to the conclusion that Americans aren't used to being pampered and well-treated at restaurants. At restaurants in America, you are basically seated, visited for a drink order, visited for a food order, given your food and left alone the rest of the time. It's an effective system but an anonymous and sterile one as well. In Romania a "restaurateur's" main job is to make you feel at home, feel cared about and deliver excellent service. The owner and servers of Little Bucharest use their wit, charms, and knowledge of good customer service to bring European-style dining to Chicago. On slower evenings, the owner himself will dote on you, make recommendations for the unsure and jolly you along with good humor. Some may see this as an overly intense concentration of service, but fail to grasp the full experience that Little Bucharest is trying to provide. The owner has gone to great lengths to bring customers a relaxing, beautiful, and classy dining experience, from the gorgeous stained glass interior art to the live troubadour music. The food is plentiful, prepared and arranged with care, and tastes like only the best ingredients are used. The bar is stocked and the hot drinks are flowing. The mood lighting is romantically dark, giving your meal an intimate feel but can be brightened for a party atmosphere. Your needs will often be anticipated, and if you can suspend the natural standoffish nature of casual American dining long enough, you may find yourself developing a friendship with the servers and owners. THAT is a true rarity in Chicago dining, a restaurant that cares to know you better, rather than just making contact with your wallet. I've tried Little Bucharest Bistro as an intimate date night location and I can't wait to try it again with a group for some serious merrymaking. Such potential! Bravo!
