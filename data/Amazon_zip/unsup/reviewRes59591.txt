SSGS is one of my all time favorite rest. of all time. But for the past 2 recent visits. I can't stand the waitress anymore. My workers and I used to come here around 2-3am when we got off from work. Please look at your bill CLOSELY, b/c they might charge extra fee in there. The waitress complained my friend gave $6 tip was TOO LOW. (BILL WAS around 38.00) 2nd time, I was there with 2 adults and 1 baby. We left $8 tip on the table, the waitress just swing right by and grab it. Than when we got the bill, we got another extra 10 bucks in there. I asked the girl, she said it was for the tip. .. The total bill was $54.00... She was mumbling in Korean than she said: "so you gave us $18.00". I was like wdh.. I demanded the $10.00 taken off from my friend's credit card. She had to do it 3 times to get the right money off the charge. CINDY, the OWNER was not there. I was so upset their customer service. They don't even look at us or asking if we need anything else. It has been 7 great years knowing them I know they're start losing other Asian customers. I know b/c I talked to them and they experienced the same situation too. I like to give their food 4* b/c I tried most of Korean Rest. and they're not quite good as them.. sike..
