OMG YUM!. I will definitely say this one of the BEST if not the BEST Italian restaurants I have ever been too. Everything was delicious. I had the "FARFALLE AI FRUTTI DI MARE in the white sauce which is their signature garlic & olive oil sauce. YUMMY! If you love Italian food and seafood, this dish is for you! I think this is the best pasta dish I ever had too lol.  For appetizers, we got the POLIPO ALLA GRIGLIA (Grilled & marinated Octopus).....one of the best octopus I have ever had lol.  Definitely will be coming back and trying many other dishes. As far as looking around and noticing what other people ordered...everything looked to die for! MUST GO! STOP READING THIS REVIEW AND GO EAT THERE NOW! :-D
