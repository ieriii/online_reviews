I started going to Schwa 2 weeks after they first opened. And yes, it can be hard to get a reservation because the "mailbox is full", I would say keep trying. Michael Carlson is so creative, the food is just fantastic!!!! Even when I know what the dish is going to taste like, it's still a party in my mouth! I love Schwa.
