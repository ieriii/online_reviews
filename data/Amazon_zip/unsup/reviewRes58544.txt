I'll admit it. I'm a pizza freak. I've built the woodfired oven in the backyard, and have inspired others to do the same. I know my napolitano pizza. This cat has nailed it! The caputo flour crust, san marzano tomato, meaty enough for the general public, but still....that art. What a sight to behold.A friend heard I was visiting my brother in Chicago and said you have got to hit this place. I would not let my trip from CA go wasted. Our family of five walked out of there with giant smiles. Please.....please head in and order yourself a big red wine, and at least one pizza per person (these are small artisan pizzas......it's about the flavors, not the gut). The freshness is over the top.  And if you're a critic....this place is a HUGE bargain.A really comfortable neighborhood. This restaurant fits right in. We were watching people walk in from the neighborhood while seated in the fresh, but still old-italian style dining room. Jon and Sarah made us feel like family for an hour. Handshakes, hugs...even pictures! I'll never hit the windy city without a visit.
