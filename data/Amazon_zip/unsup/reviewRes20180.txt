AMAZING! Devin was our waiter and OMG he knows everything there is to know about sushi. Even if the food was horrible, which it was not, he would have made it terrific with his knowledge and ability to suggest the perfect sashimi or roll or anything really. Then I asked one I the chefs to make something completely off the wall. He asked what I liked, I told him, and then came a wonderful on the spot creation that had amazing architecture and balance with all of the things one could ask for. This place is by far the most creative and best sushi location in the city and maybe even the Midwest! I'd go back daily if I could!
