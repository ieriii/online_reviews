Okay, this one is personal fav of mine and the only real good canton style Chinese restaurant in the whole area( trust me ive traveled to HK)! I went to school with one of the owners sons and literally would eat his entire supply of bbq that he would bring back from home. This place has been around since '86 and I've been eating from this restaurant for more than a decade! 1. GREAT BBQ duck, pork, and chicken 2. Freshest Chinese Veggies 3. Best salted chicken ( this one is a real gem). 4. Excellent shrimp-pork wontons. 5. Unbeatable price 6. Tentative service 7. THIS PLACE FRICKIN RULESZ.
