I came here to have my first taste of a Chicago deep dish pizza. We heard great things about this place so we went on a Monday night. We waited like 20minutes to get in which you know means the place is great. We ordered a bacon cheesburger pizza Chicago style. It took a little over one hour to bake but we were told that is normal. It was worth the wait! A small pizza was wonderfully filling for two people. We had a good server who kept our beer glasses full. Overall it was a very tasty experience and I would definitely recommend this place to first time Chicagoers or veterans of the windy city. The reason why I gave it 4 out of 5 was because the booth seating was uncomfortable. Normally that wouldn't bother me but if I'm waiting 1hour+ for the pizza then I would like to be more comfortable.
