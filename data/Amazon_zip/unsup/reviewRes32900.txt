I love Ethiopian food! This place is great... It was the first one in Chicago I went to and I have just kept going back to this one rather than trying new places because I am really satisfied with it. Great food (of course), good prices and good atmosphere... great place to take a group. The owner or manager (not sure which) is out on the floor a lot, which is both nice and slightly weird, since he is very NOT ethiopian...but he knows a lot and was able to answer questions we had about some art on the wall with good detail.
