Been coming here for a while to study. Admittedly, not a great place to hang out with friends and chat but it is a GREAT place to come and study. Quiet, free Wi-Fi, etc.  Well, as long as homeless people don't come in and start talking to themselves. Not that I have any thing against homeless people -- it's just not what I expect. The staff here is alright -- I don't think they're especially friendly, but they are friendly enough. Coffee drinks are aiiiiiiiiiight, nothing to write home about any time soon. Baked goods look good -- I had a hazelnut chocolate cupcake which, again, was nothing to write home about any time soon. I really like it here. Oh, except they should put soap in the bathroom.
