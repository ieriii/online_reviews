Oxtail potstickers were great! It's definitely a place to share dishes so that you can try a little bit of everything.  I had a pear saki but it tasted like Herbal Essences so I was not a fan. I think the mixed drinks were trying too hard to be cool. And they were out of Merlot! How is that possible at a restaurant? But overall, the atmosphere and food was great.
