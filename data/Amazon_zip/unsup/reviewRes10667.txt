Over an hour wait at a ridiculously crowded Wicker Park restaurant and I'm still compelled to give 5 stars. In fact, I feel like I should start deducting stars from some of my previous 5 star pizzerias. I only learned afterward that Piece's pizza is vegan, so this is more like a 5+ review. I'm tempted to keep this really short because I fear that anything I say will not suffice the accolades Piece deserves, but I'll give it a try. My friend who shall remain nameless put on her flannel shirt and blended in quite well with the rest of the patrons. She and I luckily caught a couple leaving their seats at the bar and snagged them as quickly as we could. While we waited to be seated, we spent our time at the bar. I pointed out all her flannel comrades within a 3 feet radius and had a great deal of fun passing the time while drinking some decently priced beers. $2 brew samples. For those of you who don't know what beer tastes like, it's a great way to begin. So about an hour and fifteen minutes later we were seated along with a couple other friends that found their way here. Pizza ordering time began and I really liked their topping selections. Roasted red peppers?!!? Oh man, yes! Tomatoes and roasted red peppers won the vote at our table. Maybe the thin, floppiness to Piece's pizza isn't for everyone, but it sure was for our group. The four of us unashamedly polished off an entire large pizza and could have kept going. Okay I didn't really ask them if they wanted more, but I know I did and I can usually speak for a large group quite well. To be honest, I couldn't stop thinking about this pizza for a couple days. I even tried replacing my cravings with other pizza, but nothing could fill that void, and Wicker Park is quite a hike from Lombard. I need help. Please.
