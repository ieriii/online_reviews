(btw - waiters are not rude - over the course of 4 hours we saw them go from professional and attentive to telling us stories of customers licking the table cloth for the dessert on the table! they have a great sense of humor and dry wit - they are prob used to seeing stuffy / uptight customers so if you are real with them, they are real with you!)
