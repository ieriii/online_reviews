Ridiculously hopping bar and amazing food. Menu is eclectic and pretty much everything works. Only miss this time was the cheese plate. Everything else was and is delicious! Drinks are always well-made and a nice wine menu. The biggest negative about The Gage is that it is by far the loudest restaurant that I have ever experienced. Mainly because there are so very many people, which is great, but it makes conversation at dinner a little difficult. Keep in mind if it is a romantic dinner or a business meeting that brings you there.
