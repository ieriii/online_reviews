I ate here last night and had a delicious pulled pork sandwich. But the dish that took everyone's breath away was my friend's Kobe brisket dinner place - sliced, not chopped. That brisket was hands-down the best brisket I've ever had, just amazingly moist and fall off the fork tender. Yum. The chocolate cream pie with pretzel crust was also really, really, really good.
