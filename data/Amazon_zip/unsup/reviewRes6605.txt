It's a beautiful space with great, great service. The meat is just OK. They use a Southern Pride smoker which only adds a wimpy small amount of flavor to the meat. Those are electric smokers with wood chips. In my opinion the heat source for the bbq should supply the smoke as well. That means wood or charcoal. The problem with the meat is threefold: The texture is wrong with no real crust, the smokey flavor is weak or absent and the meat has almost no fat. It's like they are making health bbq or something. I did not notice a smoke ring either. I eat and make a lot of bbq and this just doesn't cut the mustard. They have some good sauces but as they say, "Sauce is only good for hiding your mistakes." The pickles they give you when you sit down are incredibly good and the potato chips are good too. I would say this place is a good restaurant but not a good bbq place.
