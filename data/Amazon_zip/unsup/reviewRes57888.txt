I would not recommend this place unless you carry out and know what Ethiopian dishes you like.The service was ridiculously slow. It was only two of us, my girlfriend and I. The waitress sat us outside. It looked like it was about to rain but we figured if it did we would move inside. While waiting to put in our drink order some transient approached us in the enclosed patio dining area and asked for money.We were at the restaurant for two hours! Two other tables got up and left after getting only water because the service was so slow. We ordered one appetizer and one main dish. The waitress forgot to bring me a beer that I ordered and almost never checked on our water glasses. I asked another waitress to get the beer since ours had disappeared. When the bill came I paid it. However, the waitress came back and said she forgot to ring the beer she forgot to bring and one of the glasses of honeywine that my girlfriend drank. I guess I thought maybe the beer was on the house since I waited 20 minutes for it and had to order it twice. The waitress then proceeded to ring up another check for the beer and wine so I had to run my card twice.All in all, the food was okay but the service sucked. The waitress provided no guidance on what to order even though we inquired. I liked the appetizer and drinks but the main dish was over priced and the bread they serve has a very strong vinegar taste which I did not like much.If you think you are in the mood to try Ethiopian food at Demera, I would suggest you just go to your favorite mediterranean restaurant because, although not indentical, some of the dishes/tastes are fairly similar.
