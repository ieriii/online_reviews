Perhaps we went on an off night. The decor is amazing - so fun, and inspires a party atmosphere right away. The staff are polite & the hostess made a point to check on our table a few times. They were out of guacamole, however, which seemed amazing. How can you be out of guac when half of your menu includes it? The waitress said they couldn't find avacados anywhere...The entrees and sweets were tasty, and the drinks were ok. I ordered a mango papaya thing and it was pretty fibrous. Overall, fun place with good food.Great for a large group.
