Lost its way..... Was a fun place to hang out with great wine and cheese but now is a victim of their own success. The place seems to be on the list of must visit places in every newspaper and magazine that has a story about Chicago. I've never seen so many xmass sweaters and people having 'I'll just have a water' at 9pm on a sat night. They need to establish a local following for long tern success.
