If i could give this place 10 starts I would!!! I'm obsessed...by far THE BEST PIZZA IN CHICAGO HANDS DOWN!!! listen to me right now...order this and only this when you go to Pequods: GROUND BEEF (of Sausage if you're a sausage fan) - and Giardinera on a Deep Dish Pizza. You will thank me later. I LOVE THIS PLACE...and I miss it bc now I live in LA and the deep dish here blows!!
