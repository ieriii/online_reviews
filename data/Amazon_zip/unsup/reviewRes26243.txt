We love this place. Have been going here for over almost 20 years. The service is good. The food is great, I usually get the seafood combo and the novelty of table cooking is unique. Wine selection is superb and the wait staff are very knowledgeable on recommendations. Only thing I personally don't care for is the salad dressing, otherwise A-1. Very romantic atmosphere and inviting. Try the "wine maker dinners" but make sure you have a designated driver! Lol
