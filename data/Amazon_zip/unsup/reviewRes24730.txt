I have learned that I'm not a fondue person based on this experience. I must say that I am conflicted in saying that because I'm a total foodie, and appreciate all forms of cooking. In a nutshell here are my issues. We were late for our reservation but the host said he would find a table for us...and he did...TWO HOURS later. At the hour mark we already had our car in valet ($12) and had invested too much time not to see the whole fondue experience through to the end. So we waited, and waited some more while nibbling on the cheese and crackers by the bar, which were in retrospect my favorite part of the meal! Finally we were seated, however by then I was naseous from smelling the gross scent of oil for two hours. So the first course arrived, and it's important for you to know that I use gruyere all of the time, and this did not taste like gruyere. I'm not sure what it was exactly but I did not enjoy it. Then the oil came out, and maybe because I'm a germophobe, I felt completely grossed out by all of the raw meat and seafood on one plate. All I could think of was a deadly combo of e-coli and salmonella swimming around on the platter. Then the injuries occured...both my date and I were each burned by spattering hot oil. I quickly realized that I simply do not enjoy having all of my food deep fried...and my stomach let me know that quite powerfully later in the evening if you know what I mean. Lastly the dessert came and besides the cheese and crackers at the bar, the roasted marshmallow were my second favorite part of the meal. As far as this being one of the most romantic places in the city, I must vehemently disagree. The oily residue, the dustbunnies everywhere, and the raw food definitely did not come across as romantic to me. The first thing I did when I arrived home was to take a shower and wash that oily scent that stuck to me like a skunk right out of my hair!
