What a perfect meal. This is pretty much as good as it gets. Great service (on a holiday night to boot), lovely space, and superb food. We had: seafood linguine - each component was impeccably fresh and the pasta was perfectly cooked. Also ordered the rigatoni w/ sausage and peas - so good that the husband ate the entire bowl (with my help, of course.) To top it off, we shared the tiramisu dessert. Confession: I am usually not a fan. The alcohol used to soak the ladyfingers or sponge cake is usually too "sharp" and the coffee flavor too strong. The one here? So perfect that I had my spoon in the bowl until the last bite. Even the iced tea was good! This place is certainly on my list of favorite neighborhood restaurants - can't wait for a return visit!
