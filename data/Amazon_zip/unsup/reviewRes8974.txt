I really want to love this place for two reasons. I live in the neighborhood and I like to support my local community and because I LOVE pizza. I have been here 3 times and have been less than impressed each time. I went tonight, early, because I know it gets crowded. The hostess looked at me like I was crazy because I said dinner for one. My server was actually quite nice and very informative. I ordered my pizza and I have to say, one side was charred and the center of the pizza wasn't baked all the way. Having been a pizza cook before, clean your oven floor and lower the temp of your oven. I had the mushroom pizza with basil. The mushrooms were well cooked but there were 3 pieces of basil randomly placed on the pizza. What's up with that? I want to taste basil in very bite of my meal. I made baked a frozen pizza for $4.99 last night from Whole Foods and it had more flavor than this one for $12.99. Also, I barely finished my last bite and my plate was gone and the check was delivered. I wish I could have better comments but I can't.
