I had heard great things about Coast, and was slightly disappointed. I would say the best reason to go here is for the people watching. It's like getting the best of a fashion magazine without having to buy the magazine. People definitely dress to the nines to go here! Went for the first time last night, and we waited an hour (fair for a Friday night), but once we were sat the service was great. The food was just ok; I have had better sushi for lower costs. I don't know that I would go back, but it was an overall pleasant experience.
