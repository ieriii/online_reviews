I was extremely excited to try Revolution. Frankly, I walked away a bit disappointed. Keep in mind, I didn't try the food - it might've been great. I sampled 4 different beers with the 4oz serving sizes (which every brewery should offer). All were... eh? They just didn't do it for me. The dark beers were too dark and the light beers were too flat and boring. I think a real strength of a heavy beer is when it can mask high alcohol content with great taste... and that just didn't happen here. It was fine, but considering the hype, I was personally pretty disappointed.
