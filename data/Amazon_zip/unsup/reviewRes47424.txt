Maybe it's me, but I wasn't impressed with the mac n cheese. Really good mac n cheese is made with 100% real cheese, but this sure didn't taste like it was. It tasted more like melted kraft singles and some macaroni. It wasn't terrible, just ok. And I found their "theme" pretty cheesy. Kuma's is way better and worth the wait.
