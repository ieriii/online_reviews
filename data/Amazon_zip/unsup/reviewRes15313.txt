Love Calo!!!! Their pizza is very thin, crispy and delicious. The sauce isn't overly sweet. Truly the best Chicago pizza. Also, all though I am sick for the entire day afterwards, they have the best Carbonara. It is rich and creamy and amazingly good.  Customer services is fantastic! I order a pizza last week to pick up. I didn't think about the fact that I had a sleeping 2 1/2 year old in my car when I went to pick up our pizza. I called Calo's and asked if they would just bring it outside to me. They said, "of course!" They had me pull up my car in front, took my card, went in and ran it, brought me the pizza and the receipt to sign. They were friendly and happy to do it! I can't wait to move back to the northside so they deliver to me!!
