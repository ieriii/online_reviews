I was working in the neighborhood and came here for lunch with some coworkers a couple of weeks ago. Newcomers like myself should be aware that there are two entrances, one for dinner only, so make sure you keep looking until you find the lunch door. They do a lot of takeout but have a large seating area as well, and we were able to sit right away. I ordered some mango juice to start, and it came out in a delicate little champagne flute. I'd have loved a larger glass of the yummy stuff, but it was sweet and wonderfully refreshing. We started with some chips and guac, which was just what the doctor ordered. They aren't skimpy in providing their guac and there was much more left after we ran out of chips. They also offered us some toasted bread rounds, which made decent guac dipping devices. For my entre, I decided very quickly to go with the Cuban sandwich, as this is a Cuban place and it seemed like one of their specialties. I was in love from the first bite - the bread was grilled and crunchy, the cheese was wonderfully melted and the pickle was thinly sliced so as not to be overwhelming. It came with a side of plantain chips, which weren't quite crunchy enough. Others got some less exciting looking salads and an interesting Mexican chicken sandwich. The service was quick and friendly and I noticed there was some outdoor seating too, perfect for lunch hour on a warm day when you want to soak in some fresh air before heading back to the office. The lunch food here was simple but yummy, and I'd highly recommend it to anyone in the area!
