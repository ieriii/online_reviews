Everyone is raving about how good their buffet is. However, I did not come for the buffet. My friends and I headed after work to try this place out as they highly spoke of how delicious and good their food is and any left overs you have, they place and bag it in this usable plastic containers. Great food w/ great company = awesome experience!
