Coast is a nice BYOB sushi place. The sushi is very nice (not great but above average) and the non sushi dishes are good too. The BYOB is probably the thing that sticks out the most. This place gets crowded, but the seat at a decent place. The dining area is a bit cramped, but they pack em in and service is good. Parking is kind of hard in this area. A nice nieghborhood sushi BYOB.
