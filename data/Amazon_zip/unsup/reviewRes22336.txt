Everyone loves this place like they are partial owners. It's pretty good, not anything that special. As mentioned in almost every review the oatmeal milkshakes are killer, but pretty much everything else is jst about average. Cuban sand. is good, but nothing to write home about. Fish tacos are aight, kinda bland actually. Steak is fair, but the real gem? Listening to white kids from the burbs try to pronounce patacones.
