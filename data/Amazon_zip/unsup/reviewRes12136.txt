I have always really liked this place. We always seem to go here whenever there is a big event, like birthdays, and we always have a great time. The pizza is so good, I love micro-brews, service is always pretty solid. It's always on the crowded side and the servers are always really busy. I could do without all the TVs playing sports, but it IS a sports bar. It's just a sports bar that has amazing pizza and great beer! I love beer!
