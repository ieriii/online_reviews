Please don't hurt me! Yes, yes I am giving Hot Doug's three stars - because really, I'm not quite a fan. I'm not leaping for the chance to go back again or to tell all of my friends to come here. It's good food, but I think the experience is a 'try it once' type of thing. A friend from out of town came in and they have a car (score!) so we decided to come on a Saturday morning - a little before they opened. We waited about an hour or more in line, but it was a nice day and we got to catch up. We knew we'd be waiting awhile... but finally we arrived inside! I decided to go with a normal hot dog and a specialty, plus duck fat fries. We sat outside in the alley on the side since they have outdoor seating. Don't get me wrong, the food is great. But I think it's more of an ordeal than it's worth to enjoy the tasty hot dogs. Besides being extremely far from my place (I feel like you need a car) and the extremely long line, I might have had too high of expectations. Maybe I just don't really like hot dogs? Maybe it's because my friend was hungover from the previous evening and couldn't really eat the food? Either way, I'm not running back again - but go if you have half a day to spare in the city.
