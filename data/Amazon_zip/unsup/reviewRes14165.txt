Apparently I'm not the only one in Logan Square anticipating the opening of Revolution Brewing. We were here at 8p on Monday night and was quoted a 45 min wait... WTF? It actually only took about 15 minutes to get seated.  To be honest I was hoping for more lounge, bar atmosphere casual hang out areas for groups. Sadly about 85% of Revolution is dedicated to sit down dining... sigh. The beers were good! Not the best, but definitely good. The food was also excellent. The beef stew was amazing! I also tried the arugala and goat cheese salad. Another downside is that everything is priced a little above average. beers are $5 - $7, and meals are $15-$25... I just really really wish it was more of a hang out spot and less of a sit down dinner establish. My own disappointment aside, it's a very welcome addition to Logan Square.
