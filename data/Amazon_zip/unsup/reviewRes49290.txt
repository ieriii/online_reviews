Alliance is a great spot to sit and sip an Inteligencia brew on a Saturday morning and watch the world go by. The cakes are excellent. The cupcakes are even better -- like best in the city (forget that 'cupcake' place in Lakeview). My wife raves about the apple turnovers, though I find some of their pastries to be a bit tough, like they don't use enough butter, at least compared to some of the old school bakeries in the city where you need a lesson in Polish before you order and a cholesterol test before you leave. (See Weber's bakery on Archer).
