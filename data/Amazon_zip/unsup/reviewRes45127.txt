My husband and I took my parents, my brother and his girlfriend to Anteprima as a Christmas gift to my parents. We'd been before and really liked it. Fortunately, it was still very good and impressed my foodie parents. We started with the rabbit sausage, the grilled octupus and the antipasto plate. Everything was very tasty, and there were lots of little, very authentic Italian bites to go around. We shared two salads - the arugula and the fennel salad. The arugula was pretty standard (but very fresh). The fennel salad was excellent - shaved fennel, persimmons, pomegranate seeds, parmesan and a drizzle of fine olive oil. Yum. Everyone liked their main course - we had the sea bass, the bucatini with tuna conserva, the duck leg, the lamb shoulder and the pancetta wrapped venison. All were excellent, but the lamb shoulder really seemed to be the big winner at our table. Desserts were almost all great. The lemon panna cotta is second to none - so delicious. The winter squash dessert was absolutely amazing. Skip the lemon and orange cakes - so, so dry and the one disappointment of the meal. Wine list is extremely reasonably priced with plenty of bottles under $40. We had three bottles of a nice Montepulciano that was right in our price range at $33. Service was good, and we will definitely go back.
