The food here is clearly pretty awesome. Look at the Yelp reviews. I've been GrubHubbing from here for quite a while. Finally had my first in-house experience at the Armitage location & was inspired to post here by how fantastic the customer service experience was. Our server, Raul, was The Best. Funny, conversational, kind, helpful, and super attentive. We went last Tuesday, September 6, and tho I don't know the name of the hosts & bussers that evening, they were fantastic too. Can't wait to go back. Their delivery's so, so good, but interacting w/ the great staff takes this place above & beyond. Plus the music & atmosphere at the restaurant's excellent too. And the food :) Thanks for reading!
