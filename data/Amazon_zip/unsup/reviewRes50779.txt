My all time favorite brunch spot! I've never been here for lunch or dinner so my review can only be of the brunch menu.  First, there is always a line out the door on a Sunday afternoon at Wish Bone, but do not be turned away. Even with a mob of people we waited just 20 minutes or so for a table for two. During our wait I enjoyed an above average Bloody Mary by the bar and had plenty of room so as to not feel crammed. The Brunch itself...I always get the Red Eggs and have begun to crave them on Sundays! At our last visit my gf ordered the crawfish cakes, which were great! I've had the shrimp and grits in the past as well and am a huge fan. The service is always fast and friendly/has been more than willing to make suggestions when called upon. If you love a little bit of a creole kick to your food, give this spot a try. You will not be disappointed!
