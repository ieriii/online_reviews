I thought it was fine. Not great, but fine. I had a grilled vegetable sandwich, and they get points for being willing to do it without peppers. It was pretty tasty!  The waitress highly recommended the red potato side but they were not fabulous... too much white pepper and not enough crispy. I would go back if I was in the neighborhood but probably wouldn't go out of my way for it.
