God bless the people who work here and dealt with the yelper crowd. We descended here one fateful and chilly Sunday evening. Our group went from 15 to 20 to above that, yet they still managed to accommodate us very well. When we finally settled in and finally ordered the fun began. Many came here for the BBQ. They set up these immensely heavy bowls of flaming hot coals, plop a grill pan on and you go at it. Now my table decided not to grill, but everyone else did down the line. We went with bento boxes, bibimbap and Korean stew. Also if you have never dined at any Korean restaurant, here is the deal they give you all these main starting dishes, from seasoned radishes, to almond jelly, to three types of seaweed. Be adventurous and try them, but let me just state, if it is red, it will tend to be spicy hot. Now as every one munched on their grilled meats, I dined on my chicken bento box. Pan fried pot stickers, (gyozas), a salad, tasty chicken, 6 crab sushi rolls, 3 maki rolls and all delicious. Plenty of things to eat for just under $14 bucks. There might be some difficulty in the language barrier, don't let that discourage you from enjoying a good meal here, though next time I think the bibimbap will be calling my name!
