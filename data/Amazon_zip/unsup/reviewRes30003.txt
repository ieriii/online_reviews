So I do eat meat, gasp...I cheat on meat fairly often though to come to Chicago Diner. Mainly because my SO is a vegetarian...but also because I'm lactose intolerant...so if I come here I can have a milkshake, and cheese and more cheese...thanks Vegans! I am sort of longing for a peanut butter chocolate milkshake right now... I also have to say that this is my go-to destination for any traveling Veg/Vegans I know...I seem to know a lot too, so I'm often taking people here as a form of 'Hi welcome to Chicago, here is a cool place to eat'. I only take off one star because instead of a wait/holding area it'd be swell if they just expanded seating year round...the place is entirely too small for such a large rep. I would go on and on about all their choices of food- but honestly, I've not been disappointed with any of their veg/vegan options they have on the menu.
