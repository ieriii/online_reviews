My friend and I have to disagree with many of the reviews; perhaps we were there on an "off" day. Ambiance: 5 stars. The place is dimly lit with candles and has awesome art work on the wall. It has a very "warm" feel. Service: 2.5 stars. We waited about 10 minutes for water and then at the end of our meal, we felt rushed out. Our waiter gave us the check and kept checking back every few minutes even though it was clear we weren't done (still had a half bottle of wine and the bill was off to the side of the table, untouched). Food/Price: 0 stars. The price was indeed far too high (spaghetti is $18.00 for instance). Most items were at least $20. Honestly, I wouldn't have even paid $8 for this meal- I had spaghetti and my friend had salmon. Both of our meals were extremely bland and greasy. We felt sick later that night. I felt like I was drinking vegetable oil, not eating spaghetti. Location: 5 stars. Easy to park on the street. Free parking on the side streets. I wish our food had had some taste, because the place is so cute... but I won't be back.
