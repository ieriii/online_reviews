I've become a very big fan of Ethiopian food in the last few years. I don't know what took me so long to try it because I vividly remember passing a few Ethiopian restaurants on a regular basis when still living in Evanston heading down Broadway towards Lakeshore. Perhaps I should blame the media that portrays Ethiopia as a country with only malnourished citizens, not a people who have crafted an amazing (mainly vegetarian) cuisine! For the food, the Vegetarian Messob for two was amazing. For $22 we got 6 hearty sized portions of deliciousness. A little more detailed: -Vegetarian Sambussa had the most amazing sauce on the side. -Gomen was amazing (I love collard greens). -Ye-Misir Wot (spicy) was definitely the best and most interesting of them all. it had the most complex flavors and offered a nice heat that the others seemed to be lacking. -Kay Seerena Carrot Tibs were excellently sweet. -Tikle Gomen was good, but not great. It offered a welcome contrast to the other dishes, but as I could've guessed, cabagge and carrots alone, aren't enough to carry an entree. -Shiro was quite good. I love me some legumes! -Kik Alitcha was tasty (we asked that they make it spicey instead of mild) Despite showing up near the end of the night, we weren't rushed out the door even though they were closing. Most American restaurants wouldn't be so polite to stragglers...
