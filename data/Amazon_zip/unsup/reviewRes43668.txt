PRIVATE DINNING REVIEW: Classic old school chicago style steak house. Our group was led to a large private room in the back. Evening stated out with an couple of appetizer towers (BRUSCHETTA and CRISPY CALAMARI SERVED WITH MARINARA & SPICY AIOLI) http://www.yelp.com/biz_ Both were pretty decent. Our Choice of Salad : We went with the CHOPHOUSE SALAD http://www.yelp.com/biz_. Pretty run of the mill. For Entree we had the choice of the: SEASAME CRUSTED SEARED AHU TUNA STEAKhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rnjz2KNgsQ2YaC_kjeuuAQ?select=dWZtZ47mtLexpHsjE67hkg Slightly over cooked, but the seasame sauce as actually done quite well. DIJON & HERB CRUSTED NEW ZEALAND LAMB CHOPS... sorry no picture. Although this seemed to be the favorite out of the people who got it. 12 OZ FILET MIGNON with BEARNAISE SAUCE http://www.yelp.com/biz_ - seemed ok but no one really raved about it. Sides BROCCOLI FONDUE with GOUDA - http://www.yelp.com/biz_ People couldn't stop saying how suprising good this was. BACON & SCALLION SMASHED POTATOES - This was decent as well. Dessert was KEY LIME PIE -http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rnjz2KNgsQ2YaC_kjeuuAQ?select=UfLN6v9BsnJDmlNytNc1Xg which really looked and tasted like a cheese cake.  SERVICE was very good. Well attended and not overly in your way. Was working on something in the lobby and server offered to bring my salad out for me. They also brought out some Mushrooms and a Massively Mutatated Potato for our lactose intollernt friend since all our sides had dairy. Overall an enjoyable night.
