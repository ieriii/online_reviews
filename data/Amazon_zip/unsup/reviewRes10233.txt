This is one of those love it or kinda love it but never hate it places. It's like that friend who flirts with your chick, threw up on your carpet during your birthday party and always shows up fifteen minutes late to everything. Douchey but you still love em. There's enough praises about the pizza and the brews but one of the main things I love is that it's a great place to bring big groups (6+ people) when you wanna hang out in Wicker Park and sometimes do it at a moment's notice. It's a big space, the beer selection is great, there's games on the screens and the crowd is pretty diverse so that really does make the hour to two hour wait bearable. Their Golden Arm is a great light beer to drink in the summer heat and by the time you sit down for your pizza you won't be (too) shitfaced. You can also make reservations a couple weeks ahead but if you're like me and dial up your posse at a whim then you wanna get your night started here.
