Probably more like 4 stars for a land locked, non-sushi town, but 2 stars if this was SF or NY/LA so I guess 3 is fair. Decent Toro sashimi, decent Uni, and just okay for the rest. The escolar nigiri was acutally very good, and had shaved black truffle on top. I found this to be a nice change and tasty combination (earth and fish). Ambiance was nice and decor was impressive.
