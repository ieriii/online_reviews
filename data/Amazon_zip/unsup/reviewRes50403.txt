Our new favorite brunch spot! The starter beignets were amazing. Fresh, warm, sweet. Definitely an upgrade from the Ann Sather cinnamon rolls (and we love those). Our party ordered the leek and mushroom omelet with goat cheese, the Spanish eggs (forgot the name, starts with an M), and the eggs Benedict. Note on the EB: ordered the regular style (with Canadian bacon) because the fried green tomato version was out of season. Will have to come back for that one in the summer. Excellent EB, especially because it came on popovers instead of English muffins. Coffee is Delicious and in large mugs. Huge selection of teas and even sweet teas. Really digging the creole French style of this place. Very short wait to be seated and the service was great- not slow, not too pushy, we arrived around 1pm and ate at our leisure. We couldn't believe the place was not crazy considering how great the food was. Perhaps it's the fact that it's 15 degrees outside... we'll definitely be back for brunch and likely to check out dinner.
