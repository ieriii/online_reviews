We stumbled upon this restaurant since it was directly across the street from the Westin we were staying at in Chicago. It's a great place; open until late on Friday nights, so we were able to grab a bite when we got into town around 11 pm.  Wonderful selection of wine flights and the first place where I've seen great cheese flights too. During our 3 day weekend trip, we actually went back every day...great place to grab a little bite or drink. I first tried the Express Yourself flight with lighter, sweeter whites and really enjoyed the Gewurztraminer in the flight. In addition to the cheese flight, we ordered an apricot fig side dish with truffle honey. Truffled honey is amazing!! My husband and I could not stop adding that to every bite, whether it be of cheese or cracker. The second time we went back I tried the Shiraz/Syrah flight, which was good, but a little heavy with cheese.  We also had dinner there one night. They had a dessert "flight" - 4 types of chocolate desserts were very tasty and not overwhelmingly sweet. We only sat in the more casual side of the restaurant (by the cheese bar) and liked the environment than the look of the more formal dining side.
