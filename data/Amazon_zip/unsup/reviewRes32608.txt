Nationally known as one of the best vegan/vegetarian spots, period. I have been coming to the Diner since moving here 3 years ago. Great atmosphere and ok prices. The food got a little boring a while back (from overexposure, perhaps) and I decided to look elsewhere in Chicago for my vegan outings. Recently, with the addition of Chef Kim Gracen last year, the food is outstanding! She has totally revamped both the dinner and brunch menu, without tampering with the classics, like the Radical Reuben (now trademarked). I went to the Diner before seeing Horsefeathers at Schubas and it made the night! IF you got bored with the menu in the past, give it a try again, the new stuff is great!
