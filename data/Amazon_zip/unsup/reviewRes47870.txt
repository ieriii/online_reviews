Disaster... This place was awful. On the pretentious meter it was an 11 out of 10, waited 15 minutes while standing at the bar for a drink. I wish I could say the beer was over priced, but it wasn't. The caliber of individuals there was snotty and extra snotty. The atmosphere was crowded, and music was not good either. Wouldn't go back if you paid me.
