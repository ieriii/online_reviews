Not that this place needs another review...but here goes..Service was good, but not outstanding. We ordered the fried olives and zucchini for a starter. It was good, crisp, and not oily. I then had a salad and we ordered the mussels. The salad was a bowl of mixed greens. Seriously, for $9? Pass on any of the salads. The mussels where very good. I recommend them. Finally, we finished our meal with the main course - fish and chips. Excellent! Best Fish and Chips I have ever had. Overall, a four stars.
