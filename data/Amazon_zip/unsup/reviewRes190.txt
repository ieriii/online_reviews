I'm not sure where to start with Alinea, honestly. My boyfriend randomly took me here for a late-night dinner the night before I left for a weekend trip without him. I knew all about Alinea. I knew I was tired after a long day. I knew it was a terribly rainy night and I looked horrible. I also knew how much of his paycheck would go into the meal. Needless to say, I was pretty angry at his extravagance (though I knew he did it all in love), and I was not at all in the mood for a fancy shmancy dinner like this. So dinner definitely started off on the wrong foot. Luckily, by the time course 6 came around, I had gotten over myself and I started to feel like a kid in toy heaven. Actually, I felt like a judge on Food Network's Iron Chef and I was LOVING it. The bf, though, was scarfing every morsel down as if his life depended on it. That kind of made me sad, but I didn't let it get to me too much and I proceeded to smell, observe, and savor every course with absolute delight. And some of those courses were seriously unique and amazing. Like super wow. And our servers were sooo kind, so professional, and so hospitable. After 4 hours (a little past 1 a.m.) and 22 courses later, I was completely full and content and ready for our final dessert course of the evening. Let's just say that this dessert course was extra special. Because it came with an engagement ring. Haha. Who woulda thunk it? What started out as the most imperfect night ended in the most perfect way. :) In summary, Alinea will forever remain close to my stomach and heart.
