I've been going to Lao Sze Chuan for 10 years and the food has been consistently delicious, but I've noticed a decline in the service of late. I'd heard rumors of this decline in service for awhile now, but until recently hadn't experienced it myself. Recently I dined her with my wife, son and 2 friends, so a group of 4 adults and one toddler. We ordered a bunch of dishes, including appetizers and were enjoying our meal when, after about 1 hour, one of the servers very rudely came over an asked us if we were finished. I understand the restaurant is popular and they like to turn over the tables quickly, but this was completely unacceptable. We had not been lingering at our table at all, we had ordered promptly and eaten out food at a normal pace. Furthermore, if the restaurant wants to politely move a group along, they could easily ask "would you like anything else?" , "will you be having desert this evening?", or even just "please let me know if you'd like anything else". All of these statements have the effect of gently suggesting the group order more or begin to wrap up their dinner. This wasn't the only issue, but just an example. As I said at the beginning, I've been going here for years. so I'm not ready to write them off completely, but it is disappointing. Rating the food alone, I'd still give them 5 stars, but with the service it really drops down, I just don't know if I can trust bringing a new group here, because they might insult my guests. Hopefully they will get this stuff straightened out and realize it isn't only about the food, but also the experience, especially with long time patrons.
