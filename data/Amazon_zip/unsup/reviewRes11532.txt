I reeeeeally recommend the red pizza, with garlic as an added topping. It was SO SO SO good. However, if you're going on a Saturday night, and want to sing live-band karaoke...be prepared to bribe the karaoke host. I put my request in, and waited 2 hours (till closing time at 2am) to hear my name called, and they apparently "ran out time" and couldn't play mine. But I saw the host being slipped 5ers all night, soooooo.... haha. just sayin.
