7 of my friends and I went here on a Sat night. The sushi was fresh and the food was very tasty. We ordered a bunch of dishes, some of them being short ribs, chilean sea bass, chicken adobo, steak tenderloin, hamachi, escerot w black truffle, crab tempura. We also ordered martini's and other drinks. Finally we ordered a bunch of desserts like taro bread pudding, chocolate cake, ridiculous sweet plate, chefs special dessert. All of us liked everything we had. There were a bunch of 'wow this tastes sooo good' reactions! There was nice ambiance and the decor looked very trendy. The customers looked very stylish and there was a lot of good looking people that ate there. It's located in the restaurant district of River North. I was afraid of the cost since we ordered so much food and drinks but it actually wasn't that bad. I would go broke eating there every day but it's definitely worth it once in a while.
