Went to Nuevo Leon last week for a friend's casual birthday dinner after reading the reviews... they were so right! This place is great value, good food, and you can't beat BYOB... I had the tamales and they were delicious. The refried beans are EXCELLENT as well. Plenty of chips, salsa, and little appetizers to go around as well. The staff was very accommodating to us, even in a large party without a reservation. They even turned out all the lights and brought out a little cake with a candle and sang to my friend! Great atmosphere. This place doesn't look like anything much, but it's great food for your money and definitely a good option in Pilsen.
