I stopped there on a Tuesday night, and it was surprisingly busy. I was more interested in their beer, but ended up getting their "white" pizza with basil and mushrooms and thought it was pretty good. As for their beers I recommend their Kolsch. It's fantastic (think it was a Great American Beer Festival and a World Beer Cup winner). I also had their Wingnut DIPA which was pretty solid, as well as their Dysfunctionale. Decent selections overall. Does get noisy as they've got high ceilings. They've got several TVs for sports and good bar seating.
