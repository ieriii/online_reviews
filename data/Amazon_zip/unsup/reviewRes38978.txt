Really, this place was so outstanding I spent three visits there on a 4-day trip to Chicago. All of their menus are fun, creative, and filled with quality ingredients. Their beer selection is great, prices are not bad, and they really know how to stock some great variety even with limited space. The cocktails aren't the best I've ever had, but they're still quality, and worth what you're paying. Every bit of food I saw or had there looked like the greatest thing ever put on a plate. For a small, neighborhoody place, they really go out of their way with presentation.  The only meal I had was brunch, and it rivaled my favorite places anywhere. Chicago has a local natural foodie-doodie bacon a la Benton's, and, while it was good, great even, I've still not had anything that rivals the product that Knox County, Tennessee should be most famous for. My companion and I had a great meal, got seconds on the delicious fizzy brunch cocktails, and then moved to the bar to keep sampling from their very adventurous list of libatory (did I just make that word up? If so, I'm keeping it.) ingredients.  Well worth the trip out of downtown Chicago. Plus, they have a small selection of hip B&B style rooms at pretty reasonable prices. Next time I go up to IL, I may never leave this building!
