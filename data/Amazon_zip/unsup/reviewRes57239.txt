So everyone I know raved and raved about the Bad Apple and how amazing it was and I've gotta say, I was not that impressed. Maybe it was the burgers I chose to order, but it was not all that great. I've definitely had better. I will say that the service, their fries, and their incredible selection of beer which tends to be a weakness for me was fabulous. I tend to always go with my trusty ole Allagash White Ale, but I'm always up for trying something new there. I definitely want to go back cause I definitely see potential, it could've just been an off night with the wrong burger. However, I don't think I'd be willing to wait as long as we did (30+ minutes after 8p.m.) for a burger. It's no Kuma's.
