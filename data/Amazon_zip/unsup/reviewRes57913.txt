I don't know much about Hungarian food but it seems that Little Bucharest serves traditional dishes with a twist. We started with the smoked salmon appetizer, which was quite salty but pretty good. The potato pancakes were the star of the appetizer -they were more crepe like with a wonderful texture - yet tasted like they were made completely out of potatoes. My husband had the goulash, which was a well done version of braised beef in a tomato based sauce accompanied by gnocchi  We both loved the chicken schnitzel even more, even though it is basically fried chicken patties. But these were perfectly crispy and sat on a bed of nicely pan crisped horseradish spaetzel with a little red pepper cream sauce. Based on how great the potato pancakes were, we decided to get chocolate crepes for dessert since we figured the chef knew how to make a crepe. They did not disappoint, in fact, my mouth is watering as I write this. The manager comes around to all the tables multiple times and is quite a character. They also had live musicians playing the nigh we were there, a little loud but at least they were good. Overall a great place for a low-key night and a hearty meal of comfort food.
