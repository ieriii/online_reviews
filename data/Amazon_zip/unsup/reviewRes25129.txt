I like this place. The food is good, you can sit outside, it's byob...it's the kind of restaurant you can picture coming to multiple nights a week. During the colder part of Chicago spring, they even had heat lamps, so you could pretend it was spring-y enough to sit outside...which was much appreciated. Last time, I had some tilapia with yuca and fried plantains and a cabbage etc. salad...all of which was delicious (and fed me the next day, since the plate was mildly overwhelming). Be hungry when you go!
