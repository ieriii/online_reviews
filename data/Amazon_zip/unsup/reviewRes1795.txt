I feel silly writing a review for Hot Doug's - because everyone knows how amazing it is and those who don't live in another state. But regardless, it's always a treat to come here. I've only had the pleasure to go on weekdays, when I've been off work for whatever reason. One attempt to go on the weekend resulted in a quick drive-by, after seeing the line wrapped around the building and the temp being around -19.  Doug is incredibly friendly. The staff is incredibly friendly. The food is heaven, pure tasty heaven. I always make sure to get a special or the game of the week (ever eat rattlesnake?).  I was going to give 4 stars, only because the hours are so short and the space is so small, but I can't imagine a Hot Doug's open later than 4:30PM or a second location. It's all just a part of the HD charm.
