OMG. Finally came here after hearing/reading about it. Very glad I did. This place is insane--in a good way! They have a great beer list, both homemade and on draft/bottled. The menu consists of appetizers--pretty standard, flatbread pizzas, burgers(both vegetarian and not), pasta, etc. I got the tofu sandwich with fries. You can choose a side with a sandwich from blue cheese mashed potatoes, fries, reg./caesar salad. Pretty awesome if I do say so myself.. The sandwich was very very flavorful, with a great tomato spread. I never really get tofu anymore, it was pretty filling (but the bread was a bit greasy). The sides/ingredients that they paired with their sandwiches was really simplistic but original. Waiter was attentive and the place was super clean. I really dig this place and I will def hit it up more during the summer!
