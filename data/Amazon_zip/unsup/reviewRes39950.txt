Sometimes you have to sacrifice service for good food. The waittresses are slow to refill panchan and water. Parking sucks. But the food is so delicious. Nothing beats grilled meats. It's served with seasoned slivered scallions and lettuce to create wraps. My favorite panchan is the pickled daikon radish, potato with mayo (??), and that scary red cabbage kimchee thing. Can't remember if this place has stone pot rice, but I think there is... I kind of mix up Korean places in my head. Be prepared to have your coat reek of grilled meats.
