Yum Yum YUM!!I have been eating superdawg since I was bornI love it so much!People say the fries are nothing special..But they are the best i have ever tasted..The boxes they come in make my laugh, because everytime I go and get a superdawg, I have to eat all the fries first if I am in the car or else it will be too messy.Its kind of annoying because the change there hotdogs a lot, like sometimes they are thinner and then they are..Huge! But all in all they are really good.Its a really fun place...Ahh I want one right now..But I am too lazy to get one..haha. Don't put ketchup on this hotdog..I thnk it ruins the experience..hah. and when you order a superdawg, don't call it a hotdog, because most or the time they will be like..What is that??haha I love this place
