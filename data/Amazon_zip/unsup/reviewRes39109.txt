WARNING!!!!! EXTREMELY RUDE! If you enjoy rudeness and purposely being hung up on when you call them to inquire about services and specials, this place is for you. Ok. I speak the Korean language well enough that I can fool some people into thinking I'm fluent (depending on the subject matter). I called this place and chose to speak English because I had a simple question. In the middle of my inquiry, the lady stopped me and told me, "You come here and look. I'm busy". Then immediately hung up the phone before I could say anything else. WHAT!!! GRRR. IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND ENGLISH, PLEASE ASK FOR SOME ASSISTANCE! I was about to stop and switch languages when I realized she might not understand my question. But Nooooo. She'd rather be rude and hang up then make the effort to understand or get help. No joke. I was so angry that I almost called back to ***** the lady out in Korean. They should be receiving a letter from the BBB relatively shortly. Whatever, like that is going to do anything. Don't go here if you can't speak Korean. You will most likely not get the best treatment. I can speak and will choose not eat here.
