"love the logo; the beer and food must be good, right?"   RIGHT!! i admit, the reasons i was first drawn to RBC are twofold: (1) to try some new local brew & (2) i just like their logo. fortunately, the logo delivered. the atmosphere felt cozy and inviting and didn't feel like they were trying too hard to fit a certain image. the anti-hero IPA was great; it doesn't punch you in the face with bitterness yet it definitely lingers on the palate. i'm looking forward to trying the wheaty wit on a warm sunny day. being a saturday night, we did wait at the bar for quite a while but time passed quickly. a warm environment, friendly bartender, 3-1/2 beers and an order of buffalo wings later, we were seated. after ordering more beer, i got the fish and chips which came with a great remoulade and spicy slaw. i wish the fish came next to the frites instead of on top because they lost most of their yummy crispyness. overall though, stellar bar food. the standard reuben & tempeh reuben ordered by friends were also big winners. sadly our bellies were too full to taste any of their desserts (my now empty belly is longing for their house-made sorbet). so why not five stars? well, nothing totally blew me away (the frites might if they weren't so soggy) and they really need to work on turning tables faster. but it's a great place that anybody who likes beer and wants to just chill with friends should check out.
