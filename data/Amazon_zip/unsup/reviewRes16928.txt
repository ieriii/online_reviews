What a great lounge! The wait to get inside wasn't very fun, but once you're in there, the atmosphere is amazing. Not ideal for meeting new people. PERFECT for catching up with friends. Those awesome chairs easily make private clusters. Also, the staff will help you find a drink that you will like, even if it's off the menu. Definitely try to get in before 10pm.
