Outstanding food and a really fun take on tapas. Love the big communal tables and, on a cool summer evening, hanging out here was fun. Spot on with the wait time quoted, just enough time to share a great Rioja. Good wine pricing, they have worked hard to have good quality and approachable pricing...
