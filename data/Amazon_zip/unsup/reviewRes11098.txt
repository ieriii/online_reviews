Heeding the past reviews about avoiding dining here on the weekend, I went midweek with friends from out of town. We were promptly seated and served. It was actually my first time here as well so I hoped everything lived up everyone's hype. Luckily, things did. Enjoying nearly everything red velvet, I ordered the red velvet hotcakes and loved how they were glazed with cream cheese. (Cream cheese over butter cream for red velvet any day.) I had a bite of my friend the hotcakes with the bacon bits mixed in and bananas on top. Though I don't recall the exact name of the dish, I do recall the nice blend of salty and sweet. I didn't have the third dish which was an egg white omelet with portobello mushrooms, but it looked like a huge burrito so it must've been filled with yummy goodness. We also ordered a side of the Thai chicken sausage which was just ok - I've had better chicken sausage elsewhere. No complaints about service. Our server was nice and attentive. The space was nice and big, though I would've liked it to be brighter inside so I could really see our great meals.
