I try to like Piece. I really try. But it's just okay. I had been to Piece once before, and thought it was okay. We ordered pizza with spinach on it, and the spinach was not fresh. It was definitely frozen or canned. Last week, Piece was on Check Please, and they raved about the spinach pizza and how fresh the toppings were. My fiance and I went back again last night, we didn't order the spinach, we had tomato and chicken, but it was just okay. The beer was better than the pizza, for sure.
