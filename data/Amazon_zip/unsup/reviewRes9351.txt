Went here last night for Chef Week and i'm wondering why I haven't tried this place sooner. Really great food and a really great atmosphere. The lower level was really nice and had a good vibe to it on a Saturday night. The spring rolls were nice and fresh and very good. The bao sate was delicius too, filet mignon in aspicy sauce with yams and green beans. I would definitely come back for a romantic dinner or Intimate night out.
