Finally an adult place in Wicker Park. Unbelievably knowledgeable staff, the best drinks in the city, and they even have Lagunitas IPA. If you don't love this place, no biggie. There's 45 other bars within walking distance that would be happy to serve you a PBR and an attitude. Excellent atmosphere, the music is low enough to talk over, and soon, there will be a dress code to keep everyone classy. I love the no-cell rule. And yes, this is a terrible place to pick someone up, but perhaps the best date place in the city, esp for a sexy, brilliant economist/ yoga guru/ hilarious writer, such as my dream girl, Jesy. :)
