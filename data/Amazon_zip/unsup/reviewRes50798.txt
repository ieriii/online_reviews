Delicious food, fun atmosphere. I came here for the first time with my aunt probably 5 years ago. It was one of my first adventures down into the city from Evanston. After a long trip on the L it was refreshing to end up here, at Wishbone. I re-visited 2 weeks ago with a group of friends and was not disappointed. I ordered the black bean patties, they were great. And luckily I changed my cornbread to biscuits at the last minute. Not that cornbread isn't delicious, but biscuits are a sure thing. The service was friendly and we didn't have to wait on a Saturday morning. I highly recommend!
