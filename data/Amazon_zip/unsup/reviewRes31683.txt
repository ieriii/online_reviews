Went to Sunda on a Frida night. Everything was delicious. Went last minute around 8, had an hr wait, so we opted to eat at the bar. Each bartender was fast, friendly & made gr8 recommends. The drinks were really good, a little too good since I spilled one across the bar. The place was packed. A few posers who liked to cram around the bar area, but overall very cool space.
