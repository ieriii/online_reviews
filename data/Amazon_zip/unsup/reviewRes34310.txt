Wow! I had always heard amazing things about this place!! My grandparents had came to Chicago to visit so I made reservations here because they love good Italian food! My grandfathers love of food is hilarious he is a critic everywhere he eats. He had the gnocchi and said it was the best gnocchi he had ate since his mother was raising him in Italy. That's the first time I have heard him say anything that amazing about food!! We all loved the calamari - it was not chewy at all and great taste! There were four of us for dinner; each tried each others dishes and loved everything we tried! We finished off with a couple desserts and to our surprise they were also amazing! And to top the night off the hosts, servers, food runners, and bussers were all nice as well!! Great place!
