I absolutely love Irazu, and don't go there enough (especially for living 2 blocks away.) I've had the Costa Rican Sandwich, the Plaintains, the Civeche (yeah, I totally butchered that spelling...sorry), and the Oatmeal Shake. Since there is usually a 20-25 minute wait, especially when it is nice out, it's not a bad idea to put your name in, walk to the liquor store at Milwaukee and Western and buy a six pack to take back with you. By the time you get back your table is almost ready!
