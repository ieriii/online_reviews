Went for brunch and it was truly wonderful. We shared a few plates, but the most memorable was the maple-syrup braised bacon. This might be one of the most delicious things I've eaten. Ever. The rest of our food was also wonderful, but totally eclipsed by the bacon. 4 out of 5 because the service seemed a little inconsistent.
