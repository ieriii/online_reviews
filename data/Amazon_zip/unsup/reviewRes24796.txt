Perfect place to take a date or for an anniversary! I loved it! My fianc and I went here for my birthday. It was Christmas time and it was so beautifully decorated! I could not have asked for a better place. The hostess was sweet and there is complimentary coat check. In terms of the menu, each person picks the combination that they want. I got the Beef and lobster and my fianc got the connoisseur. When you first order, they come out with a pot of cheese and stuff to dip it with. I can't eat cheese, but according to my fianc, he thought it was orgasmic. I just ate the food sans cheese. I ordered their passion fruit martini and it was good. Not too much alcohol, but it will creep up on you! When our food came out, it was all on a plate with vegetables like potatoes and green peppers. They told us how long to cook what and what not to do. Obviously, don't use your eating fork to cook the raw meat! Salmonella = bad! The only thing I didn't like was that I don't think their cooking times were accurate. I feel like the pieces were super big and needed to be cooked longer unless you like things bloody. The chocolate fondue was entertaining because they lit it on fire for you to first toast your marshmellows. They give you fruit, pound cake, and graham crackers. I was so full at the end that I barely touched the dessert. Surprisingly, the food seemed small, but it completely filled me up. The service was fabulous! The people were very attentive and helpful. Even offered to take a picture for us without asking. I highly recommend this place for some romantic memories!
