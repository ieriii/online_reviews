I figured that I would wait until the next time I visited here to yelp about it. Well I was back recently and it remains my favorite Greek in Chicago. The saganaki and gyros are top notch standard dishes. This place is always flowing with people and it is always enjoyable. They have free valet too if you need to drive.
