This place is AWESOME. Every time we visit Chicago, we visit the Chicago Diner. Great service compliments THE BEST selection of vegan and vegetarian food. All of the old favorites are there, and better than you remember. If we could make out with any sandwich, it would be the Chicago Diner's Reuben. The Philly Cheesesteak gets an open mouth kiss, and the Dagwood gets one on the lips too. We would totally marry the sweet potato fries and kale salad. And every once in a while we have an affair with the amazing soy milk shakes. This is the type of place that you have to go to not expecting to talk much: when your mouth isn't full, you'll probably be making awkward mmmm noises and making bedroom faces at your plate. Or maybe that's just us. Go! Everything is great!
