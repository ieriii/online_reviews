I've been here twice - both times have had excellent food (ceviche, Spanish cheese/meat platter, any fish special, and Mama Mendez' Arroz con Mariscos is out of this world). My family/friends have also given great reviews of the lamb chop and skirt steak. Really can't go wrong with the food here - it's delicious, very creative and different. Flavors are amazing.  I took off one star because it's not the cheapest place, and the drinks could be way better. Not a big fan of mojitos, and the sangria is overpriced and way too sweet.
