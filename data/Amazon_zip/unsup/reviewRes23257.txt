Dude, this place is awesome! Right after drinking the sweetened cardamom infused Turkish coffee, i went next door and bought a copper pot so i can indulge somewhat similarly at home (im sure that mine wont turn out NEARLY the same) We pretty much always do one savory one sweet - but choosing a sweet was too difficult! they have SOOO many options! We opted for a mix of the apricot and raspberry jams and I'm SO glad we did - my sister makes her own jams so im generally pretty picky about jam quality, but this was was definitely up to par! For savory we got an egg, ricotta, and Algerian lamb crepe - loved it as well!!! the spices were to die for - i definitely cant make this one at home! then as if that wasn't enough we got a cup of fruit drenched in orange blossom water and covered in crushed pistachios...everything was just TOO delicious! definitely will be back here to try the other sweet crepes - nutella, dulce de leche, and cajete were on the list of options - as well as a blueberry jam and brie crepe? I mean, its hard to choose. Ambiance is gorgeous with beautiful algerian lamps and tapestries - definitely a small space but the service was impeccable and it was not over crowded (meanwhile ann sather's across the street had a huge line but i would choose this over ann sather's personally). NOMMMYYYYYYYY and ORIGINAL - YAAAAY for yet another awesome bfast spot in Andersonville - worth my bike ride over on a 90 degree day :) OH P.S. - Its BYOB AND they have freshly squeezed orange juice :)
