Location was good and price was low but I guess thats why they say you get what you pay for. Small, dated rooms. Super small "suite" that was hardly soundproof. Had a very difficult time checking in since the room was booked under my friend's father's name. If you plan on sharing a room, the desk required names of each person staying in room in order to obtain room keys, just for a heads up.
