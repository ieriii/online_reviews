First, I passed up this restaurant while living in Andersonville, because it didn't look "hip enough" while I was living there. What a HUGE mistake -- I recently was taken there by a friend, and was so plesantly surprised. The food was OUTSTANDING -- portions were great, ingredients tasted fresh, and the menu had a great variety. The wine list was lovely as well.....One of the best meals I've had in a long long time. The 5th star is due to the wonderful server we had, Maria. My friend and I went in on Mother's Day -- they were definitely busy. At the end of our meal, my friend and I each had 1/2 glass of wine left. Maria left us alone, allowing us to finish our wine at our leisure....the check wasn't presented until after we were finished. What a treat -- on a busy day, not to feel as though we were being rushed out...who does that? It was so greatly appreciated. I'll definitely be back to sample more of the amazing food and enjoy the wonderful service.
