I love this place!I had my first oyster at the Shaw's Bar (never actually ate at the restaurant) and I have been a regular ever since. I probably go once a month (it gets pretty expensive once you order a bottle of wine and few dozen oysters), but it is well worth it.. I always order the smaller oysters, I discovered they usually are tastier. Be aware that sometimes it gets very crowded, there is a waiting line, and also I don't think they take reservations (at the bar). Some nights they have live music, which gets loud and barely able to communicate. So if you're not into that kind of stuff, make sure to call and go when there is no music. I can't wait to go back next month!
