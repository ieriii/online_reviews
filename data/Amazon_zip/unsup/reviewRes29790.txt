Girlfriends wanted to come back to this oh so convenient for us all location and I didn't fight it. This has the hipster vibe which so often disappoints me. Yes, the decor is very cool and the people watching is fun but the service stinks and is not at all friendly and the food is just, well, it's thai food. Last time I tried something a little different and hated it. This time I stuck with pad thai which I knew I would like - because I always like pad thai. And sure enough it was a good plate of pad thai. No better than any other thai place, but good nonetheless. I wish they had given me a lime wedge as I like a little acid. So I will upgrade it to an a-ok but nothing more. I guess you can get sucked into the atmosphere of the place, bring in your own beer and wine and feel more like you are having "a night out" vs just a take-out Thai type place. Just don't come here thinking you are getting the best Thai food in the city of Chicago which I did the first time, believing the hype. It's good, it's not great.
