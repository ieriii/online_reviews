Probably the best place to go for a ten course meal! Money well spent at Sprout. From the deconstructed English pea soup to the very well paired glasses of vino that were brought to the table by our server, every bite was delectable! I can't wait to return! Although, pricey at $145- per person a ten course meal with ten different wine pairings is exactly where I would like my money to be! ( more my fiance,Ted's, since he took me there for my birthday dinner!)
