Pretty God-danged good. I cannot say that in any other day of my life have I eaten 4 and a half hot dogs and/or sausages. Selma Hayek - grilled, a little too charred for my taste, but yummy - 3 stars Mandarin chicken sausage with siracha mustard - sweet and tangy, mixed with heat - 4 stars Hot Doug - Chicago style greatness - 5 stars Foie gras dog - next time, i'm having it steamed and with no sea salt, but 5 stars Lamb and cognac dog with peppercorn cheese - really really cheesy! had to brush some off, but great sauce! 5 stars. ....I cant wait to go back and try the rest!
