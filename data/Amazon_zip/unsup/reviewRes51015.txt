OK, I've really tried with this place. It has steadily gone downhill, with each experience being one star less that the previous visit. This past visit will be my final one. The place is never ever busy for brunch. However, service has gotten slower and slower. The servers are slower and less attentive. The kitchen is slower. And the food that used to be so good...it sucks now. I'm a very bad cook...and now I'd be right at home in their kitchen. The Hollandaise sauce was vinegary, eggs were cold, crab cakes way too salty, and the popovers were stale! They've stopped trying, so I'll stop going.
