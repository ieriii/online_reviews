Came here for coworkers going away party and my impressions are: Decor - Looks just like barn where the table we were seated at was enclosed off with wooden doors. It was funky, but in a good fun humor way. I liked it. Service - The service was spectacular. Even though they were really busy, our waitress did a really good job making sure our orders were quickly taken, water refilled and generally taken care of. Food - The food came a little slow but when it did come, it was delicious. I like how they served one plate at a time family style so my group of four can all try the dish and savoir one at a time. Although, the table couldn't fit but more than 2 anyhow. It's really loud here but if you don't mind that, definitely worth a check at least once. I'll be coming back with a group of 4 or less!
