I ate here on the weekend and had the greatest time. When I walked in I was pissed about the 45 minute wait for two people, but now that I have experienced the place I will book my table in advance!The food was delectable. The special ciopino was very tasty. My date had the duck, a recommendation from our amazing server, and she was more than pleased. I have to thank our server, Josiah, for talking her into the duck because it earned me some points on our first date! Not only did he explain the dishes for us in a great way, but he kept us entertained even though I could tell he was really busy. I thought he was hilarious but also really knowledgeable about the restaurant and definitely convinced us to come again.  I don't know why everyone is complaining about the service---I thought it was superb. Everyone who helped me was great and seemed in wonderful spirits. A cute redhead with big ol' earrings brought by our beers at one point when our server was busy and took the time to laugh it up with us. She even convinced us to try some of the whiskey cocktails, something I would never buy, but turned out delicious! All the service seemed perky like that and they all seemed to be having a good time together. It made us feel welcome and because of that we had a great time.
