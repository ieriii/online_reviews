I was lucky and tried Sushi X for the first time for a private dinner party. The owners shut down the restaurant just for us and kept the food coming! We had a variety of appetizers. The Asian pot roast was delish. It was covered in black bean brown sauce and came with a large scoop of fluffy rice. The hibachi scallops were also delish but only came with 5 scallops--and a large scoop of rice. I couldn't quite put my finger on the ingredients in the yellow sauce, but it was nothing like I've tasted before. The panko crusted chicken also had a lot of flavor, which I was surprised about. The crust was the same crust you find on tonkatsu pork cutlets. Onto the maki rolls: we had several of the "neo" and "mega" rolls, which are regular rolls on steroids. Like previous reviewers have mentioned, they are BIG but mostly filled with rice and other ingredients that aren't fish. They're at least 2.5" in diameter and definitely a mouthful. You can't really not take it in one bite without making a mess. Many were doused in white and red dressings/sauces, which disappointed me, and many had tempura crunchies, which I also am not a fan of. But my favorite was one that had prosciutto on top (named "five-o"?), which made the roll a little salty and chewy on its own. And the "crab rangoon" roll was warm and definitely tasted like crab rangoon! I think they use real soft shell crab for it. Overall, Sushi X is a small, intimate restaurant that maybe seats 40. For the price, it seems a little pricey (avg $15 for large rolls and avg $9 for appetizers), but it truly is a lot of food and a lot of rice. If you're not adventurous, this may be the spot for you, especially if you have a hearty appetite for rice with everything. However, I like my sushi restaurants without the frills and elaborate ingredients. Not sure if I'll be coming back again, but it was a good dining experience. And BYOB!
