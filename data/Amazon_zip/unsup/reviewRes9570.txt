So we were celebrating our first anniversary and wanted a romantic restaurant...this was a great choice. My first impression walking in was negative b/c it is a very fishy smelling joint and I HATE fish, hate smelling it even more. But I was won over by an interesting and unique menu. I understand this is a French Vietnamese place, however, I didn't see much of a French influence at all...I had the Chicken curry and it was outstanding. The chicken ravioli appetizer was also a huge winner....my husband had all seafood so I have no idea what it was like, but he loved his dishes as well. It was tres romantique and I guess that is really all I cared about.
