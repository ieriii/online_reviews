Upon arrival this is a really sharp looking place. I was so hoping to fall in love with it, but it fell way below the mark, even with the understanding it just opened. The service was very slow, and paid no attention to detail; coffee was hardly kept to the brim, it took forever to get any requests we had, and they never manicured our table...or even bussed plates as I stacked them neatly on the end of the table. My corn tortilla "casserole" came out ice cold in the middle, and when sent back to get it warmed up, it took over 20 minutes to get it back...and when we already waited for over 20 minutes for our breakfast, I hardly think that is fair. When asking the owner for anything, he ignored our request and tried to pawn it off on the server(please note all the owners/managers hardly knew how to serve and paid no attention to anything in the room other than wondering around)...she then dropped the ball on it anyhow. Amazing that you have more than enough hired hands to do things for your guests, and no one is managing them to do what they are supposed to....SERVE! We paid $50.00 for 3 people, and that includes tip, and a $9.00 comp for the 40 minute cold casserole. WOW! I could sure hit Milk and Honey for better food, ambiance, great service, food and it would be less than $50.00 for 3 people! Too bad for Bridgeport....
