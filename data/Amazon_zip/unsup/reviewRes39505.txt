I've been coming here for over 5 years and this place is solid. I went the other day with 2 friends and I was a little nervous because I know its been on Check Please and you know how that goes. We arrived they said it might be a 30 minute wait which ended up only being like 15. They redecorated, and i like it. The service has always been rude and rushed no matter who you are- but hey whatever. It is what it is. I ordered the usual for us, Kalbi, Marinated Chicken, Chop Chae and fried dumplings. As i sit and wait I let the two first timers they may be overwhelmed with all the side dishes. They were but wasted no time trying each and every one. I just love Korean BBQ. At the end of our meal we couldn't believe we ate pretty much everything. Who am I kidding, yea we could.
