If you're coming to Chicago for steak, skip this place and make a B-line to Gibson's. Wildfire is a fine place, but it doesn't deserve 4 stars.  If you're just looking for a friendly place that serves solid chicken, steak, and fish in big portions with a "cheers-like" atmosphere, you've found your spot. sort of an upscaley Friday's. The place operates like a Ruth's Chris or other steakhouse: you pick your meat, pick your sauce, and then pick one side for one price. Nothing to write home about, but not bad. Just standard fare. Don't bring vegans here. Except for the roasted vegetables, the pickings are slim. Plenty of cream-laden veggies, but dieters also aren't going to be happy here. Kids, however, will be in dessert heaven: huge portions! Tasty, too, but not out-of-this-world. Wine list plays to the average consumer who recognizes brands like Clos du Bois and Mondavi. Nothing special but certainly respectable.  In short, the place serves a reasonable steak, but it's not the true "Chicago" experience.
