Heard some great things on here and from others and had to finally make my way down to Fulton and check it out. Defintely did NOT dissappoint.... When ya first walk into the room, you cant help but be "wow'd" by the atmosphere and decor. it is really unique. First off, i LOVE yelp and the great reviews because they always seem to be legitamite information. In this case, i was told by many of you to try the a) guac and b)ropa vieja. Wow! The Guac had really nic chunks of alvacado and you could tell that it was fresh! The ropa, which i was more tentative to eat when he put it in front of us, was AMAZING!!! There were about 7-8 different flavors in there but they all meshed perfectly. I had the Pork tenderloin and my lady had the salmon. The pork was GOOD....but nothing amazing. it was a good portion and had some nice flavors for sure.  I was told that the salmon, again, was good, but nothing great! She did eat most of it, which is an accomplishment in itself. The total bill with a couple coctails was $130 with tax/tip so nothing too crazy, but defintely worth the experience. ill be back...
