Grand Lux Cafe: the good news is, its just like Cheesecake Factory (which is DELICIOUS and you know it)! The bad news is, its just like Cheesecake Factory (and all the slow-walking tourists who don't think Chicago exists beyond Michigan Avenue flock to it).  Love it or hate it, the chopped salad at Grand Lux is amazing; so finely chopped that its almost a puree! Filled with lettuce, tomatoes, onions, beets (beets!), zucchini, lentils, peas, and cheese - lots of it. I also recommend adding turkey (for extra protein) and avocado (great for spreading atop the toasty bread). For dessert, if you can't decide between chocolate chip cookies or key lime pie, just get both. Trust. UPDATE: Let it be known that Grand Lux Cafe manages to always screw up to-go orders. Bastards.
