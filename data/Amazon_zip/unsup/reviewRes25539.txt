Pequod's is my current favorite Chicago style deep dish joint. The crust is hearty and stays crisp and the caramelized edges are great. The sauce is well seasoned the cheese/sauce/ingredients/crust ratio is just right. I recently took another yelper's suggestion to try sausage and giardiniera and now I'm hooked.
