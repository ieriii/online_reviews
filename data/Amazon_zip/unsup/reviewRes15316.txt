I just had lunch at Revolution. I was as delighted by the space - warm, fairly quiet (at midday), well-crafted decor - as by the tasty food and drink. I ordered the Cheddar Ale Soup, which was a comfortable portion as a starter, very rich and creamy; the Sweet Potato Cakes, deep-fried shredded sweet potato with curry flavoring, accompanied by roasted red pepper yogurt (which was as delicious and flavorful as it sounds); and a Workingman Mild ale, very smooth, with a fabulous lingering toffee flavor. The service was amazing! The people who work there are friendly and, from what I gathered, quite knowledgable as well. So glad Revolution has arrived... can't wait to go back and try more of their menu, and more of their beers.
