I wish I could add a sound bite of my joyful yelps. I eat here 2 times a week. It is wonderful, cheap & quick. The veggie options are fabulous, but there is plenty chicken and lamb to go around. My staple meal consists of the veggie lentil soup and spinach pie for $4. That is the best $4 I spend all week until I come in again and purchase the falafel sandwich for $3.75. These prices are serious folks! In addition to this, they have a wonderful salad bar that actually doesn't scare the crap out of me. Just remember to bring cash, I guess at these prices they can't afford a credit card machine.
