I went here for the first time with my dad today. Everything was delicious! The bread basket,our appetizer(grilled calamari), main courses, & our dessert(homemade tiramisu)! The place has an overall good atmosphere,very romantic. Bottom line: overall great restaurant,definitely returning,& would recommend to friends.
