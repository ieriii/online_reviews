Woo!!! I'm reviewer 700...such a milestone! I'm a piece fan, i must say. The beer was effing fantastic, staff was friendly, environment was nice and laid back and ooo the pizza. We tried a regular (with mozzarella and red sauce) and a white pie (olive oil and garlic with mozzarella) and I preferred the white. If garlic is one of your favorite things ever, you'll dig the white. If you have a garlic allergy, watch out, both of the pizzas were well-endowed with garlic. I loved the garlic indulgence, but could see where others wouldn't. The brew selection was quite diverse. Loved the Wack Job, it was aggressively hoppy and complimented the pizza very well. Highly recommend checking out Piece.
