We flew all the way to Chicago to have dinner at Topolobampo and weren't even aware of XOCO but went the next day for lunch...amazing! Yes, long wait, restaurant layout kind of strange... but the food was incredible. We raved about the ahodaga carnitas torta all the way home... actually we are still raving about it! The chocoflan was tasty, the churros were perfect with an Aztec chocolate which was super rich and a dessert in itself. We had great service and no problem with the prices considering the sources of all the ingredients and how great the food was. We weren't all that stoked about Chicago, but we will definitely return just to eat at all three of Rick Bayless' restaurants, they all rock!
