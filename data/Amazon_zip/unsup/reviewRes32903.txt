My first experience trying Ethiopian food and it was delicious! I had a friend from Austria that recommended me Ethiopian food so I went on Yelp to see what was out there and Demera came up so we decided to give it a try. When we got there the place was packed inside so we sat outside to enjoy the Chicago summer weather and it wasn't too humid out. My friend is vegan and I'm a pescatarian so we both ordered our food. Service was good for the most part being that there weren't too many waiters/waitresses but they were extremely busy so that was understandable. Our food came out on a huge circular platter and we dug in. I love the injera (yeast risen flat bread) and the seafood was amazing! Definitely a must try!
