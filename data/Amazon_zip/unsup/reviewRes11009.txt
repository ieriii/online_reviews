On a recent weekend in Chicago, I went here twice in two days. Yes, it is that good! The added benefit is that the friend I was visiting lives in the same building, so it was a convenient indulgence! The wait is worth it. I was fortunate enough to try (and no, I didn't eat it all myself...there was sharing involved!): - Roasted red pepper, spinach, and feta eggs benedict - Lemon ricotta pancakes with blueberries - Chorizo and potato burrito - 3-cheese omlette with fresh chives - Banana bacon pancakes (WHAT? Yes, I said it) with warm praline sauce The banana bacon pancake was incredible. Salty and sweet and decadent. By the way, you can order just ONE! pancake, so you can sample a few different flavors and not be full of just one flavor (the standard 3 pancakes are a large portion). The benedict was also extremely memorable, and I would order this again in a heartbeat. Actually, I was intrigued by all of the different benedicts on the menu, so I guess I'll have to come back! Tasty coffee, and a variety of mimosas and bloodies round out the menu, while the service was friendly and efficient. Awesome!!
