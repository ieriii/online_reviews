I've been in search of a Korean Restaurant since the 24 hour one at Lawrence and Rockwell closed down several years ago. Other yelpers recommended this as a fantastic alternative. There have been a lot of mixed reviews on several sites, mostly about the service. I personally never expect GOOD service at any Korean restaurant. It's the culture, they are just not the friendly service-driven type. So long as they don't actually spit on me or my food, I could care less. Regardless, I found the service to be just fine here, got plenty of water refills, food was served up fast and hot and she did even come back once to ask how everything was. For the food, the side dishes were plentiful and extremely tasty. Lots of little yummies for everyone to enjoy. I ordered the bulgogi and was a bit disappointed in the quality of the meat. For $16.95, I would think they could get a better cut of meat that hasn't practically broken down to it's lowest molecular level. The prices were variant, ranging from average to a bit ridiculous. It's not like you are ever getting really high quality beef or pork products in Korean restaurants.  The only other complaint I have is the SMOKE. Oh my god, the SMOKE. I had a very full and contented belly walking out, but my head felt like it was on a freakin skewer. If it's busy in there, and everyone is going for the bbq option, you will probably need a gas mask or oxygen tank. They have GOT to improve their ventilation system. At one point, I could barely see my friend from across the table. I have to wonder what kind of crap smoke alarm system they have in that joint for it to have never been set off?  Anyway, if you are looking for decent Korean food this isn't a bad place to go. I am going to continue my search for the holy grail of Korean food since I don't think I could ever stand to be in a place with that much smoke again.
