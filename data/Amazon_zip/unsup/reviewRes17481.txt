had a wonderful experience at the violet hour and absolutely cannot wait to go back again. we came at about 9:30 on a saturday night and had to wait about an hour and a half to get in. because it was a cold chicago winter, we simply walked down the street and had a drink at another bar (which the boys appreciated; they could watch the final moments of the bears game). the wait was well worth it though. beautiful decor. simple and understated with rich velvet and high backed chairs. it wasn't too loud and with 8 of us at a table we didn't have to yell or lean over each other to hear each other which is a huge plus. service was wonderful and as we were overwhelmed by the menu our waitress recommended an apple-cider-esque drink in a pitcher for about $80. it was perfect for the 8 of us and we each had at least 2 drinks. note: the violet hour is to the left of a day care and there is a single yellowish light out front marking the door. can be a bit tricky to locate.
