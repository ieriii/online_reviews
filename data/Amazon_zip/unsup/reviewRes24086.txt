part of the lao group (beijing, shanghai) -- come here for authentic sichuan cuisine, esp. for chicago. to have a good experience, it's important to order sichuan dishes. first, focus on the spicy stuff. don't order the typical midwestern dishes. i had the cold appetizer spicy chicken and the spicy beef soup. oily and tasty. try paul k's recs.
