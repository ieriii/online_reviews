I would not go back. the service was atrocious. We were seated at 5 pm, our first cocktail did not come until 530, dessert came at 645. The waitress was so bad, she did not even realize she was bad. the management was oblivious to the service problems and spent most of the time drinking at the bar or standing at the host station, clogging up the area where the wait staff was attempting to enter food orders.
