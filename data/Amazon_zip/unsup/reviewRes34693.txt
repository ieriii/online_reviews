I went here with a friend a few days ago. Looks like they had an interesting buffet and there were plenty of vegan options (that's why my friend took me there). They are labeled with a "V". I sampled the falafel, lentil soup, and some type of bread (I can't remember the name of it now.) It was so good and it helped with such great company!
