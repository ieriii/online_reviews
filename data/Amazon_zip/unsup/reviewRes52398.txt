Salad bar is a bit small, compared to the other places in the city. Seared tuna was a nice touch (haven't seen that at other places) but other wise the selection is quite small. But onto the meat: all the cuts taste something is just... missing. I normally could eat picanha and bottom sirloin by the pound, but here it tasted like there wasn't any seasoning at all. It also seemed like they left each cut on the grill for too long between rounds - even when requesting a rare slice, it would still be hot pink towards the center. every. time. I think I saw the same sad guys walk around with pork tenderloin the entire night. If it's pretty clear that the cut isn't popular with any of the tables, why do they keep pushing it? It's not their fault, but management needs better control of the kitchen.
