I loved, LOVED this place! Great food, great beer selection, and friendly staff. Even though we had a reservation, some chatty people lingered and they initially sat us at one of the long communal tables. I requested that the hostess move us to our own table when one opened up since I was hoping for a more romantic evening--and sure enough, five minutes later, she came back and we got our own table. Nice! I can't remember what we drank, other than the Belgian quad that I had. But the food....bread is complimentary but you have to ask for it. Beautiful, warm, crusty French bread-awesome. Then we had a plate of pickles, frites with fried eggs, and spicy cauliflower. All were delicious and there was enough of each thing to share. I particularly recommend the frites, but yeah, they're decadent. My boyfriend ordered the "small" taste of ham. Yeah, not at all small, but he said it was delicious. He followed that up with the steak tartare. A bit more food than he bargained for, but it was too delicious not to finish it. I had the sole, which was flaky and cooked perfectly. Also - they provide lime/coriander lotion at the bathroom sink after you wash your hands. This is important for those people like myself who have an aversion to dry hands after washing them. Nicely done. Overall, this place is fantastic. I'd say it's not great for vegetarians, although you could get by with the cauliflower and pickles and frites if you wanted to. YUM!
