I came here with a few friends one early Sunday evening, when it was pretty empty. With most bars, empty would be bad, but the atmosphere here is intimate and mysterious, and I had forgotten how nice it is to actually be able to hear what your friends are telling you. I am not a huge fan of cocktails, but every once in a while I will get a hankering for one, and these will knock your socks off. Even just the names of the cocktails had me intrigued. Eeyore's Requiem? Sign me up! I suppose the best part is that the cocktails are strong without tasting overly strong. You'll be pleasantly buzzed before you know it.
