I have a love-hate relationship with Piece. This place is always SO busy. They don't take reservations and to order takeout/delivery takes at least an hour. If there is any sort of sporting event on TV, just don't even bother coming here, unless you are eating this as a second dinner or something. Every time I come here, I sit starving and angry at the bar while waiting for my table, cursing myself for thinking this was a good idea. The bar does serve delicious beer, which they make in-house, but that can only satisfy my growling stomach so much. When I finally get a table and order my pizza, I remember why I came to Piece in the first place. Delicious, cheesy, greasy goodness. The pizzas don't take too long to make after you order, and they have a lot of really unique options to personalize the pizza to your tastes. They will also do 1/2 and 1/4 pizza toppings, which is nice if you have picky people in your group. Its thin and floppy crust is a nice deviation from the typical deep-dish Chicago-style pizza we all know and love (swoon Lou Malnatis). The pizza and service are 5 star-worthy for sure. I had to knock it down 2 stars because of all of the time I have spent waiting and waiting to enjoy said pizza. Stop in on a random weeknight when no Chicago-area team has a televised game, and you will be treated to some 5 star pizza without the 3 star wait time.
