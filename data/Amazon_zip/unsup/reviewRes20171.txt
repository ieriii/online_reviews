...but 4 starts for a stellar cheese plate. A few ladies and I celebrated a fellow Yelper's birthday here last night. I'd previously been to the Gage for drinks, so I was pretty jazzed to try the food. I hate to say I was underwhelmed, cheese plate aside (just wish our cheese portions were bigger!). I split the monkfish with one of the ladies, and the kitchen was kind enough to do the splitting for us. It certainly would have been a little awkward to handle that at the table. One other gripe I had was that our plates weren't quite warm, which is maybe why the sauce around the monkfish was a little on the cool side. Our side of crispy potatoes with brie was super-small, and skimpy on the brie. Boo. The dessert - a spiced apple semifreddo - was tasty, but some bites had a hint of onion to it. You know when you get a dozen bagels, and the everything bagel touches another bagel, leaving its "essence" on your non-everything bagel? Yeah, it was kinda like that. Drinks were topnotch; three of the ladies tried cocktails and later switched to one of the many unique beer offerings. Small selection of wines by the glass, but the Secret Italy selection I ordered was a palette-pleaser and paired well with the food. All that aside, the Gage was a great spot to celebrate a fab woman's birthday!
