The Good: It's cheap, clean and away from the hustle and bustle of downtown Chicago. The Bad: It's away from the hustle and bustle of downtown Chicago. That's pretty much it right there. You're literally on the edge of everything and to go anywhere, it's either a mile walk, or a short cab ride (something I loathe). There's no coffee service in the room, no room-service. If you want anything to eat, you either have to take a cab somewhere, or order delivery from one of the local establishments. For those, like me, who stayed there to save money on he Hyatt (if you're attending a trade show), it's a very brisk 15 minute walk/trot to the Hyatt, and if it's cold, I wouldn't recommend it. So far, the only real plus that most other casual traveller hotels don't have, is a really deep tub to soak in (that was nice!).
