Went there on a friday night with a few girlfriends. We were seated promptly (even a bit earlier) at our reservation time. We had wonderful service and wonderful food. We were all ranting and raving about how delicious our food was. It was a very enjoyable evening. The ONLY drawback is the loudness of the restaurant.
