I only have had this super place for delivery, approximately two dozen or more times. I am excited every time the co-workers agree to get it for lunch. The food is light and fresh. The shrimp spring rolls were great today. The delivery folks are always courteous. The Lunch specials are so affordable and filling, I don't know why we don't get it everyday. I am happy to have this as an option for delivery.
