Everything about Yolk is good. Not great but really solid for a restaurant of this size. There are not enough brunch places in the S. Loop so it is nice to have a reliable place. However the food isn't terribly inspired. They try to make up for this with ginormous portions but they might be better served by focusing on fresher ingredients. I've had three different omelets here - all good but not terribly inspired flavor combinations. A solid S. Loop option.
