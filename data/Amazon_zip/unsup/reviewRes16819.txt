As 2 stars says it, "Meh. I've experienced better." As you walked into the main dining room, you were presented with a very grand feeling as the room had tall ceiling, with very dramatic lanterns hanging and luxurious fabrics separating the different rooms. The food on the other hand was nothing to write home to mom about. I was actually very excited to try this restaurant based on all the review I've read and everyone raving about it, but was extremely disappointed after going there. We got a couple of the specials that were on the menu that night and they were both not very good. Since I felt the food was not very good, I also thought it was over priced. The only thing you pay for is the atmosphere. I hesitate to go back again, but I ended up taking a customer there one day for lunch. The lunch specials they had that day was better and I went with a safe choice, fish tacos. I've never had bad fish tacos, so needless to say, it was acceptable and kind of made up for the horrible experience I had the first time around. Ok, the only thing I would recommend is their guacamole. They stayed true to a simple guac without over complicating it. It's hard for me to recommend this restaurant to anyone who enjoys eating good food. I don't mind paying for good food, but this just wasn't worth it.
