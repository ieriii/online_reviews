Mmmm delicious! I really liked the little flaky pie specialty thing. I know I am going to find myself craving it. I have to denote one star because I received the pasta salad side instead of the potato salad side that I ordered, and the pasta was a little too greasy for my liking. I had the chicken lemon rice soup, which was so yummy. The bread at the table was excellent (that's right, excellent). There was so much on the menu that it was hard to choose. All the appetizers sounded amazing. My friend's food looked delicious as well, although the inferno pizza was not as spicy as it sounds. In fact, it didn't have a kick at all. Next time I want to try the pomme frites because those looked like something you have to order. It was a bustling restaurant for a late night dinner and I really liked the energy. I highly recommend if you want a quick bite to eat. The entire menu is priced very appropriately, and there is a cute section in front if you want to carry out dessert.
