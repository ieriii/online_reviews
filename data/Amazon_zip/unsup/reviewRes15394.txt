I've had some excellent experiences eating at Calo, and I would definitely return for more. Their food is excellent, and so is their service. Prices are relatively low when compared to similar restaurants. The only drawback--their Chicago-style pizza is sub-par. Not that it's bad, that is. It just does not meet expectations. Thin crust, great! Chicago-style, well, it's so bland that you just don't like it. Overall, I'd definitely recommend Calo. Just make sure you steer clear of the Chicago-style pizza.
