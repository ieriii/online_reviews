This Irish bar is located in the heart of Boystown and is situated between the noodle shops and sushi spots that line Broadway. Like most opinions of this bar, the wooden interior of the bar should be complimented as it's dimly lit and very large. I think that the bar is a little too big for its own good, there is probably room for a few hundred people, but when I went there late on a Friday night there were about twenty-five or forty people in the bar. There are booths, tables, bar space, another giant room in the back with another bar, with more booths and table. From standing outside, it looked as if they had outdoor seating for the early evening. With all of the seating and wide open space, I was left to wonder, 'Where are the people!!" As I mentioned, the bar is very nice, but it seemed a bit empty to me due to all the space. Red bull vodkas were $6, but the bartender got me a little bent out of shape by not letting me start / pay by debit card due to the bar closing soon. Similarly when I went outside for cigs and tried to come back in after last call the bouncer wouldn't let me in and didn't understand that I came back in to get my stuff and kept arguing with me. Overall, I think it's a nice bar, but they should hire a promoter and stop being such jerks about letting people back into the bar!!!
