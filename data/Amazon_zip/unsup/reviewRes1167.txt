Hot damn, I mean Doug's, was that line long! I stopped by Doug's on July 3rd hoping that the number of people who had to work plus the number of people going out of town for the holiday would mean that the line would be shorter. Who was I kidding?!?! The line was just as long as usual, maybe longer since the following day (7/4) Doug was closing up shop for a week-long vacation. As someone who abstains from 99% on encased meats I silently began to question the sanity of my plan; especially when one hour became close to two! Initially, I silently ridiculed those people that brought food with them for the wait in line, but after an hour I was jealous of their ingenuity. For those who came without pre-Doug's sustenance there was an ice cream man parked out front ringing his bells and playing his ice cream man music enticing people to buy a cold treat. (I was unwilling to compromise any space in my stomach for ice cream.) If I wasn't so hungry I would've jumped for joy upon reaching the front of the line. Instead, I just placed my order for 2 veggie dogs Chicago style and a large fry with cheese on the side. So was the food worth the wait? You betcha!! The ensuing food coma was worth every tasty, gluttonous bite! Sure a carnivore has more menu choices here, but I'd brave the wait in a second for more Doug's. TIP: If you think you can roll up at 4 and still get some Doug's think again my friend, they cut the line off prior to 4 so that the last person reaches the counter around then. TIP: Wear some comfy shoes, bring something to read, bring some water and a snack or two for your wait in line.
