Went there for lunch on Saturday after black Friday. We got seated right away. Atmosphere: cozy, some private tables as well as communal seatings Butternut squash: tasty. I love it. Grilled octopus: too much of lemon juice Scallop: good but could be better. I like the chick pea that came with. Braised pork shoulder: yummy but salty for my taste Soft serve ice-cream with espresso: really like it!
