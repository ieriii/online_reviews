Much has been written about this no longer new, 1 Michelin star, Logan Square, hipster haven gastropub so I shall endeavor to deliver facts in a nonetheless spirited missive. Go early. Five of us arrived at 5:15 on a Saturday and were seated with celerity. The atmosphere is wooden, literally, closer to the speakeasy decor of gastropubs without H.G. Wells at the host stand. Service was efficient but we were not rushed. Water, waitress, cocktails, food, plates, used silverware, bill, all came and went quickly and graciously. Two points of annoyance here, friends. First, the ubiquitous, "Have you eaten here/dined with us/been here before?" with no substantive follow up. Second, instructions on how to be a customer, "The chef prefers you to order your entire meal at once." Though the presentation and product are akin to restaurants whose patrons really do need instructions this is not such a one. Sous vide beef tongue amuse, meatballs with polenta, pig cheek, sweetbreads, marrow bones, burger with beef fat fries, Gruyere donuts, black licorice dessert amuse, all delightful. Pair with a house manhattan; the bar is raised to the kitchen.  Less expensive fare is available at the restaurant across the street but you know why you're here.
