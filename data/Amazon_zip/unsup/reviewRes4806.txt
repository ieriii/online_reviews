I was in hog heaven! (sorry, that was corny) But seriously, to quote Anthony Bourdain when it comes to food, "My body is an amusement park, not a temple." I ordered and savored everything I could fit into my stomach in one sitting from the bone marrow to pig's ears and feet. It was divine and I cannot wait to go back! Wine list is vast and fairly priced. They also had interesting cocktails available. It's packed, but posting up at the bar and feeling the warmth of the kitchen with a Malbec in hand as I waited for my orders to arrive is my idea of a good time.  Great location on Michigan Ave., too.
