This was my first time at a Brazilian steak house. I was not impressed, but I am glad that I went. I thought that it was too pricey for what you got. I do not like red meat, so my perspective might be a bit skewed. The chicken leg was delicious as was the mushroom risotto from the salad bar. Speaking of the Salad bar, this was a big disappointment to me. I had heard that the salad bar was amazing, but I thought it was okay. There is definitely a wide range of things: raw oysters, maki sushi, pasta salads, veggies, and other salad type things. The dessert was okay, but again I wasn't impressed. I would say have an extra piece of meat and skip the dessert. Overall, I enjoyed the experience but I would never go back.
