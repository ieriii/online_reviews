I think I first heard about this place through The Reader. One of their Bartenders was listed as a finalist competing for the Top Mixologist title. Located in a neighborhood best known for being an extension of Lincoln Park (hip and trendy) and grunge (thanks to the likes of the Subterranean and Double Door), it's refreshing to find a place as refined, classy and upscale as the Violet Hour. I come for the ambiance, surround myself with good people and savor my cocktail. George the Door Host is tall, dark and handsome. He escorted us through the entrance and personally introduced us to the Hostess. We were seated in front of the working fireplace. While the ambiance was romantic, it was too warm to be comfortable. The drink selection is intimidating. The names and descriptions are confusing. It's like ordering sushi. You may not know what you're in for. Trust the professionals. There's true talent working behind the bar. Don't be afraid with what your Server suggests. You're guaranteed the only way you're going to be disappointed by your beverage is by choosing a whiskey drink when you already know you don't like whiskey! I say this but at the same time, I tasted a Gin (bleh!) concoction that my friend ordered and I LOVED it! All the mixed beverages are $12 each. It's worth every penny. My personal favorite: Mai Tai. It's served with fresh mint garnish and crushed ice. As the ice melts and the glass is less full, I mash the mint and it becomes a heavenly tasting Mojito! This is not a place where you slam down beers and make a spectacle of yourself. You have places like Six Corners and Tavern for that. The Violet Hour is crowded but people talk in whispers, sip their beverage and mind themselves. This is an intimate place to enjoy your food and libation in the dark. I'll have to try on a night when my boyfriend isn't working and socializing with George.
