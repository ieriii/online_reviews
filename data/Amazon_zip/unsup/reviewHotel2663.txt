Classy and stylish hotel. Service right up on par with the best of any four-star boutique. Everyone from the bellmen, the front doorman, the concierge, the front desk and the bartenders were SO nice and SO helpful. We had a one-bedroom suite overlooking the corner of East Ontario and Rush with city views and street noise. Man, Chicago is pretty kicking outside in the winter at 4am in the morning! We really couldn't complain though. Flat panel televisions both in the living room and bedroom, and the most well stocked bar....yes, bar and not minibar....I have ever seen. Beautiful details, chic decor and Kiehl's products in the bathroom with a rainwater showerhead and free wireless internet. We ended up staying an extra night.
