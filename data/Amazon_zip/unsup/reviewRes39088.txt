I can't tell how glad I was when this place opened. The previous establishment at this location was horrible. I have come several times for lunch and dinner and have sampled many of the dishes (we like to share) and this stuff is phenomenal!  From the bone marrow to the beef fat fries to the welsh rarebit on to the wild boar sloppy joe then the deconstructed rabbit pot pie, and on and on. The cocktails are great but their beer selection is snobby. I prefer premium lagers and pilsners to ipas and ipas and ipas. Theirs more to beer than just hops. The wine list is premium. And that's its problem. Too premium. The atmosphere is totally current Logan Square hipster, but I don't mind. I'll keep coming back for the food. But I'll keep coming back for the food.
