We didn't eat there today, but we met up with some friends for drinks. Very very cool theme to this place. Regardless of you worldview or politics, this place has a cool feel to it. I'm not going to bore you with my politics, but I'm a big fan of 20th century world history. When you walk into this place and see the fist beer-tap pulls, you get a woody (check out the photo gallery and you'll see what I'm talking about). I'm a Reagan Republican and have my own opinion about the whole concept of Marxism and "revolution", yet I still loved the feel and respect for history this place has. Very cool.  Our friends got a handful of appetizers... my wife and I picked at the fries and dipped them in blue cheese that came with the wings. Tasty. Love to go back and try some of the things on the menu.  Definitely recommend, if nothing else just for the drinks and experience.
