For the love of all things pizza, do not under any circumstances order something from their warmer (the glass display cases). I got 2 slices that way: a stuffed combo (onion, pepper, sausage, mushroom), and a thin-crust pepperoni. They came out lukewarm, and the stuffed pizza slice was soft and undercooked. I've had better from Domino's delivery. After a few bites of each, I left and googled for the nearest Gino's East.
