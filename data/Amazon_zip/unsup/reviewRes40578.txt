These kids are simply doing great and delicious stuff. We went early and this was wise, there was a line growing by the time we left. We got two small plates and seriously considered skipping entrees and just ordering the whole list. Of the two the English Pea Agnolotti, with wild mushrooms, truffled Pea puree, pea shoots and grana padana was a whisper more excellent than the second - Pastrami cured sweetbreads with a Pumpernickle dust, Sauerkraut and Thousand Island - an actually effective deconstruction of a Reuben. Both were fantastic. Entrees - The seared Tombo Tuna with Parisienne gnocchi, Peass, Artichokes en Barigoule and Black Garlic aioli won the day. Just perfectly cooked and delicious (give Black Garlic another chance kids...it didn't overmarket itself you know...). The Flatiron steak with Short Rib Ravioli, creamed ramp greens and Asparagus, Morel Jus only finished second because one of them had to. Dessert was Gruyere donuts which I would like to say nearly made me...come...but I don't if Yelp allows that. Service was great. Room and Vibe were great. Their souvenir postcard is printed with highlights from a dubious Yelp review...a perfect and hilarious touch. Go. Go now.
