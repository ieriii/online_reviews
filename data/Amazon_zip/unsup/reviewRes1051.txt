Oftentimes we are bogged down in the dichotomy of overpriced "high-end" food, and dollar menu "fast food," to the point where the middle ground is a hazy fog of bulk processed, frozen meals.  Hot Doug's stands defiantly apart from the norm and takes one of the simplest and most iconic foods in America and bridges a gap between worlds. There is almost always a line, no matter what time of day, and no matter what day of the week. Anyone standing in that line will tell you that the wait is well worth it, and I couldn't agree more. The courteous and helpful staff are more than happy to make the experience as painless as possible despite the renowned wait times, and although the line may seem long, the staff makes sure it moves fairly quickly. How many different ways can you prepare and present a sausage/hot dog? Hasn't it all been done by now? Surely Hot Doug's response to that is, a resounding "never!" Their unique "Specials" menu and seemingly odd combinations of ingredients ensures that your first trip to Hot Doug's is memorable. And despite their popularity (or perhaps because of it), they continue to offer many of the classic varieties of sausage/hot dog for very reasonable prices. After Doug took my order, I was surprised at how easy it was to procure a place to sit considering how incredibly busy it was. The food was brought out promptly, and the Chicago dog was as good as it gets, but the real heroes are the Specials. The Chipotle Buffalo sausage with gouda cheese was certainly unique, and I heartily enjoyed every bite. Sure, the decor won't be winning any awards, the line looks a bit daunting, and I probably wouldn't eat here every day, but rest assured, the wondrously quirky food concoctions and friendly staff makes this a must-try experience for anyone in Chicago, whether they live there, or are just passing through.
