The Liconln Square location looks great since rehabbed, on busy nights make a reservation a couples hours before, you will feel like VIP walking infront of those waiting. I like this resturant, but it gets 5 stars because anytime any of my friends come over and we are deciding what to eat they only choose this place. They have a wide variety of choices, and a fair price, not to mention the great taste!
