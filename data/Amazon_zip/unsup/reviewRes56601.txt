Went on a Saturday at 7pm. Very elegant dining ambiance but so dark no one could see where they were walking. We started with crab cakes, excellent and fresh. For dinner I had the bone in ribeye. It was very good. I'd say every bit as good as gibsons, mortons, etc. We also had the Mac n cheese which was unreal!!  So tasty and hot, would go back just for that. The service was fantastic but infrequent. Overall, I'd go back but would bring my night vision goggles to navigate their light free environment.
