Went to Frontera last Friday night after 8pm and waited over two hours to get seated at a table. Not a problem if there is actually that many peope in front of you, but if 20 groups listed AFTER your name on the list get seated before you, then something fishy is going on.  Yes, they told me it would be 1-1.5 hours, but if we were 3rd on the list after an hour and first on the list after an 1 1/2 hours with people coming and going, then you be the judge. I guess if you want to be seated any quicker, be prepared to know someone working there or to grease some palms. I've been to Mexican restaurants in Mexico and across the USA. Some restaurants may be worth waiting at for that long, but this place definitely isn't one of them.The drinks are good, the entree's are average, waiter service is ok if they are in a good mood. Host staff sucks.  Go somewhere else where good customer service is the norm for everyone, not somewhere like Frontera where they pick and choose who they want to hand it out to. I will never go back and I will recommend to everyone within earshot to do the same....
