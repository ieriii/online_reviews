We waited about 45 minutes for a table here on Saturday night, and god was it worth the wait. Most BYOB sushi places that I've been to have little to no atmosphere, but this place has one, and it's cool. Yes, it's louder than most places, but between the music, lighting, people and food, it was a great place on a Saturday night. For 3 people, we ordered enough food to probably feed 8, yet somehow we had no problems licking up every morsel.  Miso soup -- my friend described this as the best she's ever had (SOUP, that is!) Edamame -- can't really screw this up, though i think it needed a little more salt Shrimp and vegetable tempura -- AWESOME Crab rangoon -- I've had better, but come on, it's a pocket of hot crab and cream cheese, so still good. We also ordered an assortment of rolls -- my favorite was the Dragon Roll, everyone else's favorite was the Mexican Roll (I don't do cilantro). Oh and some pieces of melt-in-your-mouth fatty tuna. All this while chugging our very own $10 bottles of wine, while paying a $3 corkage fee, of course. Service was fast and good, just how I like it. All of the above, including dessert, was $30 a person, including tip. So in conclusion: Crapload of food + $30/person = SEE YOU THERE TOMORROW.
