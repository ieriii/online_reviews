My boyfriend and I came here one night to try something new. We waited a little bit to get seated, but we found seats at the bar in the mean time. The wine was good, the people at the bar were nice, and the people seating us came back and checked on us to make sure all was good.We had the tom ka gai soup (with the coconut broth) and it was great! We also had the firecracker roll and one of the tuna rolls that I can't remember the name. They were so good that we got the daily special roll as our "dessert!" I will definitely recommend this place to people and will come here again!!
