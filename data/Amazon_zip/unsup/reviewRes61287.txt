My girlfriend and i came in on a saturday night probably around 7. We didnt have reservations and we waited for 45ish minutes (which was fine, we expected that, it was packed!) we got a nice window seat and our waiter was wonderful, very friendly and very funny! The salad bar was my favorite and the meats were delicious! The only negative thing i would have to say about my experience is that the owner who visited us at the table was very annoying. He kept pushing us for more of the side dishes and was just way too aggressive. I think from now on he should let his staff do all the work because he is not a good people person! Other than that, i would definitely come back, only i would make reservations!
