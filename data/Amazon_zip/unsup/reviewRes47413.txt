This place reminds me of a cross between Cobra Lounge and Kuma's. I'm not really into the heavy metal rock thing but they do a good job here. I've come during happy hour twice now (1/2 price apps on weekdays from 4 to 6) and had their mussels. THEY ARE THE BEST MUSSELS I've had in the city, and I get mussels a lot. It's loud, it appears the bartenders drink heavily on the job (I don't care, just sayin') , and it's probably not for everyone. But the owner/manager seems like he is really trying and although I've only ever had the mussels, the whole menu looks pretty darn good.  I just hope it doesn't get too popular like Kuma's--I was at Lockdown last Tuesday and it was totally packed when I left at 7. But I guess that's a good thing. Nice addition to Western.
