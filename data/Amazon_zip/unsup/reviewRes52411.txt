Call me a fatty, don't care. I starve myself on days I know we will be going to Brazzaz. We only come here for special occasions. I personally like this place better than the other Brazilian steakhouse (I will not name it but it starts with an "F"). For me, the salad bar is a better option and has stuff I will actually eat. I'd actually like to see rice and black beans there but that's something I'm willing to overlook. Meat selection is pretty awesome. I love that the gauchos remember what you do and don't like. I'm not a big fan of pork so the pork guys stay away from me. The waiters are just ok. Our last server kept forgetting our drinks. When he finally remembered my wine (after asking three times) he managed to spill it as he was placing it before me. Nice. I have wine on my lap now. I've never had a great experience with the waiters/servers but I don't really care about them. I care about how fast these gauchos are coming over to my table. Nice area, up-to-date and modern decor. The characters outside of the restaurant are very questionable. Some guy came up to us while we were waiting for valet and started talking crazy talk. Luckily, I work in law enforcement and suspected this guy was on something. As I was calling the police he fell flat on his face on the curb and into the street after trying to punch someone. I assume the police picked him up from there. But hey, that has nothing to do with how good the food is inside the restaurant. Go experience, enjoy and fill up. You will feel sorry the next day if you do overeat but hey...I don't care. It's always tasty when I'm there.
