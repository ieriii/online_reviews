A cutting edge experience for lovers of food, art and romance. Doesn't matter if you decide to do the tasting (12 course) or the tour (24 course) menu, you will be blown away by the presentations. I have to say not all dishes, flavor components or pairings had worked perfectly for me, but at least I can appreciate the thoughts and creativity behind each dish. Expect the unexpected.
