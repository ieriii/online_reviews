I love Korean BBQ and San Soo Gab San is my favorite. There are a lot of not so good Korean BBQ places in the city but this place rocks. It's a ton of fun cooking your food at your table. I don't too much eat the little side dishes but the short ribs are delicious. My family loves to visit this place.
