This is some of the best pizza I've had! The crust is amazing, the fresh veggie toppings, and the mixed salad keep me up at night craving them! I usually like jalapenos on my pizza, but I ordered the topping once here and there were so many covering the pizza, it was almost inedible. My favorite choice for toppings includes: tomatoes, spinach, artichoke and mushrooms. YUM! Highly recommended. The only negative is the super long wait times Th-Saturday.
