I came very close to giving it 5 stars; this place is very good. For starters, the idea of a French-Vietnamese restaurant, while not entirely novel, is definitely intriguing and delicious. The restaurant's atmosphere is one of my favorites in all of Chicago. Intimate, yet inviting; elegant, yet relaxing. The service is also tremendous and accommodating. The food is equally wonderful. The menu is exciting: oxtail soup, ribs with lemongrass, great seabass, and filets. I personally enjoyed a delicious duck entree.
