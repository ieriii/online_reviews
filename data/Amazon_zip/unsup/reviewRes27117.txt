Took my wife here last year, it was by far the best Mexican meal we had shared. Even if we didn't get seated until 9:45 PM (recommend getting there early, you will have to wait a long time if you don't), it did not stop us from enjoying it. We went ahead and went straight to the main course, since we had our appetizer at Rick Bayless' other joint on the corner (XOCO). I went with a sea bass with a mango mole dish and my wife went with a chicken and chocolate mole dish herself (sorry for not being too specific, been over a year). The two were both amazing and cooked to perfection. In short, you will be thankful that you had the opportunity to dine at one of the premiere Mexican restaurants in the US.
