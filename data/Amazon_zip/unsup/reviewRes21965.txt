The hotdogs here were good but not outstanding. What made the hotdogs here unique was the pickled green tomatoes they put on as a topping. It threw me off at first because it tasted like a pickle, yet looked like a tomato. This is one of those places, you should try once, just to experience it. There are other hotdog places in Chicago that are much better.
