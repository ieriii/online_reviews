It's the Green Mill, this place is a Chicago icon. That said there are a few things you should know before going. Jazz is king here, that's why there is a no talking rule during sets. People come here to listen to jazz not the buzz of a 100 different conversations. The place gets packed and the bathrooms are all the way in the back next to the stage. If you are sitting up front it could be a long slow walk to the bathroom, and some people might get pissed thinking you are trying to butt your way to the front of the stage. Just tell 'em you got to piss and they'll let you alone. If you don't like the crowds I recommend coming for the after set some time round midnight. The crowd thins out and you'll find an open seat as the house band takes over. And they lighten up on the talking rule a bit. There is another great night to come to avoid crowds but I gotta keep it a secret. Another plus, the place has a 4:00 AM license, 5:00 AM on Saturday. So stop in for the after set, drink till 5 then head out for breakfast.
