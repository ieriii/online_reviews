Went here on a weekend evening. The bar was crowded, but not so uncomfortably so. The dining areas are spread across a few different rooms. The noise level was fine (one could carry on a conversation without shouting). They have extensive wine Italian-centric wine list (we enjoyed a Brunello and also an Italian Shiraz effort). I really enjoyed the beef short ribs and thought that the lasagna entree was very good. I'm told that they have a very nice outdoor eating area and we'd like to try that come better weather.
