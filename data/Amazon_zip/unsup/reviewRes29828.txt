I'm not going to say much in my review as you can see a lot of others have great things to say about Opart but I wanted to leave one note on a particular dish. The Gaeng Musaman Curry is absolutely amazing. It's become one of the only things I'll ever order and sometimes I'll get it twice a week. You cannot go wrong with this dish. I highly recommend you try it if you haven't already.
