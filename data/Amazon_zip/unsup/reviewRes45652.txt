I went for dinner with a friend last week. It was busy with a great atmosphere and lively music (Thurs night). LOVED the decor especially the bathrooms and the library area. Definitely a place that I would like to back to, if I am out drinking in the area, but as far as dinner was concerned I really wasn't that impressed. I wanted to like it but my pasta dish was REALLY drenched in olive oil and when I asked if I could add some xtra veggies like maybe some asparagus to the dish, the waitress first seemed like it was a really big deal, then she said there would be a charge... which i said would be fine and we agreed that she would let me know what my options were after talking with the chef. So she never came back. Another waiter brought our food out about 20 minutes later. Then the bill came and I was charged $3.00 for a couple pieces of asparagus. I was disappointed to say the least. However, my friend who got the meatloaf, said it was really good and our spinach artichoke dish was really yummy. Perhaps I need to order something else, or skip the food all together next time. I also thought it was expensive for what it was.
