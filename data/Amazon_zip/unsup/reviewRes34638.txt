Always a great morning start. Came here on Friday morning, no wait, quick service, no muss, no fuss, good food. I come here regularly when I have time for sit down breakfast but twice now I found a dirty coffee mug. No big deal but please do some quality check before you place the table setting. Other than that food is consistently good and love that you give a substantial side of fruit! Maybe you should think of opening for dinner, heh?
