This place is great. I found it thanks to yelp, so here I am, giving back. I've ordered both for delivery and dined in. Delivery was the best I've had, but not wonderful. I guess you just can't expect delivered sushi to be excellent. The sit down experience, however, was wonderful. The place is beautiful inside.. So unexpected. It's got a great vibe, and for me, that's half the experience. The food is the best thai I've found in Chicago. I had the Pad Thai, my partner had the Pad See Ew (we were feeling unadventurous). They were both quite good. Good quality beef, which is important when it's in a dish like those. I'm pregnant, so I can't eat beansprouts and I told the server that.. and of course, it came out with beansprouts mixed into it. I told them and they made me a fresh batch quickly. But every thai restaurant I've been to since being pregnant has made that mistake. Service was just okay even besides that incident... It seemed like we had 3 servers throughout the night. But again, I haven't been to a Thai place with good service, so I'll let it slide. Overall, it was a great experience. The crab rangoons were amazing. As was the seaweed salad. And the vibe was wonderful. We were on our way to go back again a few weeks ago and stopped at another place along the way instead. Bad decision. Indie cafe is 10x what that place was.
