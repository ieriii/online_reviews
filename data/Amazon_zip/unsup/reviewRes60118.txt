We decided to try this restaurant since it was right off Argyle and Broadway. The selection on the menu was plentiful and it all sounded good. The food tasted good with a lot of flavor. The price was good for the portions that we got. I would recommend going at off peak hours since this place gets packed. But I guess that shows people that the food is good.
