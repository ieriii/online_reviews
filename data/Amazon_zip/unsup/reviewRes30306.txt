The ambiance here is awesome - very lively, trendy and great for a Saturday night before heading out on the town! Made reservations and they were running behind schedule so sat at the bar for a cocktail - the Peared Sake was tasty, pear is just so refreshing in the summer! Once seated, we proceeded to order some hot sake which was delicious but I can't recall which one. For food, we had a mix of things based on recommendations and what our taste buds were craving: Bang Bang Salad: Worth the bang for sure! Great burst of flavors Toast and Jam: My friend loved this idea (crispy shrimp "toast" and spicy tuna "jam") indo corn fritters: Very tasty, reminded me of Indian pakoras Veggie Q roll - i had this for an entree My friend ordered 2 of the specialty sushi rolls - we def had way too much food between us, but we don't live in Chicago - so it was worth it. For dessert, we had a great selection of Mochis - 6 different flavors!!  Overall, I give it a 4 stars for a good mix of food and ambiance. It's a similar idea to Spice Market in NY.  The service was great too - our waitress gave us recommendations of places to go out dancing and also the name of a club manager to drop at the door to get in!
