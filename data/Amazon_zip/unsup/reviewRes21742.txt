Eh. I bought into the hype and went in expecting greatness... The 1.5 hour wait didn't help; that's for sure. Standing, waiting, touching up between 2 hungry and also annoyed strangers in a tight doorway for an hour was not fun and made me hungrier and testier than I can ever imagine being. I'm just glad it wasn't raining or cold out... By the time I got up to order I was starving, I ordered a special, a duck sandwich and a dessert to be delivered upon completion of the meal...or so I believed. I then found out I had to wait some more for the food. As I saw people around me getting served, I grew excited. Then I started seeing people who ordered after me getting their orders. Finally my food arrived, or rather my dessert did... I sent that back since it would have melted. FINALLY after 3 different waiters had come and promised to bring my food a busboy took pity on me and delivered it. It definitely filled me up and had good value, however the food itself was nothing to rave about IMHO. I found myself dousing it with their hot sauce ( which was quite good; I contemplated snagging it for my troubles). The dessert was okay, an average brownie sundae. I can see myself coming here to eat again and give it another shot only if there was a guarantee of a more reasonable wait...
