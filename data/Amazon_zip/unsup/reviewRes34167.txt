My boyfriend and I have made Sultan's Market a habit. If one of us is going to be in Wicker Park, that person is going to be coming home with a pair of schwerma and some falafel balls.  The falafel is great, sometimes I have trouble deciding between the lamb and chicken, the lentil soup is incredible, the zatter bread dipped in the hummus or lentil soup is amazing, the salad bar is pretty great, and the tabouli has a great parsley to bulgar ratio. And this location is far superior to the Lincoln Park location. This location is larger, has free water out where you can get it yourself, and the staff is much friendlier. The couple of times I've been to the Lincoln Park location, the staff was somewhat rude and made me feel like I was ruining their lives by asking for another glass of water.
