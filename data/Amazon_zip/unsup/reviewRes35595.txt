I wish there was a way to show ambivalence on yelp. Sun Wah proudly displays their health violations on the wall next to the cash register including such gems as "unhygienic practices" and "food lacks adequate food protection", claims whose veracity can be easily confirmed by looking over the counter at their kitchen. Also, don't order the medium size anything there, it is just small size, only they charge you more. On the upside, this place has good duck, roast pork, and authentic, cheap soups, although theres not much but liquid in the less expensive soups. Have yet to try the congee. btw, I don't think they serve lechon, they serve hong kong style roast pork which is quite different in texture and appearance compared to lechon.
