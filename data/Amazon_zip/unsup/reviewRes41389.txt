Tank Noodle has decent Vietnamese food. I visited this restaurant on a lazy Saturday afternoon with my parents, both of whom ordered the Pho Xe Tang (a.k.a. Tank's extra large bowl of pho) with various cuts of beef. Admittedly, the portion size was very intimidating, but that is the extra large bowl. Of course the noodles came with the standard side of accoutrements of fresh bean sprouts, basil, mint leaves, sliced japenos and wedges of lime. I ordered my usual bun thit (steamed rice noodles) but Tank's version comes with grilled sliced beef, a slice of sausage, grilled tail-on shrimp and an egg roll, accompanied by a bowl of well-balanced lemony fish sauce with julienne carrots and turnip. What a plus ... Yummm! Food presentation and quality was pretty good, staff were fairly attentive, but noodles are somewhat pricey considering what neighboring restaurants charge. I would probably frequent this place more often if I lived nearby.
