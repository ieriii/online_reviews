We've been to Hopleaf on several occasions, none better than tonight. We always go specifically for the coconut curry mussels, which are fantastic. However, please don't limit yourself to this pick. There are plenty of amazing things on the menu; a trio of duck, a home made sausage, and plenty of other dishes- and the thing is, all this amazing food is designed to pair with an even more amazing beer list. Go for the food, but stay for the next six hours for the beer. The bartenders are well-versed in the subtleties and complexities of the 30+ handles and the 100+ bottles, and are able to make spot-on recommendations for the pickiest of palates. Every beer the bartender sent to my VERY picky fiancee was spot-on, exactly what she like. That alone is worth 5 Stars. Please go, and please PLEASE tip the bartenders well. They know what they are doing, here.
