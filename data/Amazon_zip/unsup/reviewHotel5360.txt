I just read the review below and I couldn't disagree more. It's really a shame that this woman had such a horrible experience because my husband and I had a WONDERFUL time. I usually don't spend my time writing reviews but I had to get on my soapbox with this one...This hotel is a dream! I can't even comprehend how much detail and effort went into renovating this place. The neighborhood has some of Chicago's oldest and marvelous mansions and if you are a fan of architecture, the Glessner House is right around the corner. We stayed because my husband was attending a convention at McCormick center, but this hotel goes beyond convenience. The service was A+ and then some. The nice lady at the front desk went above and beyond suggesting some great activities and even a golf course in the suburbs for my husband and his business partner. The city's subway is about a 20 minute walk, but it was a great opportunity to marvel at some of the neighborhood's historic buildings. Chinatown is very close too and we had a great experience at Tony Hu's Lao Sze Chuan. Also a recommendation by the lady at the hotel. (I'm so sorry I can't remember her name! Sorry!) The room we stayed in on the third floor was a-mazing. Sophisticated and very clean, amazing artwork and decor and a super modern, state of the art bathroom. Well worth it! We will definitely be back next year!!
