Pretty good food. The menu is one that makes you smile as you read it. The location is decent, parking is OK. I will say... they are far better than that heavy metal burger joint that tells you 2-4 hours for a wait. I would much rather go here, have good service, better food and a great time. I got lost in the monitors with album covers. Pretty cool stuff.
