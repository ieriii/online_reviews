New... Haven style pizza? As in Connecticut?!  Yeah that's the response I get whenever I mention this place to someone. Regardless, the pizza here is tasty and the atmosphere is your typical bar setting. Apparently New Haven style pizza is a more oblong NY-esque style pizza.  Definitely one of the better pizza places in the Midwest. Things I've Tried: Garlic White Pizza - The crust is where it's at. Quality ingredients.
