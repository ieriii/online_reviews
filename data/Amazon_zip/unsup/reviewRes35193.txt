It only took me one time here to know that I will forever be a fan of Shaw's. First, my favorite thing is in the restaurant's name... crab (not crabs). Second, it lived up to it's stellar reputation - everything from the crab appetizer to the crab legs to the filet to the desert - it was all incredible. One of my favorite meals in Chicago.  It is pricey, but I don't even care. It's that good.
