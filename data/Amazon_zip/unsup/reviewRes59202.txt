This past Saturday was my third time to this establishment and I have to say the food has been absolutely delicious every single time I have been here. The duck is the best I have ever tried. My one complaint is that the service was not up to par. We waited at our table for twenty minutes before a server even came over and asked us if we would like something to drink and that was after we waived down a different bus boy to go get him.  Then after our food arrived he never came back to check on to see if we needed anything. I don't know about you but I prefer a drink with my meal.
