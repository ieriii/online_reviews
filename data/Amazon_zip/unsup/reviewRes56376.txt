I stumbled upon this place one night when I had friends in town and we could not get into Cafe Ba Ba Reeba without waiting 1.5 hours. We were reluctant at first (Vietnamese in Lincoln Park...?!) but I am so glad we gave it a try! The atmosphere is a lot better than what you would get in a typical Vietnamese Restaurant and we loved the apps (Calamari Salad is to die for), bubble tea smoothies, and the entrees - we got Beef and Mushroom, Chicken Fried Rice, and the Roasted Duck. We were stuffed and still had leftovers. If you want a good meal for not a lot of money in Lincoln Park, I would strongly recommend trying Simply It!
