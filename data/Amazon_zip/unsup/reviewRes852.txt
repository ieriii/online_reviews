You know you're a food snob when you find yourself microwaving ketchup at home to eat with your leftover fries. Wow, be prepared to wait. Freezing weather deters no one. 1 1/2 hour wait on a late Saturday afternoon. Their "normal" sausages are 2 or 3 bucks, their specialty ones more like 7 or 8 bucks. Since you can get a normal dog anywhere, I'd recommend getting something exotic here. Anything from alligator to rattlesnake to elk to yak to kangaroo etc (weekly specials rotate when they run out every week or two or three). So what to get? I'd rec the Foie gras with duck sausage, which is amazing. The yak was also fantastic, had a nice beefy flavor, makes sense since after all, it's a long-haired bovine found throughout the Himalayan region of south Central Asia (courtesy Wikipedia). The rattlesnake was also really good, somewhat sweeter flavor w less of a meaty flavor. Honestly, I'd just ask the owner what roughly you want (beefy, juicy, smoky, gamey, strange) and he'll help rec one or two. French fries were natural cut, great. Cheese fries would be excessive as there's a good amount of cheese on many of the specialty hot dogs. Cash only. Closed Sunday and closes at 4pm.
