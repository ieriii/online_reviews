Recently visited Chicago with the BF and for the most part, enjoyed our time there. We yelped pho in Chicago because we were in dire need of hot soup. He was sick and I was getting sick, and what better way to clear our throats with a bowl of pho? I had the seafood pho and he had the special pho (#1). My bf is Vietnamese and he said the pho was just alright. It didn't compare to pho places in San Jose, CA however what he enjoyed very much was the avocado / watermelon drink, which are two of his favorite fruits!! This place is also fairly popular. We were seated right away but there was a wait, and the place was packed. Yes, service is a little slow but expect that when you know it's busy. I personally enjoyed my hot seafood soup, especially the noodles. Yum yummm... I also loved the crab balls in the soup. Overall, it was a great experience. I loved my big bowl of seafood pho and the bf was happy to have had the yummy avocado/watermelon drink! 4/5!
