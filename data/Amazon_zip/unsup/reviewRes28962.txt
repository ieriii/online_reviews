I've been here twice now and I'm not completely won over by it's fantastic-ness. I'm also pretty certain I'll be going back. How to reconcile the two? Here it is: The food is quality for cheap. The pasta dish I had was excellent and the portion was enormous. The left-overs were even great...cold. The pasta will call me back and certainly the price will too. My issue with this place both times has been the service. It's slow. It's not awesome. The last time I was there (with Meghan B.) and her drink came out with lipstick marks on the glass. I was semi-gagging as it sat there on the table for a good 10-15 minutes before there was a "check-up" that would allow for remedying that situation. AND, I felt there wasn't enough "Oh my god...I'm so sorry"-ing going on. When the server returned with the drink he said, "I even gave you a fresh glass of wine." Well DUH. That's what I would have EXPECTED. Something like that happens (and I'm saying the lipstick was egregious...and did I already say disgusting), I'm thinking comping that drink wouldn't be totally wrong. Anyway, a great place for lunch/dinner. Very good food for the price. I just want them to be a smidge more attentive.
