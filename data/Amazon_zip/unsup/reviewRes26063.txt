The pho here is just okay. The broth is pretty good, but I'm less than impressed with the amount of meat that comes with it. That being said, there aren't too many alternatives for pho if you don't want to go all the way to Argyle (I haven't tried Hai Yen yet).  The only reason Simply It is getting four stars instead of three is that they have a variety of other dishes that are pretty good. Their lemongrass beef appetizer is great & their catfish in a clay pot entree is also really really flavorful. They also have a ton of fruit smoothies to choose from. The last two times I've been here we've either gotten a free fruit smoothie or free dessert. They definitely have good service here.  If I am craving pho and unwilling to go north, Simply It is definitely my go-to.
