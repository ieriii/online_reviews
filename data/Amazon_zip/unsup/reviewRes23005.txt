Lao Sze Chuan makes me very very happy. I haven't tried the hot pots, but I can say that the mapo dofu and home style bean curd are fantastic, and their pork and chicken are actually edible. (I have found numerous Chinese restaurants in Chicago that serve something stringy and tough and call it chicken.) I love that you can get dishes extra spicy, I love the appearance of less than Americanized items, like blood and tofu stew, and I love the spicy cabbage appetizer that comes with every meal. Negatives? I think the menu is too large. If they picked their best dishes and focused on those, they would be absolutely stellar. Also, when you get things to go, they are begrudging to give you extra rice. You really have to beg them for it, which is very annoying.
