Most of my friends seemed to have experienced Calo well before I did. I had to see what the fuss was about. (Well not fuss per se, but I heard generally good things.) Now that I've been there myself a few times, I'm ready to pronounce judgment. And isn't that what most of we Yelpers are here for? I enjoy the atmosphere. It's dark in a good way. Comfortable, relaxing, classy. One caveat, the candles are fake! The service averages out to good. On my most recent visit our server was rather absent later in the meal, but at leas the bus staff was attentive so we didn't feel totally neglected. The menu is extensive. Surely there is something for everyone. And they seem to have some good specials too, so there's always something new to try! I've been pleased with each of my meals there. Not like blissful "OMG BEST FOOD EVAR!!1"! pleased, but it's above average. The prices seem a touch high at first. However, two things to consider: 1) Most entrees come with a soup or salad, for which many places will charge you another $3-4. And 2)The portion sizes are quite generous. If you eat a little of the free bread (and the focaccia is quite good) you could probably make two meals out of most entrees there. Those things considered, I think the prices are reasonable. So if you find yourself in A-ville looking for a hearty, tasty meal, give Calo a try. Tell them Josh sent you. They have no idea who I am, but everyone knows a Josh, right?
