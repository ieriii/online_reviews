Now I like to think of myself as one of those who doesn't go to the fancy, froo-foo places. So when I first heard of Chicago Q, I told myself I wouldn't go because BBQ was supposed to be down home cooking. I was wrong. Went for lunch today and I loved it. First of all, the place looks good. But more importantly, the food is great. They start you off with pickles and BBQ chips, which is Thriftys on Wilson special. I split the Q3, with half a slab of St. Louis ribs, pulled pork and brisket. It came with the largest piece of cornbread I have ever seen and I also ordered some mac n cheese. Honestly, everything was great. I think the quality of meat they have is a notch above the other BBQ places because even though I'm stuffed, I don't feel fat. While it is pricey, the gas I currently have and the smile on my face prove you get your moneys worth.
