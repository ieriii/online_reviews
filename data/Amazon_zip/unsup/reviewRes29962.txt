Went there for Brunch on Sunday and was not disappointed. They have amazing scones (with butter and whipped cream!) and 3 different types of Eggs Benedict (e.g, Florentine, etc). It was non-fussy delicious brunch food that was delightful. Server was very sweet and coffee stayed full the entire time. I will go back if I'm in the neighborhood!
