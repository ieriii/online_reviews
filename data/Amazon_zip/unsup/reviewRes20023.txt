I like this place. I have liked it since the very beginning. What's not to like...Michigan Ave..outside dining...generous pours of wine. But Gage - please make some changes to the menu! It has been the same menu for soooo long. No one wants fondue when it is 80 degrees. How about some seasonal fresh stuff? Asparagus rather than the same brussel sprouts maybe? Just a suggestion. Still a favorite for location and people watching.
