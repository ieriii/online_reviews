I had really conflicting feelings about this restaurant as I used to live close to the Vietnamese section of town. There you can get cheap but wonderful V-food but in a poor or even terrible restaurant environment. Le Colonial is a beautiful restaurant with good service, though we paid huge prices for small portions of good food. Our Pho soup I thought was really kind of mediocre. The Chao Tom (one of my favorite dishes) which usually consists of a shrimp paste wrapped around sugar cane, was good but was a REALLY small portion.  The real star was the Bun Thit Nuong which had some of the most delicious bbq'd pork that I've ever eaten. It's served with a angel hair like pasta which sadly was stuck together in kind of a clump. This was a really good dish, though, and I will be back to eat more. I think this restaurant would be a great stop after shopping or if you want to impress someone for a date.
