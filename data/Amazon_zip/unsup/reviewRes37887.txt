Deep dish was so good and not greasy like most places. I had the sausage deep dish. So good. The meatball sandwich is ok. The bread is so toasty and delicious, the meatballs are really small and the meal in general, not that filling. It comes with a bunch of fries, but they get pretty blah after a while. Ordered the tiramisu as well. Pretty good, but then, I think pretty much any tiramisu is good.
