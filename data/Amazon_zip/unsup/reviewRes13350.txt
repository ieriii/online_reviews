The place was pretty filled up Saturday evening but not as filled up as we expected it to be. The atmosphere is cool and hipster. I liked it. I ordered the Eugene which was simply awesome! My bf got the Heugene (I was contemplating getting that one) but I'm glad I stuck with my choice although his was good too. I tried the fried calamari, which had a LOT of breading and little calamari and was way too dry to be served without any dipping sauce. there is a sauce on the bottom of the place but it's much too little for the calamari to taste good. It needs a dipping sauce! The sweet potato patties were YUMMY along with the sauce (same one as for the calamari I think?)
