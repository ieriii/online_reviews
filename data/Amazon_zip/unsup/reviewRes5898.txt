After reading the awesome reviews Jeff and I decided to make reservations at Wildfire for 7:45 on a Thursday. We were very impressed at first with the atmosphere. We ended up getting a larger booth and that was nice since the smaller booths looked a little too small. The booth was comfortable and the menu looked very impressive. We couldn't decide what to get! We put in our drink orders and both ordered the lobster bisque, and we ordered scallops wrapped in bacon for the appetizer. The drinks took at least 20 minutes to arrive. The rye and coke was very watered down but Jeff's Manhattan was very good. The waiter asked us several times if we wanted more bread, and every time we said yes but it never came. Eventually we got some bread and it was over an hour before the waiter took our food order. It didn't take long to get the food out after that. I ordered the prime rib medium-well and it arrived medium-rare (still rather bloody). Jeff ordered the duck and said it was above average. I didn't eat my prime rib and I wanted to get out of there because we were going to a movie. I let the waiter know about the prime rib and he comp'ed a desert for us but everything was so slow we didn't get out of the restaurant until quarter to 10. The bill came to $99. Overall I think the food quality was great, the food was just cooked poorly and the service was very below average. We were disappointed.
