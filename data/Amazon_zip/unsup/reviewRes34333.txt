Ok, yum. I had the most amazing hummus last night brought to me from Sultan's Market. I am half middle-eastern descent, so I definitely have the authority to say what is good and what is not. The pita was delicious, as well as feta. Is there a more fun word to say than falafel? I think not. They have a new location on Clark street! I don't know the address, but it is right next to the Austrian Bakery at Deming. Delicious and I love the service. Great falafel and they have this apricot paste my mom used to give me when I was little.
