Ambiance was really neat , food was average.This place is in the theme of the old style drive in (little menus and speakers for every spot), complete with waitresses. You can spot this place from the giant Godzilla-esq boy and girl "cave-hotdogs" with glowing red eyes (I didn't know they have LSD in the 50's). The hot dogs were the big fat ones , I'm used to the smaller Vienna dogs , and prefer them. These dogs were just ok. The burger was good , the fries good. The vanilla shake was the star of my meals here , without it I might not have made the effort for a return trip. The polish's were good , I'm not digging the Green tomato's either. I give this place points for atmosphere , but it's called super DAWG , and I didn't like the dogs. Not too bad a place though.
