Some things were great others were quite disappointing. Bad news first, the kobe brisket was dry and nothing to brag about. The server was a bit dry himself and how can you work at a BBQ joint and never think about Texas??? That's what he told us when we enthusiastically told him that we just returned from a BBQ tour of that fine state. We didn't try the ribs but we got a 7 out of 10 from a nearby table. Good news, the pulled pork was excellent. Especially when drizzled with a bit of the mustard and vinegar sauces. The slaw and baked beans were nice. I really enjoyed the ambiance, extremely detail oriented and comfortable/classy.
