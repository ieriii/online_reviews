we checked out Alliance on Sunday for the Yelp knitting event. since my birthday is coming up, we've been on a search for a place that has beautiful AND tasty cakes (it seems the two ideas can't be found together without spending tons of money). Alliance blew us away. We tried the pumpkin cupcake, which was moist and tasty, like a lovely pumpkin bread with yummy cream cheese frosting. the vanilla actually tasted like vanilla, with again a perfect texture. the red velvet is close to perfect deliciousness with a subtly fruity flavored and cream cheese frosting.  But the BEST is the hazelut cupcake, now i'm not a huge fan of chocolate frosting (I prefer my chocolate in the more dense truffle or bar form) but this fudgy frosting was great, rich and deep not overly sweet. The hazelnut cupcake has this great aroma and rich flavor that pairs well with the chocolate (I could also see it pairing well with a cherry or berry preserve filling if being used for a cake). Despite the fact that there was a line out the door, the employees spent time with us discussing options for custom cakes, good combinations, their most popular selections, etc. turn around for custom cakes is quick, service is great, designs are beautiful and innovative, and best of all the taste is hands down the best! what more could you want
