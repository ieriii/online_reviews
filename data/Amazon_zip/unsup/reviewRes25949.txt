AWESOME. Yes, the portions are small but they pack a punch of supreme flavor... thank you yelpers for the reviews, I ordered the pork belly (tocino) and the brusselsprouts that were probably the best thing I ever ate.. service was on point esp. the wonderful server who patiently described every dish as he presented it. Plan on 3-4 tapas per person for a full meal. Decor is contemporary but comfortable. Valet is off the Blackstone Hotel entrance. FYI average dinner for 2, no drinks $80--give or take dessert, etc..
