Great back patio - it's worth the wait. I'm not a big drinker but I can appreciate their massive selection. We always get the mussels - the size for 1 is great for 2. But the new reason they've solidified my love, and the reason I'm writing this review: the pork chop. It's the best thing I've eaten all year, hands down. It was perfectly cooked - I don't know how they do it, but it is completely worth it as the most expensive thing on the menu. I'm usually a budget diner, but I won't hesitate to get the pork chop again. We also love the sausage plate (with the german potato salad), and the brisket platter. The one thing that maybe didn't wow me was their seasonal corn waffle entree. It sounded delicious in theory, but in the end I just didn't think it came together all that well. You will likely wait a while for a table, and they're likely working out the kinks of just having expanded considerably in the recent days. But if you're in for a leisurely dinner and don't mind waiting at the bar or in their nice outdoor seating area over a few cocktails, it's a great way to spend an evening.
