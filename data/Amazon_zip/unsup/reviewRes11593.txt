Came here again last Friday and it was a winner. The kitchen closes around 12:30 on Fridays, so we rushed over here around midnight since Big Star was closed. The pizza was as delicious as I remembered the first time and it came out pretty quickly. Came with 6 people and ordered a large pizza (spinach and pepperoni). Left very satisfied and splitting the bill was easy. What more do you want from late night food? WINNER!!
