All I can say is Amazing!!!! Must have passed this place 200 times and never went it. Went there last night for a birthday party and I wish I visited earlier. The bar is gigantic and well stocked. We ate downstairs and didnt have any problems with it being loud as another person stated in their review. Started with shrip appetizer in some rich red sauce - amazing. Next came the chopped house salad with shrimp - amazing. Ordered the bone in Ribeye canjun style - amazing and ended with the signature butter cake ala mode - amazing. My wife does not eat meat but I will take her back because they serve tuna the way she likes it. I left in a food coma and will be back. Others at the table had the bone in fillet, KC bone in strip and the rack of lamb and everybody loved their food. We also ordered the lobster mashed potatoes, mushrooms. creamed spinach and the macaroni and cheese - one was better than the other. You will not be disappointed.
