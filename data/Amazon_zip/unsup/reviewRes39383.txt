Two friends and I came here on a Thursday night at about 8PM and the place was packed. We waited about 45 minutes for a table, but it was well worth it. Be ready to order all your food at once - appetizers, small plates, and entrees. We unanimously agreed the scallops ($15) was out favorite thing we tried. The meatballs ($6) were great too. My friend who likes seafood got the escolar ($23) which he enjoyed. I got the cavatelli ($19), but I would not re-order this again; there are much better things on the menu. For drinks we got the old beaver ($8) which was great! I would definietly get this again!
