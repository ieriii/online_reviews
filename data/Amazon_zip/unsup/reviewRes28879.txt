The first time I ate here - over 10 years ago - it left such an impression (good one) but I didn't make it back until this year in May (for my birthday). The presentation of the food was fantastic, but the food was not as memorable as I remembered it from 10 years ago...but the gold margarita was fantastic! The decor is beautiful, vivid colors and Mexican style art work.
