One of my favorite restaurants. Loved the steak and chimichuri sauce! Also the best flan and coffee I've had. They tried to charge us a $5 sharing fee so we said fine thinking we each get our own side and all they did was give us two cheap plates like you get at Ikea. So I joked and said we will take the plates home since we paid for them. They waived the fee:)
