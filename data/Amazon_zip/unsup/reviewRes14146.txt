i went to glenn's when my parents were in town because my dad saw it on "diners, drive-ins and dives." i have to admit i assumed what our dinner was going to be like soley based on the word "diner," and boy was i wrong. we got to the restaurant about 15 minutes before they closed. based on some of the other reviews on this website regarding poor customer service, i was afraid we would be shoed out or refused service, but this was not the case. we had a very polite waiter that didn't seem to care we just strolled in. i was overwhelmed by the amount of seafood selections on the blackboard (a good idea unless you're someone with poor eye sight.) this is not your typical diner. the only bad thing about arriving so late was that there were a few items on the menu that were no longer available because they were sold out. i ordered the apple jax tilapia and it was delicious! my parents and boyfriend's dishes were also very good - two got seafood pasta dishes and one got the catfish with cornbread stuffing. i would go back here again and again and again - everyone was very impressed. also super convenient since it's next to the irving park stop.
