I absolutely love Coast...as does everyone else I know. I think its hilarious how its everybody's secret favorite spot....except everyone know about it. Unless you go early, it's best to call for a reservation...love the byob. The true secret roll is the ultraman. It was a special once several months ago and no longer on the menu, but they make it for you if you ask. I'm telling you, try this roll - especially if you love mushrooms, you won't be disappointed. Everyone I take here loves it as much as I do - even my boyfriend who hates sushi ended up liking it. Price is great for good Chicago sushi. Definitely a must.
