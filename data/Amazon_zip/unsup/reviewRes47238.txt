I live a few blocks from the Lockdown which is awesome. I actually dont go there too often, but every time friends come into town I definitely take them there. The food is incredible even when compared to normal restaurants, much less a bar. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because the place is relatively small. This isnt their fault, but if you go on a busier night it can be tough to find a seat. The staff is very laid back, but quick to serve and very nice. Overall an awesome joint if you like louder music in the background, good drinks and killer food.
