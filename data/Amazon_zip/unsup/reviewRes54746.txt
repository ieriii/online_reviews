The fact that this place offers such a diverse menu while maintaining quality and yummy flavor is pretty amazing. This is definitely a favorite brunch spot I regularly take out of town guests to so they can get a feel for Greek town. The only complaint is that it can get super crowded on weekends...but it is worth the wait and crowded seating. Week days are much more relaxed and enjoyable. Try it!
