This place did not disappoint. Went there for brunch and can't wait to hit up dinner. Street parking was no problem. Zero wait for table, but then again, didn't wait around for dingy hostess chic to seat me....just sat myself, told my server and he didn't seem to mind. Ambience is cool, urban, organic, lofty, leaning towards garage-y.(sp?) Cozy temp...music was stellar. Where the heck else are you gonna hear the Supremes and The Smiths back to back? Guess their iPod was in the "S" section. Loved that. Ordered an Old Fashion cocktail and loved every part of it...down to the square, retro, seemingly solid ice cubes. I paired that with the Duck Hash with duck eggs. OMG. Insane good. Truffle sauce set a nice base for the potatoes to absorb but the kicker was this sick dollop of vinaigrette that was hiding under my eggs. I had to order a side of it just to believe it. Stuff really tied the plate together (and aided in my personal obsession of vinegar based sauces) Of course, had to get a side of sausage AND a side of bacon to try. Both were top-notch. Zero gristle in the sausage..and to me....that alone will kill the deal. On the plate, it doesn't look like a ton of food....but flavors are so well done, rich, savory,...almost relaxed, that you leave there very content and feeling kinda good that you ate organic, local ingredients and actually liked them. My server was more than pleasant, knew his food, and knew the establishment. I dig this A LOT. Raul....big shout out to you my dear. I will for sure be coming back for dinner and a whiskey flight. Or two. Rumor has it there's rooms for rent upstairs; unfinished paperwork has them on hold at the moment but can't wait to see them. Place is right across the street from the blue line so super easy airport access. Dessert is suppose to be quite memorable too....will report back about that when I do dinner.
