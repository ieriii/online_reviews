I popped in here for brunch over the weekend. It was 11:30AM on Saturday and the wait was comparable to Bongo Room (we headed here since Bongo was a 20 min wait).  The place fit a ton of people and the yellow and blue decor was somewhat pleasing to my eyes. I definitely have to come again since the menu had a ton of items. Their skillet selection looked great, but I had to have an omelette for this first meal. I ordered "The Works", which had everything under the sun in it. My wifey had scrambled eggs and cream cheese. Our dishes came with sides of pancakes, english muffins, and wheat toast.  For the price, our portions were huge (we had leftovers for later on in the day). The pancakes, toast, and english muffin were how you would expect them. I prefer my eggs a little solid and my omelette was a bit spongy. Same thing with the eggs and cream cheese. Also, the stuffed goodies in my omelette didn't jump out and assault my taste buds. Better than IHOP, but it could be a lot better.  Oh well, it's a reason to come back and try another dish that isn't egg heavy. I had to give it four stars though since a big standout was the service. I had 2 refills on my coffee (1st cup a little burnt, the other two was fine), the waiter was attentive, and the food came out quick even though the joint was hopping. I can't wait for the weather to warm up so we can walk here instead of driving (parking is getting a lot worse around the area).
