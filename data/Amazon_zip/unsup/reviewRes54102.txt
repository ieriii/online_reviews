This place is good, but not exactly a huge fan. The price is a bit high relative to the service and quality of food. I would rather go to local restaurants and pay about half. Rick's flagship restaurant is damn good and worth every penny, but XOCO is simply nothing impressive. It's good food, but nothing impressive. This might have been like a hyped up movie... good, but didn't live up to the expectations.
