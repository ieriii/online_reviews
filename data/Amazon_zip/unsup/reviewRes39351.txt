Oh, San Soo Gab San... I had so many high hopes for you based on all these stellar Yelp reviews. I felt that the second the staff figured out I wasn't Korean, service took a nosedive. Not only was it painfully slow, they moved my friend & I across the restaurant after we had already sat down just because we weren't getting the BBQ. The side that we had to move to was poorly ventilated, so we were practically choking on other peoples' BBQ smoke. Gross. The only redeeming qualities about this place are the side dishes! I don't know the names of all of them, but there was something with potatoes that was quite tasty.
