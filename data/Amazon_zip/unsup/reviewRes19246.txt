Bad Apple is quietly the best burger joint in the city. Wait, wait, wait...before you stop reading this because you think Kuma's is sooooo amazing, you're wrong. I'm not one to write a positive review while simultaneously knocking another place. It's uncouth. Bad Apple has an amazing burger list, an even better beer lost, and a friendly staff who doesn't treat you like you should feel honored to be there. Pardon my spelling, but I've become close with Alyssa and Laura. They've both been my servers for quite some time now. Awesome chicks! They know their $hit and get it for you quickly. Btw, to all you helpers who think you're doing someone a favor by disrespecting someone because of the the way they look or how many tattoos they have....stop.  Review the venue as a whole and tell why you didn't like the service, if it's ever bad (which it isn't here...it's always on point). Please don't disrespect someone personally, unless they truly ruin your night. You Yelp haters are bums. Bad Apple is badass. Great food, knowledgeable staff, amazing beer selection. Try it. If you like Kuma's, you'll love Bad Apple. (and you won't have to wait 2 hours to eat)
