Good lord! This is where my Tapas Las Ramblas date takes a turn for the worse. Of course after some strong red wine, what better way to follow it up than with some strong ass 9% beer! Delirium Tremens to be exact... do you know what that means? I see it everyday at my hospital, its a symptom of alcohol withdrawal... you start having the shakes. Great idea huh? Seeing as how I didn't really remember the last part of Las Ramblas I should have ordered some water, but no, instead three Delirium Tremens wench!  Damn, I wish I remembered this place....
