Wow. The food, in a word, sublime. As you may know from other reviews this is a small place, seating around 26 people. The service was unpretentious and informative. Reservations are difficult to come by due to the size of the operation. Our party all had the nine course option priced at $100pp. The flavor combination was brilliant. The fact the restaurant is BYO saved us the equivalent of Costa Rica's GNP. If you enjoy Contemporary American cuisine and consider yourself even a little adventurous (in a culinary sense) Schwa is a must-visit.
