From the outside the place doesn't look very appealing. However, the inside is very nice. Has the sports bar feeling. Garlic cheese bread was awesome! Soft and flavorful. Their fries look similar to McDonald's fries, but taste much better. The pan pizza with the caramelized crust was unbelievable! The sauce and cheese meshes well together on top of the bread. Additionally, I love how the bottom of the bread is seasoned and juicy. My wife really enjoys the thin crust pizza. However, I still prefer the pan pizza. My favorite toppings are sausage, pepperoni, and basil. I'm craving their pizza as I write this review. They are open until 2am so its a great late night spot. Also, if you order their garlic cheesy bread make sure to order marinara sauce as it doesn't come with the dish.  Pequod's pizza is a true taste of Chicago pizza!
