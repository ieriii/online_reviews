This is not so much for the hotel but for the ballroom on the second floor where we had a party, and then for the restaurant, Aria. For the party: 3 stars. We were welcomed into the hotel lobby, then swept up the stairs. All was fine until we walked into the ballroom... I've heard that there are a few beautiful ball rooms in this hotel, but this one was somewhat lacking. It transported me back to my days of bat and bar mitzvah's on the north shore of Long Island. Two big glitzy gold chandeliers, a small dance floor, mirrors on both sides of the walls, and... that's about it. The ceilings were kind of low, too, and coupled with the dim lighting in this space, it felt kind of oppressive. Throw in two severely understaffed free-standing bars (read: one bartender at each bar) with rude bartenders (probably overstressed, overworked, and underpaid), and you see why this event venue was a disappointment. For the restaurant: 2.5 stars. I'd read some good things about Aria, but having given it two shakes, I've decided I don't like it. For the price, you can easily find better food and a much more aesthetically pleasing environment. I will say, however, that they have a very delicious mushroom soup. I believe it's something like "mushroom soup your mother never made." I think my greatest qualms with the restaurant is the space. It's very long and narrow, making it awkward to maneuver around. Also, the restaurant is kind of divided into three separate sections - the front area for the bar, then a hostess booth hidden behind a wall, and then, as you keep walking, what appears to be another room. The layout is very awkward.
