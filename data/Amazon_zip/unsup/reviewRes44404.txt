Alliance is my first stop in search of a replacement for Mercury Cafe. I'll need about three cafes to serve all the purposes Mercury used to - one for studying, another for a place to hang out with my friends, another for cheap, tasty coffee and food. Alliance fills my first need very well. The fact that the seating area and the serving area are in two different buildings helps - the seating area is completely silent, save the music. Whispering is conspicuous. I could never meet a friend here to catch up, but there's literally nothing to distract me from several hours of paper-writing. Pros: The internet is free, the coffee is decent. The whimsically decorated cakes in the front window are highly entertaining (I am easily entertained, but you'd have to be pretty cold not to smile at a severed foot cake.) They have a dinosaur with a shark in its mouth on the counter in front of the register. Cons: There's usually only one barista, so the line isn't commuter-friendly. There isn't that much seating. The food selection is limited once you leave the pastry food group. It is a bakery, after all. Mercury, you left a gaping hole in my consumer's heart, but I'll be stuffing it with lots of gauze. Some of it will come from Alliance Bakery.
