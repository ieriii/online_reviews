I ordered delivery from here, and I liked it, but it was lacking somehow, and I hated their garlic bread (a sesame seed hoagie cut and toasted with garlic butter). However, a significant number of friends whose opinions I value said I had to try this place. After reporting back to one, he told me I need to eat on-site. So, I went over and had dinner there with a friend. The advice was pretty spot on. Somehow, being here made it so much better. I don't know what happened the first time between Pequod's and my door, but when I ate the pizza at Pequod's, I was able to appreciate it so much more. The caramelized crust is amazing, the ingredients are pretty fresh, and the atmosphere was much nicer than I'd imagined it would be from the outside. It looks like a sports bar, and it kind of is, but I didn't feel like I was sitting in a sports bar from my booth, and there were lots of families around.  So, I highly recommend Pequod's for your deep dish, but you gotta go there. don't get it delivered or to-go.
