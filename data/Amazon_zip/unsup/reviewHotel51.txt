Well..... I don't know where to begin.... Do I start with the room with no blinds.... or maybe that the TV didn't work... OH I know... the fact that the A/C didn't work!  A/C not working... We rented 2 rooms for 2 nights...135/night during NATO weekend, so we werent expecting a whole lot and thats exactly what we got. Only in 50% of the rooms the A/C worked. it would go on for about an hour and then just hummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm the rest of the night. We had corner rooms so there was plenty of light, 2 HUGE windows on 2 walls... the only problem was that 50% of the rooms didn't have freakin blinds!!!!! One of the walls faced West so, hello sun at 6:15am. Not a good thing when we were there for a bachelor party.  So being the lacrosse fan we are, we wanted to watch a little NCAA lax before heading out... only one problem, 50% of the 46 inch flat screens didn't work!  Couldnt find the " Free High Speed" WIFI. I will give credit where is it due... the bathroom was nice and large and the beds werent the worse I have slept on. The building was perfect placement for us.. close to Wrigleyville and Down Town. We brought all items to attention of the front desk... many a times it was "its my first day sorry" or "I'll look into it" with no result. When leaving we explained to them the issues again and we got "wow your rate was only 135/night we are charging 250/night for this weekend, you should feel pretty lucky" WTF who says that, fix the A/C!!!
