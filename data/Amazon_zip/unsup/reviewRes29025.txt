This place is great for cheap, basic Italian. It can be pretty crowded at rush hour times, but you can still get in and out fairly quickly. Maybe stop by The Other Side (bar attached next door) and grab a drink while you wait? The ingredients they use are always really fresh and tasty. You can't get anything too extravagant here, but what they do have is great. They also deliver, which is great for a lazy Sunday night when you can't bear the thought of cooking dinner. Downside is the cheese sorta globs all together and you have a lump of pasta by the time you get it. But that doesn't stop me from scarfing anyway. My roommate loves their pizza - it's big and loaded with cheese if that's your style.
