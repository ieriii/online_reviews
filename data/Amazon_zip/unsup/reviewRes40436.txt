First time having pho. word of advice-- don't do carryout from this place. the pho was all raw meat and stuff (which i guess it's supposed to be, would have been nice for them to explain that). i ended up cooking my food on the stove. not really my idea of fine dining. but whatever. what i docked the stars off for was because: 1. the bf got a chicken dish that he had to mostly throw out because the chicken they gave was inedible (think cartilage and feet and stuff). 2. the salad stuff that came with it was bad so that had to be tossed. 3. the spring rolls had no taste and a weird texture. 4. i found a bug in my chopsticks when i pulled them out of the paper sleeve. nasty. all that for $37.00 and i throw most away. a huge disappointment.
