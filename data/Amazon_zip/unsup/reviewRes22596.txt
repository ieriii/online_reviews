I always liked Greek culture, because growing up my best friend Jack, who's like super greek. Well his grandmother said to me "You remind me of Hercules, because you're always standing." And that's the main reason. Because I'm always standing. And while that doesn't have anything to do with this restaurant. Thinking about that moment in my life always makes me laugh and think about Greek things. But onto the review! They have free valet, which is like freakin' awesome. So like right there they have me impressed. Because I hate looking for parking or having to pay for parking. And the food and everything was pretty good. The coffee was good, and the service is like awesome, and very attentive. And all in all it's a nice place is you like Greek food.
