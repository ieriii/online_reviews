This has to be the best Thai place in the city. My fiance and I come here when we're in the mood for "fancy Thai." This basically means dining in at a restaurant that has more of a real ambience than a college dorm room. The prices are cheap and the food is excellent. Portions are slightly on the small side for the neighborhood, but the quality is unparalleled. Service is quick but friendly.  I wish there were some 2-tops away from the door, however. This is the Thai place that I compare every other Thai place to.
