Loved this place! Whenever I think about this place, my month starts to water. I've had the black bean burger and something with cheeseburger in the name and loved both. In my most recent visit, I tried the chicken panini, that was pretty good too. Living in the city next month well help me fill my cravings. The only part that sucks is the wait, usually 30 minutes every time I go.
