What a nice, cozy, little place. The crepes my fiance and I got were both very fresh and very flavorful. The fact that the crepes were $10 were more than offset by the fact that the soup was good and we saved plenty by bringing our own bottle of wine (no corkage fee!). The desert crepe we got was also wonderful and didn't last very long at all!
