All I have to say is this: This is a great cocktail lounge in almost every way, except that it is so dark in there, you can't read the freakin menu. WTF? Keep it dim, not dangerous, dudes.  Some of the best cocktails in the city, no doubt. I actually am mad about it - I would love to go here at least once a month, but I am afraid of tripping the dark and hurting myself! Nothing new to add to the rest of the reviews. Overall, you should absolutely try this place at least once, and see how you react to the whole ambiance.
