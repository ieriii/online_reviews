First lets talk= money King size room with a nice lounge area in the heart of downtown for under $140 thanks to Groupon. $46 over night parking.....yeesh,pricey I know.....but after fighting through rush hour traffic and oodles of construction the price could have been 5x that and I still would have thrown the valet my keys 9$ for mixed drinks at the bar....tourist trap! Second= Service Bell Hop, Front Desk, and Valet were all professional....not amazing but I wasn't expecting the Hotel from Pretty Woman Third= atmosphere/experience I was hoping the Hard Rock was going to be super cheesy.....zebra skins and chandeliers. But it was pretty tame...looked like most of the places I've stayed in Vegas with an occasional guitar just hanging out in a hallway.  In the end, its just a hotel. A place to lay your head betwix the journey. Bottom Line: It was clean and the right price.....service did what service was supposed to do.
