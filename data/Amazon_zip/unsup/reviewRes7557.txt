I really have no real complaints about the food except that the entire experience was just meh and on Yelp meh = 2 stars. My two biggest gripes are - it is wayyyy overpriced. Maybe some meat aficionados think that the meat here is the real thang but the rest of us can just be happy with a less pricey meal. Second - the wait service was terrible. Maybe our waiter was having an off day but he did not seem pleased AT ALL to be serving us, considering he did not even have to serve all that much. It felt and looked like a typical buffet place - not a nice setup. My date appreciated me footing the bill nonetheless. Dont they all! I will not be going back.
