Are you craving Italian? More importantly, are you hungry? Go here! I planned a weekend of festivities for my family, and we ended up going to Piccolo Sogno for my mother's birthday dinner. I called and easily got a reservation, plus I could tell them that I wanted something special for dessert since it was a birthday. They delivered - throughout the entire meal. Copious amounts of bread and a bottle of wine while we sat back and relaxed on their patio, under the tree canopy. It was quiet enough that you could easily hear each other speaking and not feel like everyone else was looking at you for talking. We started with a plate and a half of the figs and prosciutto, since our server was kind enough to make sure we would all have enough. Our main meals were all delicious, I personally had the risotto of the day, and ate almost the entire bowl, and there was a lot! Dessert came with a candle and a chocolate message 'Happy Birthday' for my mother, plus we all ordered other desserts and enjoyed every bite. This will become a place I suggest to people time and time again, much thanks to a coworker for the suggestion, as well as fellow Yelpers! I couldn't imagine a better birthday dinner experience.
