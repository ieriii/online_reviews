We were visiting from out of town and went here based on recommendation. We started the evening off with a long, very opinionated dissertation of our waiter's favorites on the menu. I don't know what it was, but it all went downhill from there. He gave the same long-winded spiel to the parties of two on either side of us ad nauseum. The food was good, but the lackluster service (he abandoned us for another table of 6 business colleagues and rarely saw him again) we received diminished our experience considerably. We had cocktails before dinner and tried to flag him down to order wine with our food, but to no avail.
