Not much to say that has not been said. incredible. best steak i have ever had and fantastic service. Started with the Tuna Tartare (to-die for, melt in your mouth--would have maybe preferred more of a plain avocado layer rather than guacamole but had a TON of taste) and crab stuffed mushroom (also fabulous). Then got a bone-in-filet. MMMMMMM. Cooked to perfected. served on 400 degree plate. For sides we got the garlic mashed (good nothing outstanding) and the brussel sprouts (ONE OF MY FAVORITE PARTS). Finally, the butter cake and boy does it live up to the hype. Absolutely wonderful. Needed to go for a walk around the block after ;) Everyone walked out with a smile and would absolutely come back
