I recently went here for dinner and just loved it! The decor reminds me of an old Southern plantation house and the food is delish. We had a large group and tried almost everything. Favorites included: Kobe Beef Ribs (they are HUGE so get an order to share for the table), Pulled Pork Sandwich, St. Louis Ribs, Mac & Cheese and Cornbread. The barbecue comes out with 3 different sauces on the side - I was surprised to find a loved the vinegar-based barbecue sauce. This place is great for a large group, or, for when parents are in town!
