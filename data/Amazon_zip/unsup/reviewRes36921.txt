Had dinner here last night, I was pretty excited as it is walking distance from my house. The restaurant was busy for a Wednesday night so I took as a good sign. I had the wonton soup, it was delicious. My husband and I shared the Oranger (orange chicken), an unagi and philly roll. The waitress gave me a heads up that our makis might take a while because the sushi guys were busy. I appreciated the fair warning. Our orange chicken took a while to come. While it was tasty, it had a little bit too much sauce for my liking. The other problem was that the table to my left ordered after me, yet they got their sushi order 20 minutes before I did, I mean, what gives? I didn't mind waiting but don't tell me I have to wait while another table who was seated and ordered after me gets their food way ahead of me. Anyway, by the time I got our makis, my husband and I were already in ill humor. The makis turned out to be just ok, it wasn't worth waiting 45 min for.  I truly wanted to like this place, maybe I'll have to try it another time.  But I probably won't be in a hurry since it's not like there's a shortage of thai/sushi places in edgewater.
