I love going to Shaw's Crab House, it has absolutely amazing seafood. The first time I ate at Shaw's I was forced to try the lobster which I have never had before and did not really want to try...if your going to try lobster somewhere for the first time it should be at Shaw's! It was so good. They serve it with this butter sauce on the side (I know real healthy haha) but when you dip it in there it taste unbelievably good. I am now officially hooked on lobster...expensive tastes what can I say =) Along with the lobster we shared a few sushi rolls as appetizers and being a huge fan of sushi I truly felt this place was great. The fish was so fresh and the rolls were very unique. I love the maki rolls, specifically the King Crab California, the Chicago Crazy Roll, and the Rainbow Roll. The service was impeccable, we had such a great time with our waiter. A huge part of enjoying the restaurant (aside from the food) is if your Waiter is good and we loved every minute of our time at Shaw's. I can not wait to go back!
