I visited Opart today. Our server, "Anne" was a total b*tch. She was in a foul mood when she came to our table. I didn't even get to order my drink before she ran away. I asked what soup could be made vegetarian since I don't eat meat. She said everything on the menu could be made veggie friendly. Well, not so much. I ordered vegetable soup. One would think that should be safe. Well, it wasn't. It reeked of fish so I didn't eat it. She came over and asked if I wanted it boxed up (which she never came to check and see how our food was). I told the soup smelled like fish and I specifically stated I'm a vegetarian. She confirmed with the kitchen there was fish in it and then SHE BLAMED THE MISTAKE ON ME. She yelled at me for now saying I'm vegan. I'm not vegan. I don't eat dead animals. Fish is an animal. The C*nt then acted like she was doing me a favor for taking it off the bill. She apparently is the manager there. How such an ignorant and rude person could run the place is beyond me. I will not be going there again. The owners should fire her. And hopefully my call later today will help with that. Suck it, Anne.
