The evening we arrived in Chicago my friend took us here.We were starving, and wanted food fast. I have to admit I was really surprised by how many taquerias there are in Chicago.Who knew??? This is my friend's fave in the neighborhood,so we were excited to try it. I was a little disappointed that there was no fish, or shrimp on the menu. Maybe it's a regional thing, not sure. Service was fast, and even though they screwed up my order they redid quickly and without any fuss. I had the chicken super taco, it was good. Not great, but good, and seriously cheap. Alos, they are open REALLY late!
