Ugh.. I was SOOOO disappointed. Bin 36 was my favorite place in Chicago and I was so excited to re-visit! I even went straight to the airport to Bin 36! Then I got there and received such terrible service I wouldn't stay to eat. I met 3 friends there and the 4th was coming from the airport. The first 3 had to eat and run so I was going to wait to order until the 4th came. The bartender came over took our order, got us drinks,... and that's pretty much what we saw of her. She walked over to help another worker make coffee or espresso or something.. and NO ONE bothered to check on us AT ALL. No manager, no other server etc. My friends food came and not one person bother to help us until they were done.. and we still were sitting there for a good ten minutes after they were done. I understand you helping another employee but a manager walked behind the bar grabbed 2 glasses and didn't ask how we were doing. No one did until we were DONE! I was so upset that when the 4th got there we left and went to Bridgehouse.. where even though they were closing at 2:30 (we got there at 2:15) they accommodated us and we had a blast. Bin 36.. so sad.
