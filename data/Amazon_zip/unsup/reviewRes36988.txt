I really like this place. I've done some grocery shopping here - the cheese selection is sensational and the staff is very helpful. I also used the catering services a few times and this is where they really soar into the 5-star category. The catering staff is helpful and friendly and the menu selection is great. I like the food in the cafe for a quick bite to eat. Still haven't eaten at the sit-down restaurant, but am looking forward to trying it!
