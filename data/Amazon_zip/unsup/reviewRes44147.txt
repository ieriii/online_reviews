I ordered my son's 2nd birthday cake from Alliance after seeing their incredible cake decorating at another party. They can do anything you want in terms of design, decoration and theme (the cake that impressed me so much? Shaped like Prince's guitar). And the cake is also one of the most delicious I have ever eaten from any bakery. Everyone was amazed with how the cake looked at the party and how great it tasted. Sometimes great looking you lose the taste and get taste doesn't always look so hot but this was the best of both.
