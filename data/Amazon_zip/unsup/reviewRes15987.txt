Being able to get a table for two on a Friday night within 20 minutes was pretty surprising, but it looks like they have quite a few tables to seat everyone who comes in. I got pizza here, which was pretty good, not great, but the free bread was a nice bonus. Thinking about it more, I am going to take a second and change my rating from three stars to four.
