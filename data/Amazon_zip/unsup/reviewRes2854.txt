I am hugely not a fan of these uber prix fixed meals with 9000 servers and molecular gastronomy, so wasn't expecting to be blown away. But I was...I came here w/my family for my mom's birthday, we did the wine pairing as well, and it was the perfect complement to the meal. Everything from the amuse bouche to the personalized birthday menus to the bread courses to the wine was fabulous. Food was actually delicious, and you didn't feel like you were eating out of a science lab. Obviously not the kind of place you go on a regular basis, but of the restaurants in this category, I would definitely recommend. We had a wonderful night, were able to have conversation without being constantly interrupted, and felt like the food complemented our experience, as opposed to being the only thing you could talk about because it was so strange.
