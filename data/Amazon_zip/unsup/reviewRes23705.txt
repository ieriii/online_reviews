I had dinner at Greek Islands Restaurant the other night for the first time. I am trying to understand why it gets such outstanding reviews and why it is such a tourist "hot spot". The only reason why I am giving it 2 stars is because the service was excellent. They are very nice and accommodating there. However, the food is just not up to par. Maybe if you are not Greek, have never eaten any type of Mediterranean food then you will like it. Maybe its because I have been to Greece that I had higher expectations. Now the food is not awful by any means, but its really just not that great. It is also very expensive for the quality and quantity. The decor is nice and like I said the service was great, they really went above and beyond, but I just would not spend my money there again.
