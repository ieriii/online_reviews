Finally went for brunch because Labor Day was considered part of the weekend :) Loooooooved the brunch items. The french toast was deliciously battered, served with extra sweet syrup and topped with crunchy almonds. Perfect - much better than my recent adventure with Lula Cafe and also $4 cheaper (can you tell I'm still upset?) The Mexican egg dish was also great - perfect amount of cheese melted on the top and paired with excellent spicy sour cream - we were spooning that sour cream into our mouths. Yummy! They really need to work on their customer service. Every time I'm there, the people taking the orders are so grumpy. If you don't like your job, LEAVE!
