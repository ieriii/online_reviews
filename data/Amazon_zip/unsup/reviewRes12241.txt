Pizza is not all its hyped up to be. Atmosphere is awful if you are looking to have conversation with the people you are with. The wait staff has no clue what they are doing. Beer is ok...the only thing worth while. Overall, the place is very chaotic and over-rated. They are only popular because of the young college students who watched "Real World"!!!!
