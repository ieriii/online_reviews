Went to check out this bar because it is new and close to my place. Overall a good experience, the place is clean and has a very cool decor...definitely follows the "hard rock" theme they go for. I had the chicken club sandwich and mac & cheese, which was awesome. Their menu is pretty small, mostly burgers with a few random sandwiches, salads and apps. The prices are reasonable to cheap, and they have a good beer selection. Nothing special....but I'll definitely be back
