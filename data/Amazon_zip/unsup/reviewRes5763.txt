I love it here. I have been to this location multiple times. Food is always good. The ceasar chicken salad - Yum! Along with the lemon chicken, steak wellington, coconut shrimp. Stormy night is my all time favorite martini! I highly recommend. The stawberry lemon drop is delish too! Service is always good too!
