BYOB AND DELICIOUS FOOD!!!! I love, love the rope vieja, the black beans and the papa rellena, so good just thinking about it is making my mouth water. Staff is extremely friendly perfect place to get a quick lunch or have a romantic dinner. They have a patio outside which is enclosed and is lit by lanterns to keep away any unwanted bugs. I love the decor and how they use old glass jars for cups. It's nice to go in a group enjoy dinner and drinks you honestly feel like you're relaxing in a friend's backyard minus the after party clean up ;)
