What they say about this place is true...in this case believe the hype b/c davanti enoteca is MOLTO BENE (very good in Italiano)!!!!! The bf took me here for dinner last night since we saw so many rave reviews on yelp & were glad that it was so closeby to us located on Taylor St. There is a wide selection of wine @ davanti b/c after all it is a wine bar, but I opted for one of the specialty martinis since Wednesday's special is $5 martinis. I went for the "Acai Fizz" (acai vodka & lemoncello) it was really tasty & pretty strong, but then again I'm a major lightweight so one of these was enough for me. We started off with the toast served with fresh ricotta & honey comb...the warm bread with the ricotta & honeycomb mixed together was SO good i almost had a "jizz in my pants" moment. For antipasti I wanted to order something a bit lighter so I would still have room for our pasta so we opted for the roasted hearts of palm. I really liked the small plates because the bf & I ordered 2 different pastas that were nicely sized portions to share. The bf ordered the giant rigatoni-loved the sauce & the sausage was really good too. Once I saw the "Riccio di Mare e Granchio" (Linguine with sea urchin & crab) I knew right away that's what I wanted to order because I LOVE LOVE LOVE sea urchin!!! If you've never tried it before this would be a great dish to try because ordering it by itself at a Japanese restaurant (sea urchin aka uni) might be too overwhelming for some. In this dish the flavors of the sea urchin balance really nicely with the linguine and the pieces of crab..never thought sea urchin would be so good with pasta!!!!! Nice ambience. Great service. Good drinks. Awesome food for a decent price...definitely will be back soon!!!!
