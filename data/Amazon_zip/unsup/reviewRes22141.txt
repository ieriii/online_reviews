Best hot dog in Chicago. Bar none. The quintessential Chicago hot dog. The fries are good, but no they're not perfect. Who cares though? They're still pretty damn good with some ketchup. And yes it's a little pricey but, again, I say who cares? It's not like you go there every day... and always remember, you get what you pay for!!! It's worth every penny. Superdawg will always have my love and support.
