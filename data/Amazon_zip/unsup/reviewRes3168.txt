I have been walking past Crisp for almost 2 years wanting to go in. Why I didn't until a few weeks ago is beyond me! Missed out on 2 years of glorious korean bbq chicken! The boyfriend and I finally went in for lunch about a month ago and immediately fell in love. I ordered the whole jumbo chicken wings and he got the Chi-town Chicken Bowl. I LOVED the wings and boy are they HUGE!! I guess the name jumbo should have tipped me off but I underestimated the size and got the 10 piece meal (should be called 10 lb meal). I was only able to eat three but we happily took them home and had them for dinner that night. One more plus, super cute community seating at picnic tables. Always fun!
