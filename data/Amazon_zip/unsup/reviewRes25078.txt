Is this where Fragglerocks live? I felt like a cave dweller walking into this place. At first, I thought it was a cute little place and the concept was great. But I soon discovered that I almost couldn't make it out of the place with the amount of people waiting in the tiny lobby area. By the time I got my coat at the coat check and got out of there, I must have apologized 10 times to people for having to get by them just to leave. By the way, I'm about 6'3" and fairly slender. I don't know how anyone bigger than me isn't going to have even more issues than I did. Fondue can be such a pain in the butt. To me there's really nothing romantic about placing raw meat into oil and hoping you cooked it long enough to eat. I will say that they have a great wine list I had an extremely knowledgable waitress to help make selections. The cheese in the beginning was the best part of all, but did not make up for the entree and dessert at the end. If I were to go back, I'd go really early and make a reservation beforehand. Also, maybe just get the cheese appetizers and a glass of wine and call it quits here.
