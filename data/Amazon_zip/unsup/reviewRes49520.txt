Everything was awesome. It's bright, but lots of natural light. Airy, open, lofty, casual. We got oysters, shrimp, hummus and a wonderful wonderful wonderful asparagus soup. And wine of course. I know nothing about wine but the wines I had were good. The waiter bordered on cute-friendly and overbearing-annoying. But attentive nonetheless. Good. Fun. Go with friends and/or a boy for summer afternoon conversation.
