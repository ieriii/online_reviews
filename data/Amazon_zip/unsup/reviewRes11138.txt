Went to brunch today and must say that it is my favorite meal of the day! I have not been to bongo room in a while but it did not disappoint at all. The selection of decadent pancakes, french toast, to flavorful breakfast sandwiches, and over stuffed lunch sandwiches was like a cornucopia. So much selection! Since I went with a large group today I got to taste a lot of the menu! At least 5 items. But by far the must of today was the banana peanut butter chip pancakes. The buttermilk pancakes covered with a sweet banana cream sauce drizzled with a chocolate peanut syrup and sliced bananas was orgasmic.  When we got there there was no need to wait we were seated immediately, the service was beyond what I expected. We hardly had to ask for anything besides the check. The server was thoughtful and even a savior because one of my cousins had forgotten his iphone in the restaurant and she literally chased us down just to return it! Honest people, that is something I can appreciate. Satisfying food + Superb Service = Happy tummy and wallet.
