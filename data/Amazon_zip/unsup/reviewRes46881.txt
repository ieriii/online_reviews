I'd heard awesome things about this place from some locals, so I was excited when I was invited to a private brunch.  There's a parking lot in the back that I almost missed - it's not huge but you might be able to find a spot - enter off of Devon.  The space is awesome, very comfortable, lots of wood, great atmosphere. Lots of big tables that are perfect for groups.  We got to try: - potato latkes - tasty, huge (sort of too big), a little greasy - french toast with fruit, macadamia nuts, & cinnamon butter - decent - scrambled eggs with broccoli, leeks & cheddar - yum - 3 different kinds of sausage: turkey, pork, and chorizo - the turkey & chorizo were SPICY but great, the pork was sorta boring - bloody mary - perfect level of alcohol, VERY spicy, watch out!! My only complaint was that for this event, our food was served family-style but without any serving utensils. Sort of awkward when you're there with people you just met. But on the plus side, they brought more than enough food to share, so we weren't arm wrestling for the last piece of anything. I definitely want to come back for a regular meal!
