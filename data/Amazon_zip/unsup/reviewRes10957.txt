I once saw someone faint while waiting to be seated. Seriously, after about an hour of waiting, she just keeled over and her head hit the pavement. And she still had to wait a bit longer once she came to! So don't think fake fainting is going to get you a table sooner. If they tell you an hour wait--they mean about an hour and fifteen minutes. So yeah, the food is really good. Really good. Well worth some road rash.  The service ain't always so great though. On very busy days after about an hour of waiting, you still might have to wait 20 minutes for someone to bring you some coffee.  Here's my tip for enjoying the food: If you're there with others, make a deal with someone to switch plates 1/2way through. One person can get one of their delicious benedict dishes and someone else can get the pancakes. I feel like the pancakes are a bit too sweet to eat in one sitting but a 1/2 order of both is a great breakfast.
