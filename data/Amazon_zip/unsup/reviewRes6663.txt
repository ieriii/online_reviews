I have never eaten at the restaurant only gotten take away. I will tell you that this is the best barbecue in the city. Seriously. No other BBQ I've had in Chicago can touch this place. it is *that* good. seriously. and make sure they give you some of their home made chips. Damn they are delicious. and the pickles too! MmmMM!
