When I choose a hotel, I look for value, cleanliness and location. The Seneca Hotel offers all three points. For the location (a block off Michigan Av), other hotels in the area could not match the price of a room for the week-end I needed for my visiting relatives. The room, however outdated and somewhat dark, was clean and had a small kitchenette. The staff was friendly, the bellman very helpful. There are a few parking garages close by if you do not choose to use the hotel parking overnight (saving some money).
