What hasn't been said? Arrived at around 10:15am on a weekday morning and joined the handful of people hiding in their cars. Not much of a wait, even for my second round at 11am after a quick drive to the ATM down the street (CASH ONLY!). Four dogs and a cheesy fries later, I was ready to pass out on the floor. Foie gras and duck sausage was definitely the highlight. Not a big fan of the chicken sausage (kind of bland), but the ribeye sausage was awesome. Sure, it came out to a $40 meal for two, but I'll definitely be returning for future encased meat brunches.
