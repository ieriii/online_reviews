Tried it out again with some friends, and we all agreed that some of the staff need an attitude adjustment. Our server (female) seemed bothered when we couldn't decide what we wanted. I ordered the cauliflower and lentil dish and it was really good. Will be back to try some other dishes, but will go when it is not so crowded.
