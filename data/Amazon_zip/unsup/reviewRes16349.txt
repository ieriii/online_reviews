this place is legit. As someone visiting the city I certainly would not have known about this place if it weren't for a tip from a friend. I believe the likeness to Alice in Wonderland has already been made and i'll confirm it's true. The layout and design of the space really adds to the feeling that you're someplace special. I'll get to the drinks in a minute (at least the ones I remember) but want to first note that the food was actually quite good. The tempura string beans were the table favorite but I also enjoyed the Cubano sandwich and duck meatballs. Leave all stereotypes behind when it comes to the various liquors. In Violet Hour, gin doesn't remind you of licking the Green Tree hanging air freshener in your car...this stuff can actually taste damn good. My favorite drink was a take on a margarita with a spicy kick to it thanks to some special hand made jalapeno-esque concoction crafted behind the bar. The dark and stormy was also a personal favorite and after sampling many terrible ones across of a few major cities, this was in the top 2. The ingredient often ignored by those consuming.. ICE, also gets a design tweak here. Keep an eye out for the hand shaped ice cubes that fit the exact shape of the glass.  This place is a must visit but go early and avoid a potential line.
