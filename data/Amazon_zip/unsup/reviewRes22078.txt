I'd rather wait an hour in line at Hot Dogs and pay half the price! I can't believe how expensive it was. The hot dog wasn't anything special but the drive in concept is cute. I guess i was shocked I had a twenty and only got 3 bills back for 2 people to eat at a hot dog stand. What is this world coming to when a weiner is more than $5? Sads.
