5 Stars! I'd give this place 6 stars if I could. The service is awesome, everyone is so Nice. And the Food. WOW. It was so good I had to go back one last time before my flight left back to LA. Their Reuben Sandwich is soo good you have to do a triple take to make sure it's not meat. Their dumplings are amazing and I have to order the Cheese sticks every time I go. We went on a Thursday afternoon and there was no wait but on a weekend afternoon there was a 20 minute wait. But I would have waited an hour! Oh yeah and the "Country Fried Steak" WOW WOW WOW WOW!
