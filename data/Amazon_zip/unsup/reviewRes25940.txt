So, I've had a bit of a Pho problem lately -- one night last week I didn't feel like trekking all the way up to Argyle which is about a 25 minute drive from my house so I happened to find this little spot up on Lincoln. The Pho was alright -- not as big of a portion as Tank but still a lot of food. The service was excellent and the atmosphere is pretty cute. I would like to go back to try other dishes but probably wouldn't get the pho from here again. Or maybe I would if I was starving. ;-)
