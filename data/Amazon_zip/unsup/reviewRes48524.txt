Have been to The Publican several times now over the past month so I feel qualified to review it. I absolutely love The Publican for brunch and dinner, it's generally quite busy but they run such a smooth operation that you're never waiting very long for a table. Two weeks ago I had an incredibly delicious onion and ricotta tart. I've had a couple beers here based on the very knowledgeable recommendations from the servers which were great, and everyone I've been with that drinks bloody mary's won't shut up about how good they are. The food is delicious and the service is impeccable so I think The Publican is my favorite place in my neighborhood now!
