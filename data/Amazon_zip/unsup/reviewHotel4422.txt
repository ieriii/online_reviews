I had to walk a dog in this hotel once. Not only is parking down town impossible but they make worse. I had to go to this place 3 times on a weekend, (sat & sun) They wouldnt allow me to park in front. I ended up haveing to spend money for a parking garage. NO parking down town ever of course but when i got inside the staff at the front desks were rude. Like i was impossing on them. I was walking a dog for a wedding in their hotel you would think they would be more polite. But they werent
