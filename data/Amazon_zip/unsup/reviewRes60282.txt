One star for the food, which is on the right side of mediocre. One star for the fabulous lavender cookies. You heard, lavender, which turns out is a part of the peppermint family and it plays so nicely on your palette after a meal. Minus 3 stars for the service - horrible.The layout in general is pretty bad, you order at the counter then hope and pray for a table, the line is usually out the door, which i could deal with if after waiting in that line i didn't have to deal with this:counter chick: whadayawant?me: um... (looking at the menu that is posted on the wall and NOT visible when you're in line) counter chick: seriously? just pick something, everything is good.me (seeking any sign of humor on her face and finding none): ok, i'll take the huevos rancheros.counter chick: great. (eyes rolled) NEXT!So, counter chick, sorry I didn't know the rules of making your day a little easier, but that's not why i went there and its definitely why i won't be going back.UPDATE: i heard the blonde counter chick is actually the OWNER! For shame...
