I came in here a few days ago and the first thing I thought was that I'd stumbled into a militia meeting or the first stages of a stakeout - the back table was like eight cops, guns on hips - some standing and some sitting. My friends and I had a seat and had a great dinner - everything was fast and tasty. They did forget my spring rolls even though only four tables were full, but that's no big deal. The spicy cabbage is fantastic, but I hate the way they cook their tofu - which is to say that it's not cooked at all and comes out as slimy, tasteless cubes. Ick. And stay away from the mock chicken. I have no idea what it's made of but is served cold and looks alarmingly like a block of pressed tapeworms. Toward the end of the meal, we started to get nervous about cops standing in the kitchen, taking photos. We started wondering if someone had been killed in the kitchen. Not appetizing. So we asked our waiter, who told us that someone had run into the kitchen and taken off with the shrimp. My friend raised an eyebrow, since he'd just eaten some shrimp. We stifled our laughter until we were outside, and laughed about it the whole ride home. So minus one star for letting a gaggle of cops create a menacing presence instead of working (all on duty and eating and switching off between their table and the kitchen - Chicago's finest indeed). Supposedly it's impossible to get anything delivered or ready for pickup in less than an hour on some nights, so that sucks.
