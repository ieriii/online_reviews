Simply put, this place Never disappoints.  I've been here so many times, I've lost count. I could eat here every day of the week and never get sick of it. The service is always excellent and the food is phenomenal. I can't even recommend just one thing it's all THAT good. I don't even mind the long wait during prime time, and I'm an impatient person.  I love the atmosphere and especially love the outdoor seating during the summer. You can't beat sitting on the "patio" drinking a pear martini. Try this place. You won't regret it.
