Brunch at Longman & Eagle is really special & totally tasty.The most memorable dish of the table was the biscuits and gravy served with one hour eggs. This was a badass breakfast plate: the biscuits were huge and the gravy had bonus pieces of meat throughout! But the one hour eggs were the the most amazing thing: Not quite opaque, not quite translucent but a very appealing consistency. The waiter explained that they are cooked in the shell at a certain temperature for one hour and then heated once again before being served. Kind of like an egg sous-vide. I had the smoked salmon plate, which is one of the tamer menu choices. I really wanted to know what grated eggs were...hard boiled eggs, chopped. The plating made this a very special meal. It's served on a large square plate with the ingredients clustered in one corner to free up space for assembly. All the ingredients were fantastic, but I cannot stop thinking about how the bread was the perfect vehicle for all the goodies.My friend ordered a omelet stuffed with morels and nettles. I couldn't believe the number of morels inside! My friend also lucked out by ordering a series of mini items that were fun to play with: mini beer served alongside her bloody Mary, mini spoon and mini creamer served with her coffee. She loves mini things and was very happy.The dark wood interior looked really pretty in the daylight.
