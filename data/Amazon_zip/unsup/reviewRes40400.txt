It hurts me to rate this place so low because their breaded steak (Milanesa) is so good, but damn, their service is letting me down. The last 2 times that I've been here, they've gotten our orders wrong.  - The first time, my friend wanted the Milanesa Dinner, no tomatoes. Instead, they brought out a Milanesa Torta w/ tomatoes. - Then last night, we order the Milanesa Dinner. My friend said, "Milanesa" pointed at it on the menu, the waitress nods. I order the same thing with a side of extra cheese. She nods again. When the food comes out, she brings us two Carne Asada Dinners, no extra cheese. It tasted fine and all, but that's not what we ordered. You know what that's like? Its like wanting a PS3 for Christmas, getting the PS3 box, but inside is a really nice sweater. Nice, but its not what I wanted. I'm definitely going to come back here when the opportunity arises, I just hope they get my order right. Will I have to write it down for them? I hope not. I'm still jonesin' for some breaded steak. There is a place near my house that has it, not as as good, but at least they get my order right.
