Amazingly good vegetarian and vegan food. So good that my wife and I went twice on a two day trip to Chicago. Very friendly staff. The Radical Reuben is the sandwich to die for. Holy smokes. My only complaint is I was so satisfied from my sandwich I couldn't eat dessert. And the cakes looked super yummy!
