My Best memory of Chicago - hands down. When I lived here for a short while I would take every chance to go here. Whenever friends came to visit it felt like the perfect authentic experience to take them to. Great energy, always impressing music. Even years later I can remember the acts and the unique moments created between friends that were accentuated by the atmosphere.
