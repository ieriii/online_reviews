I'm not from Chicago. I looked up the best place to get Chicago pizza and this is what came up. I drove here, ate, and was 100% satisfied. Slice and a drink for just over $5. True Chicago style pizza. Good stuff. If you're from out of town and you're looking to get a slice of Chicago style pizza and nothing more, this place is a no brainer.
