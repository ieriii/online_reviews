Last couple times I have ordered, Fogo 2 Go has forgotten items, given me the wrong order, or the food has been immensely cold. Very frustrating. I have given up ordering from them because I just expect something to be wrong. I don't know what has happened. Pretty disappointing. Used to be my favorite go-to place.
