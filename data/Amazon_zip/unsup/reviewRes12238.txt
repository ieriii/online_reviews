Cafe 28 was the site of Roommate Date Version 2.0 (we wanted something that was different from Version 1.0, which was at Wildfire). Stacey A had already been, so I had pretty high expectations. The service wasn't bad, but it could have been a bit better. Our server was very polite, but she took her time bringing us things like the dessert menu, check, etc. The food definitely lived up to the hype. Stacey A had warned me beforehand that I would want to eat the butter by itself. She was 100% correct, and we may or may not have finished off the little ramekin of butter after the bread was gone. I ordered the tuna, and it was perfectly cooked and very tasty. I wish I'd paid closer attention to the menu, because I couldn't really identify the vegetable that came on top (beets? maybe?) but it was very well put-together. And the drinks! Cafe 28 serves Pisco Sours. These are...pretty much my favorite drink ever. And Cafe 28 does them well. I had been under the impression that the only place I could get something comparable to a Pisco Sour was at Violet Hour (their Iron Cross is very similar), but by some random luck, that drink is on the menu at a place right down the street from my house! I'm going to mark this down as a definite for going back for drinks (Pisco Sours, anyone?), and a most likely for dinner.
