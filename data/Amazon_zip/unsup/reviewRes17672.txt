Went here for a nice romantic Valentine's Day dinner and was really looking forward to it. The vibe is great, the decor and music really hit you and it's got an exciting feel. This place is huge! The hostess was very sweet, our server was attentive and nice, even though they were packed she would stop by our table to check on us throughout dinner. We started with the ceviche tasting, which was very fresh and delicious. My honey had Costilla de Res (braised short ribs) and I had the Churrasco (beef tenderloin). My beef was tender and a decent size piece, with a green garlic chimichuri sauce. As soon as our food was served, I looked at my plate and it looked as if it had been sitting for a bit before being served. The sauce didn't glisten, it looked almost like the plates had sat under a heat lamp or something. It was good, but I just found that a bit off-putting. I think we hyped ourselves up so much before going, reading reviews, then you get hit in the face with the exciting atmosphere. I would definitely go back, and give Carnivale a second shot, though.
