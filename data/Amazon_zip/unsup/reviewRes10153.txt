This review is for the BEER and for the great bartender and hosts, who rocked! We were visiting Chicago from San Fran and decided to take a field trip from our downtown financial district/tourist zone digs. We hopped on the blue line and set about our way towards the Wicker Park area, which we'd heard was a fun place to find some food/drink/etc...  Off the Damon stop and kicking around the neighborhood, there were several promising options- I veered towards an early dinner at a sushi or local foodie joint; my fiance not so much... so we kept on looking for a "fit" and found it in Piece.  "Let's grab a drink here, then look for dinner" he says, "okay, fine (local beer...yaya!)" I say...(Ahhh, the art of compromise:) So we walk in to what kind of looks like a barn/loft/brewery and at the direction of our friendly hosts, we sit at the bar to begin sampling their offerings.  I begin with the Kolsch which was great (and a Beer Cup winner), then the sampler, which took me on a tastebud-assault -roller-coaster ride (IPA's are as hoppppy as billed!!!!), and then to my eventual favorite, the (very tame by comparison) english style bitter. My man friend opted for the dark and curvy dunkelwiesen (sp?) which tasted like banana bread.  I thought about reserving a star for when we come back and try the pizza, but whatever, we're from California, and Piece shouldn't have to wait for it's extra star:) Another review for another time, I'm sure...
