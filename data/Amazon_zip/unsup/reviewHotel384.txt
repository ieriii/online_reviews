I've stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn at Times Sq and I kinda liked it, so when I came into town with the giant Peepster, I booked this hotel. Great, great location. It was about 4 blocks away from the Rock n Roll McDonalds, which had a lot adjacent that was guarded 24/7 and only costs 35 a day and could take oversized vehicles. There was food everywhere, plus the room had a microwave and fridge [jackpot! ramen night!] I didn't really like the beds, at all, though I don't remember what the beds were like at the one in NYC but these had really uncomfortable duvet covers that were all scratchy, and the beds were weirdly soft, even when I adjusted it to firm. I'm pretty out of touch with my body so it's hard to tell exactly what about it I didn't like, just a kind of dull, all over ache that's probably about 25% the bed's fault and 75% my extremely labor intensive job's fault. Bath and Body works amenities! [I'm such an amenities whore.]
