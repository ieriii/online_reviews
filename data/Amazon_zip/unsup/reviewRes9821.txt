Le Colonial is one of those Rush St favorites that you can never go wrong with. As soon as you walk in the door the atmosphere takes you away from the often cold and overcrowded touristy area that it is located to a lush and luxurious establishment where you immediately feel relaxed and revived. I more often then not skip the downstairs restaurant and head straight upstairs to the amazing bar with its cozy Southeast Asian vibe. Overrun with greenery and low comfy seating it is a great place to grab a drink and hang with friends in a private and laid back atmosphere. The cocktails and service are great and you can order food up there as well. Everything I have eaten here has been good, but nothing has blown me away which is why I can't give it the full five stars. Ambiance and location definitely boost this restaurants status and if they can just escalate the menu a bit then it would definitely receive an enthusiastic five stars from me. Either way, I would recommend Le Colonial to any shopper looking to escape the hustle and bustle of the area and enjoy a delicious mojito or stiff martini.
