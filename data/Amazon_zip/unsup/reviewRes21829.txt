This place is unique and fabulous, hands down. I am a lover of sandwiches, but sometimes have a hard time finding one that really stands out since there are so many great sandwich places in Chi-town. But, this one did it for me.  I came here for lunch and as expected, it was PACKED, with a line out the door. We probably waited about 40 minutes, but it was well worth it. I ordered a sandwich with pulled pork and the pork was one of the most tender, juicy and flavorful pork's I have ever tasted. It came on wheat bread which was soft, chewy and delicious, and although I am forgetting exactly what else was on my pork sandwich, it doesn't matter because it was something fabulously tasty and you couldn't go wrong with this selection. My mom had a sandwich with chicken which was also superb, and my dad had a cream of squash soup along with a sandwich made as vegetarian friendly as you could get. What I mean by this is, the only downfall of this place is the lack of truly vegetarian options. There is one dinner bowl that is vegetarian but not available for lunch, and many other things although they don't contain a slab of actual meat, we found have been cooked with meat. This was a little frustrating and disappointing mainly for my Dad, but the quality and tastiness of the food could not be questioned. I am all for communal seating and meeting the people next to you, and it worked out great here, although always packed they did have a good system of ensuring that no one is left standing with no table after waiting 40 minutes in line to order your meal. It is a little small though and I personally feel it would be a good idea to expand to have more seating, but hey, that's just me. The Mexican-style spicy hot chocolate was rich and delicious, a perfect end to an almost perfect meal. Next time I will leave room for the churros that everyone raves about, I just couldn't do it this time.
