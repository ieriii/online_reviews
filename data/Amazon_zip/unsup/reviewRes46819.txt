Uncommon Ground has been a fantastic addition to Rogers Park. I've been for lunch and dinner several times during the past few years, and each time I've been pleased. Good eats include the sunshine salad, fish tacos, and the Reuben (with sweet potato fries), and the mac and cheese. The bar area is cozy and fun, and the cocktails are mighty tasty (I'm a fan of the caramel Manhattan). This place has developed a great neighborhood feel, but even if you're not a regular, the staff go out of their way to make you feel welcome, whether you're with kids, in a big group, or on a date night. Also suggested for Loyola students looking for a place to take you're parents when they're in town (and willing to pay!).
