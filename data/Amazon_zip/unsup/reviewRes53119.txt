I really wanted to like this place, but I had a hard time finding positives about our experience this past Sunday. So here goes: The good: The prices are pretty affordable. The so-so: The food was fine. Not spectacular, but not bad either. The Cuban sandwich and tostones are comparable to what you would find in the city. The horrible: I can't think of another time we were so put off by the service. Our waiter seemed so distracted we had a feeling our order would be wrong. It was. Even after repeating it to him 3 times. Also, the side orders came about 20 minutes after our entrees. Finally, the veggie sandwich said it had portabella mushrooms. Should not have been plural in the menu. We had to search pretty hard to find the 1 tiny sliver of portabella.
