Came here with a few girlfriends for pizza n beer! It's a fun no frills kinda place. The large pizza is freaking huge! It says it feeds 3-5 but more like 6-8. We had four girls with us n we took half of the pizza home. The salad was ok but the pizza was great. 4 stars for pizza service n atmosphere!
