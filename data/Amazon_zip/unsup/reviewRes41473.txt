The steak is "oh-so buttery delicious"!!! I had dinner here with some of my family earlier this winter. The ribeye steak I ordered came on a super hot and buttered plate, and the ribeye was super tender and cooked to perfection (medium rare). It was so succulent I didn't even need steak sauce. It came with a large piece of broccoli, which was just okay. Pairing the steak with a nice cabernet is a good choice too haha. But again the steak was Really good and this is why we came, so mission accomplished. In addition, the service was very good, attentive and very courteous to us. The location of this place is in downtown Chicago, so parking is scarce, and valet is a good choice if you can't find meter parking. Although the steak is pricey at $40 for a steak, I'm giving this place 5 stars because you come here for a good steak and you will still be surprised at how awesome it is.
