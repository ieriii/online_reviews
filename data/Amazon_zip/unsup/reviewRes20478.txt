The food here is great. Everything I've tried so far has been top notch. I had the torta ahogada. My brother had the chirqueso torta, and my friend Jose had the milanesa sandwich. The torta ahogada was amazing, the pulled pork was just right, the tomato based sauce the torta was dipped in was on point. It was a little pricey like others have mentioned, but definitely worth the treat. Word of advice, a line does form at times so expect to wait 30 minutes just to get in.
