We went here after I flew in on a Friday afternoon. Luckily it must have been a slow Friday afternoon because we waited in line for no more than 30 minutes or so. Luckily there was plenty to look at while waiting in line; from the people driving by asking "are y'all really waiting in line for dat? Is it dat guud?" to all the kitschy wiener-related decorations in the place. My favorite had to be the boys/girls bathroom signs. Boys get a hot dog in a bun, girls just get a bun. If you can't figure out with door to go in, that's your own fault. I ordered a standard Chicago Dog and a corn dog, along with the duck fat fries. I wouldn't say the duck fat fries are a reason enough to eat here, but they're pretty good, I guess. I didn't find that there was too much of a difference between them and regular fries. I'm sure some people would disagree but I wasn't terribly impressed. I was however impressed at how delicious and crunchy my corn dog was. The Chicago dog was delightful, the meat was tasty and all the toppings including the blinding-ly bright green relish were perfect. The constant flow of in and out traffic made seats available at all times. You wait in line, you order, you sit, you eat, and you get out. It's very simple. I'm not sure exactly what happened at 4pm, but there were definitely still a handful of people in line and I THINK they went to check who was last in line AT 4pm and once that person was inside the door they put a sign up behind him/her and cut off the rest of the line. They're very strict about their closing time which I think is OK. If you don't get there early enough it's your own fault for missing out. Hot Doug's is a definite must-try when visiting Chicago.
