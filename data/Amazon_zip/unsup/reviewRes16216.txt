Andersonville staple. Have not had a bad meal yet, great service and they do accept reservations. If you happen to come on a Saturday they typically have classics of Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra being sung in the background. Also huge flat screens in the bar area to watch the game. Great wine selection and a wide array of Italian food and american food as well, give the ribs a shot.
