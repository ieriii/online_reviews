Finally came here for Sunday brunch, so that's the only meal I can speak for. The place was nice, bright and cozy, and packed, so be prepared to wait in line (didn't ask about reservations). All of the servers I noticed, but especially ours, use this extra smiley high-pitched "I am so friendly" voice (think twee), which was artificial and unnerving, but I'm sure a lot of people will appreciate it. The food was mostly Mexican-fusion, and quite good. Almost everything came with some kind of chilli sauce, so I had to avoid a lot of the dishes. Unfortunately, I still got a dish that had chipotle sauce in it, even though the description on the menu didn't state it. I get a weird bitter allergic reaction to it, but tried to keep eating anyway. The server offered to exchange the dish for another one (which I accepted), but she looked upset and avoided us for the rest of the meal. The next dish I got was a breakfast sandwich with egg and spinach, and it was pretty good (not blown away, but decent and the ingredients were nice and fresh). In the end, however, our bill was the most expensive for any brunch we've been to in recent memory (including M'Henry, Tweet, Toast, and many more). Even though the food amount was comparable. The place is nice, but not nice enough to become our go-to brunch place.
