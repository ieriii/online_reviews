Nuevo Leon is all about expectations. Expect delicious, spicy, greasy, home-y mexican food. Expect it to be busy, probably a line. Expect that awkward moment when they try to seat you by the front door (cold!) or in the front room by the line to get in, where everyone waiting awkwardly stares at your food and listens to your conversation...(i swear that room is "gringos only") Expect shitty service. Finally, expect the best tortillas ever. I swear the only reasons I come back are the tortillas, salsa, and breakfast. I never venture outside new lion's breakfast menu, and nuevo leon always meets my expectations.
