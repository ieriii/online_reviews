My boyfriend bought a groupon for this place and we came here on a Saturday night. The place has the dimly lit cozy romantic feel to it though our table was a bit cramped ad I was constantly afraid of brushing elbows with the table next to me. Our waiter was helpful in helping us decide what to get, we had the fondue dinners that starts with a salad, then a fruit and bread cheese fondue. We then had the beef and lobster & prince geja's combination. The main course was very good, we weren't sure how long to the meat but our waiter was very helpful with that and we just kept pulling the food in/out the water. We both agree that we enjoyed the dessert most:Chocolate fondue with fruit and a marshmallow. Price is a bit high even with the groupon compared to the places we usually go but it was a great romantic date place. Probably won't be going back anytime too soon but was a great place for us to try fondue for the first time
