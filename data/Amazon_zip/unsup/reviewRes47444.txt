Update: I went here on Tuesday with a group of friends. Wow. I've never dealt with such a rude server in my life. This girl must've thought I stole her boyfriend or something. She was so angry and just...mean. I would go as far as to say I think the kitchen might have messed with our food order, too. We tried to blow it off and enjoy the beautiful weather, but it was so abrasive it actually ruined the whole experience. I'd rather pay $3 more a beer & not deal with such a cranky hag. Never again.
