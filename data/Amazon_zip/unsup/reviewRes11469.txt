At last! I've been hearing about the Bongo Room forever- open any Chicago magazine or newspaper and it will tell you that their pancakes reign supreme in the WIndy City. Went this morning with a friend and avoided a long wait by sitting at the counter. Got the vegetarian croissant sandwich (filling but you will not look attractive trying to eat it!) and my friend got the breakfast burrito, recommended by a fellow counter diner. We couldn't decide between the sweet pancakes (brown sugar and apple... red velvet... oh my!) and opted for one piece of the Chocolate French Toast Tower. This thing covers an entire plate. It comes out covered in bananas, chocolate shavings, and a banana white chocolate sauce. I seriously have no idea how you could finish a full order. I cannot wait to go back. If I could, I would tomorrow. In short: 1) Get counter seating if with a small group and starving 2) Ignore the people ogling your food- it's too good to look away. 3) If you have the stomach for it, grab a full order of sweet pancake options or the french tower. If not, split it with your group or get one piece- that can be breakfast on its own. 5 out of 5. Fantabulous.
