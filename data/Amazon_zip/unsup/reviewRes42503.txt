I really wanted to love this place. The atmosphere and ambiance are pretty cool, with nice but casual furnishings and a gentle amber lighting scheme.  Unfortunately, the menu items are fairly hit or miss for the most part. We had some really good items: the ricotta gnocchi were fantastic, the mashed potatoes in chicken jus was really tasty, the pot roast was tender and absurdly flavorful, and the mussels were also a good dish (served with a massive side of sourdough for dipping into the delicious mussel broth). We also had some really disappointing items, including a salad with shallot vinaigrette ($8 for a small plate of just lettuce with a very simple light dressing), the pork meatballs and grits (delicious grits, but couldn't have been more than 3 oz of slightly burnt meatballs), and the asparagus (really tasty but I couldn't bring myself to avoid feeling slighted after paying $8 for 6 spears of asparagus). The cocktails were innovative and delicious. The service was solid if unspectacular. I could probably have a better dining experience the 2nd time around now that I know some of what to and what not to order. Maybe I'll be back.
