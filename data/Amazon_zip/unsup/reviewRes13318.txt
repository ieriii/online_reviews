I have a really hard time finding a place that will please my father, my step-mom and my kid sister, but Glenn's does it. The atmosphere is fast-casual, service is more than friendly. The food is spectacular. I mean, food you would expect from a high-end surf-n-turf house downtown, but none of the pretense.This is a great place to go to just relax with your family. The only problem is that word got out, so it's very popular. What can I say? They deserve it.
