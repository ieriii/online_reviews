I love this place!!! Always have, even when they looked like an old Greek tavern!Just was there yesterday and had a great time, the drinks were lovely and the food is amazing! Try the baked clams, one of my favorites. The manager is a good guy, always trying to cater to everyone. Love the garlic mash too! mmm Yum! Ever in Chicago, have to try this place!
