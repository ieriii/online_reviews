I love greek if you dont believe me check my review of Barba Yianni Grecian Taverna in Lincoln Square. This place underperforms in soooo many ways that I'm disappointed in my first experience in Greek Town. The tzatiki and saganaki were small and not very flavorful. To get any bread there we basically had to beg making it near difficult to eat our appetizers. Their chicken lemonato and moussaka was lacking in pizzaz and was the sauce was runny. Their wasn't greek rice or anything with it. And we were almost rushed through the dinner. Before we were even done eating we were asked what we wanted for dessert with me having to ask the waiter to leave my dish alone as he tried to clear the table. Not the experience I was hoping for and I can't say I'm looking forward to a return trip to Greek Town one day. I'l head to Lincoln Square for my Greek food.
