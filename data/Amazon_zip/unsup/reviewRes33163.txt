When I plan trips the only thing I ever leave out is breakfast joints. Why? Because most of the time, I'm not quite sure if I'll be up when they stop serving it. However, I was lucky enough to travel with some ambitious friends on my trip to Chicago. We were actually up by 10 am by most mornings, thus leaving our stomachs empty and craving some yummy goodness. Since, I had no prior planning I was lost...BUT, I had the yelp app. I looked for an affordable breakfast place within walking distance. YOLK popped up and what do I see? A Houston yelper, but a HOUSTON YELPER I STALK?! Has given it 4 stars? I was sold. I went on a weekday so it wasn't too packed, trust me we tried on the weekend and it was about a hr wait.  I had the pot roast benedict. OMG. I think this is by far the best version of eggs benedict I had ever consumed. I even tried some of my friend's salmon benedict, and it was delicious but just not on the same level as the pot roast. The pot roast was so tender and full of flavor. The best part?! They give you a silly bandz with their name on it!
