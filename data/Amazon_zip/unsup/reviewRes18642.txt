Came here to meet up with some friendly folks I met at 'Yelp rocks The Southern.' No one had been here before but I heard the burgers were new and exciting. Got there a little early and while we were waiting decided to sample some of their beer. It's saying something when the beer selection his larger than the food menu WITH an extra insert just for the drafts. I started with the Founders Dirty Bastard ale, a Scotch style ale which was pretty good, not as malty a Scotch ale but good. I then tried Eric's Ale a spiced sour beer from the maker's of Fat Tire it was an interesting beer to say the least, more tart than sour and fruity, like a good lambic. I switched to the Domaine Dupage as my last one- a recent favorite. Oh wait, I ordered food too! As a starter I got the Montreal Poutine which was okay. I've actually had poutine before and the gravy really wasn't as rich or salty as I liked. The housemade ketchup was sweeter than used to but still pretty good. On suggestion from my friend who had been there before I tried the Frenchie. A burger with brie, spinach, truffle and fried red onion strings. It was okay-it was good but I've had better burgers and not from a fancy burger place either. Our server was a little slow, but once our whole party showed up +4 extra he was all over the place. Strangely, more people brought better service. We also had to move tables to accommodate all of us and he had no problems with it.
