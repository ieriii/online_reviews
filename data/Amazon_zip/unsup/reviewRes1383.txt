Yes, HD's is delish. Yes, its always crowded and there's a line around the block. Yes, most of the patrons are now tourists (therefore annoying). Yes, its worth the extra cash and the trek from the West Loop. But after only two trips (one Pre-Bourdain and one Post-Bourdain), I don't think I'll be going back until it looses popularity....which isn't going to happen. Its just not worth the hassle!
