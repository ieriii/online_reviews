Given the rave reviews on this site and my own experience last week, I have to wonder if I'm even thinking about the same restaurant, because this place was 'Simply Terrible.' The night started off bad when we were informed that they'd run out of tofu. This struck us as odd since it was only 7:30 pm and tofu could have easily been had at any number of nearby grocery stores. We shrugged it off, however, and opted instead for the only two vegetarian dishes that did not originally come with tofu. Unfortunately, despite being told that our dishes would be prepared with soy sauce instead of the usual oyster sauce, we were in fact served a quite boring selection of veggies prepared in the distinctly gooey and fishy sauce o' the oyster. Again, we shrugged it off and choked down some veggies coated in fish goo while we enjoyed the company of a meat-eating friend whose own dish of clay pot chicken was reportedly also quite lackluster due to the curious lack of veggies that were supposed to accompany the protein. ('Perhaps she'd like some of my veggies?' I thought to say, but didn't.) Several servers who clearly did not communicate well with one another asked us if we wanted dessert, which we declined. Our waiter (or one of them, I should say) made a comment about how he didn't think we'd have room for dessert given how much food we'd ordered (charming, right?) and then proceeded to ignore us for 20 minutes as we patiently waited for our check--which we only actually got after requesting it at the front counter. If bringing your own bottle of wine to dinner and not paying a corkage fee provides you with that much of a thrill and you don't mind eating over-priced, bland Asian fusion, then perhaps Simply It is for you.
