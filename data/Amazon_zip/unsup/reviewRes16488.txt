Went to Carnivale on a Tuesday night. As soon as I walked in, I was in love with the decor. Very happy and colorful, but not overdone. Once seated, a few members of our party ordered the drink which was on special, which was the Caipirinha. When the drink arrived, it was PACKED with ice, so much so, that it was almost impossible to stir, and was nearly finished with two sips! I will say that the drink was tasty though. . . it was a pretty much an limeade cocktail! I love limes, so this was plus for me.  As an appetizer, we ordered the Ceviche Tasting of 3, and the Shrimp was definitely the most flavorful! As the main course, I ordered the Pollo Estilo Billy... which is a chicken breast rubbed with spices. I must say it was some of the most flavorful chicken I have ever had. But, the side for this dish was papas fritas (french fries), which were somewhat disappointing, very blah. I did get to taste the rice and beans that came with the Arrachera, and they were delicious! For dessert, the Tres Leches was ordered. I must say it was disappointing. Not only was it not very flavorful, but it also came topped with blueberry sauce (not a fan) and with this strange basil-cream sauce on the side. I must say it was also the driest tres leches I have ever had. On the upside, the ice cream dessert I tasted was very good. Overall, I like this place, because I believe it has potential. I may have just ordered the wrong dishes this time. I will be back, and hopefully will be wowed my my meal next time.
