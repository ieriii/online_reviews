I am a New Yorker and wanted to try "Chicago Deep Dish Pizza" Well, put it this way, I am glad i was brought up on New York style Pizza. I was not impressed at all with Ginos East. I did a little research before i selected my Chicago-style pizza restaurant. and came up with Ginos. Maybe I picked a bad pizza place, or I just dont like deep dish?! The atmosphere was pretty cool and different. I enjoyed my experience, but wasnt impressed. I order the meat lovers deep dish. should of stuck with the traditional Cheese/Pep
