I am definitely a thin crust kinda girl but since I was in Chicago, I had to have deep dish pizza. The wait was sooo long and I was getting really antsy. Good thing we were able to pre-order so that the pizza was already ready when we were finally seated. The slices were (obviously) huge and very filling. Since there is so much topping (or filling), you're able to taste the quality of the ingredients used.
