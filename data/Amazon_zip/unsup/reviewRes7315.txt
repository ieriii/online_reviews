How did I not eat here when I lived in Chicago in 2005-06!? Man, did I miss out. Food: 5 stars (everything was fantastic, the portions are HUGE which makes it an above average deal for the money. and don't overlook the Stella salad it was honestly the best salad I have every had.) Wine: 4.5 stars (the only knock being the first 2 bottles I ordered they did not have. but otherwise our wine pairing was excellent and the list is expansive) Ambiance: 4 stars (the only thing that did not blow us away, the room is kind of small and it gets PACKED which can make it feel a little crowded. the other issue is that there isnt any room for people to wait so they stack up all around the door but inevitably end up crowding around some of the tables near the door. glad we didnt get sat there!) Service: 5 stars (knowledgeble and charismatic waitress, she was extremely busy but never showed it and took the time to seem genuine. great attitude) This is the best Italian food I have had in Chicago, after dining at maybe a dozen places in the city.
