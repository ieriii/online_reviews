Ok so The Bongo Room was pretty much everything I expected. Super duper decedant everything-the food is freaking awesome-the wait staff is superb..they manage to stay friendly and accomodating amidst the chaos...and let me tell you there was chaos.  It was incredibly busy for breakfast--had to wait--but not too long (about 15 to 20 minutes). Got the sense that this is (or was) a total indi/laid back breakfast nook that has since been overrun by wicker park's stuffy new residents (yuppie lincoln park transplants)-- I really don't care who I offend by saying this because it is true--And for all you Lula devotees--it's only a matter of time! Anyway--came with two other people--we're somewhat ragtag--but we certainly felt jome cold hard stares from a few prada bag wearing customers.  All that said...I will be back--the food is amazing--the wait staff is great- but next time I think I'll wear some old time--ankle sinched sweatpants just to piss some people off.
