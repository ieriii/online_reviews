Went here with some colleagues on a Monday night based on a suggestion from a Chicago friend. We did have a reservation (there were 7 of us) but it didn't seem too crowded. We were seated right away and were encouraged to order family style by our server. I got the saketini to start off the dinner and it was delicious and refreshing. We ordered a ton of food and there were no complaints (and hardly any talking) from anyone, including the meat and potatoes guy who is afraid of sushi! My hands-down favorite was the crouching pig, hidden lobster roll. It's a clever name (win!) and it was DELICIOUS! I will definitely be returning to Sunda. My only complaint is that it's a bit pricey, but work was paying so who cares?!
