Sad, I used to love Peaquod's but after my recent visit, not so much. It's not really deep dish, more like a thicker pan. Definitely more crust than anything, but the major disappointment was the sauce. It was lackluster, and left a lot to be desired. If all I wanted was a basic tomato sauce, I could have done that on my own. Sauce definitely makes or breaks a pizza for me and this definitely left me wanting for more elsewhere. Toppings were plentiful but again, the sauce. The place itself is huge! Two stories that span the entire flat. Service was friendly. Our server was always on point when it came to making sure we were hydrated. Price-wise, a bit pricey but definitely nothing that will break the bank.
