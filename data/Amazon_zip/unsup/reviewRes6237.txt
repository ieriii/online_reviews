I was in Chicago today and had the opportunity to eat here for lunch. Never even heard of it. Great building. The exterior is very "Phoenix". Lots of stones, warm colors -- but then you enter through a revolving door, which is a little odd for a building on its own. As you walk in, everything inside is rich, dark colors. Great seating, we were seated at a large corner booth, very plush leather booth, perfect for business conversations. They have a great menu - steaks, chops and seafood. My colleagues had some type of a crabcake dish, but I can't remember I wasn't listening I was still taking in the interior of the restaurant. Really nice.....I had the salmon w/glazed potatoes. They brought cornbread as the "bread", it had actual corn in it. Delicious. They had a great selection of martinis, but since it's business meeting, i skipped and had cranberry/ginger ale mix. My salmon was delicious, cooked perfectly and the potatoes were amazing. I think the crabcakes had blue cheese in it and my colleagues couldn't stop talking about it. 1 of them also had the soup of the day and I believe he inhaled it. Some kind of a cheese/broccoli soup...maybe, like I said I was paying attention to the bar area and the interior of the room. It's like they really studied space planning. Anyway, next time you're in Chicago - I highly recommend it. Not cheap by any means, but lunch entrees aren't too bad. Around $13-$21 per entree.
