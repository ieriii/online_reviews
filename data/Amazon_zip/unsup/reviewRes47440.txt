Here's how I would rate it: food good, three stars, service excellent, four stars. Just because how often do you go to a restaurant and the people are friendly, nice and very attentive, it was noticably good service. Even on half priced burger day which is amazing. The food as everyone else has said is NO KUMA'S. It's good but not omg wonderful. Which is sad because I love Kuma's but that wait is ridiculous. So I will go back for sure but it's not my favorite burger place in the city.
