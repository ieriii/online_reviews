Meli's has the best breakfast menu that I have ever seen. It is so hard for me to go try other brunch places because I just love this place so much. They have every pancake, french toast, omelet, and eggs benedict you can imagine. There is so much to try on the menu but I just can't get away from the veggie eggs benedict. The service is excellent. The only downside is that there is often a 30 minute or more wait if you go after 10 am on the weekend and I sometimes feel a bit rushed to get the table seated after me.
