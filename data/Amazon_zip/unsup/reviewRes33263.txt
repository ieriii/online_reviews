Yolk is a place that keeps things classy while offering a menu full of special and simple meals at a very good price. It caters to the Sunday brunchers and the weekday neighbors, with eggstravant (shoot me but I had too) choices and simple ones to spare. It's bustling and busy, but you get your good service. You'll wait for a while if you come in at rush hour, but you won't be cramped into a corner or sitting in the lap of someone else's fiance while you try to enjoy a good meal.--Spacious still, booths and tables alike. You won't be surprised when I say that Yolk's forte is its eggs. One of the few restaurants whose cooks deliver at the request of an over-medium egg, and make beautifully shaped poached eggs. Favorites include the benedicts and the skillets. I'm not totally in love with scrambled eggs so when I tell you that the omelettes are okay, that probably means they're pretty good.  But I'm telling you: there's a reason the place is called Yolk. Choose how you want your main dish and then pick your accompaniments accordingly. Pancakes are nice and fluffly. French toast is good too. My only tiny disappointment is that the corned beef hash is from the can, so I'll steer clear from that dish and remain happy with other options. Yolk offers pretty big portions and manages to have healthy options too. There's a good range of a lunch menu as well. Come to Yolk, for the love of eggs!-- or at least to pick up those cute sillybandz on your way out.
