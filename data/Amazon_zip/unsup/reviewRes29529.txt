This place where be forever remembered in my heart - You know when you're in that awkward stage with someone you're dating and sometimes you'll go a week within seeing each other? The guy (now boyfriend) that I had been dating for literally 3 weeks and myself went here for dinner during our awkward phase. It is a quaint little place.. (we chose this place instead of the Tin Lizzie for obvious reasons..smells like a vomit pit), very simple and it's attached to a great bar (from reviews that's I've read). The pasta selection was great. We had drinks, salads, and pasta and our bill came out to about $30... not bad. The service was outstanding.
