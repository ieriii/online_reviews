I love the fact that they bring warm bread and feta cheese out to every table. I have been here a few times and it is funny, I always seem to have the same waitress (I wish I had her name to compliment her)...she is always very nice! The food here is great. We usually will get a chicken dish and a lamb dish. I tried the Lebanese white wine on the last trip and it was delicious! It might be one of my new favorites.
