Went with a real cuban from Miami and he said it was the most authentic Cuban food he's had since moving to Chicago. His only critique was that they didn't use authentic Cuban bread, but like every other Cuban sandwich shop in town, they use french bread. The Cuban and Media Noche sandwiches we had (even with the "wrong" bread) were delicious and so filling. The staff is super friendly too!
