We were in downtown Chicago for the evening and had heard a great deal about the Purple Pig... and we thought, why not? Here is what we had: The pigs ear: This was really good. Salty, meaty, pork goodness, with crunchy kale topped off with a perfectly fried egg? A.Maz.Ing.  Seriously, there was some crunch, some tang, and a touch of sweetness... a great way to start off the meal. Salt Roasted Beets with Goat Cheese: I love beets... I grow a garden in the summer specifically so that I can grow beets... and roast them. These beets were cooked well and the creaminess of the goat cheese topped it off perfectly. Tasty. Fried Brussels sprouts: This was interesting. I have never had anything quite like these... very light, almost an airy quality about them, great flavor, with a touch of lemon. Tasty! JLT: More ooey, gooey fried egg goodness on top of Jamon Serrano, lettuce, tomato, and bread... We got the egg running, and sunk our teeth in. Quite tasty. Turkey Leg: Ok, nothing screams good eating quite like a turkey leg the size of my arm sitting on a plate. Cook that bad boy in pork fat and not only does it scream healthiness, but it screams eat me as well. My wife and I tore into the turkey leg and it was all that I could do to keep her from licking the plate. I was skeptical at first, because it is a turkey leg, and I will get one in a month at Thanksgiving... but this was probably the best turkey leg I have ever eaten, and I may need to kidnap the chef for thanksgiving so that I can get one next month. We finished it up with the Sicilian Iris. Let's talk about this... imagine a freshly fired doughnut, stuffed with chocolate and cannoli filling. Hot, gooey, amazingness that is worth making the trip from Long Island to Chicago for just about any night of the week. This was really the star of the night for us. This was a great night, our server was fantastic (Kelly), she even gave us breakfast tips for tomorrow morning.
