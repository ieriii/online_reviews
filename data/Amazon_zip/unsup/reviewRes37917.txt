The pizza is big, and filling, but not very good. If your goal is to eat an obscene amount of food and contribute significantly to world hunger, Giordanos is the place for you. Go order their stuffed pizza, which is essentially a wheel of cheese with a crust. The first few bites are usually quite delicious, largely because of the 45 minutes to an hour wait that makes you desperately hungry. Unfortunately, the pizzas lack much flavor, taste rather monotonous, and, as a result, eating quickly becomes a chore.
