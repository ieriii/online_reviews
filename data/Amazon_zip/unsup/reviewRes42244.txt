Tartariffic! I first tried gilt bar on a friend's recommendation for their house made pastas and great drinks but I've gone back 3 times for the most amazing dish I've ever eaten. Yes, their steak tartar is the best thing I've ever had in my life. This isn't Gordon gecko's mound of raw meat with an egg cracked over it. We are talking perfectly seasoned and chopped beef with a slow poached egg and the most delicious horseradish youl'll ever have. Served with wonderfully toasted bread that is somehow crunchy and chewy at the same time. Gurkins are a nice touch but I'd say pocket them for the kids when you get home. I must add that before trying their tartar I'd never tried the dish before. Since that first time I've tried a dozen others and this one is like no other. Last night I satisfied my two month long craving for this delicious dish and it was nearly spoiled by the the ribeye we shared for "dessert". The ribeye was so good that it almost erased the tartar from my palette. Served sliced for sharing with a side of steak salt and another of delicious bErnaise I was simply amazed. Our server said they sear it and then let it rest for an hour and then bring it up to temp to serve. I'll be trying this technique all summer long if the result is he same. Gene's, gibsons, maestros, and the rest can take a cue from this place. Awesome pistachio ice cream (better than oberweis) and a superb chocolate cream pie to finish off the night....enough said. Gilt bar, I think I love you.
