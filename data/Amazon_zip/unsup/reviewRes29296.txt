I about gave up on this place after some terrible deliveries this past spring, and I see that other yelpers reporting in this time period agree. Just ordered from Spoon instead. Ordered last night, and the food has never been better. Gosh, if they got the consistency down this place would be really great, but you never quite know what you are going to get. Started with fish cakes and Tiger cry. Both were excellent. For the entrees, had the rice dish with ground chicken and basil, and a delicious green curry with eggplant and tofu. Both of these were OUTSTANDING in a way that the food has not been in the past. Kudos to the new chef! Will give them 5 stars if the quality of the food delivered is no longer a game of roulette. If you have been staying away because of the inconsistency, now may be the time to give them another try.
