The best seafood I have ever had! I always make a point of going there when I go back to Chicago to visit. There are two parts of Shaw's - the more formal side (the main dining room) and "The Oyster Bar." I have only eaten in the main dining room once - I think The Oyster Bar is more fun and would recommend dining on that side to anyone who goes. It's a nice, relaxed atmosphere and on some nights there is live music which makes it even better! The only thing that makes me hesitate a bit is that it always gets a little expensive and on weekends the wait can be long!
