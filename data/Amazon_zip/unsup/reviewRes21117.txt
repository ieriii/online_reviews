This place starts out promising but ends with an eh. The appetizers and soups are really unique and delicious, but the entrees are just ok. The scotch egg (deep fried, hard boiled egg with this awesome dijon mustard) is something I had never tried, probably would not have tried if someone else hadn't ordered it to share, but will always order in the future because it is so surprisingly good. I went to a cocktail party here with some passed horsd'oeuvres, and those were excellent. They went above and beyond typical passed horsd'oeuvres, serving deconstructed chicken wings and fish and chips in newspaper. But the entrees I have ordered sounded great on paper, and then were just ok. Last time I had the steak salad, which the most bitter greens and no dressing to counteract its bitterness. The beef was kobe but lacked any flavor to justify the fat. I would come back here for after work drinks and appetizers, but skip dinner for later.
