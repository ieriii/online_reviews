The deserts are really good! The cakes are also really pretty. And the people serving you are kind of hot *wink wink* hahaha. I especially like the raspberry oatmeal bar. Soooooo good. I'm not sure if I'm coming back for the raspberry bar or because I think they guy that works there is a totally hottie. Either way, I'll be going back and I definitely recommend this place. haha
