Like several other reviewers, I feel that the pizza is fantastic, but the service seriously leaves something to be desired. You can't beat the pizza/growler combo for $25 on Sundays, and the best part is that it's to-go only so you don't have to deal with the servers/bartender. I gave Piece 4 chances to have a good experience, and every single time we were disappointed. It's like the application has the question: "Are you capable of being a complete douchebag to your customers?" and only hires girls who can enthusiastically answer "yes!".
