I would just give it three stars because I don't think the salad bar is as great as everyone else does apparently! But overall it probably deserves more than that so I'll be nice. Before I went, I heard the salad bar was so phenomenal, but it didn't knock my socks off, and that's basically what I was there for! I didn't order the meat (its not really worth it if you don't eat red meat since there might be one chicken option in there, maybe something else, I can't really remember) so can't comment on that, but as far as cow goes, it looked pretty good and cool that they cut it right there for you.  I thought the experience was pretty nice in general- that is, if you come hungry!! My bf and his dad (who took us there to celebrate our law school graduation) stuffed themselves silly, so its definitely possible to eat your money's worth but ONLY if you come starving. And if you're ok with your cholesterol skyrocketing! I didn't care too much about getting my money's worth since I wasn't paying, and was only getting the salad bar, which was somewhere around $20? I remember them having really good bread too, and good drinks. And yummy desserts.  Serivce was obviously very good, they are very quick to come by when someone at your table flips their card, and the waitress we had for non meat items was also very quick Great for meat-eaters, decent for others, overall something worth trying
