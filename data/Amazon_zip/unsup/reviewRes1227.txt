My fiancee just HAD to go here for "fine" dining lunch. One hour before it closed on Saturday (closing is 4 pm by the way), we found ourselves waiting in a line that curled around the corner. We waited for about twenty minutes and once we were inside the doors, the restaurant could have used some better ventilation, 'twas smoky from the grill! The point is - always expect a wait. We even showed up at 10:30 (opening) and we waited for fifteen minutes. OK OK, I'll be nice. I ordered the Blue Cheese Pork Sausage with Pear Creme Fraiche and Toasted Hazelnuts $7 and as it was VERY delectable; it was more of a $5 meal. Yes, the Duck Fat Fries were great -- but for $3.50 -- you can fry anything in reused vegetable oil and it tastes pretty damn good. Doug, who is very friendly (having a million dollar business must help! ;)  ) was working the ordering counter, the tip jar looked as if it was only for the other staffers which was more incentive to tip & the wait staff was quick at clearing tables during the busy rush for the next customer. Next time, I'll stick with the plain ol fries. I swear the Duck Fat Fries kinda tasted the same as the plain ones after Fry # 15 and I'll show up at 3:46 pm when nobody is in line. That way I can enjoy my dog and a conversation without feeling like I was being scooted out.
