You don't go to Tru to "go out to dinner". Eating at Tru is more like an event in-an-of itself, like going to an art show or the theatre. A museum of consumable food-as-art, where the chef is the artist, the server a tour-guide. Which is good 'cause it's incredibly expensive. My husband and I went there for our 1 year anniversary. They had custom-printed menus wishing us a happy anniversary at the ready (impressive). I was 8 months pregnant at the time (so, sadly, no wine for me) and my husband doesn't drink but the check for the both of us STILL exceeded $400! We chose the chef's tasting menu in which we each received several courses (It's supposed to be 7 but was really more like 9), each using the same base but interpreted differently for each of us. Chef was very careful of taking my condition into consideration and not serving me anything raw (drag for me...I love raw fish). It was a 4 hour gastronomic ballet of tastes, colors and textures. The minute we walked in we immediately noted the seeming somber calm of the place, how quiet it was and the lack of color and adornment to the decor. That in itself was, for some reason, intimidating. We fully expected the staff to be snobby but were pleasantly surprised that they were not, but very friendly, smiling, incredibly attentive and accomodating.  As we were experiencing our meal it dawned on me why they chose the atmoshere they did: so that it would not compete, in any way, with the food! They created a comfortable but bland environment to enable all of your senses to focus on what was in front of you. pretty brilliant, I think. The timing of the courses was impeccable. We were never left with nothing in front of us for more than a minute or two. A visit to Tru is something you save for a very special occasion or to really impress someone. Don't bother scheduling anything else around the experience...there's no need.
