I have to say, Sapori Trattoria on Halstead used to be my most favorite Italian in Chicago. And it still is for my neighborhood. But Mia's is definitely an attractive alternative. Service was prompt, courteous and knowledgeable. I had pasta before a half marathon and it was just the right amount. As a vegan, it is hard finding restaurants that offer accommodations. Mia's not only provided them but offered them first. I will be back.
