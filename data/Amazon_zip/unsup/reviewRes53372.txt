Alinea = Excellent experience! What an amazing experience my husband and I had at this wonderful place! And that was just the walk down the hallway!!! Is it pricey? yes. Is it worth the price? TOTALLY. The food, is truly a culinary adventure. The time and the creativity that goes into each course is really difficult to put into words. The only way you will understand is if you experience it for yourself.The staff is so helpful and friendly, the decor is absolutely beautiful. Not only will your taste buds thank you, all of your senses will thank you as well.If you have to open a separate savings account just to experience this dining experience, DO IT! You will not be disappointed.
