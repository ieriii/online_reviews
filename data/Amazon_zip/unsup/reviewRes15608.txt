My initial thought upon walking through the enormous, obscurely marked front door was "Holy crap, these are big velvet curtains..." followed by "Whoa, these curtains must have cost a fortune..." finished off by "Oh, hello. Do you have seating for four?" after stumbling upon the hostess' stand. ----- As per my wont, I went off-menu for some rye magic, ending up with a Coin Toss to begin with, and finishing off the night with something that sounded to me like "Vouqueray." If anyone can find me the appropriate name and recipe for my second drink, I'll buy you one. (Edit: Thanks to Mike R for pointing out to me that my second drink was a Veiux Carre - as confirmed by Mel at The Gibson.) Both beverages were absolutely delightful, expertly crafted, and quite voluminous. What didn't fit in the first martini glass came in a small decanter, equating to roughly one and a half martinis at a cost of $12, if I remember correctly. Quite affordable, considering what a similar drink might cost in NYC or DC. The enormous hand-carved ice ball in my second drink left me quite impressed as well. And although all of the small bites were modestly priced, none of them truly stood out as being wow-worthy. I was particularly fond of the chick pea "popcorn," but the eggplant fondue and kobe hot dogs (when they finally arrived...) fell short of expectations. Not bad, just not noteworthy. Similarly, the fried bananas with honey, bacon, and peanut butter were innovative, but unexciting. ----- Two drinks and a few hours later, I walked back out through the heavy, enormous curtains musing to myself, "I would love to have a joint like this closer to home."
