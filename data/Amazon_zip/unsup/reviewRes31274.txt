Is it bad that my review is slightly tainted by the wonderful ambiance and celebrity/politician sightings the night I was there? Billy Dec, owner of Sunda, was celebrating an award for Asian Heritage Month and the entire downstairs area was packed with beautiful, stylish people and celebrities such as news anchors, won't drop any names (eh hem, Linda Yu) and politicians, again won't drop any names (eh hem, Alexi Giannoulias and Pat Quinn). Pseudo celebrities aside, I'm happy to report that the food has gotten much better here since my last visit when Sunda first opened. The "No You Didn't" handroll is still one of my favorites. Wonderful organic miso soup with mushrooms and great garden vegetable roll. Also had an opportunity to sample some shrimp appetizers and other rolls. Everything was delicious and wonderfully prepared. I was also very delighted with my drink, which was iced tea with sweet or flavored vodka. Even though we were sitting in chairs that were not all that comfortable in the lounge/bar area because the restaurant was packed, I was wonderfully impressed by our meal and the great time we had here. Service was understandably a bit slow, but that will not deter me from coming back here again real soon.
