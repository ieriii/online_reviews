I'm sorry Hot Doug. I wanted to love you. I wanted to eat your foie gras and duck sausage and die and go to heaven like so many other yelpers. And since I waited an hour in line and am indecisive, I also ordered a a regular "The Dog" (described as a "Chicago style hot dog") to see if Hot Doug's turned a basic Chicago dog into something magical. So... "The Dog" was just a Chicago hot dog, definitely not worth waiting and ordering from there. And the foie gras dog.. I mean, it was tasty.. was it 5 star amazing? no.  I wouldn't wait an hour for it. If I happened to drive by and didn't see a line out the door, then I'd stop by and order it (and maybe try the Game of the Day), but other than that, trying it once to see what the hype was about was enough for me.
