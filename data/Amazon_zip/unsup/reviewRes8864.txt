Both times I've been to Spacca Napoli, I've seen the van pull up delivering the cheeses rigt off the plane from O'Hare. This place is not messing around. True Italian pizza...yes, it gets mushy in the center, but that's the type of pie it is. Go here; pour your wine into little glass tumblers, chat with the owner and don't try to pick it apart. Just enjoy it.
