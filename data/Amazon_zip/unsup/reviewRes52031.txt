Make sure to ask for the lunch special as I don't think it's on the regular menu. $6.25 will get you a personal sized stuffed pizza of cheese, sausage or pepperoni, plus a house salad. The personal lunch size pizzas are pre-baked, so they bring it out to you right away as opposed to the 45-minute wait that is typical of Chicago stuffed pizza. The salad is just iceberg lettuce and a few other bits, but I suppose it's a fair accompaniment to the behemoth that is stuffed pizza. The crust on the pizza is crispy and not too dense, and the sauce is quite flavorful. It wasn't that crowded when we went, but they still made us line up outside, single-file behind barricades, while a guy with a clipboard and headset marched up and down the line and directed people. I suppose these crowd control measures means it can get pretty crazy over there. But I was still in and out for lunch within 30 minutes. Not bad, not bad.
