Many friends have raved about this place, and now that I'm in Chicago for business I got a chance to visit. Budget a $7 cab ride from the loop for a fantastic dining experience. The place won awards for best restaurant design, but the whole place is really laid out to resemble a barn or farmhouse. The decor fits that as well as the uniforms of the waitresses, busboys and waiters. Because this is the Chicago foodie hangout it is hipster central. This is the type of place where you expect to see Ira Glass carried in on a throne where the onlookers throw him their panties and bra. But it's not all hipsters. I wound up sitting next to some bikers who had some really awesome ink. The beer list is an insane mix of many different types of great beers. I went with the house Lambic mix. Then there is the food. This place is renowned for its pork and seafood, so of course, I ordered the half chicken. Which came with sausage. And frites. I was really in the mood for the frites, but the entire meal was excellent. And they have dessert, too. I went with their chocolate cream pie which is topped with hazelnuts, carmel, and some kind of vanilla creme that isn't ice cream. And now I'm stuffed. And thankful I visited.
