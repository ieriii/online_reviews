I follow the hype - all about it! Sis: "Did you hear about the latest dining hot spot in Chicago?" Me: "No, OMG where?!?! " Sis: "It's called Davanti Enoteca- across the street from Francesca's." Me: "Say no more, I'm there." Sis: "They don't take reservations though." Me: "Hmm..." **Brainstorming on how to maximize my eating time @ Davanti.** I do the restaurant picking in the relationship, because I'm the real foodie. So 4 days before Valentine's Day, and still without a venue for dining, I decided to to check if Davanti was taking reservations for this holiday of love. Thank you food God! 6:15pm seating. Portions are small - tapas like dishes. I feel like that's been the recent trend for most new restaurants in Chicago.  Every dish I ordered was pure deliciousness. I think the only words that came out of my mouth after tasting a new plate was "Omg you need to try this, it is SO good." Favorite of the evening: Mascarpone Polenta + Ragu.  Davanti, you have impressed me.  You've even managed to impress the bf and that's not easy! Service, FOOD, great cozy and simple decor, amazing wine list, and the ambiance made the 3 weeks wait worthwhile.  We will meet again very soon.
