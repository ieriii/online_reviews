What a fantastic place for dinner and drinks! The bar is so cozy and warm. Excellent wine and drink list as well! Dinner, I had the pistachio crusted Tilapia and it was out of this world! If you are in the neighborhood and looking to find a great place for dinner & drinks, you should check it out. Great service, good music and an eclectic crowd.
