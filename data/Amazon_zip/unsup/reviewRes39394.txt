The service sucks even if you're Korean. So if you're American, and think you got bad service because of it, don't feel too bad. The reason why I am giving a 1 star is because my girlfriend and I came here for a hunger fix at around 2 in the morning and I am eating away when my girlfriend stops eating and starts digging for something in her Sul Lung Tang soup. Several strands of hair. GREAT. Although this not uncommon at Korean places... I look in my soup and I see a long hair and..... NO FRIGGIN WAY. Pubic Hair.  I'm not joking. It was long, squiggly n curly PUBIC HAIR. I told the waitress in Korean "Excuse me, but how the HELL am I supposed to eat with this in my food?" After debate of what kind of hair it was, they offered us fresh bowls of soup but we said we're not having another bite for sanitary reasons. They told us not to pay and watched us walk out. Watch what you eat. Literally.
