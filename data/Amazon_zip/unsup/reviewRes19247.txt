I met my boyfriend in the bar here after a class I was taking up the road. We had two salads, the fava bean appetizer, the gnudi, the beignets, and drinks. I was fairly impressed by the number of vegetarian selections on the menu, which you don't always expect at a place like this. Our server was Nicole and she struck us as knowledgeable, skilled, personable, and all-around charming. The salads were quite good. The fava bean dip was better than it had a right to be. The gnudi, sort of like gnocchi but not made out of potatoes, was good, but maybe not $19 good. The mushrooms, fiddleheads, and peas were very fresh though and the parmesan broth generally brought it all together. The beignets were sinful. They were served with blueberries, ice cream, white chocolate, and something involving pop rocks. Next time we're getting the fondue. We're also probably getting about six orders of beignets.
