Geja's has the most delicious fondue you will find - far superior to the Melting Pot. You can go just for the cheese fondue, which is considered an appetizer, and it will definitely fill you up. It comes with Veggies (broccoli, cauliflower, etc), Fruit (apples, grapes) and of course bread. And if you want to go all out, you can choose a meat or veggie option to cook in the broth, which is also delicious. Not only is the food excellent, but the atmosphere is hard to beat. It's one of the most romantic restaurants I've ever been to in Chicago - it's underground, candlelit and a lot of the booths are private. One thing to note is this won't be a cheap dinner. The cheese fondue alone is $14/person, and if you do the broth it is $30-$50/person. Definitely worth every penny though! :) Definitely make a reservation as it is unlikely you will get in otherwise!
