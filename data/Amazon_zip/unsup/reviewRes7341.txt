YUMMO! Walking up to the restaurant, the smell of good ol' wood burning BBq filled the air. The atmosphere inside was nice and cozy, as if I was walking into someone's cottage. The BBq Flight of Kobe Brisket, Pulled Pork and Pulled Chicken was super tasty and the Baby Back Ribs and sweet cornbread were delish! Next time I go back, I will try not to load up on the pickles and homemade chips they bring out when seated. The milk and cookies dessert was a great way to end a very satisfying BBq feast. The staff were very friendly and I look forward to dining here again soon.
