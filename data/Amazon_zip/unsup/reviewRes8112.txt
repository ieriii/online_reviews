This is the best pizza I have found in Chicago. It is better than DOC. This pizza is not afraid of its natural inclination to be soggy in the middle. It is served whole. Head to toe, this pizza is Naples pizza. 1 star because I don't like the cleanliness or the way the owner treats his staff. I don't shop at wal-mart either.
