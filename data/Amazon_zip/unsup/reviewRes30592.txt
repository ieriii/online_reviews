I went for sunday brunch and had the Polenta dish, it was real good. Everything sounded delicious on the menu. I also had my juice (carrot, lemon, ginger, beet) and that was made to perfection. They have a great back patio, you have to walk thru the kitchen to go there, that's always fun.  Don't have much else to say about it but it was yummy, the company was wonderful and the weather was divine for a mid-October in Chi-town. I'd go back.
