We made reservations probably 1 month in advance since we wanted to go on Saturday around 7pm. I have watched Rick Bayless on tv and really like his personality and his food looks great too.  While waiting I had the Topolo Margarita which was really good (though I wish it were bigger for the price). It was Halloween weekend and I thought it was great that the bartender was dressed like a banana.  One appetizer I had was guacamole which was as good, but nothing special. The other appetizer I had was the gorditas de carnitas -I love carnitas it had some green salsa that had a limey taste - I really liked them. They were smaller than typical gorditas but good size for appetizers.  My main entree was the carne asada which was really great. The steak was thicker than a skirt steak and was done perfectly. The spices on the steak were amazing and the black beans and fried bananas were great as well - I ordered some tortillas on the side which made it just perfect. It was a really great atmosphere and definitely worth the experience but too pricey for me to come here more than once a year.
