Our server was great. The food sub-par.....way oversalted or very fatty. Nothing we got was "great." The worst part of the meal was when we were served RAW CHICKEN. I pointed it out to my husband and he thought it was salmon...that's how undercooked it was....but TOO LATE-he had already ate it. While the "chef' served it to us, he accidentally dropped the piece from his skewer onto the table and USED HIS HAND TO PICK IT UP AND PUT IT ON MY PLATE. Eww. The apology we got for the raw chickem (which, by the way, it super dangerous) was the sous chef coming to our table and saying, "Next time you come in, we'll serve you champagne." No thanks. There won't be a next time.
