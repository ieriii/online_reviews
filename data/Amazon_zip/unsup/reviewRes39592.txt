One of the best meals I have ever had. Now it sucks it takes forever to get a table on a busy night and they don't take reservations but it is worth it completely. So pull up to the bar have a great drink (I was drinking Pappy VanWinkle that night, what a selection of liquors and beer) and wait for a table you will be thanking yourself. Me and my dining companion started with the buffalo frog legs. Which was just fun to try. Tasty and the old adage is true, "Tastes Like Chicken". The homemade blue cheese dipping sauce that came on the side was fantastic. For my entree I had the grilled Berkshire pork chop with head-on prawns and hush puppies (That's right HUSH PUPPIES!). It also came with Bacon Braised Swiss Chard and was in a Black Pepper Shrimp Sauce. This meal was cooked artfully and with tons of flavor. The pork chop was cooked just right and was tender and had a good ratio of meat to fat which just enhanced the flavor even more. The prawns were a great add on and were paired well with the pork chop and the black pepper shirmp sauce. The hush puppies were everything you would hope for. Golden brown on the inside and so tender and quite tasty.  My dining partner had the vegetarian butternut squash risotto. Which I was lucky enough to try and was delicious....but not as delicious as that beast of a pork chop. I will defiantly go back there. It is a bit expensive and if you like a good drink it will cost you even more. But a great place for special date or occasion. And with their menu which seems to change from time to time I can't wait to see what they will have next.
