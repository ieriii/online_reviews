Waiters can't be beat. Just let them do the ordering for you... Sit back and enjoy. REALLY just ask which beer goes best with which food to order - they WON'T soak you just because it's the most expensive item on the menu (and even if it is it doesn't matter - it WILL be delicious!) I always look forward to the chance to get back.
