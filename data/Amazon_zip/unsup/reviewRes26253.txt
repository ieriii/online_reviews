Went back for fifth visit on a Saturday night. We were a little early so had drinks in the bar first. My girlfriend had the strawberry sangria (yummy) and I had a pineapple rum drink that was tasty too. After being seated, we ordered the sea scallop main and another main that comprised both scallops, beef, lobster and shrimp. We also had a Spanish wine flight (3 wines that were paired with the meal. Everything was good.
