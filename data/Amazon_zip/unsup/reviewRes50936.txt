Buckwheat Banana Pancakes- Yum! Ask for extra sauce on them because thats what made them delicious! Came here Sunday morning right at open at 9 am and there was no wait. By the time we were leaving though the Sunday Brunch crowd was arriving and they were on a wait. Make a reservation online and skip the wait. I didn't try it but my friend did- Sweetened Ice Tea is killer!!!
