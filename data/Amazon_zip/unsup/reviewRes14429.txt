As promised, I went back to 90 Miles Cafe. I just can't pass up on a good Cuban sandwich or their guava pastelitos. Just as the owner said I must have been there on a day things were somewhat off. Not this time around. The food was delicious. I even brought a new friend with me and he said the food was "scrumptious". I'll be coming back!
