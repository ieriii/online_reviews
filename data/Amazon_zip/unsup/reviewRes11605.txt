This is now officially... my favorite restaurant in America. I was here for 4 days and ate there twice. EVERYTHING on their menu is delicious... but you have not lived until you have eaten any of their fancy/sweet pancake/french toast combos. It is just divine. :) Really... french toast with caramelized bananas, crushed pecans, caramel coulis. YUM.
