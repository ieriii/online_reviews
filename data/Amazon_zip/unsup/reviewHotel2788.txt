My wife and I just celebrated our five-year anniversary and spent a night The James. Our stay was fantastic. Upon arrival I mentioned our celebration. Later that afternoon in-room dining delivered a special congratulatory gift with a personalized card. We also had use of the house car, which was terrific. Booked through Hotwire then upgraded to a junior suite for a small fee. Good call. What we especially appreciated was a standard 2p check-in. Even better, the standard check out time is 2p, which gave us plenty of time to have a leisurely lunch and visit to the Apple store with plenty of time to spare. The only surprise was $50 per night for parking, so unless you need in and out privileges, go with self-park. You can't beat the location: one block off Michigan Ave in the heart of the mag mile. Overall, kudos to The James for helping to make our weekend especially memorable.
