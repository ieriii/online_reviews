Piece's owner responded almost instantly to my Yelp review, and extremely graciously at that! He offered me a drink for my troubles, and it worked! I went in with a group last night before a show at Subterranean and enjoyed a seamless experience including delicious pizza, friendly service, and a fun atmosphere. One eeeeensy weensy little thing, though: the tables at which we were seated had dangerously slim spaces between them. As an unabashed klutz, I was terrified each of the three times I had to squeeze through the tables on my way to and from my seat. Did I mention how much I love the high ceilings? I loved them again. The pizza menu is varied and glorious, leaving little to be desired (*cough* pesto *cough*) There is fresh basil, but we had it on both pizzas and both times it was a little chince, and too finely chopped. But I MIGHT be a food snob in love with basil. Thanks Bill, thanks Tony, can't wait to come back and rock the house on a Saturday night!
