Wife and I came here for our anniversary and was not dissapointed! I made the reservations online and was brought to this common area to grab a drink. The first thing you notice is the communal seating which is much different than to other places I've been to. The atmosphere here was great with a lot of chatter but very friendly. I grabbed and beer and was seated. Our server was very helpful in helping us select a few dishes and a big warning: portions are very small!  Here's what we ordered: 1.) Hamachi Crudo: Fantastic! Thinly sliced pieces of fish with pecans and cucumbers and was great! 2.) Serrano: Thinly sliced pieces of ham and was great! Only did the half taste. 3.) Spicy Pork Rinds: My most favorite part of dinner! The pork rinds are deep fried fresh and was still hot off the fryer and lightly seasoned cheese on top! AWESOME! 4.) Black Bass: Very tender and not dry at all. Good! Pros: - Amazing atmosphere - Attentive service - Great food! Cons: - A bit pricey due to smaller portions
