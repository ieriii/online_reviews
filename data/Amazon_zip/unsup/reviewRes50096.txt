Came here for a friend's big 30th bday dinner on a Saturday night. She had a approximately 20-25 in the group and we all were seated once half of the group arrived. The waiter was very helpful in assisting us with the menu and recommending some appetizers and entrees. The empanadas are good...we ordered the trio to share between the 4 of us that were sitting close together and after we each had a half of one we decided to just order our own since they were that good! It is BYOB with a $8 corkage fee. We ordered a platter that consisted of grilled steak, pork, shrimp, chicken, octopus...(basically all the meats and seafood) and yuca and plantains. The skirt steak is by far the best out of the different meats...juicy and well seasoned. They were very accommodating as far as how we divided up the bill (a combined cash and straggling credit cards) since there are always those annoying ppl that decide to not bring cash to a big group dinner. Anyway, it's a great place for group dinners or even a dinner for two as long as you come hungry! On a side note....check out the bathroom. It's downstairs and you feel like you're going through a small maze and as you turn the corner you might be surprised by a scary painting of a lady's face. ha! Can't wait to come back to try this again.
