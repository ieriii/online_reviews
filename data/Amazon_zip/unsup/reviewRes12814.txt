I was in charge of booking our company Christmas party this year and I chose Texas de Brazil. I'm so glad I did. Everything from the planning to the day of the service was perfect. The event planner was courteous, prompt and seemed to genuinely want to help us make the event as perfect as possible. The staff was wonderful, the manager was fantastic - everyone was just all smiles. Our party was never deprived of any selection they had. The staff really made this place for me. Yes, the meat was delicious and plentiful but they're the ones who actually made our evening complete. Thanks to everyone at Texas de Brazil who made me look great at planning the dinner.
