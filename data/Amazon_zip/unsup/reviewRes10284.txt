The threat of a long wait usually keeps me from frequenting here as often as I would like and the threat of soggy pizza always keeps me from getting it to go, but this pizza is off the hook. A true Chicagoan, my pizza preference is deep dish (Lou Malnati's sausage and spinach please) but when I want a good thin crust fix, Piece does it for me.  Yes it's loud, and yes, I generally get stuck in a small table in between two large parties so I can't really hear myself think, but whatever, stick a piece of pizza in my mouth and I'm good. One visit my friend requested broccoli and my initial thought was "I think I just threw up in my mouth" but since I'm trying to work on my compromising skills, I agreed, provided there was something else I could cover up the taste with. Turns out, I love broccoli on pizza. Well, on Piece's pizza anyway. It gets all roasted and crispy and doesn't taste anything like the broccoli I used to douse in ranch dressing and choke down when my mom made it growing up. I doubt I'd order it on my own but if it was requested, I wouldn't say no. The crispy crust managed to not taste like cardboard, which is what you usually find on thin crust pizza. Not only did it manage to not taste like cardboard, it was buttery and delicious!   My biggest gripe is that the appetizer section is relatively small. When this place is packed, it can take a while to get your pizza, which means I need something to nibble on, lest I try to take a chunk out of the arm of one of my dining companions. I've had the spinach dip and it's good - but I just wish they'd throw a few more options out there.
