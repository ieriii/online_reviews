Went here for a late night bite after a cocktail reception for some "real food." It was really good. The staff was very friendly and accomodating to our large group (11 people). The food was really good. It was my first time trying Chicago style pizza and it was really good. I had cheese stuffed with pepperonii, sausage and jalapenos. Not too expensive, with a couple pitchers of beer it came to $13 a person. I'd go back if I was in the area again.
