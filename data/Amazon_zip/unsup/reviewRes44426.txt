I wish I loved this place as much as other people, but I just didn't.  Small detail which only probably bothers me, but, I walked in and I felt like I was walking into a sauna. I shared a cupcake and a cheesecake bar with a friend, and once again I wish I loved this place. The cupcake was a vanilla cake with buttercream frosting. I suppose if you like dry cupcakes this is the place to get them, but I like moist cake (since the frosting isn't something I even eat). The cake part was such a let down. However, the cheesecake square was heavenly. It melted in my mouth like all cheesecakes should, and it had the perfect amount of crust to cake.  I'll be back for the cheesecake square, but, most likely never a cupcake. I'll have to just feed my craving with my own for now.
