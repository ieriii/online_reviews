This restaurant was a pleasant surprise! Their menu is absolutely gigantic, with everything looking delicious. I had the rice vermicelli with shrimp, and it was so light, yet filling, and perfect for the summer weather. The curry chicken dish was also fantastic, but it was listed as a spicy dish and it was actually very mild. I am excited to go back and try new things every time!
