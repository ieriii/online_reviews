Oh Cafe 28, how you disappoint me. While you food is still some of my favorite in Chicago your servers leave much to be desired. I came for brunch today because brunch is the greatest meal ever. It's breakfast food in the afternoon with cocktails. There's really no downside. Anyway, I had a groupon so I decided to give their brunch a try. While the food was wonderful, our server was not. We waited a bit to be seated which is expected for a popular brunch place. Once we were seated though it took our server at least 10 to 15 minutes to ask if we even wanted drinks. By that time we already knew what food we wanted or ordered right away. While the food came quickly, she forgot about the side of bacon I asked for (we weren't charged for it thankfully) and when a refill of coffee was requested it never came. Finally after about 15 minutes we asked the bus boy clearing our plates for more coffee. He was right on top of it though. I realize brunch can be busy, but I seriously feel like our server either forgot about us or just didn't care. Because their food is so good, and I've never had service issues here before, I'm only knocking one star off. But if it happens again there will be carnage.
