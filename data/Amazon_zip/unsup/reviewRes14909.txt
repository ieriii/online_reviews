This was a bright spot in our trip to Chicago. My husband and I went on a Friday night when it was pretty busy and managed to find a few seats at the bar. The bartenders were very attentive and the beer was pretty tasty too. We had an appetizer at the bar before getting a table for dinner. The brushetta is AMAZING, esp the cauliflower, white bean, arugula topping. I also loved my Morrocan chicken salad. Also our neighbor at the bar let us try his bacon fat popcorn and it was pretty freakin' awesome too. DIg it!
