Kudos to PIECE for attempting to serve up authentic New Haven-style pizza. It's not quite the quality of Pepe's, Modern or Bar, but if you're from Chicago you've likely never heard of those places anyway. This is a more-than-adequate Midwest substitute. It does share in common with those aforementioned places the occasional intolerably long wait time. A two hour wait on a Thursday night? Well, you can always pony up to the bar and have a few pitchers while you wait, I guess.
