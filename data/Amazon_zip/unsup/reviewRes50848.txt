Wished we had more BYOB in NYC! Went there for brunch a Sunday morning, worth the wait (50 minutes). Amazing food, good service, great ambiance, price is moderate. We followed the waiter suggestion for a blueberry spread, (can't remember the exact name), but it was really worth it. I recommend the Eggs Benedict with pastrami.
