The best part about my meal here was that I misjudged how quickly I would get downtown. I was lucky enough to get the last table for the 5pm seating, so I didn't have the horrific wait many people experience. First off, a waiter having a bunch of tables seated at the same time is never good for service. It took forever to even get our order in. While this is completely not our waiter's fault, it still meant we sat for quite a while before our drink order was even taken.  I'm guessing that this place is so busy because of his TV shows, because this was some of the most average food I've ever had. $16 got me half a scoop of guac, small amounts of marinaded pork and some black beans. I think this should have come with some salsa and tortillas, but that was apparently forgotten. All this average food was served to us by a robot. A waiter who could not have been less interested in being there. I don't blame him, this place sucked. I went with an out of town friend, but was excited because I've always been curious. However, I've gotten better mexican out of a cooler at a bar. Blech.
