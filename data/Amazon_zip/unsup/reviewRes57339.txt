So, I'm pregnant and found myself at Coast after work with a friend craving an avacado roll. I knew Coast had a reputation for great sushi at a hefty price so I was a little worried about how someone obviously going vegetarian would be preceived. Well, our waitress (Debbie, I think) was amazing. She was so sweet and very patient. She made suggestions and even told me about a fab vegetarian roll that was seriously so delicious. The friend I was with had tons of questions about sushi and she went through each without any hesitation and didn't make us feel silly at all. After all that, she even came back after the check was given to let us know she charged us a dollar too much! I was so impressed by the service - I think I would go back just to have Debbie as our waitress again. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is becuase the price is craziness. I ordered no drinks and ate three vegetarian rolls and some edame and ended up paying $40 when all was said and done. I can't imagine if I had ordered the pricey fish!!! Overall, major props to Debbie and other staff if they are anything like her:)
