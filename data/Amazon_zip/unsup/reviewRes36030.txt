Good chinese BBQ. For this kind of restaurant, the dirtier the place the better the food. Well, the food is good! However, I would try to avoid looking at them preparing your food over the counter. So, just cover your eyes, bring your food home, and enjoy the goodness. Get a rice box with 2 meats, and it comes w/ vegetables and half a salted egg. It's a ridiculous amount of food for like $3.50. It can't be beat.
