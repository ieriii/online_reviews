Meh. I came here this past Saturday for brunch. There was a 40 minute wait, which is to be expected, however it ended up not being worth the wait. Our server was miserable, and it took 10 minutes after being seated before she appeared for the first time. When she took our order she didn't listen to me at all. I ordered the chocolate chip strawberry pancakes with no chocolate sauce on top. She said "so you just want strawberry pancakes". Umm no, if you are familiar with your own menu, you would know there are chocolate chips in the actual batter. I had to show her the menu description. I also ordered a side of pork sausage and as she wrote it down said "side of turkey sausage". They don't even sound alike, please listen. Once you get the bill, you have to stand in line to pay at the counter. Maybe this helps them turn the tables over faster but standing in a line that starts in the middle of the restaurant where you are blocking those dining at the counter, dodging out of the way of servers delivering trays of food, and waiting 20 minutes to pay really detracts from my overall dining experience. The vibe and atmosphere felt very much like a chain restaurant. If I didn't know any better I'd have sworn I was at Denny's. The food actually was pretty decent and inexpensive. I thought my pancakes, which came out correctly much to my surprise, were good although did not come with enough syrup. Part of my enjoyment could have been the fact that it was 1:30 before I ate for the first time that day. With so many amazing brunch spots in the city, do yourself a favor and skip this place unless you like enduring long waits and poor service for mediocre, chain restaurant quality.
