i'd come here for the beer any day of the week. brewmaster - outstanding job. the october was terrific, as well as the recent red. the wait/service staff (matt specifically) - get your act together. kicking people out of a table who are actively drinking and eating appetizers is not the way to win people over. i don't care it there's a party of six waiting for a table. it was generous of the hosts to tell us we were 'allowed' to go back to our table and continue to spend money while drinking their beer was nice....but too late. once again, the beer is great. thank you so much for that. sorry you have to deal with a bad review because of your wait staff.
