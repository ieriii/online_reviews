SCRUMMY!!!! I really do enjoy this place, it is super super creative and super super delicious. This includes the libations. They go from the run of mill, margaritas, which I am so sick of I could barf. Enough with them. But they are good. There is a carnivale martini that gets my juices flowing. GET IT. The food will make your mouth get real happy and it will like what it is feeling. Not everything is spicy like you might expect, rather they rely on complex nuances and interesting ingredients. Their guac is fantastic too. I love that place. Ya gots ta go.
