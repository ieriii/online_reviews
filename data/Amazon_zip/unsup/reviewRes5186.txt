Absolutely delicious... if you get a table. The purple pig is one of a kind in Chicago. Its food is a delicious fusion of basque and southern France cuisine with meat on almost every dish. I have eaten here about 4 times and ordered different dishes every time. The food comes in small appetizer sizes no matter what you order. My wife and I usually order 4 to 5 items and share them with a bottle of wine and it is plenty of food for both of us. You mustn't miss the bone marrow. Such a simple dish but executed perfectly. I've tried holding myself from ordering every time and I have failed. If you are a health nut this might not be the place for you. You might need some Lipitor after you are done but it will be well worth it. The only problem with this place is the wait. Fridays and Saturdays for dinner are impossible unless you go late night. They take no reservations and the seating is first come first server unless you get lucky and snatch some bar seats. One time we were told the wait would be 2 hours, we said "0K we'll wait". Then we headed to a nearby movie theater and had our table waiting for us when we got back.
