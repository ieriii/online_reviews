The only highlight of this place is Jean-George's food. The lobby is pretty but not functional for hotel guests. The rooms are pretty dismal in comparison to Ian Schrager's Gramercy Park Hotel. They are unfinished and dirty. Calling this place "Minimal" is an excuse for lacking attention to detail. It seems like the only renovation that was made to the rooms was throwing in some Ikea esque particle board furniture and a cheap white paint job. I would recommend staying at somewhere else and stopping by for a bite to eat. Overall, this was huge let down after my experience with Ian's Gramercy Park Hotel.
