I wish this place was less popular. I've been waiting for the crowds to die down for going on two years now, but I guess I need to give that dream up. XOCO is amazing and I guess everyone knows it. The ahogado is maybe the best sandwich ever. Pork and pickled onions on a crunchy baguette, served in a bowl of spicy tomato broth. It is easily the best thing on the menu, and maybe the best sandwich I've ever had. When doing take-out I've tried to get other sandwiches, but I'm never as happy so I now just plan on eating in so I can get the ahogada. The chocolate is made fresh from bean to finished product, and it's really wonderful in anything from a hot chocolate to a churros or ice cream topping. I've seen complaints that the chocolate is too strong, but I think that's because people are used to eating a lot of additive with their chocolate. This is fresh and pure, so there is a bit of a tart, berry flavor to it. If you like real chocolate, I think you'll be very happy. If you prefer milk chocolates, it might seem a bit strange to you. The carnitas salad is great too. It didn't occur to me to order a salad at XOCO before, but this one is pretty spectacular. The pork is rich and deeply flavored, and the dressing and salad greens are light, fresh and a bit tart. They're the perfect complement to each other. Now when I can tear myself away from the ahogado, I get this salad. And when I have room for dessert? The soft serve is awesome! It has the teeny tiniest hint of tartness to it. Not anything as strong as tart froyo, just the smallest hint of tart, like there's a bit of buttermilk in it or something. I have no idea what it is, but I really like it. The baked goods and churros are great as well, but for the past few months I haven't been able to move away from the soft serve. Come autumn, I'm sure I'll be back to churros though!
