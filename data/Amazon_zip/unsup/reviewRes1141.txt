Went on a Monday at 11 am and still a line out the door!!! Had to wait about 20 min to get to the front of the line to place the order but our food came out fairly quick! We ordered a lot of food: 2 Chicago Dogs (steamed) with everything - 5 star Awesome...the Vienna beef with tomato, pickle, celery salt, peppers, onions, on a poppy seed bun. 1 Bratwurst (Charbroiled) with everything - 4 star Very juicy but the meat was a bit bland...but we didn't know it didn't come with sauerkraut so that was our bad so make sure to ask! 1 Selma Hyak *Hotlink* (Charbroiled) with everything - 2 star This was a total disappointment it was really burned...had to take off some of the charred pieces from the meat since some pieces were burned to a crisp and very dry. It wasn't spicy at all either =( 1 Marty Allen * Thuringer* (Charbroiled) with everything - 5 star Very tasty!!! Lots of garlic and spices and cooked to perfection! Make sure to taste this one! Overall a great experience! The owner was super nice ^^
