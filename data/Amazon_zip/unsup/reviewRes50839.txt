After Yelp Office hours at Starfruit, I headed off to Wishbone to meet a pescatarian for dinner. Coming early, I decided to start compiling my dart team statistics and while waiting for my friend. The server came by and I ordered a diet coke and had some water while I scribbled on a piece of paper. The waiting got longer and longer and I was starting to feel awkward. The server stopped by periodically to refill my drink and asked if I needed anything. Having scanned the menu a few times, I still wasn't sure what I would finally order. There were plenty of children running around climbing on tops of booths and introducing as much chaos as they could muster by dancing to the live jazz music and having the time of their lives. The jazz band was a wonderful touch to Mardi Gras and I felt like it really was finally Mardi Gras. Once my friend came we got down to business and she convinced me that a Mardi Gras plate featuring jambalaya, crab cake, sausage, red beans, and etouffle would be the way to go. She ordered hers and I ordered mine while she took notice of the delicious cornbread on the table that I already helped myself to. The music was loud the restaurant was running on all four cylinders and the night was just getting better. Once the food arrived I was in another place quickly taking out a crab cake and getting to work on jambalaya and etouffle which was rich, laced with taste and I resisted the urge to take my straw and just slurp up the rest of it! Okay, so not really - but it was the best thing on the Mardi Gras plate. Dinner passed by with the server bringing back more and more and time flew by and never stopped. I had a great time and now upgrade my assessment of Wishbone food and service to 5-star status.
