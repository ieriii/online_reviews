Two words: Crab Cakes! The crabs were Ok, could have have been fresher (I'm especially picky because I originally come from a tropical island, where seafood comes live) ....but WOW the BEST CRAB CAKES I HAVE EVER TASTED. Really. What holds me back from giving it 4 stars? 1) Impersonal service 2) Bad house wine 3) Super saturated sweet raspberry cake
