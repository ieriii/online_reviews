3.5 stars - The pizza is delicious, I like the atmosphere, and a lot of famous people have come by the restaurant. The waiter seemed like he was just making conversation to provide good service rather than genuinely making conversation. I'm sure it gets tiring with so many tourists coming in, but it comes with the job. I like that the restaurant is well prepared for large groups of people, there was four school buses of kids pulled in, front of the restaurant. They had the kids waiting outside while they set up the tables. My group and I walked up afterward and were seated immediately. My only complaint would be that the place has writing all over the seats and walls, it's a part of the atmosphere, but it still looks gross.
