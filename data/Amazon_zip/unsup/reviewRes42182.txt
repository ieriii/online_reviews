Was originally heading to Harey Carey's on a friends recommendation, was tired from walking all day and ran into this spot. We had a 45 min wait without reservations, so we grabbed some bears in the bar while we waited. Nice little speakeasy type joint that has a downstairs bar/lounge area and an almost hidden ATM (which maxed $100/transaction, so they can rape you with $2.50 fees). Our server was nice, food runners are quick, and the outside seating was great in the nice summer weather at dusk... The marrow was succulent, salty, greasy, and everything awesome you want to spread on some crisp toast. It matches well with the tart onion jam and the coarse seal salt sprinkled on the bones last second is on point! Steak tar tare was great; tender, savory, and nicely matched with pickle and sriracha! (+1 star just for this). It could have used more salt as the capers were a little light for me personally, but great nonetheless. You can skip the Kennebec fries if you've every had good fries cause its just as easily repeated at any great place. The bee sting was only meh... just an overly tart margarita, however their Iron Horse Brown Ale made up for it. The rib-eye was nicely charred/seared on each side and served with Bearnaise and coarse salt. For me it felt a little overpriced $38.50 for 16 oz roughly... but hey..that's market price for ya. The pork belly was off the hook! Sweet and tender with some nice fatty chunks. The taro was OK w/ asparagus ..but the raspberry onion glaze was good. Michelin Gourmand restaurant and less than 2 blocks from by brothers apartment, so definite win! Oh and they run doughnut vault so if your not from around just find Gilt Bar's outside seating and you'll see the entrance.
