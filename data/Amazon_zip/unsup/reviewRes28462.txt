I went here for a "nice" dinner out with a friend. We had a great time, and the food was good. Maybe it was hyped up but I was kind of expecting it to blow my mind - and while it was good, it fell a little short of expectations. We started with the foie gras, and each got an app, main course, and a dessert. Everything was plated beautifully, it was extremely creative, and the service was great. I would recommend checking it out.
