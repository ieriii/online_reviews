We went there for a special occasion and we had a remarkable meal: chefs collection with the wine pairing. The food was delicious, beautifully plated and elegantly presented. The staff focus on YOU, and are welcoming and extremely attentive, but not stuffy. I really felt like I was a special guest in their restaurant. The wine pairing really did enhance all aspects of each course, and was expertly paired to the foods. If I could offer one small improvement, I felt that each course came so quickly after the other, that we hardly had time to fully relax and anticipate the next course. Maybe that was because the valet told us that their service included 3 hours in the parking garage....maybe that was a factor?  By the way, how great is that they provide you with a beautiful litlle pound cake/cookie to take home and enjoy the next morning with a cup of coffee! A reminder of an elegant night enjoyed!
