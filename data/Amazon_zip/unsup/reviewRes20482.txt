I have tried a variety of items here over the last 4 years, but always go back to the regular burger. It is one of the best in the city and they have Matilda on tap. Really couldn't ask for much more. Also the service tends to always be on the fast side, but Friday night it was 5 minutes between ordering and receiving our food.
