Decent food, decent service, been to better steak houses in Chicago. I was here last night with a group from work and I just wasn't overly impressed. I thought that the prices were pretty high (comparable to other steak houses in the area I suppose) and I thought that the servings were a tad skimpy (again, comparing steak house to steak house). I did appreciate the fact that they had more on their menu than just steak, though I ended up getting the filet. The appetizers that we ordered were ok - again, nothing to write home about. If I am going to spend money on a good steak restaurant in Chicago, this won't be the one I choose next time. Oh well, you win some you lose some :).  The wine was good and they had a nice selection.
