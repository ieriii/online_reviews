This is not a great place for someone who is a vegetarian and likes cheap, pedestrian beer....and hates crowds. We went on a Monday night and it was PACKED. As in, couldn't turn around. After a little over an hour we got a table and checked out the menu.....they've got a ton of meat options but it is slim pickins for the veg heads. I got the mac and cheese and fries (if my trainer is reading this, hello! Went to the gym first, I swear!). Mac and cheese was good, but not great. The fries were awesome, mostly because they are served Belgian style with mayo. Mmm, lard. I'm not a big drinker, and when I do drink beer it is PBR. Not because it is "ironic" or even because it is cheap, but because I like it. I don't need all the razzle dazzle this place has got goin' on.  The atmosphere was cute, though. Fire place, pubby kind of feel. I bet on a night when I'm not elbow to elbow with everyone it would be pretty swell. As for the meat eaters and beer geeks I was with, they seemed to dig it. The consensus is that the CB and J is tasty, as was the rabbit (yuck). The beer list got big thumbs up, too. I think I'll stick to the Chicago Diner, though. I never have to watch anyone eat Thumper when I'm there!
