Yes, this place is pricey, but you pay for what you get. The ambience of this place is so awesome. Super dim lights and a classy setup create an intimate setting. What's good? Chef's cut garantuan ribeye? Lobster mash? Sauted sea scallops? Crab gnocci laced with truffle? Buttercake? Thats all I need to sleep well. Portions are take home style... And take home message is...Mastro's has one of the best ribeyes I've ever had! The consistency is maintained at every chain.
