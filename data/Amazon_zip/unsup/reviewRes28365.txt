Put me with that select few who don't get the hype about this place. The refried beans looked and smelled horrid, the fajitas were floating in a puddle of grease, the carne asada meat used for the tacos was griddle-fried, stringy and hard to chew, and the salsas weren't very appetizing. The enchiladas mole were pretty decent and the horchata was killer, but killer horchata isn't enough to keep me coming back. Then, the waitress seemed like she'd rather chew gravel than be working tables, and the whole place just had a weird cheap vibe. And not that endearing cheap vibe like hole-in-the-wall taquerias.... this place is just odd. And don't get me started on the disgusting grease-covered floors that are almost impossible to walk on. Want to pay with a credit card, as is the custom here in the 21st century? Too bad -- but conveniently there's an ATM inside that adds two bucks to the cost of your transaction. If I'm going to drive all the way to the south side for Mexican food and pass about 400 other Mexican joints along the way, I'll stick to Pancho's. Never again for this place.
