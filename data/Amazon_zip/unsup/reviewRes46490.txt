R.J. Grunt's might be considered the Lettuce Entertain You parent restaurant since it's been around for about 40 years. Hadn't been there in a while, and it's the 1970s/80s throwback deli with nice salad bar. It was crowded and we were told we'd have to wait about 20 minutes, but we were seated much more quickly. My tuna salad sandwich on white bread was delicious and huge, so I finished it the next day. Also, I was able to replace fries with a heaping helping of pretty good slaw.
