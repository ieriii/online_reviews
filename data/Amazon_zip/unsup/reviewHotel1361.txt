Came to Chicago for a two day meeting and I barely left the hotel. The service was attentive, the food they brought in for many of my meals was good, when I was able to find a veggie option. Imagine my surprise when two traditional veggie-friendly soups, minestrone and pasta fagioli, had meat in them. The bar was nice, but not separate from the lobby and I prefer a separate room for my hotel bar. However, the bar at the Drake Hotel across the street is excellent. Many people would like the location as it is so close to many popular areas of Chicago; shopping, Lincoln Park, Zoo, the loop. Personally, i found it a little soulless. While the location is a huge plus for many, I do prefer a less glitzy, and more neighborhoody, area. Overall, a good, clean 2 day stay.
