Hands down one of my favorite places to grab brunch. It can get a little crazy with all the kids and the crowd but once seated, the coffee and food comes quickly. Interesting menu choices like crunchy french toast (corn flakes?) and cucumber lemonade. But I have to disagree with other reviewers about one thing: Well made grits are still grits, blech. Not my thing.
