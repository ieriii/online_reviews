Was this place open in 2002? I vaguely remember going there then, and not being too impressed. Tonight was, unfortunately, no different. I got a slice of cheese so the flavor of the 'za (how annoying is that word?) wouldn't be influenced by its toppings. Also, I didn't want to eat a bunch of swine flu. The crust on the deep dish was very good and fluffy, but there wasn't a whole lot of cheese, and the sauce kind of sucked. Way sweeter than I prefer. Malnati for my body. Art for a shart. Still, I can't give it less than 3 stars based on principle... A. It's pizza B. I support the deep dish institution C. Slices ready to go at all hours
