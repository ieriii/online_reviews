I'll come back to this hotel. Rooms: 1 bedroom king suite was perfect for my needs. The bedroom was simple and closed off, which is exactly what I like. The living area had a couch, a chair, table with an office chair. The room also came with a rerigerator as well. Very clean, well-maintained. My only complaint was that central air didn't seem to work too well and I like to keep my rooms very cool. Evening manager's reception: well liquor drinks, 2 draft beers (MGD and miller lite). The snacks are very decent- on a Sunday night, it was pita bread with spinach & artichoke dip and fresh vegetables with ranch. Breakfast in the morning: The cooks who make your cooked-to-order breakfast are VERY nice! There is a variety of cereal, juices, fruits, and other hot breakfast items. Workout room has 3 treadmills, 2 elipticals and a stationary bike. There are mats and hand weights as well. Hotel has on-sight valet parking. It's underground and the valet staff are very friendly. Parking is $46/night. Starbucks is in the same building, but you do need to go outside to the corner of Ohio and State.
