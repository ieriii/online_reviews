OK. Brace yourself.  I'm going to give this place a 3. I know, I'm definitely in the minority but, it's not like I disliked it and won't come back. Given all the great reviews, I'm sure I just went on an off night. Plus, I didn't try their falafels yet, so, it might be not be a "true" review. Anyway, I got the lamb sandwich.  My meat was a little dry and I got some chewy bits in there. However, everything else: the salad, humus, mild sauce, and pita were just fine. I also got the lentil soup and that my friend was lick the bowl good. My boyfriend got their lamb dinner plate and which had everything I had but not in sandwich form, with some rice. I'm a big rice fan and I'm happy to say it was tasty! Another good aspect of the meal was that it had large portions for a cheap price.  As for the restaurant, it was quiet and mellow and the service was quick. Overall, I'll come back again, try the falafels and give their meat another try.
