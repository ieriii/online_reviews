What a fantastic little restaurant. This is a great Italian place without any formalities.  Everything was delicious...especially the gnocchi. Your food is cooked right in the middle of this long skinny restaurant. Next door is a pub that can help get your evening juices grooving.  Great food. Great value. Great place.
