I am a fan but there are issues with this particular spot. If you go during patio season and then it rains, you will likely be squished inside. The fact that their patio can hold more than the inside causes this issue.  The food was very good. I had the raw tenderloin for an appetizer and the salt encrusted fish for an entree. Both were very good! My wife loved the focaccia bread and the rest of here food as well.
