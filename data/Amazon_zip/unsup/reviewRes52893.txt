I've been whining to the boyfriend that I've been wanting cuban food for a veerrryyyy looong time. He suggested 90 Miles and I jumped for joy! We ordered entrees only: He got the bistec, and I got the shrimp. The server was really helpful with our questions (we had a little hard time picking what we wante), and the ambiance is fun! We'll definitely be going back there soon :)
