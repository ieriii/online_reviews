While this place felt very authentic (with skinned animals hanging in the window) and had a HUGE menu, I didn't love the food like I wanted to. We ordered a TON of food including appetizers, soup, fried rice, some entrees, and of course the infamous Peking Duck. Don't get me wrong, the food is good, but I am not sure I can handle authentic Chinese food. There were bones in all of the meat and the chicken is definitely not all white meat. While that may not bother others, it made the meal a little less appetizing for me.  The Sweet and Sour chicken was delicious though as was the fried rice. Should I ever go again, I would definitely order these again. The Peking duck was actually not all it is cracked up to be in taste, however the experience is cool. They bring out an entire duck and cut it in front of you, so you know it is super fresh. It comes with these super fluffy pieces of dough and sauce to make little wraps. The duck was a little dry in my opinion and they leave the skin on. I enjoyed the very similar duck dishes much more at Japonais and Tao, however it is WAY cheaper here. I can't say I would be dying to go back, however I would be interested in trying more on their menu.
