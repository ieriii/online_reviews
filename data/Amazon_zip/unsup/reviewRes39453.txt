My first Korean BBQ experience was fantastic! Apparently this is the only place in the city with in-table coal grills. We ordered the brisket and tender beef....not the best quality, so I focused my attention on the 25 little bowls of food they brought by! It was great to see my husband at the grill, even though it is February! The in-table coal grill was wonderful to keep warm by. I can't wait to go back with friends, because that's my only complaint, I had no idea what the 25+ tasty side dishes were.....just simple ingredient guesses, like seaweed, sprouts, cabbage, etc. Perfect food for a cold....spicy and hot :)
