I feel like I can't give this place a fair review as I could barely taste my food past the heat of our dishes.  I am sure it was my fault since I tried to order the things that I read numerous yelps about - Ma Po Tofu, Chicken with chilis and a spicy lamb dish but everything was just so darn spicy it was hard to enjoy.  Would like to go back and try some different dishes.
