This is one of my favorite restaurants in the city. I was sorry to see it on Check Please a few years ago, because as we all know, that exposure suddenly makes it harder to get a table in a timely fashion. We moved a little further away from Sabatino's several years ago, so we don't get there as often as we once did, but we still make an effort to get there several times a year. The food is consistently good. I'm not a huge fan of Italian food, so I usually get a steak, and they're always excellent. Oh...the eggplant parm is also delicious! I almost forgot! If you like blue cheese dressing on your salad, theirs is the best I've ever had at a restaurant. Must be homemade. They also load it up with additional blue cheese. The Oysters Rockefeller are excellent. They're the real deal unlike most places with bastardized, inferior versions. Then of course they have the various table-side services, which are a dying culinary art form. They do Steak Diane as well as a few desserts. If you're into a "trendy" scene full of yappy, insipid 20-somethings, this is NOT the place for you. It's old school as they say. Primarily mature adults. Dark dining rooms with cheesy decor. The food is most excellent. We've never had a bad meal or experience there.
