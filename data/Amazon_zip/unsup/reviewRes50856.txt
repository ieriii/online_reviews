Well, they aren't the best grits I've ever had (that title belongs to Hominy Grill in South Carolina), but the food here is exceptional for the price. I ate brunch at the bar so the service was pretty attentive. Giant coffee mugs, very fresh ginger beer, scrumptious complimentary beignets. It was difficult to choose just one entree from the menu - I can't wait to go back and try more!
