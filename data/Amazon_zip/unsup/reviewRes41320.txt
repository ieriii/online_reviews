It's not the most authentic Vietnamese restaurant in Argyle. It's cheap but so are most other Vietnamese restaurants. There are plenty of options on the menu. However, all the soup dishes seem to taste the same. Being so familar with the cuisine, these soup dishes are supposed to have a distinct flavor. Service is extremely slow. Have your cash or credit card out when you finally get the bill or else it will be another 20 minutes before the server comes back.
