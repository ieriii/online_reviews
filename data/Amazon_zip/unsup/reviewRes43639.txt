Love, love, love this place. It is about as pricey as you would expect for a yuppie cafe, though, so I am glad i don't live in the city, or I would go broke just coming here all the time. First of all, it is so cute, it's ridiculous. Even when it's crowded, the ambience is light, and even though you know it's packed, it doesn't FEEL packed. Somehow, they've got everything spaced out just right. Then there's the food (which is also cute). I've gone for both breakfast and lunch and loved both. Even though I am not really a french toast person, there was something irresistible sounding about the orange brioche french toast, and it really was delectable: sweet, but not overly so, with a welcome touch of something different, though (despite the name) I wouldn't call it citrus. The side of chicken sausage was reasonably priced and was enough to share. For lunch, I tried the crabcake sandwich. The sandwich was large and very savory, so again, I would definitely recommend sharing. I really liked how they used some kind of thin batter layer to keep the crabcake together: While it didn't necessarily look nice from the outside, it definitely helped to keep things a little neat as I bit into the sandwich! Oh, yeah, I love their granola. I live out of state but mail order it ALL THE TIME, as it is absolutely the best granola I have ever had. The blueberry walnut is my favorite, but they are ALL good. Service was really great both times I visited, both at peak and non-peak dining hours. The cashier was friendly and helpful. I'll definitely be back!
