YUM! So Greek Islands Restaurant is pretty smart - Free valet? I'm there! And I'm sure there are plenty of other people who are in this boat too. I was the first to arrive in my party and our host was very friendly and accomodating. Per my fellow yelp'ers recs, we tried the flaming saganaki. You will not be let down. The presentation is pretty awesome. Anything flambe will fascinate me. I was served a greek salad that I found addictive. Those simple salad dressings really get me! I ordered the shrimp tourkolimano and it was delicioso! The marinara sauce was delectable and complimented the shrimp quite well. My cohorts ordered the mousaka, grilled octopus, and roasted lamb; we are very pleased with our dishes. Not sure of when I would return - solely because I pride myself in finding cheap eat treasures and Greek Islands, although not expensive, is certainly not cheap. They do, however, get high marks from me =)
