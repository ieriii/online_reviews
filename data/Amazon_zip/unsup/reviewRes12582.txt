Yum, if you are not full after you leave here, you probably need a lapband.  Lobster bisque was the best thing at the bar. I had two bowls. The bacon for the salad was thick and crispy (as it always should be). There was a lot of other things to offer at the salad bar, but I'll let you see on your own because we all know the star of the show was the meat! My favorites were the filet mignon, chicken wrapped in bacon, garlic steak, and the parmesan crusted chicken.  Oh that sausage was "slap you momma" good!! I definately recommend this place, you won't need to eat again for another 12 - 18 hours and you may end up in a food coma afterward.  2 Kettle One dirty martinis didn't help my food/drink coma either!! Enjoy!!!
