Maybe it was a bad day for them, maybe the staff is int he middle of post Christmas doldrums but we had a horrible experience here. Where to start? We walked in at lunch, when someone finally noticed us standing in front near the front we were directed to sit in the only blind spot allowing a view of the TV's despite ample additional seating. Upon asking for another seat eyes rolled and uncheerfully relented. After taking our drink and food orders it took a good ten minutes to get our drinks despite a sparsely filled restaurant. We began to notice that we were seriously getting hungry and checking the clock. After attempting to flag down our waitress we got the hostess who we could see visually scrambling to even find our order in the kitchen. She eventually sauntered back and said it would only be another 15 minutes and it takes 25 to make a pizza. I explained our wait was already 40 minutes to which she disagreed despite not even being our waitress. I told her that we came in as sportcenter came on her main TV, that means it was 12pm it was now 12:43. She asked if I was sure and I explained I had been watching ESPN for 15 years so yeah I am pretty sure. 10 minutes later our waitress finally came with our pizza and took our drink refills about 20 minutes past the time they were empty. Now at last we had the long awaited pizza that I had long heard was the best in the area. In a word it was crap, well more like uncooked crap. I am not sure not being a chef at any time but I assume all the cheese should melt and the crust should not be doughy enough use as pool stick chalk in a pinch. The Beef was nasty, the peppers were fresh a week ago at best and the sauce was cold in patches. It was atrocious and beat out the service for "worst in show" of this circus act. I can understand being off at times but at lunch? With a half filled restaurant? It was amateur hour in virtually every way, never coming back to this mess again.
