Don't go out of your way, but not bad if you're in the neighborhood, want some pub food, and are willing to pay fine dining prices. We've eaten at the Gage twice now. Our first meal was probably closer to 3.5 stars. Great pork chop and pretty good burger. Our second meal was closer to a 2 star. Some significantly undercooked mussels that we couldn't finish was the bummer of the night. The flank steak appetizer with watermelon and goat cheese was an interesting mix of sweet and savory, and the rest of the meal was simply average. In terms of the food overall - this place is not going to knock your socks off by inspirational cuisine; after all it is a gastropub. But if you stick to items that sound like dressed up pub food you probably won't be disappointed. It will be a decent meal, but nothing that will be a future must-have that requires a return visit. Also consider the price - this is fine dining prices for upscale bar food. Service is attentive, and in some cases they seem to be almost trying TOO hard. But they mean well, are very attentive and friendly, and do their best to accommodate the patrons. For example, our bad batch of mussels were taken off the check without question or hesitation. And we didn't expect them to do it. We've only dined here on weekend nights, so can't attest to the power lunches. But there was a fair amount of tourist traffic. That said it doesn't feel like a tourist trap (e.g., Planet Hollywood, etc.) and you don't notice it unless you are looking for it. Overall - solid. If you have out of town guests and you're doing the Millennium/Grant Park tour, this would be a great spot for an impromptu visit, assuming you've indulged in the requisite Italian beef and/or deep dish. Not a value buy, but a good alternative if you happen to be in the neighborhood (in other words, don't go out of your way).
