I have been here a few times, yet I still order the same entree because they are the best at it. I might have to rank wildfire's prime rib as the best in the city. The herb crust doesn't over power the cut of the meat and temp is perfect.  Each time I've eaten here, the marble of the meat is perfect, so you don't end up with more fat on your plate then meat in your stomach.  The wine list is above average for a steak joint. They carry your basic reds, yet don't have anything so unique that have to order. Service..This is why I had to take off a star. I have had both ends of the spectrum (under attentive to way way over attentive).
