I'll rave about this place. I went on a Thursday, late morning, sat at the counter next to another out of towner like myself. Service was great, though the place was hoppin busy. I had a made to order skillet of vegetables (zucchini, mushrooms, spinach, asparagus & fresh tomato) minus the red potatoes with a bit of shredded cheddar (not a dousing of it, but a taste) & two over easy eggs atop it. This is their Vegetarian Skillet, made to order. It was perfect! The eggs were just perfection & the veggies were fresh, top quality and cooked just right. Coffee was good and it kept coming. They had regular and flavored creamers. For my side I had a pancake - this was cooked fluffy and golden crisp on its edges, again- just right. I'll see you again next summer, and that's no yolk, Yolk!
