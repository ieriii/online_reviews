Second Pig restaurant I'd eaten at within a two week period. Sorry Purple Pig, the timing was not in your favor. While the Pigster doesn't hold up to the fabulous Cochon, I may be biased since Purple Pig is very wine-centric. I am not a wine drinker. Though I believe that the food should be able to stand alone... Pig ears were cool. 2.5 Stars, rounding up to 3.
