I'm not sure I have anything new to add to the discussion on Schwa, but it's hard to let such a memorable meal pass without comment. It goes without saying that the food is incredible. Right up there with the best of the best but for me Carlson's ability to keep things (relatively) accessible while simultaneously blowing your mind is seriously badass. The apple pie soup, the veal heart and honey tagliatelle, the sweetbread biscuits and gravy - amazing. Oh and the memory of the biggest star of the night at our table - the unexpected pork belly - it's enough to make you weep. The older I get, the less desire I have to be sit in a stuffy dining room and "behave" for a whole meal. Here you wear jeans (or whatever the hell you want), the walls are spray-painted black and gray, the music is loud and in your face and no-one batted an eye while we were rolling our post dinner cigarettes at the table. By some stroke of luck my husband called at 10.30 am and by 2.30 pm we had a table for the same night. Now I'm experiencing the full mailbox that so many have talked about while I try to procure a table for April. Is it annoying? Yeah, a bit. Worth it? 100% And all for $110 a head? Insane. Completely insane.
