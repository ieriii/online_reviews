i went to this restaurant once. I was quite disappointed. they try to do a fusion thing. it doesn't work. they would do better to stick to the basics. i won't go again. why three stars then? their pho is good, a bit over priced, but they'll deliver it (but with a $15 minimum). there is nothing quite like having a piping hot bowl of pho delivered right to your front door. yum! Edit: i go to this place regularly now, but only order the pho. nothing else i've ever had has been good. Edit: they also have a beef salad that is pretty fantastic. they have a dumpling appetizer (but don't get the fish) that is delicious. i just upped the stars to four. because i really do like to go here.
