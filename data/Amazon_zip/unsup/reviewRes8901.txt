We came here at the recommendation of a friend. We had a pretty enjoyable time. That being said I didn't give 5 stars because I found the food to be really bland. I ordered the chicken and kibbadeh kababs and they were cooked perfectly, and the chicken was probably the most succulent chicken I've ever had. The kibbedeh was good as well, and was actually seasoned alot more than the chicken. Also the service was a little too slow for me, the waiter never asked me if I wanted another drink and would walk away from our table so fast that I didn't really have the opportunity to ask him. Bottom line? I recommend going to Noon o Kabab, just don't expect your food to have the same kick that you'd get from other middle eastern places.
