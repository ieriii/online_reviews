Took the family to Chicago for a long weekend and wanted to get some deep-dish pizza, and frankly I didn't care if we went to Giardano's, Pizzeria Uno or what. Gino's East was close by the hotel, and the concierge had a "preferred seating" pass for us, which was HUGE. The line was at least an hour wait (in the rain), but with the preferred seating, we were able to get a table in less than 20 minutes. Not being a regular, I asked the hostess what we should order, and she recommended the deep-dish spinach pizza. My wife and daughter had their first encounter with deep-dish and both were very impressed (I was already a fan). Chasing it with a couple of Goose Island tall ones and it was a terrific meal. If you can handle the wait to get in the place, Gino's is well worth a visit.
