This is really the greatest restaurant I have been to in ...forever. For a truly special occasion, this is the place to have a great time. Those who give it 3 or less stars are not serious reviews.  (Since 3 or less stars is just a0ok and 2 is i have had better..) It is unfortunate that some people had very specific bad experiences there but that is more of a rare occurrence from what i have read.  Read any of the other 5 star review and you get the idea. IK have been to other chef tasting restaurants for about the same price and no other place match both presentation and taste.   My wife and i came with 4 other people and every one of us was blown away by the quality and service.  I could go on about the food and the service and the presentation, but there are so many reviews that articulate better than i would or could. This review is really to say that if you are on yelp undecided about this place, my answer is JUST GO!
