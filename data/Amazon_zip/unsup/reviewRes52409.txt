can you have too much meat? not if you decide to come here. Should you eat any meals before hand? The proper way to come here is to eat to light meals during the day and then show up here after 6pm. I am not a Dr but this is my advice:) The meat is juicy and they will never bring you meat that you may think deserves more work. They have good dessert...not that you need it after the meal or anything:)
