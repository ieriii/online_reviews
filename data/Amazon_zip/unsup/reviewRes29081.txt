This is a couple steps up from making pasta at home, and it's worth the price. They have about 20 pasta dishes (think some form of noodle and some sauce) and I've yet to have anything I didn't like (also some paninis I've never tried). The place has Chicago character and is cozy, even suitable for a casual date. Average meal and a drink will run you $15/person. Stop in for lunch and there are plenty of tables open, but at dinner time the best spots to sit are usually full. But it's a quick turnaround. Last time I had lunch here I was done in 18 minutes, perfect for the big city lifestyle. The service is very friendly and will forgive you for showing up in sweatpants.  I give them extra points for the meal portions, which are enough to fill a 190 lb. guy, but won't make you feel like you need to bring half of it home to feed the dog (a la Carmine's).
