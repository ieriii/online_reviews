Love Love this place. Firstly, the food is just really damn good. Im from eastern NC and this is truly adventerous & authentic tasty southern goods. Yeah its fancified a bit and portions are medium size for real traditional southern plates.. and thats all good with me. The cocktail menu is delish and a fun companion. The first time we went we sat with a waiter named Andy who helped make the experience, super professional and knowlegeable everything. We always request to sit with him now so I cant speak the rest of the service - The adult coffee drinks & deserts make my heart go boom! I dont think its too pricy for the quality of the experience but its not a once a week place either, I reserve for friends, special occasions, etc.
