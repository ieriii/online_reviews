I've been here twice. I'm not going to go too in depth in this review since 400 other people have covered that.  Great staff, very caring, and a great selection of whiskey. Food is executed well. Some of the portions are REALLY small. It'd be great if the servers would mention that too people who might be REALLY hungry.
