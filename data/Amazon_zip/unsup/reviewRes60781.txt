I ate here last night and I have to say, great place! I have to admit, when I heard the patio was in the parking lot I thought, yuck, but I was completely wrong. The patio was nice and comfortable with beautiful flowers all around.   Delicious food too! My husband and I were nervous because we usually eat pretty plain American food and didn't know how to approach the somewhat fancy menu. We were both going to just get a burger until our server saved us and sent us in the right direction. Her name was Shannon and we loved her.  I had the rib eye which was so juicy and flavorful and my husband had the chicken dish with tomato and basil and croutons. I was a bit scared of the gorgonzola on top of the steak she recommended but she convinced me I would be ok and she was right! It was sooo good. Not only that but my husband was drooling over the sliders she talked us into. At first I thought she might be one of those waitresses that just tries to get you to buy the most expensive stuff on the menu, but she was really honest and knew her stuff. Although we did end up spending close to 40 bucks on wine and cocktails....and I'm usually don't drink that much in restaurants but Shannon wouldn't let us go without trying her favorite drinks, which were amazing and totally worth buying. Beware though, although the cocktails don't taste strong, I sure got a little buzz! On top of all the great guidance, she was hilarious, really sarcastic and cute. Frankly I am surprised at the amount of attention we got from her because the patio was so packed, I think she was everyone's waitress out there, yet everyone still seemed happy, I know we were at least. All in all she made our night, everyone should ask for this girl (look for the girl who looks like Mila Jovavich), she's great!
