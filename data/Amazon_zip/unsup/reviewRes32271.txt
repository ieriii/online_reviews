Always wanted to try Ethiopian food and this past Saturday night was my first time. Arrived around 6:30pm (just early enough to beat the dinner rush! Thank goodness). Our waitress was super nice and super helpful; she gave us suggestions depending our taste preferences and she also showed us the proper way to eat our food. I shared the Veg-meat messob with my friend, so you get two vegetarian and two meat choices. We picked Ye-Doro Tibs (chicken dish), Ye-Siga Wat (beef dish), Gomen (collard greens), and Quosta (spinach) on injera, which is a large sourdough flatbread. We also had the Chicken and Vegetable Sambussa. Everything was quite tasty. Would definitely go again. The atmosphere was also very nice. It seemed pretty authentic, but I don't really have anything else to compare it to. Would go again.
