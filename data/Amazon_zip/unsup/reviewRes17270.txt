Went in tonight with my husband for dinner. I had the ropa vieja appetizer which was like always absolutely amazing. Somehow I restrained myself and did not lick the plate :). I had the pernil (pork shoulder) for my main course and the Carnivale ice cream cake for dessert. The pernil is absolutely out of this world and the the rum flight I had was really good too. The ice cream cake was ok, that's why I'm giving the four stars. The service was very good. The food at Carnivale is consistanly amazing and this is definitely one of my top 3 restaurants in the city. I lived for South Florida in a long time and I always feel at home when I am here.
