My querida and I came here with a couple of folks from church for Sunday lunch. To be honest, I might have experienced Christ's real presence in, with, and under the pizza bread as much as during communion beforehand. That good. This is about as good a poster child for classic, old-school Italian restaurant as can be found...and unlike the cluster of restaurants in Heart of Chicago, the prices here are AMAZING. And the service. And the food. It should be said that we went with a couple of regulars who have been eating at Sabatino's almost every week for years, and we definitely benefited from some major VIP treatment, but...this place has a killer waitstaff. Attentive, friendly, knowledgeable of everything on the menu and at the bar...the whole deal.  As for food...again, there was a little VIP treatment going on (such as the tray of free cannoli and mini tiramisu), but that doesn't affect the kitchen. The pizza bread is to die for - perfect, crisp, wood-fired crust with excellent sauce and a just-right layer of melted cheese. The soup and salad were both nicely done; I especially appreciated the abundance of real blue cheese in my salad dressing. Entrees were excellent, and great portion sizes for the price. My veal saltimbocca was cooked and seasoned perfectly; the veal parmigiana was also a home run. The desserts did not disappoint; how can you really go wrong with cannoli and tiramisu? And all of this food, plus two drinks a person, plus amazing service, was a BARGAIN. This place is one of the best food finds I've made in a long, long time; check it out!
