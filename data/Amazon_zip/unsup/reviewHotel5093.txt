Stopped by this place yesterday to pick something up quickly. The hotel is indeed nice, however, one staff member I interacted with was pretty rude. When heading southbound on Michigan Ave, the hotel will be on your right side. There are a whole bunch of cabs lines up there, followed some space for drop offs central to the lobby opening. Right after that there is an area for deliveries or for standing up to 15 minutes. The sign said to put on your flashing lights if you leave your vehicle. Well I did that, ran inside, got what I came to pick up from an associate, and went back to my car. The guy assisting with getting peoples cabs was pretty aggressive saying I can't park there. I don't like when people raise their voice on me so I told him in a stern voice that I followed the directions of what the sign said and was on my way. I was in the hotel for maybe 10-12 minutes maximum.
