I've heard so much about Chicago Diner and could not wait to eat there. Being from LA, I have lots of vegan restaurants to choose from and compare to, but still Chicago Diner is a classic and I'm so happy to have finally eaten there. The flavor of the food here is great, but some of the textures are off. For an appetizer, I had the spicy buffalo style seitan wings with vegan ranch. Some pieces were so hard and chewy while others were soft and melted in your mouth. It tasted very good though. For the entrees, I shared the country fried seitan steak, mashed potatoes, gravy, pesto sauteed vegetables, bbq bacon cheezeburger, and macaroni & cheeze. Again, chewy seitan steak, but the entire plate was comfort food and totally delicious. I liked the sauteed vegetables and cheeseburger very much. I've had better vegan bacon. I wished the macaroni & cheese had a creamier texture, this one was crumbly and lacked cheeze flavor. This place serves great vegan comfort food in a cozy diner. I went for an early dinner on a Wednesday night, so no wait. Great coffees and teas (hot or iced) to choose from and nice servers. I didn't get to try any desserts because I was already so stuffed. The prices are more reasonable than vegan places in LA. I wish I could go back soon...
