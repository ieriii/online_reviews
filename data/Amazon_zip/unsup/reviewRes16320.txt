I want to review the violet hour, but I feel like it's so much better to just go there on the sole recommendation that it's an amazing place to experience. They've got an incredibly unique introduction for the uninitiated which is why I don't want to ruin the experience I had going in there unprepared. If you've never been there and don't know what it is, let me tell you only this: the entrance is just a little to the right of where they want you to think it is. Once you get in, put your name in with the doorman. Bring a close friend or two and wait for what lies within. and that's it. That's all I'm going to tell you. Read the other reviews if you want to spoil it for yourself, but I think it's definitely worth letting the Violet Hour introduce itself.
