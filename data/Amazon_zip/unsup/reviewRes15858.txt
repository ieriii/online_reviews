Took my girlfriend out for dinner saturday. She had the octopus that looked freaky on plate, but it tasted good. GREAT vitamin c martinis, my pasta dish totally sucked and the prices were VERY HIGH. she wanted to try this place as we had a reservation at Mia's (yes, she gets what she wants.) and i regret not keeping our date at Mia's. Not sure how they justify the outrageous pricing, but we won't ever come back here again...
