Went there based on the recommendation of a couple we met in the street while looking for a place to eat. They suggested Calo's - a perfect recommendation. Great neighborhood restaurant. The food was fresh and down right delicious. The service was quick and professional. I recommend the house vinaigrette to go with your salad.
