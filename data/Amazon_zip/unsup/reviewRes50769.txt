Fun, cool, friendly, and really good eats. One star for the fun and wacky decor. Carved wooden chickens, lamps with forks and spoons in them, funny custom art all over the place. A soul food feast for the eyes! Three more stars for the deeeelicious food. I had the crawfish cakes, hoppin' jack and sauteed spinach, and I cleaned my plate (well, except for the slaw, but that's a personal preference.)  The final star is for our lovely waitress. She was so honestly cheerful and friendly (without being annoyingly chipper), with great recommendations and attentive service, that we would go again just to sit in her section and really enjoy the dining experience. Thanks, May! Your sunny personality brightened up a dreary winter night.
