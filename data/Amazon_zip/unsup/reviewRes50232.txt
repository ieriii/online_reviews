It's already been established that brunch is my favorite meal of the day so I love finding new places that have a unique take on it. So you have Southern food on one hand and brunch on the other, and you put your hands together, and what you get my friend is Big Jones. To start, I have to mention that this place is adorable, beautifully decorated, a feast for your eyes as you wait for your breakfast. I love that they take reservations on Open Table so you don't have to wait. Great location on this "restaurant strip" on Clark in Andersonville. Easy street parking. Andersonville is the new Bucktown, fewer hipsters, easier parking, less wait, great food. I ordered the "Simple Southern Breakfast" which came with two farm eggs (I got 'em scrambled), with something that tasted like a crab cake, plus creamy cheese grits, and cornbread--all for $9, great deal. I'm usually not a fan of grits, but I had to give them another try since the server said their grits are awesome. I still think potatoes are better than grits, but these grits were better than what I've had before. Eggs were terrific, crab cake thingy was delicious, cornbread was awesome, oh how I love cornbread. Yum. My friend ordered the "Big Jones Benedict" which came with smoked ham simmered in Kilgus Farmstead cream, served on a traditional farmstead biscuit with poached eggs and potatoes. I had a taste of it and it was delicious, the biscuit was phenomenal. The Bloody Mary--get it! It's good, garnished with a pickle and okra, it's got kick and there's nothing better than a good Bloody Mary to help you get over your hangover from the night before. Great coffee served in big mugs and refilled promptly. Great, friendly service. Big Jones is my new brunch bff.
