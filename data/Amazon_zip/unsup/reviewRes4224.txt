A friend of mine who is very familiar with the Chicago music scene took me here one night and I was in awe. That night was a "jam" night, meaning several musicians would switch out between songs and the "band" was always changing. It was truly incredible the skill of these musicians to be able to play such great jazz with each other even though they are not a real band. The place is beautiful inside. Hand carved wood adorns nearly every part of the bar, while the walls are lined with beautiful mural paintings. There are massive wooden tables and calm "jazzy" lighting. A+ for ambiance. The waitress I had was very rude, however, I ended up by passing here and just ordering from the bar every time. I don't need a waitress who had a bad day trying to ruin my night. The booze prices are reasonable given the epicness of the venue. If I lived in Chicago this is the kind of scene I would be found at weekly. It's truly worth a visit.
