The food is good and unique, but here's my beef. This place has limited hours and closes often for any reason they can think up. I've driven past there many times intending on going there to eat but they were closed. They also have limited seating relative to their sales. These two characteristics are obvious marketing ploys that many people are falling for. They've got the perfect combination of being exotic but still safe. If the lines are out the door then they must be popular, right? Well the line begins five feet from the door so if there are more than three customers then the line is going to be out the door. How many times do you see more than three customers at McDonalds? The difference is McDonald's and many other vendors of unhealthy food provide a certain level of customer service that Hot Doug refuses to.
