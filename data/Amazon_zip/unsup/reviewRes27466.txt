Four stars, only docked for CASH ONLY and a language barrier. It's kind of a trade off though... You might ask for a Pepsi, and instead you're disappointed to find a white glass of milky something set on your table. No worries though, it will be, quite possibly, the best damn Horchata of your life and will wipe away the spicy salsas. They bring out a certain type of free appetizer while you wait, I've read in past reviews it was a chicken soup of sorts, and in my visit it was an amazing taquito. I got the tamales, they were okay, but I'm comparing this to authentic tamales made by my grandmothers cleaning lady... so maybe I'm expecting too much. For the record, they only have coke products, so if you say the word Pepsi, you might just get the amazing Horchada. Also, this is a cash only establishment, which is fine... I'm not complaining, but I never carry cash. The nearest ATM is an MB bank just west on the same street which is "locked" after hours. Pull on the handle twice, it worked for me.
