Love irazu. Went here for lunch on a sat'day. Its a casual place with some seriously good food. We tried the vegetarian chifrijo - wow. It was a flavor explosion. Absolutely loved it. Then hubby and I shared the veggie burrito, which was also very good. Food is pretty inexpensive and super delicious.
