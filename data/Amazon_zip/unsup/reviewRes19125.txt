Basically my new fave place in my neighborhood. Very open and friendly atmosphere. EXCELLENT food. Burgers are kind of phenom. Sandwiches rock out. UMMM the salmon salad I had was kind of out of control good that I crave it again. Also how many freakin' beers can one choose from?! A whoooole lot. They have a variety of beers on tap and bottle to choose from that just make the experience all the better. And they have some deliciously cheaply priced martinis! Lovin' me my options of good beers or mixed drinks!
