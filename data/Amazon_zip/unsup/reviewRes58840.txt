My favourite place for Sunday Brunch!The tempura French toast is AMAZING! As are the rolls we tried and the dim sum.The atmosphere is lovely, relaxing (it was mid-morning on a Sunday, so I dont know what its like at happy hour or for dinner) and the staff attentive and knowledgeable of the menu.The tea bar is great! And the bloody Mary bar is huge with a big selection.If you have guests in town, bring them here for brunch!
