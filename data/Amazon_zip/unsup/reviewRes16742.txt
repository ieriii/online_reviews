I absolutely fell in love with this place when I went. I was invited to go with a friend for her birthday. I like that it is a rather hidden gem--I would have never found it if my friend didn't meet me. I have been searching for a quiet lounge type place forever in this city and this is it. The drinks are a little steep but are very tasty. I enjoyed the environment a lot. I really hope they turn the fire place on in the winter! It is so cozy. Can't wait to take my bf on a date there!
