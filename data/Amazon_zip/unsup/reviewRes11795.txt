Piece, everybody likes it. You know why, it's not deep dish and it's a little different. Pretty good home brew beers and fun atmosphere and great space. The hitch: is there a guy in the back just covering the pizza's with salt or what? I can't seem to get enough water in my system after eating there. Warning: hydrate before consuming 'za at piece.
