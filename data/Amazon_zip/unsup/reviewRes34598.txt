This is the best breakfast place I've eaten at in Chicago thus far. I've only been here once and even had to sit at the counter bc it was so crowded but i don't care!! Simply amazing. I loved the banana french toast. Food was delivered very quickly, and I would go back in a heart beat! My friend got the crepes which were delicious as well. I left unable to move I was so full!
