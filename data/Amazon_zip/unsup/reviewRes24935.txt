Very very good place. Perfect portions of the food. Nice clean place to sit down and eat. The staff is very nice and helpful. This is easily one of my favorite places in Greektown, much less the city of chicago. My suggestion for anyone considering going there is to order the espresso. It's perfect. They grind the beans just the right amount.
