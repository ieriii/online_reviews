I've only ever had delivery from Coast. The ladyfriend and I aren't hip enough to eat there. The sushi is always delicious! But Coast is VERY expensive, and our bill for carryout or delivery always winds up being in the $40-$50 range. Ouch! Plus they seem to have trouble finding the apartment sometimes, even though we always give very specific directions when we place the order.
