I love the Green Mill. The prices are more than reasonable (considering other jazz clubs in the city) and I've yet to have an unpleasant time here. In the past I've had friends change their minds on jazz after taking one trip to the Mill. It caters to what you like in nightlife. If you like the crowded happening scene show up late Friday and Saturday nights as the place will most likely be packed. If you want to hear some good music get there early for the first set and you'll generally be get a good table. As far as the regulars go I would personally recommend the Tuesday night set with the Deep Blue Trio or Alfonso Ponticelli on Wednesday nights. Two different vibes, but both are definitely worth checking out. Check the calendar at http://www.greenmilljazz for what suites you best. Occasionally the Jeff Parker Organ Quartet will play Mondays and those evenings are not to be missed.  The covers are usually not much and you'll be pleased with yourself after getting inside. The bar has a great selection of liquor, some decent wine and modest beer prices. It's open until 4am, so if you just want to take in the scene and see what this legendary place has to offer come in at 2 and look around. The bartenders rule and will probably do a shot with you.
