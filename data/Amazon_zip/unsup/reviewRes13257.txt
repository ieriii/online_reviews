Mad props for the best bloody mary I've had in Chicago and for the best fruit bowl I've probably had anywhere. Seriously, most places skimp on the fruit bowl, but this one was towering and hard to finish. There's lots on the menu, so there's something for everyone. I wouldn't say the food is gourmet, but it feels like brunch time at a family joint.
