I am always happy with Calo! My cousin and her husband are in town and we just ate there tonight... Her and I split two dishes the specialty rolled egg plant with cheesy goodness and a great menagerie of pasta fresh mozzarella and grape tomatoes they were both great dishes! My cousins husband was blown away by his Chicken Madeira dish, I tried it, it was juicy and flavorful, it was great! We accompanied all of this with a great bottle of new zealand pinot noir priced at just 32 bucks... The best part of the journey for sure is the amazing focaccia bread they serve up front... It is so warm and buttery and flavorful! I always ask for more even though I know I don't need the extra calories!
