Mayan Palace is by far my favorite restaurant in the city.I grew up on Mexican food in California and I was a little worried about not being able to find a place in Chicago that was as good as the food I'm used to. When I went into Mayan Palace for the first time, I was a little worried because the place looked a lot fancier than the awesome little places I'm used to. After one bite, I was so happy I gave this place a chance.My boyfriend and I go to Mayan Palace at least twice a month (sometimes up to once a week when the weather is nice!). The food is amazing. The chips, salsa, and guacamole are amazing. The service is awesome. I can't say anything bad about this place. I love Mayan Palace.
