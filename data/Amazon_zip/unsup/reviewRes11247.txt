What's the deal here, why would anyone wait hours? I came on a Friday with a friend for lunch which thankfully meant no wait, but for a weekend? There are 1,000 better brunch places in chicago. 1) No veggie sandwiches. I know there are breakfast items, but c'mon, humor me, ONE LUNCH SANDWICH. 2) I got the veggie egg croissant sandwich. In a word: "Meh." 3) The Intelligentisia was also not that great. Wtf? 4) Slightly expensive for meh food. **Bonus: Lovely staff! But really? I'll be sticking to lula or handlebar :)
