Overall its a decent hotel. The advantages are great Hilton family services, very comfy beds, free DT cookies, and the hotel restaurant was very good. The disadvantages are they charge for WiFi, bad HVAC system, funny smell in the hallways and really slow elevators. I also found it to be a loud hotel since they didn't have thick enough walls or good enough windows.
