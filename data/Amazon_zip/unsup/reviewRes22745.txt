The first time I went to Irazu, I was slightly skeptical but mainly excited. One whiff of home and I was overwhelmed with emotion and hunger. Irazu's eat-in cuisine is delicious and just like the food my mom used to make in Nicoya, Costa Rica. Portion sizes are generous even though I smashed EVERYTHING on my plate. You really won't want to stop eating even once you're full. With this experience in mind, I ordered from Irazu for a Lunch and Learn at work. I figured they would be late because it's Tican Time - what do you expect, however they cut it waaay too close to the actual starting time of the presentation for comfort. The sandwiches might have been good if they were hot (not completely their fault) and the chips with salsa were good. I was dissapointed in the meal, but everyone at work liked it. The point is, eat in. You won't regret it! Pura Vida!
