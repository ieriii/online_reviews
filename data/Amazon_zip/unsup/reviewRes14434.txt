This is super solid beer, okay food and awesome service.  The bacon popcorn? Maybe a bit more hype than needed. It's popcorn. With bacon. It was good, but nothing to get your panties in a bunch over. Bacon makes everything that much better. I got the flemish beef stew, which, quite frankly, I loved. The SO got the sausage and ham plate, which he said was okay. Probably better as an app to be shared though.  My overall impression was that I like this joint. I am definitely a fan, and I would definitely recommend it.
