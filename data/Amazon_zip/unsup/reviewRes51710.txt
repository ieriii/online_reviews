seriously, this little joint has the best mexican food ive had. one of the reasons i miss my old neighborhood. every time i go here i know what to expect and they usually deliver. most of the time i get the combo meals especially the one taco/tostada/enchilada meal. their steak and al pastor are very tasty and tender. sometimes i change it up and just get a taco dinner. wanna try something that will fill you up? try what my friends and i affectionately call the drew special: 1 steak torta and 2 steak tacos. problems with garcias are ones that usually coincide with popular places: always packed and limited parking. prices have gone up throughout the years, but the food is worth every penny. since i grew up by this place, i will always have special place for garcias whether its late night at 2am or for just plain old take-out. garcias is what i measure other mexican food places to.
