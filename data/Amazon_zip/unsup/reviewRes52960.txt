I am moving. For the record, in case you didn't know moving is stressful! You are constantly packing, throwing stuff out you didn't even know you had, putting loved things into storage... Plus you are broke, exhausted and in a foul mood! Boyfriend decided I needed some Cuban food. I had never had a Cuban sandwich before! I'll be back though... I had the Timba which is GUAVA, melted Swiss cheese, toasted bread and you can dip this entire delicious concoction into mustard! Yum! My boyfriend had ham and cheese- he says an authentic cuban sandwich should be loaded with pickles too- I don't care- My Timba is the stuff of dreams. They also had fried yuca- which is my new favorite thing- it is like a cross between puff pastry in texture and the best d@mn french-fried potato of your life. I also had fried plantain (like chips) and a huge iced cafe con leche- thus fueled, I am now able to finish this move! I may demand more yuca though. Possibly next time some guava empanadas too- burning a lot of calories!
