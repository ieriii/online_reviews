"A whiskey bar with a killer kitchen" is what the bartender mumbled to me. Of course calling him simply a "Bartender" was a bit of a misnomer.  This was a master mixologist... carefully blending flavors and textures together as he magically created a potion so magical it had no name.  Well, at least none that I remember.  I blame the whiskey. A good bartender knows the art of the show.  We all sat captivated watching him play with the poison.  Like Tom Cruise in cocktail, just taller, smarter and not believing in alien creatures who desire our souls. An instant new favorite.
