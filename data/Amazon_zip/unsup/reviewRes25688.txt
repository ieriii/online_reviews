LOUD, a bit overpriced. Food had to be sent back. 1st our soup came with no noodles. Then the second soup came out & was cold... We asked them to reheat it then pack it up to go. We took it across the street to POTBELLY's where you could sit & not smell the woman's perfume next to you. The staff need help! The girl moved us THREE times to accommodate a larger group. I understand you have to make money, but uprooting us while we are eating, to take half the table is absurd! On the positive side, the older man was really nice.
