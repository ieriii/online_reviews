The food was as good as the other location, and the performance space was much bigger, which was great, but I work with a band that had performed at the other location and was having their first one at the Devon location, and the sound guy was a complete prick! He basically blamed the band for the bad job he did on the sound! I also asked him where the bathroom was very nicely and he acted as if he can't be bothered. I would strongly suggest to Uncommon ground to choose all their staff wisely, not just the waitstaff and hosts. All of the employees, no matter what their capacity represent your restaurant.
