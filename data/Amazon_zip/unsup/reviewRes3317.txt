I went with a group of five so we were able to try everything. I thought all the wings were just ok, the super spicy one (buffalo??) was almost inedible. And there's something that needs to be said about Asian Fusion and Americanized Asian, they're not the same thing.  The bimibap was authentic, not spicy enough, but flavors were still there. Their fried foods seems odd to have there, like onion rings and fried mushroom. Not gonna go again :( Sticking to my Great Seas.
