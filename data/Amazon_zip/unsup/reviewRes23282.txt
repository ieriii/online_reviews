Stop reading and get yer butt over there. Parking....not as bad as it looks. Service...almost too friendly and I totally do not make it easy since I am a total extra sauce whore. Know the waiters names now and get greeted by the owner when I walk in. Food never disappoints...my naughty favorite is the Chichironne plate. They make pork feel, look, and taste very grown up. And I need as much of that as I can get. Love the Chicken with rice dinner....you WILL take half of it home, count on it. The yucca with garlic sauce is wicked good. Oatmeal shake is a must...even if you think it sounds odd or u don't dig oatmeal..GET IT. If you don't like it, you need professional help and someone else at your table will devour it asap.  A big plus...they sell bottles of the Linzano sauce which I can drink straight, it's so good. Pricey but worth it. For early afternoon..try the egg and black bean sammy. Bread is perfect pull apart consistency and won't pull out all the other ingredients. It is BYOB, they DO deliver and they do prep Take out. Outdoor patio is decent. Music is oddly cool. Two only complaints: 1. CASH only 2. CLOSED on Sundays. Don't hesitate with this place. Good good stuff!
