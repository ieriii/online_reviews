I thought Mercat a la Planxa was good at best. Although the food was delicious, I thought the service and management need severe help. We arrived early for a 7:30 reservation and were told they could seat us earlier. By the time we were shown to our table it was 7:50. We wouldn't have cared if the bartender wasnt horrible. The bald asian bartender needs some serious help. Not only was he rude, he poured the weakest .75 ounce of tequilla ($13) I have ever had. Even the young hostess was pathetic. At one point, another party complianed to her about the bartender and she just rolled her eyes. At our table we had a pleasant waitress who really didnt provide assistance with the menu. However, the food quality was great. We are large foodies and ordered a wide assortment of the plates, which were all delicious. We did have a manager come to our table to check on how things were going, but she showed up 2 minutes after we sat down. The waitress never checked on us until all of our plates were finished. Overall, I dont think we will rush back. I really liked the food but did not like the whole experience. For our party of four, we spent $250 and I would have appreciated a better experience. Even on our way out, another manager asked about our night. When we explained our issues, he rolled his eyes (they must teach that) and walked away. There are better restaurants in Chicago. I am really surprised by the number of positive reviews. They must not eat out often.
