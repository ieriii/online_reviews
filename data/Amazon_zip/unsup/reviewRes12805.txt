Always enjoyed going until our last experience. We went for my birthday dinner with parents and my partner. There was an hour wait on Labor day which was understandable so we went to the bar to get a cocktail. I looked over the drink menu and after checking out what bottle of wines I wanted to order for dinner, I shut the menu. The bartender came over and in an annoyed tone asked me if I was ready. I said I would have a jack and coke and he responded by saying, "After all that you just want a jack and coke?" I told him that would be fine and that I was reviewing the drink menu for dinner.  Right after our drinks came out our table was ready and we asked if our drinks and bill could be transferred over to the table. The bartender told us that it was very difficult to do and that a manager would need to get involved. My partner that had a full martini asked if someone could at least bring that over to the table since it is dark in the dining area and he didn't want to accidentally spill on anyone. They made him feel like it was a stupid request. I'm not so sure about this place anymore, the service is now inconsistent and for the price tag it sucked having to talk about how awful the service was at the start of dinner.
