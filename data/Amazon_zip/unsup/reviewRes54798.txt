I'll keep this one short:Great beer selection. Tasty menu. Impossible to get in, even on a Tuesday. Y'all would make more money if your bar eating rules were less awkward. How about a bar menu for when I want to eat but it's packed with a two hour wait? Also, how about letting me sit in the dining room and drink but not eat for when it's the bar is packed and I want to sit and talk to my companions?If I'm not hungry, I'll go to the Map Room. If I am hungry, I'll go somewhere else. If it's 4pm, I'll go to Hopleaf.This doesn't read like a four star review. Hopleaf really is a pretty sweet place. I can't fault y'all for being popular and delicious.
