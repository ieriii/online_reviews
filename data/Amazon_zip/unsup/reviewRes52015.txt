I was amused for hours just by reading the writing on the wall. There was one next to a friend that said "Has No Testicles" with a big arrow pointing right to his head. Another had "Loves the Dudes" over his shoulder. I'm not so sure I loved the pizza... but my group seemed to really enjoy it. I also was hungover, so probably anything I ate would have made me grossed me out. We had 3 guys and 3 girls... and one large and 1 small was MORE than enough for all of us. One slice of pizza was like eating an entire Little Caesars pizza all to yourself... all stacked on top of each other. Our service was great the atmosphere was a lot of fun. I'd come back :)
