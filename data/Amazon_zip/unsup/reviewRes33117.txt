After hearing that my favorite Middle Eastern place in Chicago had closed it's doors (bye bye Alladin's), it was recommended that I try Sultan's Market. While it is tiny inside and doesn't have waiters/ waitresses, the food more than makes up for it. I must mention, the place draws an odd crowd. It seemed there were a lot of students there, but also some random loners. There was a guy reading Hitler's book with tattoos all down his arms, sitting alone, not eating, and checking out everyone who walked in. I shot him a few death stares when he looked our way. Just a head's up to be prepared for strange birds in that place. I've been there twice. The first time, I opted for their falafel It was filled to the brim with everything delicious - falafel, hummus, veggies, rice/lentil mixture if you want it, and I'm sure they'd throw in anything else you ask for. Priced around $4, it is well worth it.  My second trip, I got a little more adventurous, and created a big plate for myself from their salad bar. It is priced by weight, and has everything you can think of - hearts of palm, grilled vegetables, dolmas, sun dried tomatoes, beets, mushrooms, artichokes, etc. I think for a large container, it was around $8. I finished off the meal with baklava which was tasty, but was given a corner peice which was mostly filo dough (lacking some of the yummy filling).  Next trip there, I'll try one of their hot plates. I will be back!
