Having eaten here 2 days after Lou Mitchell's, I would say this place is a star lower than Lou Mitchell's but still really good for brunch. It's definitely a small space, so on a cold Chicago winter's weekend, you're cramped like sardines trying to wait the 40-50 minutes for your table. But it's very trendy, well-decorated, and the bathrooms are surprisingly clean for such a tight, high-traffic area. I had the french toast with pear compote, cranberry streusel and caramel gelato on top. Really creative and good but a tad too sweet for my liking. My husband got their chocolate french toast with bananas, chocolate and mascarpone cheese, and I think one bite of it was enough for me. It was really good, but more like a dessert item that I could eat a small plate of, rather than a full plate for a big brunch that will lead you to a major sugar crash in a couple hours. My sister got the burrito with sweet potato puree and the cilantro-jalapeno tortilla. Very creative and surprising mix of ingredients, but my sister said after the first few bites, she actually wasn't ALL that wowed by it. Good though. That was my impression of my bite of another friend's breakfast burrito. Good sized, that's for sure. My mom got the eggs benedict with beef tenderloin on top, which was pretty tasty. My dad's vegetarian crossaint sandwich was a nice healthy alternative. Overall good. $85 for 6 people felt a little steep, but hey we're on vacation.
