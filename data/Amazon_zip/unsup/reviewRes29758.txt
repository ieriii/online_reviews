This might be one of my favorite restaurants ever. Everything I've tried here is amazing but I really love the mole enchilladas. I haven't tried them anywhere else because I'm afraid I will be dissapointed. The margaritas, sunfish ceviche and desserts are great too. The wait was about 2 hours but I knew that ahead of time so it didn't ruin the night. I'll definitely make a reservation earlier next time.
