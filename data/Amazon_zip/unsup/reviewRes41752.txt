It's not too often that you choose a steakhouse, in downtown Chicago, and have a perfect experience from the moment you arrive to the moment you leave. That happens at Ruth's Chris Steakhouse on Dearborn and Hubbard. The service is impeccable, the food is delicious, and the ambiance is classy. It really comes together, perfectly, because of the management (under GM Michael Schultz and Chef Jorge Fernandez). If you want mouth-watering steak,served with the signature sizzle, a dedicated and knowledgable staff (wines, pairings, kinds of meat, etc), an absolutely delicious menu full of appetizers and sides that are both sweet and savory and continously perfected, and a wonderful night on the town with co-workers, family, friends, or a special date, go to Ruth's Chris. You'll be glad you did.
