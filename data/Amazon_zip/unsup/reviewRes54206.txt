I have been coming here religiously for the past 3-4 years or so, and never thought to write a review till tonight. Why you ask tonight of all nights made me want to do this, because I just came back from a H O R R I B I L E place and the 1st thing to came to mind after I walked out the front door was I should of went to Irazu.I will keep this short, Irazu has KILLER food at more than reasonable prices, great service, great delivery, etc... All the food is great, especially the Ceviche (best in the city by far) & their Steak sandwich. You get hungry, you go to Irazu, you get great service, eat killer food, are wowed by the cheap bill, and you go on with your day.If I could give this place 10 stars I would...
