I love this place. It's very quick and easy to get a bite here at anytime during the week. Somehow there always seems to be at least one extra table where you can get a seat. The prices are very good and it's a great first date place. It may not be fancy, but the atomsphere is very good and it's easy to get to know someone here. At the same time, my family wants to go here all the time when they are in town. The food is very good too. I suggest the sandwhiches or artopitas. Also, always go with the pasta salad over the potatoe salad.
