Meet me in the Bar! The best Shaw's has to offer starts and stops in this setting. The perfect (yes, perfect) surroundings- bar atmosphere, fresh seafood, top notch service and oyster shooters at the ready - heaven. Do not ruin the experience sitting amoung the dinner tables...enjoy the youth and chaos of the bar. Oh, order up some half shell samplers, lobster bisck, and a crab cake sandwich. This is what we're fighting for...
