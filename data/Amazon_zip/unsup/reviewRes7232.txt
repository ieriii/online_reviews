So freakin' good. Used to live right around the corner and smelled the delicious smell of BBQ all the time - if my wallet could handle it, I'd be here every week. It is expensive (bill for 2 was about $100), but amazing food. I had the brisket and the mac & cheese. The mac & cheese is beyond tasty, and the brisket was very tender. Not a huge fan of any of the BBQ sauces, but the meat is good on its own! The service is also great and I can't wait to go back again!
