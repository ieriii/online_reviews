I don't believe there's a better stuffed, deep-dish pizza in Chicago. And if there's not a better one in Chicago, there's not a better one anywhere. Some people prefer Lou Malnati's style; that's fine, but that's not classic. Art of Pizza delivers on fantastic stuffed pizza with a sauce that isn't too sweet, and a fresh taste. Now that they've expanded in size, you can actually expect to get a table.
