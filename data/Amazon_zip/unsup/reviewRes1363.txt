An hour wait...nothing is worth an hour wait. Here's what I tried after being thoroughly annoyed. Uber Garlic Pork Sausage with Sweet Curry Mustard, Vintage Van Gogh Cheese and Roasted Garlic Cloves The Atomic Bomb Spicy Pork Sausage with Spicy Prickly Pear Cactus Mayonnaise and Cheese Medley  Apple-Habaero Chicken Sausage with Lime-Ancho Mayonnaise and Chipotle-Jack Cheese The spicy pork was the best and the only one I'd eat again if I can ever make it through the line again. The texture of the Apple-Habaero Chicken Sausage wasn't that appealing and the Uber Garlic Pork Sausage was totally overwhelmed by the cheese. Actually, I could have done without the cheese on all three. It took too much away from the meat. I guess you have to try it, but you better not be hungry when you arrive because you'll be waiting outside for awhile.
