After we walked around for a while after they told us it would be 30 minute wait we ended up here and just sat at the bar. We sat right by the draft beer and the bartender went back and forth 3 different times to fill beer and finally we got the barbacks attention to help us. we asked for 2 bloody marys (which were not very good, must be the mis they use) and some menus. Well he forgot the menus and straws for the blood marys. so 5 minutes later or so we asked the bartender who finally acknowledged us and she gave us menus. The barback took our order as the bartender was doing her hwn thing. he put plates and everything in front of us, and finally 15 minutes later after we placed our order the bartender ask if we were ready to order. I have to say the pizza was REALLY good, but my empty drink sat there for at least 5 ten minutes before the barback asked me if i wanted something , i got a sample of a draft beer and when the bartender came by she asked me if she could get me something else to drink and i asked for the beer i tried, i know its partially my fault that i didn't specify what size i wanted but she have me the larger one when we had to-go boxes already and my friend wasn't having another drink. I think she was more concern with getting the check higher for a bigger tip, well when we tipped her a dollar less then 20% because we thought the service sucked so much (we were both servers) and the barback wasn't going to see much of that tip, she turned her head and made a smirk type look. I will be back though as to they have great beer and pizza, just going to sit at a table this time.
