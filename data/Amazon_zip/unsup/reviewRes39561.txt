DELICIOUS! Another one of my favorites. The BBQ is amazing - you cook all of the deliciously marinated meat over charcoal grills at your own private table. There are certainly cheaper Korean BBQ places in the area, but the food here is the best. I love bringing all of my friends here who've never had Korean BBQ before and they all leave loving the food and the experience.  My own never fail comfort food: Goon man doo (the dumpling apps), Jhap Chae, Kal bi or bulgogi. All great. The entrees come with what seems like millions of little sides - literally something for everyone. You may have to be fairly aggressive to get refills or more rice, but that's typical for a lot of Asian restaurants. Definitely make it a point to come here!
