I had the breafast burrito (I wasn't looking for the sweet sweet options, although my friends chocolate french toast was DELISH) - it was good. A little greasy (but it has chorizo and chorizo is greasy.. I got over it), but it was pretty innovative in the spinach tortilla and the chipotle sour cream. I heart their "hash browns" which were really just fried potato chunks. We also put our name on the list about 15 minutes before they "closed' and waited for us to finish (yes, we did feel like jerks) and didn't give attitude or anything. Definately worth the wait. Update: 5/18 - I had the strawberry banana hot cakes.. DELISH. I was craving pancakes, and couldn't think of any where that had good ones. The wait is still killer long (45 minutes for 2 people) and it seemed that people who showed up after us were given tables before( although they might have wandered off for a while too). But its good. Just reminds me that Wicker Park needs more breakfast places!
