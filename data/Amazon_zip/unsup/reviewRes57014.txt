my son inlaw took me out for dinner there all i have to say about the place is if you don't go there it is your mistake. you are missing out on a great dinning exp.iI would go there once a week if not more if i could. i wish they had one in northwest IN.the waiters and food is some of the best i had in a long time. the salad bar is to die for.i had a great time.So do not take my word for it go and have a great exp. for your selfand exp. the time of your life
