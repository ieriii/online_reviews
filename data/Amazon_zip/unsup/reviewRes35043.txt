Since I was traveling solo, I opted for a seat at the bar. It is way better than sitting at a large empty table, trust me. The bartender was attentive, nice and bilingual. Even better - I could eavesdrop on the conversation because I knew just enough spanish. This definitely added to my entertainment for the evening. The menu was your standard upscale standard seafood restaurant - oysters, fish, lobster and an extensive wine/cocktail list. Located across from a few hotels, I would guess this caters to the spendy business dinners. Luckily for my company, I would be ordering the clam chowder. It was actually really good! Very creamy and lots of clam and potato chunks. And not big chunks, but nice bite size ones that make you wonder if that was potato or clam. I love that kind. Next time I go back, I will definitely stop in! Since I can't speak for the dining area, I will say the bar is comfortable and a nice place to hang out solo, enjoying some dinner and playing Word Mole.
