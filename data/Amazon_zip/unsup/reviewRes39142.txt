Excellent Korean food, open late, and caters to non-Koreans? I thought it wasn't possible so I ventured to San Soo Gab San with my wife since we both had a craving for Korean food. Ah, a menu written in Korean AND English! The place got busy really quick. Those who arrived late had to sit in a different area where you remove your shoes and sit on the floor. I was really surprised at how busy and how diverse the customers were. We ordered the marinated beef short ribs (kalbi) and spicy pork belly (cheyook bokim). At first, the kalbi came out and looked like a small portion for $20 but it wasn't between two people. Then the cheyook bokim came out along with all of the side dishes (pan chan). The beef was sweet and salty and the pork was spicy - perfect combination. Although the pork belly wasn't as tender as I am used to in Chinese cuisine, it was still good. The number of pan chan filled our table ranging from kimchee, pickled vegetables, potato salad, and soup. Each had their own individual flavors and complimented the dishes. With all of the food that we got, the meal came out to only $30 plus tax. Amongst two people, that's a steal. With authentic Korean food done well at reasonable prices, it's no reason why San Soo Gab San is doing so well. I'll have to come here again but for a late night fourth meal to try a different experience. I really appreciate how welcoming they are to diverse populations, Chicago needs more Korean restaurants like this.
