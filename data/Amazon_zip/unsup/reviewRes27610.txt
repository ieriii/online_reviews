best mexican food in chicago. if i had to choose a last meal quesadillas raul would definitely be included. they have an excellent selection and I'm sure everything is delicious. the caldo (soup) reminds me of something grandma would make. enchiladas are solid. cash only. they have an atm on site though. BYOB!!!
