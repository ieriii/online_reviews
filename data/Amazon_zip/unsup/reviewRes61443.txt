Excellent restaurant. I'm Persian, so I'm a pretty tough critic. Trust me, this place is great. I happen to know one of the assistant chefs, and he has long raved about the freshness of the ingredients. If the meat is even one day old, they throw it out. If the tomatoes are not in spectacular shape, they throw them out. So I thought I would try out the place. He was right. Only the freshest and best ingredients. The chefs are Persian, the owner is Persian, and boy do they know how to make great Persian food. Very authentic, natural and delicious. By the way, one of the reviewers below gave a five star rating but could not understand why some of hte online menu items were not in the menu at the restaurant itself ... they're there! They're just listed on the BACK of the menu. So remember to take a look at the BACK of the menu for more delicious Persian food dishes. Enjoy!
