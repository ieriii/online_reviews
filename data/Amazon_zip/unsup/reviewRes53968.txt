Really, this place is solid. I highly recommend the Lechon (pulled pork, plaintain, onion), the empanadas, and the cafe con leche. The staff are great and you should listen to their recommendations. When are you guys going to take credit cards so that I can order take out for the family without running to the ATM?Update - Arturo the owner just sent a note that they are accepting cards.
