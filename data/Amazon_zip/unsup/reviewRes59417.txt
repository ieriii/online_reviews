The pizza was good, service HORRIBLE. Our hotel recommended this Giordano's location as "the authentic Chicago-style pizza experience" and we were looking forward to it. The obviously do a booming business, but their service was some of the worst I have ever experienced. After waiting 1.5 hours for a table, when we were finally seated (next to the host station, at the front door) our server ignored us for a full 20 minutes before even acknowledging our presence (though 2 other tables across the aisle from us, seated just after us, were greeted and attended to before we were). It took another 20 minutes to get water, which arrived about the same time as our pre-ordered pizza. The antipasto salad was mediocre.The waitstaff was clearly overwhelmed, and when I tried to speak to the manager about how poor the service was, he was unconcerned and blew me off. I would NOT recommend this place to anyone! Find another place that might actually appreciate your patronage (and serve good food).
