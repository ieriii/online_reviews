If you are a first timer to Hot Doug's, go on a Saturday so you can suckle on the teet of Duck Fat Fries. The BEST fries you will ever taste (and i love to get a side of cheese as well). I have been to Hot Doug's over a dozen times and have never ordered the same thing. I haven't even had anything on the regular menu because the specials are impossible to turn down. If you live in the city, put this on your list of "musts." Its surely a place you'll take all your out of town visitors. Do not be discouraged by the line. It moves pretty quickly and is absolutely worth it.
