I am a fan because it has good, vegan diner food, but it wasn't a good as I was expecting. The one food I'll rave about is the Titanic Bit Burger-yuuuuuum! I went there twice while I was in Chicago. Since I had such a yummy burger the first time, I went a second time hoping it would be as good. I was disappointed, not by a lot, but still disappointed. The pesto chicken sandwich was not as tasty as I had hoped. Not sure what kind of vegan cheese they used on there, but it wasn't good (and I like vegan cheese). The mac and cheese was OK; it tasted like the version of vegan Kraft macaroni 'n' cheese. Also, I had the chocolate chip cookie dough shake (vegan). It was good, but it didn't exactly taste like chocolate chip cookie dough, it tasted like chocolate chip. Where are the cookie dough chunks? Lastly, I wish they would extend their breakfast hours to all day. That's what I expect from a diner anyway. Why not the breakfast foods all day?? The service was great though. No complaints there.
