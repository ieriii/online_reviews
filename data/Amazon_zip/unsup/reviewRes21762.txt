Hands down best Mexican in the city. This is my spot if I need a good margarita or 3...if you are worried about prices then get here on a Tuesday or a Thursday-HALF PRICE PITCHERS of MARG! Food is awsome, margaritas are flowing, and the service is right on. When I feel like Mexican I don't go anywhere else but here.
