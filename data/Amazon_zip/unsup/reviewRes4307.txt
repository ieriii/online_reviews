Nothing new to add to the Yelpers. I was here for Mortified (http://www.getmortified.) and it is SUCH a cool place. So much history, such a cool vibe, and some very nice eye candy, gotta say. Yes it sways a bit towards the expensive side as far as standard drinks go, but I'm willing to indulge a little just for the surroundings. I mistakenly ordered a Guiness instead of something classy like a V&T, and subsequently witnessed the bartender make the WORST POUR EVER -- straight in, to the the top, half foam and coming out over the sides. Doesn't matter ... this place oozes cool.
