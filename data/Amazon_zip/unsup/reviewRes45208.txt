Had another lovely dinner at Anteprima last night. The orrechiette with lamb sausage was particularly good. I'm writing the review, though, to specifically mention our server, Chris. We sat on the back patio and we were a table of five. Chris was really informative about the wine and menu, didn't go crazy up-selling anything, and didn't seem to be rushing us at all. We sat there for a long time, on a busy night, on the VERY DESIRABLE patio. He was just really good to us. I really like Anteprima. Can't wait to go back for a romantic dinner with just my husband!
