HIGHLY recommend!!I've been going here a lot lately and love it, for many reasons.First, the menu is extensive and has something for everyone. I am a vegan and appreciate that there are options for me. Veggie burger, black bean burger, edamame salad, vegan soup, etc.  And my carnivore friends like the burgers, chicken, salmon, etc. So many options!!! And good wine selection! Wonderful menu!!Second, the service and the staff are top notch, starting with the managers. A group of us went to Wilde on the show day recently. While the city was nearly completely shut down, Wilde was open and so enjoyable!! It was packed and they were way under staffed. But Chad, who is the manager, stepped in to be our server that day. He was so friendly, so fun, and offered fantastic service, despite the chaos and his "dual jobs" that day. There were a couple minor mistakes with our order due to all the chaos, and Chad was fantastic in how he dealt with it -- with humor and respect.All the staff is consistently wonderful. So friendly, hard working, etc.Third, the music selection. On a typical day/night, the variety of music is amazing! I will say the music on the Saturday before St Pattys day was ridiculously loud and probably should have been turned down a notch, but we certainly enjoyed the selection and dancing regardless. :)My friends and I now go to Wilde often b/c f the food, atmosphere, the staff and location and always feel welcome as if it were a tiny, friendly, quaint, neighborhood bar....even if its completely packed and nuts in there as it was on Sat before St Pattys day. I do think the kindness and great work by the wait staff should be a nod to the management, Chad and the others.
