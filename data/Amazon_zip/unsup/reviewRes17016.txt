"Meh" is a good way to describe this place. Usually I'm into this kind of thing, but...I didn't really think they pulled it off. Overly pretentious atmosphere with a snooty staff to match. The drinks are unusual, but as others have mentioned, they're overpriced--and honestly, this place just tries a little too hard. You'd be a lot better off with a local blues club.
