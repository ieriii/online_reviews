First Korean BBQ restaurant I have ever tried and it was so good! Went with a bunch of friends so that made it even more enjoyable. Prices was decent, it was $20 per person and there was so much meat and appetizers, loved the Kim chi. Words of wisdom, dress comfortable and if you are sitting next to the fire, its gonna get real warm. Also if you're the type that doesn't like to walk bare foot, wear socks because you have to take off your shoes. You would also need to have background knowledge on what you like to eat at a Korean BBQ ex. kalbi. Luckily I had a Korean friend that came along. My only complaint however is the waitress doesn't come around to refill drinks and boy you get thirsty after eating that much and the wait can be long sometime.
