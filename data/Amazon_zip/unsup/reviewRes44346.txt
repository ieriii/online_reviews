The manager of the restaurant called the police on my party because I told him an $8 per bottle corkage fee was "fucking bullshit". Sushi was average. Customer service, an epic fail from the 45 minute wait to get a 4 top seated in an empty restaurant to the total lack of respect shown by every staff member. Skip this place not due to the chefs but do to the epic faiilure of management.
