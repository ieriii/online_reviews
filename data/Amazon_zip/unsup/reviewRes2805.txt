The evening started amazingly. We ordered the tasting menu and after some various drinks, we were presented with a beautiful amuse. I picked up the spoon of pea soup, and tried to convince myself it was good. I failed, because it wasn't good, and my date noted the same problem. Thankfully, this was the only bad moment at all during our evening. The courses were varied and interesting. The only complaint I could've possibly registered was that by the end of the evening I felt a bit like a foie gras goose. I was very happy, but those little courses add up fast. It was a fun and memorable meal, well worth making a quick jaunt to Chicago to enjoy it. I'd happily go back.
