Amazing staff and food. There really isn't much more you can ask out of a place. Got us seated within 30 minutes at 8pm on a Friday night. The manager really seems to know what he is doing. Got the sweet potato and black bean quesadilla and mac and cheese between me and a friend. Perfect portions and amazing food! I'm not even vegetarian or vegan, but loved every bite! Great first experience, will definitely be back many times!
