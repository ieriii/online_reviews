Vegetarians steer clear! This place is not your cup of tea (although they do have a salad bar, but I don't think you want to spend $25 for lunch or $50 for dinner on a salad -- pricing is set per person - all the meat can eat!). Mmmmm, churrascaria. Thank you to my boyfriend for introducing me to this one (and many other fantastic places in the city), but this one is a sure-fire winner. We usually go for lunch (duh, its cheaper) and its fantastic. They have so many different types of meat (15 I believe) and you choose what you want, how much you want and how you like it cooked (medium well, well, etc). How it works: They give each patron a circular card with green on one side (gimme more meat baby!) and red on the other (whoa there I'm eating or I'm so full I'm going to vomit). Along with the meat, you are served sides of fried bananas, polenta-like mashed potatoes and these awesome cheesy rolls. With a glass of wine (or three) and a huge dessert selection (my favorite is the papaya dessert - papaya has natural enzymes that help digest meat - an excellent idea after binging on all the Churrasco here!) you leave stuffed and happy! Oh and the "gauncho chefs" (who bring around the various meats) are fun too look at too! ;) And I love that they pull out the ladies chairs, so we can sit down! Such gentlemen!
