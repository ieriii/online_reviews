We had a booking for 10pm, which was the only slot we could get on short notice, but had to wait a little while for tables to clear. The piano bar was going off at this point, and we waited in that area for a while, but the singing was a bit over the top if you weren't already half drunk. We weren't, and sniggered happily at the raucous crowd.Portion sizes were generally huge, and our waitress proactively split the orders for us, which was both helpful and - as it turned out - necessary.We had:Shrimp cocktail - not at all what I was expecting - large shelled prawns in a tomato and chilli jam, presented with ?dry ice? forming a mist over the top. Cold, tasty, good prawns.Lobster bisque which was generously portioned, with tasty lobster and a slightly sweet (not overwhelmingly so) bisque.Iceberg wedge was too big even in split form, but was really fresh and tasty with its blue cheese sauce, real bacon, and tomato pieces.Then, the steaks - we chose a petite filet each. The steaks melted in our mouths. Special mention of the hot-hot-hot plates, which were literally finger-burningly hot (as we were warned). I added some mustard and horseradish to mine and was very happy.After that, we had been told to try the warm butter cake, so we did and it was sensational. Could. Not. Stop.The bill was less than we were expecting based on the quality and quantity of food (ballpark of 170 for all that). So we were very happy, and impressed. Very glad we went!
