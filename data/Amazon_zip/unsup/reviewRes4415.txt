This place is very cool. An old time jazz bar, supposedly Al Capone hung out here. They even have a "hidden room" underneath the bar where he would hide out from the cops. Now they store booze down there. The musicians they had here were very good. Very relaxing. The drinks we ordered were super small though. Not sure what that's about. Also, you are not allowed to talk during the music. $4 cover to get in.
