The pizza at Piece is extremely generic. Kind of seems like something I could make with grocery store pizza dough, a jar of store bought marinara, and a bag of shredded motz. Not sure what people's pizza standards are, but this is nothing special.If you like thin crust, I would recommend Lou Malnati's thin crust. If you like beer, I would recommend the map room or Revolution brewery in Logan Sq.I am baffled by all the stellar reviews for such mediocre pizza.
