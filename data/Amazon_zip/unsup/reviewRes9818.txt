Sprout is the perfect restaurant to unwind from the rush of the city. Although Sprout is a hip new organic restaurant (dim lighting, great modern music, cool photography, and high-end organic cuisine), there was no pretension or attitude; just a warm welcome and a truly enjoyable dining experience. The menu is very creative, but a bit under-stated, and after chatting with the charismatic waiter, I learned a lot more about the seasonality and local/organic production of the food. I really like that this place is doing the right thing, but not bragging about being the most sustainable restaurant around. They are a modest example of socially and environmentally responsible dining. If you want to know more, they openly invite "green" conversation. However, if you don't really need to know that your lettuce came from a local farmer, you can simply enjoy a great meal (and AWESOME drinks) in this fantastic restaurant.
