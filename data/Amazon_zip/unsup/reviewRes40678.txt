Do not forget to reservate! Trust me on this one... you'll want to plan ahead. We got to Tank Noodle on a Friday night about 15 minutes prior to our reservation time, but they already had our table waiting for us. The line for walk-ins was out the door for the entire time we were there (and it was cold out)! This should tell you, it's worth it. The decor is nothing to write home about, but you're not here to look around. You're here to stare at your food once it arrives, and slurp the goodness of the Pho or whatever sits in front of you. We started with the vegetarian and shrimp spring rolls. The consensus at the table, skip the shrimp, since the vegetarian is fresh and rolled tight. After all, who likes floppy spring rolls that fall apart upon picking them up? Not this girl... Everyone got a different meal, my husband got the caramel shrimp which he said he would not order again. Luckily for him, I got the egg-noodle and mixed vegetable soup which was HUGE, and I couldn't finish on my own. The egg noodles were perfect, and they give you a lot. The vegetables were fresh, and there was a huge variety in the soup. Others at the table raved about their Pho, it was the perfect meal for a cold night. Was it a life changing experience? No. But I certainly will be back for some great Vietnamese soon. The best part? The meal for 4 was $57. Yes!!!! Oh, and BYOB.
