I used to work in streeterville when there was virtually nothing there, except for a Starbuck's and McD's....When Fox & Obel opened up it changed my world. They have the best selection of cheeses, wines, meats, and seafood. The prepared foods are always great if you don't feel like cooking your own meal. They have really good cupcakes (my fav is the red velvet!) and fresh bread. You can't do your entire shopping there, but we usually go when we know we are just getting stuff for one meal or occasion. The people there are very nice too. Go in the back of the store and have a soup and salad. I find it the best on a really cold day--sitting in the window..... Also, if you like Peter Luger Steak Sauce....you can get it there. We always have a bottle on hand. My boyfriend lived in NYC for a lot of years and I guess Peter Luger Steak House is AMAZING....I have never been tho...but the steak sauce is quite tasty.  Happy Shopping!
