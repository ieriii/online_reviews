Having just moved to Chicago I have depended on yelp to generally guide my choices for where to eat. Living in the center of the loop, I am at great opportunity to hope a train any direction to try new places.  Mayan Palace was great, a few notches higher than you average Tex-Mex 'authentic' stuff. Service was quick and their margaritas are killer. I don't mind droppin a faire buck for good food, but this place definitely was well priced IMHO.
