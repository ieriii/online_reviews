The Tom Yum Kai (chicken) soup was delicious and exactly what I needed to make me feel better when I had the flu. It had plenty of chicken, fresh straw mushrooms, and a good amount of lime. I ordered it medium spicy and they got it spot on. I got carryout, so I can't comment on the inside yet, but I will definitely be back to try it out! Minus one star because the guy on the phone who took my order was an impatient dick.
