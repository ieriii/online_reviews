We first walked in and I'm positive 3 staffers walked by without saying hello, even the girl at the register.... HELLO. That's the first thing you do when customers walked in. But oh well. We were hungry and this seemed like a good place to eat before heading to the Shedd or Field museum. On the plus side, our waitress was much more friendly. Yolk has a ton of different options for a very moderate price. Plates were beautifully assembled when they came out. However, nothing too spectacular about the food here. Ordered the French toast combo, which is comparable to many other breakfast places, but where was my powdered sugar?! Tsk tsk Yolk. Fresh squeezed orange juice was awesome. And tried a bit of the Works omelette and that was really good. Will definitely have to try something else the next time I'm here.
