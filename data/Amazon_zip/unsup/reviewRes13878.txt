This unassuming little spot shines like a diamond in the rough. In a residential area of Roscoe Village, the cafe offers outstanding service and a flavorful taste of Cuba. The physical space is nothing extraordinary - you order your food at the counter and eat at the few stools inside or on the patio (weather permitting). They were more than willing to accommodate our BYOBottle of wine with no corkage fee.  For such a small kitchen, the menu offers several choices of authentic apps, sandwiches, entrees, pastries and smoothies. We tried the Media Noche - a Cubano on sweet bread served with crispy plantain chips, as well as the Ropa Vieja - a very generous portion of shredded beef which was slow cooked and well seasoned. All dinners come with rice and beans as well as plantains, which left enough for a little midnight snack. Another huge bonus - food comes out fast! We barely had time to open our bottle of wine before our meal was served. Great spot - will be back soon!
