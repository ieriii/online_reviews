Is there anything better than eating outside in the summer? No, there isn't particularly if it is at Piccolo Sogno. I had heard and read about this patio and thought nah, it can't be all that good. Oh my, it is even better! It was just a vision of tranquility with gentle breezes and surprisingly moderate temperatures adding to the complete enjoyment. My daughter and I first split a peach salad while we pondered what else to taste. The peach salad had this amazing arugula, not as bitter as I expected, with peach slices, goat cheese and a perfect dressing. We then split small plates of a delicious burrata with prosciutto and a slightly disappointing squash blossom. It could have been anything inside the pastry, that dish needs to use the glory of those blossoms in a more subtle way.  As our final split, we had the black spaghetti. It was just out of this world delicious, the best pasta I have ever had anywhere. I have to go back there and eat that dish again. All of the great food was enhanced by sublime service. I would have been happy with graham crackers and milk in such a beautiful space but I got a sublime meal as well.  Grazie, Piccolo Sogno, what a wonderful summer memory.
