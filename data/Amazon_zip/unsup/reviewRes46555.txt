Still full from my meal last night... after reading reviews, I must say that I was expecting the salad bar to be even Bigger than it was, but then I think about all the toppings I put onto my plate of lettuce, and realize that it was in fact, large. I was putting things in my salad that don't even fit together, I got a little excited... edamame, garbanzo, sprouts, pineapple, wasabi peas, mushrooms, cous cous, black bean and corn salsa, croutons, sunflower seeds, just a lot of everything. Salad bar also comes with soup. Unfortunately I went back for seconds for both... and then my burger came. Got the green chiliburger... called green because of the tomatillo sauce, and it's a wonderful burger! The "fries" are like thick potato chips, good. Loved the experience, the pictures on the wall, and not to mention I think they stole my iPod because we listen to the same playlists... embarrassing??? Definitely going back, the Nachos are calling my name. Oh yeah, don't count on finding parking. Valet is 8 bucks.
