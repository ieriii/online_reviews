Let me take you back in time......drive in, to a slot, push a button, and yell your order into the crackling speaker. Then sit back, and watch the parade as cars come and go (if you're lucky, it's a vintage car night!), carhops pass by with other people's orders until yours finally arrives. Make sure your window is 3/4 rolled down, so the tray of food (complete with real salt shakers and ketchup bottles) can rest beside you. Then open the cardboard box where your hot dog is resting in its poppy seed bun, on top of some of the best french fries you've had since childhood. Make sure you order the pickle on the side as well. And a malted or root beer float couldn't hurt! Wave to the giant male and female hot dogs (dressed in their finest and with twinkling eyes) on the roof as you go!
