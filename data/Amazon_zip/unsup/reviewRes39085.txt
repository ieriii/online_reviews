I have been told about the horrible service here but I decided to go because I wanted my girlfriend to experience the Korean BBQ. Anyway the service was surprisingly good because there was no customers and we really enjoyed the food. BUT when it was time to pay the bill the price was abnormally high. But thinking this place was a professional business I put my card down. Having my girlfriend put the tip usually, she was dissatisfied about the ridiculous tax and tip, so she left a little. But the lady came back and demanded more tip, out of confusion, we just payed and later calculated the tip. We got ripped off. I am an Korean and I have never experienced this kind of ?!$& ever! At least tell us what is going on before doubling the price. And she called us names as she demanded. I payed over 100 for how much? For the future customers I hope you reconsider and try a new place.
