I am downgrading my rating of Icosium Kafe for this reason: I had a late dinner there last night, and accidentally left a bottle of beer in the booth where we sat. This was a Belgian ale that was on the pricey side which I'd purchased for later. Unfortunately I didn't realize it was missing until after they had closed. I called this morning, and surprise, no one had seen my purchase. Apparently, I left a bigger tip than the already generous tip I'd already left. I won't be back.
