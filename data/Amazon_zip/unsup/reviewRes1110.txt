There's few places in the world that make me as happy as Hot Doug's. Here's a guy who truly seems to be doing what he loves, and he's doing it so well that he seems to be really making it into a lifestyle business. More power to him. Classic dogs are amongst the best in the city, and I live for the foie dog, which is about the most luscious thing I can imagine. Don't even get me started on the duck fat fries.  If only I could find a way around lining up...
