Went to this pizzeria a while ago and they completely messed up our order, giving us a pizza that was nothing like the one we ordered for ourselves. Since they message up, they offered the pizza to us for free, and who would not take them up on their offer. The atmosphere is like a loud pub, and the people are there usually for one of the many sport games that are playing. Good place to go to enjoy a game, but not some much if you are looking to enjoy some good company.
