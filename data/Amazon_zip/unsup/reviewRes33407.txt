For quick, cheep eats I love going to Sultan's Market. It is the best falafel I have ever had. The lentil soup is delicious and my sister tells me it is a great hangover cure, though I haven't tried that one yet! If you look under the counter you will notice a slew of unique grocery items. Pick up some rose water an add a dash to your lemonade at home. So good!
