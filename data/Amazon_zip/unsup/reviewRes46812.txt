Great cocktails, some food is good, some bleh. My rating is based on an experience I had there a couple weeks ago. Short story is... I used my debit card to pay for an almost $200 bill, and my card got swiped twice. Over the course of several days, I had multiple conversations with multiple restaurant managers and people from my bank to figure out what happened. I wanted to make sure I wasn't actually getting charged twice, and I was not happy that an extra $200 was being held from my available balance. One manager in particular gave me some horrible excuses, such as, "this happens every now and then," and "our new credit card processing company does this with a couple of banks to make sure people actually have the money in their account." (Frankly, if a credit card company was double authorizing people this regularly, it would be out of business.) This manager even had the nerve to tell me, "You should probably use a credit card instead of a debit card in the future to avoid this from happening." A- double-swiping my credit card is no different than double-swiping my debit card. B- WHO ARE YOU to tell me how to pay when I come to your restaurant? Needless to say, no one at the restaurant was able to do much for me (they say they called the credit card company and that there was no second transaction). My bank did take care of me, but it literally took several hours of my time to keep making phone calls back and forth, re-explaining the whole story each time. And, I also sent an email to the owner after it was all finished, and 10 days later, I still have received no response from him.
