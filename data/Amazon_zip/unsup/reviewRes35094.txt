My BF took me here for my bday dinner last weekend - it was delicious! Loved the oysters and the crab legs. The steak was a little over-cooked, but I'm super picky about my steak and cooking it to the exact right temperature. The service was wonderful though and we were tucked away in a cute corner booth, couldn't have had a better time. Thanks!
