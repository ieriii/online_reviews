I will not repeat what has been said over and over yes the duck is an almost religious experience, no the service is not very personal or attentive, and yes they did move around the corner. I will say however the move was great, I love the new space its bright, sleek, and I love the exposed brick. Though I was always a fan of the specials on the paper plates adorning the walls of the former location...I didn't miss them. Glad to know they are doing so well and the food was not compromised in the upsize. Oh and they are still BYOB so score!
