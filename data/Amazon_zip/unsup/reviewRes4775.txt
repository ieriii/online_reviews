I'm not an offal guy. Organ meat and cheap cuts of meat don't really do it for me all that often. So maybe this isn't my type of place and should have known that going in. That being said, this place has all the hype in the world and neither the food and the service lived up to expectations. Some things that were a disappointment. Whipped feta w/ cucumbers - nothing whipped about this. Standard feta with diced cucumbers. Silcian Iris - standard fried fair food. Braised baby artichokes antipasta - much like any supermarket cold case antipasta. THE SERVICE was terrible. One would think that in a tapas style restaurant the wait staff would stop by frequently. Not the case. 20-30 minutes between visits. Overall, a disappointment. I doubt we will be back.
