Wow, probably the best pan pizza I've ever had bar none. From crust to the toppings, especially the sausage, it was great. There isn't much else I can add, the bar has a nice beer selection? I loved the pie, they had great sausage and it was hot when we got it. The waitress was solid, the prices acceptable and the restaurant good looking enough.
