I don't understand why Mercat has such great reviews. I saw it Mercat on Check Please! so when my husband and I went to Millennium Park, we decided to check it out. We arrived without reservations. Opps. but not a prob. We sat outside and it was a gorgeous evening and we had Dancing At the Park across the street. Great setting. While waiting at the hostess stand this very nice woman, obviously a tourist, recommend the dates. She was so sweet and excited to be there. It was cute.The lounge area was filled with tourists, doesn't really bother me, just throwing it in here 'cause I know some people prefer to stay away from touristy areas, and this was. The service was excellent! The hostess, the servers, everyone was great. However, the food wasn't. We ordered: 1. Gambas con garbanzo, which is a flat bread with shrimp, chorizo and garbanzo bean puree. Reminded us of a pepperoni pizza with shrimp. My husband said it was like a fancy Pepperidge Farm pizza. 2. Paella Negra. Very salty 3. Peolotas de Calabaza y Cordero, butternut quash dumplings, were ok. Not very exciting. 4.Butifarra Con Judias; house made pork and apple sausage. Kind of sweet, I would prefer to use the sausage for breakfast or brunch with some pancakes, and without the truffled white beans. The best item of the night was compliments of the chef, the Bacon-wrapped dates. I would have been happy just eating this alone. We also had the Ajo y Tomate Flatbread. It's like a bruschetta, only I prefer brushetta when it's warm and crispy. Desserts were good. Had the Croquettes, my husband loved it. Chocolate balls with banana and marshmallow, crisp on the outside. Not bad. The ambiance it great, service wonderful, food-just eat the dates.
