Brunch to die for. If you arrive on Sunday after 9:00AM, you should expect to wait to be seated, but it is one of those places where the wait is completely justified. This is one of the very best brunch places in the city. Living in the area, I am very familiar with places in the vicinity and this outshines them all in breakfast selections. You will find the selections varied, high quality, and relatively moderately priced for what you get. This is a destination location for Sunday brunch. I just returned from having their classic eggs Benedict and I found it completely satisfying. My dining partner had the caramel pancakes and they were excellent as well. In past visits, I have tried out their omelets, crepes, french toast and conventional eggs. Never have I been disappointed. Their portions tend to be large and, for the ungry among us, satisfying. For the more healthy minded, they have some outstanding healthy selections, too. If you are living here, visiting here, or just passing through looking for a good breakfast or lunch, you cannot go wrong. I have also brought business associates here during the week for lunch and they loved it. The salad selection is among the best. I'm hooked and will keep coming back again and again. (This is truly one of those places I am almost reluctant to post about since it will only make the crowds bigger.)
