I'm so sad to give it such poor rating since my husband proposed to me here...however when my family was here it visit me for a week I had an awful experience with Sheraton. As soon as I checked my family in, i realize that they did not fully clean the room. There was wet, used coffee packs and some items were missing in the room in which they actually charged us. Also the service downstairs to get a taxi was pretty awful. There were two families in front of us and no hotel help at all to get taxis. It's very expensive and the rooms are not great. The only nice part is the lobby. We made a complaint about the experience and they were nice about, but I would not come back again.
