AWESOME! Went here for a late lunch/early dinner and it was great. It's a wine bar concept, but they have lots of tables. The food is in small plate format...almost like Italian tapas. Great decor, nice casual atmosphere. Cheese/salami....great selection Polenta with daily ragu...I too wanted to lick the board clean Grilled squash with farro, goat cheese, & watercress...great balance Wine...retail price with small corkage fee, so you can try much higher end wines than in a full dining place Cacio e pepe spaghetti....simple and put together perfectly Espresso....perfect Service....perfect I will DEFINITELY go back!
