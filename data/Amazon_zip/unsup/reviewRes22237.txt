The three stars only refers to the GUACAMOLE. I've never ordered it before because it's 6.50 for a small, which was always kinda pricey for me. I decided to splurge on my vacation, and seriously, this is the blandest guac I've ever had. If you want delicious guac, stick to Tony's. It's delicious and probably a few cents cheaper. (The rest of the food is great, though. I love all the veges and the variety that comes with the Shrimp and Vege dinner. Still pricey though!)
