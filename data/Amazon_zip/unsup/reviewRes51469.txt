My favorite Mexican food on the north-side. Huge portions, cheap food, strong margaritas. But what happened within the past few weeks? They remodeled, and now business is booming. Good for them, but I miss having the place all to myself. Definitely order one of the combos. I've eaten nearly everything on the menu (making it a personal goal in the Spring of 2009) and the #3 is still my favorite.
