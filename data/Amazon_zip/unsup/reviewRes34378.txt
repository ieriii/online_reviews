Going out for Breakfast is something I do every weekend. I try new places all the time, and I have yet to find a place better than Yolk. My daughter is a HUGE fan of their potatoes, and I haven't had a dish, I didn't like. There's often a wait, but I don't mind because the atmosphere is GREAT, and food is well worth the wait!
