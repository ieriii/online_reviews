The three-year-old I babysit is OBSESSED with this place. Everyday when her dad picks her up she says "Daddy, do you have money to take me to Superdawg? Pleeeaaase!?!" So my husband and I decided we'd check it out for our anniversary (um, we're that kind of couple I guess.) He called ahead and asked if they had veggie dogs, they don't.. but they kindly offered us a "dressed bun" which I guess it all the fixings with no hot dog. Ew. We went anyway because we spent 8 hours getting tattooed and just wanted to eat in the car and listen to Iron Maiden. We got grilled cheese, which is cheese melted on a burger bun, fries, onion chips and a shake. The cheese bun was kind of gross, but the fries and onion chips were tasty. The shake was pretty good, but I was sick by the time I got to it. I was a little surprised at the prices, since it is just a hot dog place but it was cool to go to once and maybe if they get veggie dogs we'll take our son when he's a little older.
