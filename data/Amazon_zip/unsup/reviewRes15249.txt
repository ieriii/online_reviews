I like it here, but I can't say that it has lived up to all of it's hype. It's very dim and kind of an unwelcoming atmosphere...even once you're inside. The drinks are good, but nowadays you don't have to wait in a long line and sit in a dim corner to get these sorts of craft cocktails. I'd come back, I just don't think I'd wait around to make it in.
