I'm giving this place 2stars based mostly on the experience I had trying to order a custom made cake for a 50th bday party I was planning. After coming across Alliance on line, I called to make an appointment for a tasting for a custom made cake. I was informed in a snooty tone that they only did cake tastings for WEDDINGS, not birthdays (though the price of the cake would have been equal to a wedding cake if not higher) but I was free to come in and buy a cupcake to try it out. Perhaps it is irrational for me to believe that money is GREEN no matter wait type of cake you are buying and the fact that just because my cake was not for a NUPTIAL I would be denied the full range of customer service was laughable. I went to the bakery to simply explain my reasoning to the manager, but the cashier at the counter wouldnt even allow me to talk to the manager. Again treating me as if asking for a tasting for a $500 or more priced cake made me "high maintainence" simply because it was not for a wedding. I was tempted to say "well Im not ordering a birthday cake any more, Im ordering a groom's cake- can I get my tasting now??" but I did not, as I choose to give my money to another establishment who would provide me with the type of service I felt $500 or more dollars deserved.
