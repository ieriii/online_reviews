I received an email about a buffet dinner Chef Anthony was having and I RSVP'ed almost immediately but not fast enough because reservations were filled within the first 3 minutes! But that's understandable. But then 2 days before the dinner the chef himself called me and invited me to his full booked dinner, just a little later. Of course I accepted! The buffet dinner was fabulous and the food was great. I've been to Sapori's a few other times and it never disappoints. Their food is really tasty and served in large portions, always plenty for leftovers. The tiramisu dessert we had at the dinner was beyond belief, so good! The servers are really friendly, they have a nice wine list, and the interior always sets the mood I'll be sure to be back!
