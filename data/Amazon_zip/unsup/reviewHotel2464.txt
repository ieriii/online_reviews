Came to Chicago on March 13, day of the Green River Day Parade, for St. Patrick's Day. The hotel is festive, everyone in green and convincing everyone that walks in to do the same. The had a little booth, right in front of their Irish Bar/ Restaurant - Kitty O'Sheas-, with all things St. Patrick's (tiaras, shirts, necklaces, and more). Their energy is contagious so, of course, I go in and buy something for everyone in my party. Before we join the madness at Kitty O'Sheas, I go check-in. Lady at the counter was really nice. Check-In process took less than 5 minutes. They even had arranged all clocks at the rooms to change automatically for day light savings. Room is big, spacious, clean... so is the bathroom. Mini bar (you can ask for the key when checking-in), TV, desk, big enough closet, and more features to make your stay comfortable. Oh, but do bring your own soap, the one they have is brutal on your nails and skin.  Back downstairs, St. Patrick's celebration has intensified. Kitty O'Sheas' is packed, with a line of people waiting outside, without and estimated seating time. Would have loved to stay and celebrate but after waking up at 6:30am, traveling without anything to eat, I needed lunch fast. So we leave, with our green accessories to another restaurant, promising ourselves we would have our green beer when we got back. At night the hotel has security, who checks your room key before allowing you into the elevators. They have a piano at the entrance, a lounge/ bar. Apparently this hotel is very popular for conventions, conferences, etc. Saw people from 3 different ones in one weekend. This might be a problem if your traveling to get away and rest. I'm sure it might be a bit quieter on non-holiday weekends but gotta love a hotel with that spirit, good service and, on top of that, close to just about everything on Michigan Ave.
