So excited to have found a great Korean BBQ place within walking distance, more or less, from my apt. I came with two friends on a Sunday for lunch, and it was not at all crowded like I expected. The 20+ small dishes they give are awesome. I don't like them all, but it's nice to have such a variety to try. And they'll give you more if you ask. Just remember - if you really like something, especially if you don't know exactly what it is, be sure to save a little of it so you can show your waitress what you want. We made the mistake of eating all the fish cakes thinking they were tofu, asking for more tofu, and not getting the dish we wanted back. We ordered beef short ribs and bulkoki to grill ourselves at the table. The orders came with tofu soup, rice and lettuce. Surprisingly, the short rib meat had already been scraped off the bone. Both were good, though. My only comment would be that I'd prefer a cross-hatched grill, rather than one with parallel bars only. Over the high heat of the charcoal fire, the grill got distorted, and pieces of meat were falling through. Plus, after a while meat started sticking or getting burned to the grill. It needs to be cleaned/replaced more often than it was. We also got fried mackerel which was allright. I'm not a huge fish fan, and I would probably order more BBQ meat instead next time.
