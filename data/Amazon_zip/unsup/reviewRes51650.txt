Garcia's is our new go-to Mexican spot in the neighborhood. Mind you, we haven't tried them all yet, but Garcia's is much better than another place down the street closer to Damen. We ordered take-out, but after reading some of the other reviews I want to head back to dine in and try the margaritas. The steak in the burrito was actually steak! Imagine that actual carne asada instead of the usual mystery meat. The guac was pretty darn good. I read another yelper say it wasn't made fresh, but ours certainly was. I was a little surprised when we walked in. The place definitely feels more like a bar than a Mexican restaurant, but I think I like it. See ya later Garcia's!
