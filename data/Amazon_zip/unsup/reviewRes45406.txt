In my time visiting Chicago, this place was my absolute favorite restaurant/bar. The decor, ambience, and service (not too horrible to look at and genuinely friendly) was great -- not to mention the fabulous food. I went with two friends, and each of us loved our dishes. I had the BLT with a side of fresh strawberries and it was delicious. I sampled my friend's Pecan Belgian Waffles and they were melt-in-your-mouth. Sitting fireside in the cozy library during freezing temperatures was just what we needed at the time. I loved the details in the decor, such as the domed stained glass ceiling above the library and the gorgeous wooden bar that was reminiscent of a very 1930's feel. The only disappointment we had was that the infamous macaroni and cheese wasn't available during brunch hours. I guess we'll just have to go back for that next time we're in Chicago.
