I like Garcia's enough but there is something here that put me off a little. I like the dumpy vibe of the place and have been coming here for years, you know, before Lincoln Square was gentrified and it was a rather seedy little destination. I love that its cheap. I mean crazy cheap. I think its funny that the extras are like fifty cents upcharge. I mean really, fifty cents. I also like that they modify everything for my picky little self but what I don't like is the texture of their guacamole. It frightens me. I would swear there is lard in it as a filler but can't be certain and that is a horrible rumor to spread. But honestly, I highly doubt they would read this review of even care because they will always have the loyalty of the drunks regardless of my slanderous accusation. Service is decent and mariachi guys say sexually inappropriate things in Spanish that make me laugh
