Came here on a Saturday and I wasn't prepared to see a DJ in the very back of the bar while the place wasn't so crowded. I do have to say that this is a very aesthetically pleasing bar. Obviously an homage to Oscar Wilde, this place feels very scholarly with wall to wall books surrounding a fireplace, glass domes over head and wood paneling. After sitting there for an hour or so you start thinking that maybe you earned an honorary degree from UC after all. Its a shame that the place wasn't as crowded because that always makes for excellent people watching. But what this place lacks in people, its make it up in good atmosphere for getting together with friends. Just make sure to pick up table not so close to the DJ.
