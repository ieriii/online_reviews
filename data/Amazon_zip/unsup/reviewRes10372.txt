The patio is awesome, the staff was great and very attentive, and the cocktails were delightful. I found the food to be very well cooked, simple, and not overpriced, but on the bland side. The seafood antipasti was fresh and quite tasty, but the zucchini blossoms were boring. The pasta was a little disappointing, mostly because the sauces were unremarkable. The tuna entree was light and lemony but also lacked major flavor. Dessert was wonderful, the chocolate cake with hazelnut gelato knocked my socks off. A nice frothy cappuccino was a great way to end the night. Overall, this place is fantastic for a romantic special occasion. Its really the perfect spot for an upscale dinner on a nice summer evening. But if you are craving the best Italian food in the city, particularly the best pasta dish, you may be a little disappointed.
