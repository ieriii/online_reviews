As close to a religious experience as I can get. And I'm not religious. My foodie husband and I have been there twice, both times were fabulous, the food outstanding, and service attentive. On our first trip, we went not really knowing what to expect and were told we'd have a 2-hour wait. We didn't have anything else to do, so what the hell? Two margaritas apiece later, we were seated and the food was awesome. Two margaritas later, who cares?! The second time, we got there right at opening, had to wait in a line to get in, and had a 45-minute wait for a table for which we were given a beeper. No big deal. The bottom line: If you want fabulous food and great service--(and it IS about both, no?), chill the f.u.c.k out and wait for it. Good things come to those who wait, and these are VERY very good things. Both experiences were WELL worth the wait.
