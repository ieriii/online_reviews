Craving a burger and off to The Bad Apple we went. We went for an earlish dinner during the week. The place wasn't at capacity and there were alot of families in the back dining room. No bar tables open, so we opted to sit a the bar. The service is a little off putting. There was alot of gossiping and talking about customers behind the bar within our earshot. I'm not so naive to think that doesn't happen (I was a server, afterall), but it's a little rude to do it in front of customers seated at the bar. Service wasn't exactly attentive or engaging. Listen, I don't need a server to sit with me and be my best friend, but be friendly for goodness' sake! At least make eye contact when you are forced to speak to me. On to the food. The burgers were really good. Great beef, very flavorful and cooked to a perfect medium rare! Couple of comments are that I would prefer a thinner, wider patty. These are a little hockey puckish for my liking. The buns are just plain old, wimpy white buns. I don't even like they were toasted. You can order a pretzel bun for $1, but I think it's a little petty to charge extra for a better bun on a $9-$11 burger. The burger was piping hot and the cheese was nice and melty. Both burgers that we got were really good! I was happy with them. The fries were just ok and they weren't hot...boo to warm fries. The atmosphere is ok, nothing to write home about. Felt a little "Applebees-y" to me. Perhaps it was because it was 6:30 and still day light.  Overall, I'll be back and home to have a different server next time.
