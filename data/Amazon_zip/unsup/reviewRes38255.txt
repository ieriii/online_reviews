When I lived in Chicago I wanted to move to Andersonville just to be close to Hopleaf. Best beers in the city. Best mussels in the city. I recommened the mussels steamed in ale as opposed to wine. The food is delicious and WONDERFUL. If you live there, are visiting there, have a layover WHATEVER...go to Hopleaf. God I miss it!
