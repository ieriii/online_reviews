I wanted to love it - I really did - but it just didn't deliver for me. The beers are over-priced ($4.50 for a miller lite) and the bartenders cannot manage to be polite in a crowd at all. I would still go back there because the food is great - love the oysters. Recommend avoiding the post-work rush because the bartenders cannot handle it!
