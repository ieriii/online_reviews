Whoa!!! I haven't written a truly bad review in a long time... But I was inspired by brunch today to do just that.... So Me and the boyf walked in for breakfast. We were half greeted by the counter woman and then interrupted by an another employee 2 times before ordering. The cashier slammed down our # and we walked to our seat... cold and strange it left a bad taste in my mouth.... and so did the food. I got the crab cake sammie... it tasted bland and like it had been heated (mayo bread lettuce and all) in a microwave. As a matter of fact I am 99% sure that it was... the chips were flavorless and the pickle was just a soggy cucumber. I will not be back... I will stick to buying the granola from whole foods...
