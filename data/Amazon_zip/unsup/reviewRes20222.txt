Excellent lunch yesterday at The Gage after a trip to the Art Institute. The service was very good - these people know what they are doing. Excellent cocktails and wine. The food was really quite superb. We had the turkey on baguette (which sounds really, really dull but was not) and the pasta of the day. So fresh and so incredibly good. Looking forward to dinner there soon.
