I'm done with this place! It happened again yesterday. Twice before we've been overcharged and I've caught the errors. But, yesterday, it happened again! So I'm now convinced it is a common practice at this place. We went there for breakfast, (eggs, etc.) and the bill came to over $40 for 3 people (average price was $9. per person.) When I checked the bill, they'd added $10.00 more to the bill. When I confronted the waitress, she got very nervous and didn't know what to say! If you must go, beware and CHECK your bill, twice!
