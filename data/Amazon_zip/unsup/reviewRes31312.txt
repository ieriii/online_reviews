Wow! That's my first reaction to this place. Too many of these "trendy" restaurants are definitely a scene with great design, beautiful people, and the place to be seen, but they usually disappoint when it comes to the food. But Sunda is the complete package, food included! Anyone who has lived in or visited Los Angeles is familiar with Koi. Billy Dec and company spared no expense when bringing over the former executive chef at this trendy L.A establishment. He's brought to Chicago some of the most innovative and delicious Asian food...including his world famous (yes, I'm going to take it to that level) Crispy Rice with Spicy Tuna and jalapeno. People, this dish is insane, and you'll be dreaming about it for days after. The fish is incredibly fresh and the meats are tender and full of flavor. We tried numerous small dishes including the Lemongrass Beef Lollypops (amazing!), two orders of the crispy rice with spicy tuna, and one of the most amazing nigiri dishes I've ever had....two pieces of escolar (white tuna) wrapped around rice with a thin potato chip on top with a bit of black truffle shavings. Oh, and how can I not mention the seared tuna crusted with crab cake. I took a double take when I saw this on the menu, but the two distinct tastes work perfectly together. I think the mustard that fuses the crab cake to the tuna really helps the two fish flavors coexist beautifully. I can go on and on about the food, but I'll let everyone try for themselves. Try to get in before the grand opening, because once word gets out, good luck getting reservations. Crispy Rice and Spicy Tuna!!!!!!!!!
