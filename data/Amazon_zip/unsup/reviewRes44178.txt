Wakamono just knocked out a wall and DOUBLED their capacity. It is newly spacious, and while the atmosphere has suffered, the waits that used to be common have also been nearly eliminated, as far as I have experienced. The sushi here is terrific. The special rolls maybe a little heavier and sauce-oriented than some other places, but it is great food at very good prices. The service can be a bit slow, and (as I alluded) sometimes it can get crowded. But the sushi is excellent, and that's that. Really delicious.
