Why did it take me four years to dine here? I went to Lao Sze Chuan with a group of six so I was able to sample all of my friends' entrees, and couldn't find anything sub-par! I recommend ordering the pot-stickers and basically anything from the items from the chef's specials, particularly the 3 chili chicken and the spicy pork. However, if you want to stick to the classics, you'll find pages of them! On a Saturday evening, we waited about a half hour for a table of six - not too bad and completely worth it.  Note: I also highly recommend the sister restaurant Lao Beijing, just down the street.
