Congrats go out to the Chicago Yelp community! I relied on you guys to find restaurants this week and you did not disappoint! I knew I had stepped into someplace special when I walked in to find a 30! string guitar mounted on the wall and a table full of your 20 something hipsters next to a table full of uniformed soldiers. Piece was just what I wanted to find in Wicker Park. After having come to Chicago numerous times to eat deep dish pizza, I was skeptical of trying traditional thin crust pizza. Thank goodness I did.  The crust and sauce were emphasized as what set this place apart by our knowledgeable waitress. She was correct in advising us only to get a max of 3 toppings because the crust & sauce (the real essence of a pizza) were out of this world good. The pizzas were fairly priced, and I guess cheap by comparison to food prices in Chicago? The food was great, one of the best pizzas I have ever had! The atmosphere was unique...in a good way. Definitely worth a stop in.
