Lots of reviews. Doesn't look like I'm going to say anything here that hasn't already been heard. So let's cut to the chase. Hombre Burger. I have dreams about this burger, and I don't even like red meat! Great beers (sometimes they're out of my favorite!), great menu overall. Have yet to have something I don't like. The only downside I can find to this place is they won't seat you unless your entire party is here. I'm sure this is an effort to avoid people taking up a table if they are waiting on one, but I wish that they'd change this. The bar is usually packed and it's hard to squeeze in some times to get a drink. If we're coming here, we're for sure having a few drinks, so sit us down and have us order while we wait for our friend. I think Revolution would get another round out of me at least.
