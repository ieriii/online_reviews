I've lived in Chicago all my life and this is definitely a very important part of my childhood. The BBQ is always fresh + great though a bit high priced but worth it over the long trip to Chinatown, the atmosphere can be a bit lacking on slow days due to the huge new dining room. Very casual atmosphere with an open kitchen. Definitely not vegetarian-friendly with all of the meat hanging on display, but it's what you'll find in Chinese BBQ places world-wide. We were die-hard loyal Sun Wah fans until a few years back when we discovered other places in Chinatown that are almost just as good for a cheaper price. However, since it's the only decent BBQ place on the northside, I will always be a huge fan of them.
