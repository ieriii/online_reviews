Part of the Tourist 101 stops - we took our last brunch at The Bongo Room. Being labor day, the staff had some sour puss faces on them BUT they were professional and very attentive all the way through. Hubby ordered a savory dish - omelet + cheese + sausage = AMAZING. Add some cheese on the potatoes = AMAZING. His savory dish was fantastic. I am a red velvet connoisseur, trust me - I have a business card. Nevertheless, the short stack of 2 with the cream cheese sweetness failed to get my attention. The pancake didn't seem to be cook all the way through and I tasted the batter. I don't know if it is a normal trend of the red velvet pancake to taste 'doughy' but it wasn't my favorite. It was however, very well presented. I think I should have ordered some other great looking pancakes they had, but being a red velvet business woman, I had to try it. They lose 1 star for 40 minute wait, doughy red velvet pancake + charging us $0.75 for salsa. That should have been on the house.
