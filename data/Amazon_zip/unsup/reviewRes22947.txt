I don't know if there is anything that they don't have here. The menu is a bound book about 20 pages long, but it's broken down in a way that makes sense. It still takes about 15 minutes to get through, but if you can't find something that looks good, that's your fault. They have everything from Orange Chicken to a soup with pork blood cakes (not as creepy as it sounds). I tried a couple of soups, the shredded pork, and an appetizer of pigs ears in a spicy sauce. It was all really good, the flavors clean and fresh, and it was very affordable. There are plenty of items for those looking for true Szechuan spice and rustic, traditional dishes. The service was great. There were plenty of people working when we arrived for an early dinner, so numerous people were stopping by to make sure we were taken care of. All said, a fine experience that warrants a return trip.
