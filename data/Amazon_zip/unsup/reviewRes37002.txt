My wife and I went here on a Sat night a few weeks back. We saw this place on Diners Drive-ins & Dives and decided we had to check it out. Parking was relatively easy, we parked about a block away, and it was free. As soon as we entered, we were greeted and directed as where to go to sit eat. My first two impressions are already good. I knew ahead of time which craft beer I was going to try. So as we approached the bar, we were greeted by one of the bartenders (who was very helpful and I wish his name ) I had a question about the beer and he answered and served me almost immediately. I tried the Tripel Karmelet, which I must add was AWESOME!! We went just for the Montreal style brisket, but I would definitely just go and enjoy more of that beer. I ordered the brisket sandwich covered in french fries. Was better than advertised! Our experience was well worth the trip from the burbs. We will definitely be back
