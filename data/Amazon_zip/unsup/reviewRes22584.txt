Of all the Greek places in Chicago I have been coming here since the 1990s and always point my friends to this place when they are visiting the city. This is a great place for home-style Greek food in Chicago. The Spanokopita and the Lamb dishes are famous here. I like the scardallia, and the yogurt as desert. I just brought a friend here recently who teaches Greek and lives there every summer and he goes out of his way to stop here every time he comes to Chicago. I went here recently on a date, and they sat us by the fire. Thanks guys. And, yes, they have the cheese on fire. Ooopha. Great service, free valet parking (tip please!), and an experience to remember.
