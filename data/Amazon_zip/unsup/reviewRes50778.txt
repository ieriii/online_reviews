Saw this restaurant as part of Chicago's chef week and was hoping to catch their prix fixe menu - but when we called to make reservations (even though you can make reservations on Open Table) and specifically mentioned this they didn't bother to tell us that they only do brunch on Saturdays. Strike 1. Oh well, I was still excited to try the restaurant. When you sit down they give you some beignets - while they were sugary and dough-y, I wished they had been a little less chewy. Having said that, we finished the entire plate because they were still pretty good.  I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with lemonade - and the lemonade tasted like freshly squeezed lemons. Not as sweet as I would have liked, but at least it wasn't artificial tasting. The pulled pork sauce had basically obliterated the bottom part of the bun making it impossible to eat without a fork/knife - strike 2. Then I took a bite of the pulled pork and unfortunately it was a little dry and very vinegar-y. My husband ordered the crab cake salad, and the salad dressing had an overpowering vinegar taste too. Not sure if this was the taste they were going for? Well anyway, strike 3. Was not a huge fan of either dish.  However, LOVED the fried okra I ordered with my sandwich - came with this creamy pesto (?) sauce that was delicious.  I was a little disappointed after reading all of the great reviews on Yelp, but maybe we just ordered the wrong items?
