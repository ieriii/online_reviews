The service here is unacceptable. My boyfriend and I have been to Garcia's about 10 times (because we like the food) and every single time, the service has gotten worse. We had lunch there today, and will never come back. When you walk into this place, you're ignored. The waitresses are unfriendly and uninterested. You have to ask for things a bunch of times before you get them. You get refills if you're lucky. The management here really needs to wake up.
