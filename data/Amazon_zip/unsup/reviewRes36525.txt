It wasn't bad. It wasn't good. It was "okay". The atmosphere could have been cozy, but the music was a bit too loud. Normally I don't care, but you had to yell for the person across from you to hear you correctly. And also, that's normally not a problem, but when you have twenty people on one side of the room, it gets REALLY loud. Loud enough that I think that's why the waiter got my order wrong. I ordered sushi, and I get a plate of fried noodles. "Look, it's fine, whatever. Just tell me what this is." "It's drunken noodles." "But...what IS that?" After a while they took it away and told me that they'd bring me I actually ordered, I just needed to wait for it to cook. (Why did it take ten minutes to think of that, I wonder?) The sad thing is, the maki was actually decent. I mean, good enough for me to want to come back and try other things that they had on their sushi menu. But the night was just unpleasant enough that I don't want to go back. And if it helps, the noodles that they brought me looked pretty standard, too. You can get the same thing at Summer or Thai Grill around the corner. And you don't have to argue with the waiter over loud music if they get your order wrong, either.
