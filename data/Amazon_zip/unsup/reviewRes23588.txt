I used to frequent this place at least 2-3 times a week a few years ago. the service was always just ok to bad. it was never great. i had a bad server once who was just a complete you know what. i was pretty aggravated that the service was that horrible considering that she had seen us in there so much and had served us before many a time. i think she just had something against us. so i decided not to leave her a tip. as we were walking out, she stormed after me and asked "wheres the tip?" i could have died laughing. i was like, "are you serious?" she asked why i didnt tip her and i started to explain. mid sentence she kinda shoved me out the door and said, "just go. just go." i could not believe she put her hands on me like that. this was about 2 years ago. so the next time we went back like a few days later, Tony came up to us and said he knows we frequent this place a lot so this one was on him and apologized about her behavior. soon after we didnt see her there anymore. we heard the same about her service from other friends as well. anyway, enough about that. the food here is friggin' AMAZING! i love, love, love spicy food. im always skeptical about places that say their food is spicy or they have warnings on the menu about the spice factor. they always seem to fall short. Lao Sze Chuan exceeds all those spicy expectations of mine. everything ive ever had there is amazing. as of recently, i dont dine in anymore for my own reasons, but getting it to go is just as good. open until midnight, 7 days a week. doesnt get any better for spicy chinese food. i heard Tony opened up 2 other similar restaurants. i plan to try those soon.
