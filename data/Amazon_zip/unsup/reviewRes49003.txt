Only tried brunch and only visited once so hate to give a five without more time. But it was great - reasonable place, hearty, simple contemporary fare. Ricotta with honey and dates ... wow great light starter. I had keilbasa with potatoes and egg - really great. My wife had a red wine poached eggs benedict, using prosciuotto as the meat. Not sure the red wine poach added anything -but it was great. tried the pork rinds just because, best for sharing with more than two folks - but great. Only gripe is the little bottles of soda so they can charge you really high soda prices and then charge for each refill. Eagerly looking forward to lunch.
