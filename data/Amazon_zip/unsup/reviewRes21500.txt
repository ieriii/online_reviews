Mayan Palace has become a regular Thursday tradition for my friends and myself (mostly them). However when I do eat there, I never walk away unhappy, actually I walk away from there pretty stuffed so I have to walk home and try to work off some of what I just finished eating. The burritos are stuffed with goodness and the platters are generous and come with lots of trimmings. Having eaten my fair share of bad and "imitation" Mexican food, I will tell you Mayan is pretty close to what you'd actually expect if you were to go south of the border, simple delicious food made with love and care. The mole sauce there is one of my favorites. The trick with Mayan Palace is to order the margaritas...always a good decision. The staff there is always friendly and will sometimes even stop and chat with you if you're there by yourself waiting for friends to meet you.
