No matter what time you show up (we were there at 6pm on a Saturday), the atmosphere is great. My husband ordered their Guatemalan chicken and had enough for two days! The mojitos are great, a little pricey though. Our server was friendly and explained everything we asked. We even got a free desert because it was my hubby's birthday. I highly recommend this and would definitely come back again.
