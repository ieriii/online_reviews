Ah, the one where I get to trash a Chicago mainstay and probably invite the wrath of yelpers city wide! I went here last Saturday for a friend's birthday. Three of my friends went in first, and I stayed outside with the other two while they smoked. Upon entering the doorman (who looks like one of those Old Time Strongmen that wear those leopard togas and lift dumbbells with spherical weights on the end) tells me to stop, and promptly pushes me a few feet while telling me to "go outside." Once out in the cold and rain he demands to know if I was first in line (what line?), and the folks around say yes, so he tells them to line up behind me. I calmly mention that our friends are inside for a birthday and we would like to join them, take a guess how that went. Our friends inside meanwhile, realizing the wait for us to get in may be enormous try lobbying on our behalf but fail. Eventually after enough negotiating I, and my two fellow compatriots that were stuck outside are allowed in. Once inside it is jam packed, and most people are talking while a live band is performing. There was no problem hearing the band, but all the employees made it a point to loudly make "Shhhhh!' noises to quiet the crowd, which was more disruptive than the crowd noise itself.  So yes, terrible staff, terrible atmosphere, and yeah, I almost forgot, overpriced drinks.  Never again....
