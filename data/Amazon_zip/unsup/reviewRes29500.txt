While the pasta isn't the best I've ever had, especially living in a place like Chicago, its affordable, decent, fast and for all intents and purposes, it hits the spot. They have an amazing lunch special (pasta and a soda for only $6 which is ridiculous considering the amount I have spent on other lunches)! Its not too loud, its never ridiculously crowded and the seating is intimate and fun. The only complaint I might have is that the last time I went there our waitress was a complete flake and forgot to do almost everything we asked her to. But all things considered, this place isn't the best place in town, but I don't really think it means to be. After all, if you're looking for fine Italian food you probably shouldn't go to a place called Pasta Bowl. But if what you're looking for is a cheap way to spend an evening with decent food and service, than you should.
