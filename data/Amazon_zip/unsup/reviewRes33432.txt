I'm trying to remember why I only gave this place 4 stars the first time because...I swear I didn't mean it! Returned again this cold, December evening and can honestly say I felt like I was on top of the world. This time I tried the "Chicken Shawarma" sandwich (with a piece of falafel on the side of course...because who am I kidding...those things are heaven). If food were in relationships, chicken shawarmas would be that perfect couple who live happily ever after. The combination of fresh, marinated chicken (not cubed and frozen), cucumber salad, hummus in delectably soft pita bread is like an honest love story that will be told for generations. Each ingredient...its own entity...that can stand on their own two feet. And that piece of falafel?...would be that free-spirited individual you will always have a crush on (see previous review for details). And the Food-Oscar goes to...Sultan's Market...standing ovation.
