This the most authentic Cuban food I've had north of Miami. The owner is a Miami native and he has kept true to real Cuban cuisine. While some of the food is jazzed up you can be sure the staples of the Cuban diet - black beans, rice, maduros, pork, bistec empanizado etc - will taste the way Abuela used to do it. I've heard the pastelitos are even shipped up from Miami. Theyre no Vicki bakery Pastelitos but they're still leagues better than anything else you'll find in the city.
