A lot more upscale than I thought. Pretty expensive. RIGHT across Millenium Park (should've brought my ice skates w/me) !! Superb service. Got the "chips"(fries) with curry gravy. A HUGE bowl of fries(couldn't finish it, I am weaksauce) with curry gravy. It was pretty okay, just wanted to try it. My friend liked it. The goat cheese risotto with basil puree and crisp esgarot?! Yummm.. SO rich that I almost couldn't finish. Comes in this cute little black pot. Basil puree + crisp escargot under the goat cheese risotto. My friend got the potato and semolina dumplings. Almost gnocchi-like, but not as chewy. My friend loved it, I thought it would've tasted better if it were chewier.
