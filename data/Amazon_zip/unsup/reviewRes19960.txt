Hands down my favorite sushi bar in Chicago, or anywhere for that matter. First and foremost, I have to mention that I don't eat anything completely raw, so I wouldn't consider myself a sushi connoisseur, but I love Coast. They have awesome rolls... some of my faves are Po'Boy, White Dragon Roll, and the Popper (not on the menu). Also, obviously being BYOB makes it even better. The atmosphere is sleek and modern, kind of romantic, but also great for a dinner with friends.
