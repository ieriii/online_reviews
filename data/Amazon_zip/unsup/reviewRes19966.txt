I've been coming to the Gage for quite some time. I like their selection of drinks and their appetizers. Their scallops are delicious, but like other expensive restaurants, they charge $15 or so for 2 scallops. The rest of the food was just ok. My ABSOLUTE favorite items to get here are the Gage N-17 fondue and the Amalfi Dream cocktail!!! mMMMMMMm!!! They have a great location across from Millenium Park and the bar and seating areas are very spacious.  However on one occasion, a Thursday evening after night class last summer, a group of early thirty-somethings asked my friend and me if we were swingers. Yikes! Sorry, but I am not. With the exception of that incident, I've had great times at The Gage and great drinks too! Though expensive, The Gage is a great place to stop if you're in the area. It offers a great space to relax and enjoy a meal and drinks since most similar places are further north on Michigan. Go here mainly for drinks and appetizers. It's definitely one of my favorites.
