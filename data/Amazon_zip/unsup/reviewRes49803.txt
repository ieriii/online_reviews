Three of us went, two had different flights of red, one with white. The white pours were significantly smaller than the reds. Odd. The wine selections in the flights were great. Overall the food was fine, nothing special, although the hummus was a standout for us. The service, indifferent. I think we'd go back if we returned to Chicago if we were looking for something decent but it wouldn't be a "must".
