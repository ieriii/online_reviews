Sure the Green Mill is a landmark and a jazz institution and the home of the original poetry slam and oh blah blah blah... I love the Green Mill but some of the servers are high on the fumes of their own hubris. Specifically: I was there for the slam last Sunday night and had the WORST bartender experience since Paris. Total asshat. When I asked for an olive for my drink (that he should have put in there in the first place, thanks) he pitched a bitch fit and acted like two steps over to the bowl was the Bataan Death March. Pretended he couldn't understand some people from Wisconsin. Got overly hot-headed with an older lady who accidentally talked while someone was on stage, pointed to the cross she was wearing, and called the pope a German son of a bitch. Plus, he seemed sweaty. An hour into the experience this guy had me longing for the pitbull who usually works the door. It totally brought down the whole vibe. And don't think I'm overly sensitive just because I'm from CA. So definitely drop by the Green Mill, it never disappoints, but get there early so you can grab a table or booth and be waited on, rather than rely on this prima donna. I believe his name was Mike. You owe me an olive, buddy.
