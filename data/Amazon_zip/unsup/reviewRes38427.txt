I know most people come here for beer but that's never a draw for me. I came here for the first time rather against my will but I found that the mussels are really quite exceptional. The only complaint is that it's usually way too busy to come here any more. I'd recommend arriving at off hours because it's been way too crowded since they were "check-pleased."
