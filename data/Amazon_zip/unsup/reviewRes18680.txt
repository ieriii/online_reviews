I want to like this place, like wanting to like a new hire with a good resume. On paper, great potential: in my hood, BYOB, a bit out of the way, homey interior, etc. But the food is just, well, not showing up for work. For starters, it's a bit on the pricey side for what is basically standard, old-school Italian. I can understand this to a point given that they need to compensate for being BYOB, but, again, to take the whole co-worker analogy and beat it like a dead horse, it's like realizing that you shouldn't have given them that lucrative package. When it comes to Italian, it all starts and ends with a red sauce. Even if I only get a taste by dipping my bread, this most simple of elements has to be right since it goes into pizzas, dipping for calamari, pastas, pizza, etc. So you know where I'm going...red sauce is bland and just off, to my tongue. In fact, everything seems to be missing that 'tastiness' factor to me that makes me crave the food. Sometimes good service can cover me sins, but even here, it's somehow not either the nice restaurant you don't even know they're there, or the friendly 'neighborhood' vibe thing. So, when the contract renewal comes up for this gig, I'm going to have to pass.
