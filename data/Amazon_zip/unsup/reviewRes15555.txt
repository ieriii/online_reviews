My girlfriend and I were in from Austin and decided to give Violet Hour a shot. To start with the only negative, there was about a 15-20 minute wait to get seated on a Wednesday at around 10 pm. However, I can't really ding them for this because they do a good job of setting expectations. The positives - simply the best drinks we've ever had. She absolutely loved the Juliet and Romeo, and my Old Fashioned was perfect. Our server was extremely accommodating and willing to recommend other spots we should hit in Chicago before heading home. The chairs/seating allow for just enough privacy without making it too cramped. Overall, just a great experience. We'd definitely go back.
