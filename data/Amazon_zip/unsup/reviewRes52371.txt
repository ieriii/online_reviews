I have to say, the pizza is pretty good. But the wait is ridiculous. I went here with my boyfriend at the time, and it was in December so it was freezing outside... and there was nowhere to wait inside. Literally, the line wrapped around the building and was probably 50 people long at least. Luckily, one of the hosts came out and asked us if we wanted to sit at the bar since there were just two of us, so we didn't have to wait in the line. But it would have been an hour, at least, waiting outside in Chicago in December! Just seems a little crazy that they don't have anywhere to wait inside. We got mozzerella sticks, which were really good and different from typical ones. The bartender told us that they actually make them there and bread them themselves. So much different taste from the frozen ones. They were really good. The pizza is good, but honestly, I prefer Lou Malnati's or Edwardos deep dish. Especially considering the line.
