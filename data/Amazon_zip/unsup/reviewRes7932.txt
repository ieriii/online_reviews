I can't confirm the medical accuracy of this hypothesis, but there seems to me to be an interesting effect here where the volume of meat you will inevitably consume causes your stomach to tell your brain it needs all available blood diverted to itself, such that it can work as hard as possible at digesting the absurd amount of unnecessary calories that you have just consumed. After every meal I've ever had here (or at any Brazilian steakhouse) I have felt a lightheaded buzz that I can only deduce comes from this selfish requisition of resources by the stomach. I guess it's alright though... the less oxygen my brain has the less aware it is that I have just dangerously over-gorged myself on enough red meat to last a small bear an entire winter's worth of hibernation. With that said, everyone's already covered the stop/go buttons, the fantastic diversionary salad bar, and just about everything else about this place. I will say one more thing which is that I find about half of the meat options to be fantastic, and half of them to be either overcooked, exceedingly dry, or simply an inferior cut of meat. Find the ones you like, and let the green light of your 'feed-me' token guide you to a blissful meaty slumber.
