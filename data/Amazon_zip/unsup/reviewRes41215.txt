Excellent food and beautifully prepared. You're not only paying for the crazy combos, but for the experience that comes with it. Be prepared to spend at least 2 hours here (minimum) and send your taste buds on a roller coaster ride. The menu changes often, but when we went, we got the 9 course meal and everything was lovely. They are smaller courses, but yet filling. I remember we had a bacon wrapped marshmallow as a course...ummm what? But it was pretty damn good. We also had Thai curry ice cream as dessert, which was fantastic after you got over the initial shock of the two being combined. ANd BYOB is always a plus! I would say this is a special occasion spot as it is pricey - but everything comes out at a nice pace with a brief and detailed explanation, which makes for a great experience. yOU just feel fufu and stuff. Me likey. But I must try others of the same concept before making my return.
