i'll keep it short and to the point. if you order one of their tasty hearty sandwiches, eat it quick! the jerusalem salad they stuff the pitas with turns them into some sort of gooptastic squishy mess. grab a fork if you're a slow eater. ps-you can get three tasty falafels for a buck. stuff them into your zipper pocket (ala napoleon dynamite style) and munch away while bar hopping in the hood. be the envy of the town that nite.
