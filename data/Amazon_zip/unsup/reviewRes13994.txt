I was in town about a month ago on a business trip and read some of the Yelp reviews about this place about the beer being really good and had also noticed the bacon fat popcorn on the on-line menu and was intrigued. First off the beers were very good, the Bottom Up Belgian Wit was delicious, it tasted like a good Belgian Wheat beer should. They also had an IPA on tap in limited quantity that I wish I could remember the name of 'cus it seriously gave Dogfish Head's 60 Minute IPA a run for its money. The bacon fat popcorn blew me away (and probably added 100 points to my cholesterol, but that's OK 'cus it was worth it). Pop corn popped in bacon grease, topped with bacon...how can you NOT love that!? The food was good. The pulled pork sandwich was very delicious and the cole slaw was one of the better ones I've had. If and when I'm in Chicago again, I'll be stopping back in here for more brews and and bacon good-ness!
