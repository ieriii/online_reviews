The ambiance at Uncommon Ground is excellent, and conducive to having a great experience. The lounge area is swanky (I can't complain any time I get to eat dinner at a plush rocking chair), and I seriously dug the indie playlist they had on. As far as the fare, I found it to be so-so. The drink special was whisky; drinks involving Buffalo Trace were $7, which is a good deal. However, my old fashioned was cloyingly sweet, which I find unacceptable (my date's Manhattan, on the other hand, was very good). For food, I ordered the burger, which comes as I like it: simply, with top-quality Dietzler farm beef, cheddar cheese, applewood smoked bacon, and a fried egg. At $14, I expect an elite hamburger; instead, this one was marginally above average. The patty was actually cooked medium rare (which is surprisingly difficult to find) and had a mild yet pleasant beef flavor. The fried egg was luscious, but ever-so-slightly overdone such that the yolk did not run down the patty. The cheddar cheese was good, but not nearly sharp enough. Sweet potato fries were delicious (but they always are). By far the most offputting element of the burger were the condiments: jarred crinkle-cut pickles, and squeeze bottle Grey Poupon. I don't understand the point of offering a gourmet hamburger, only to serve it with condiments I can buy at the Jewel. It makes about as much sense as buying a Rolls Royce and putting in a plastic interior. This also stood at odds with the "local/sustainable" vibe that UG is trying to create. All in all, a pleasant, if overpriced and imperfect experience. I recognize that it may not be entirely fair to judge a place not known for its burger on its burger, but I still think that there's no point in offering a gussied up, $14 hamburger if it isn't an absolute home-run. I'd come back, but would definitely order something else.
