I don't say this lightly. I say this as an Indian, who has been to Indian restaurants on nearly every continent of the planet, and every city in North America: this is the best Indian buffet in the world. You guys in Chicago are a bunch of lucky bastards. The only place that approaches this is Montreal's Buffet Maharaja, except India House isn't as massive and, I'd say, the food is tastier. The machli saag was mouth watering. I didn't even know there was a such thing as machli saag.
