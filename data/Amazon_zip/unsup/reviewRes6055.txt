We order Fillet Mignon Wellington and Spinach Salad, Crab cake. OMG, Fillet is really juicy and tender,,,, so good. Spinach salad is really good and good size too. (I order small one.) Crab cake is so fresh. I really like bred too. Maybe they made own bred. I am really impressed! Service is good as well.
