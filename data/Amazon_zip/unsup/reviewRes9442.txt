Came here for brunch with 3 other ladies, reserving about 1 month ahead (just in case). We ordered the following drinks: Rumaki Fizz - pretty strong bacon flavor, a little too savory for a brunch drink for me, though my friend who ordered it really liked it Curious Jorge - the bruleed banana was fabulous, and the drink looked really tasty though I didn't try it Afternoon delight - also pretty strongly flavored, nice to try (I only had a sip) but definitely an acquired taste Bugeymosa - variation on a mimosa, very light and fizzy.. yumm! Now for the food: Sturgeon Lox Platter - I didn't try it, but it looked pretty good from where I was plus it was visually interesting. Lingonberry French Toast - yum! really tasty, pretty big portion Rhubarb Waffle - a bit soggy, but I liked the tartness of the rhubarb with the strawberry, goat cheese, and almond flavors.. a very nice combination Skirt Steak & Eggs - perfectly done steak, really nice crab batter, definitely a wonderful flavor combination with the greens on the plate. The addition of the egg was delightful. Recommend. We also ordered the Lithuanian bacon buns, brioche, and pork belly sides. The brioche came with chocolate butter and lemon curd (amazing). The pork belly portion was small but tasty. The bacon buns were reminiscent of BBQ buns you find at dim sum restaurants, but pretty good nonetheless. Our waitress was pretty sassy, which was kinda fun at first but got a little grating (like when I asked her to separate the alcohol, she was almost rolling her eyes..). So, definitely a miss on that point. But other than that, perfect foodie brunch!
