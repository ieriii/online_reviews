I am a huge fan of finding a neighborhood gem that makes you feel so good when you walk out, you almost feel like you didn't pay enough money. I'd heard of this place for years, but for one reason or another had never visited while I had been to Tango Sur (everyone's favorite restaurant in Chicago apparently and closest comparison to this place) probably a dozen times. First of all, its BYOB Mon thru Thurs which automatically gives this place some bonus points by default. The decor is nothing flashy, but its very warm and inviting and gives the restaurant an authentic feel. A girl I work with explained to me the following day that all of the tables and chairs are hand carved and i definitely remember thinking how unique they were during dinner without knowing that. I'm not sure how busy this place gets on the weekends, but it was decently full when we were there on a Thursday night in December.  Now lets get down to business....the steak. It is absolutely everything you can want it to be and more. Hearty, well-marinated steak that just makes my mouth water even as I'm typing this review. We started with some empandas which were served with a salsa verde and they were really good. Our entrees came with some grilled shrimp and chicken which were also good, but definitely on the B squad of this roster. I wish I could say any of us had room for dessert... I think this is a perfect place to go with some friends you haven't seen in a while to hang out, drink a bottle or two, and enjoy a comfortable delicious meal. Our server was really nice and did everything she was expected to do. I just think the fact that you can go here without a 2 hour wait gives it an edge over you know where. 3 of us all ordered steak dinners with appetizers (we brought a couple bottles) and got out of there for somewhere around $30-35/person after tip. I will definitely be going back asap and I'm also angry with myself for not going here sooner!
