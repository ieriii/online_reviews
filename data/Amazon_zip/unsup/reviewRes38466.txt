I walked into this place not knowing what to expect. I knew they had a great beer selection but I was not expecting the yummiest food I've had in a long time. I had three couples in my group and we decided to each order something different and try each others meals. EVERYTHING WE ORDERED WAS GREAT!!!!! Every bite you took you would discover a new element to the dish that made it even better. At the end of the meal we asked for bread just so we could sop up that little last bit of sause. The food was well worth the price. They beer was outstanding too. My sister is not a big beer drinker and she found a few she loved. It was a cozy,warm, and romantic atmosphere. The service was great. I will defiantly be back.
