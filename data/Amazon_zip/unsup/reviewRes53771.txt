This is my # 1 all-time top Chicago destination. Get there early (tables are tough to come by, and sneek under a cheap cover) and stay late (the music goes until the wee hours of the morning). Every night has its own feel, its own vibe. I love Sundays, when it is quiet and Gordon tears it up on a little late night Ella.The place is chill and the beer is cold (PBR on tap!) but the tunes are HOT.
