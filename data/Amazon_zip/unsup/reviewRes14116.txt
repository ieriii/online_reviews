I live 2 blocks from Glenn's and have been for dinner and brunch. I'd give 5 stars to brunch and 4 to dinner. The smoked trout hash is a MUST TRY for brunch... as far as breakfast goes for me, it's savory, smoky, creamy perfection. If you're not into trout before noon, the corned beef hash is a very solid option. I was impressed/jealous that the couple next to us polished off bowls of cereal before chowing down on their entrees, so next time I'm definitely going for some sugary cereal I was never allowed as a child. For dinner, I sampled a bunch of seafood dishes (whatever came with the bacon hollandaise sauce = amazing) as well as the mac & cheese (it has smoked cheddar, enough said), clam chowder (get some to try and share it, unless you enjoy spoiling your appetite!). The reason I'm knocking a star off is for the steamed mussels. The sauce they were in was bland, they were sprinkled with parmesan (the Kraft variety) and half of them weren't open...Blegh.
