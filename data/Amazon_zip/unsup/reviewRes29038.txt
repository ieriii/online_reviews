I have to agree with most Yelpers and say that Frontera is pretty good. I went with Jason O. and some friends and we waited approximately an hour or so to get seated. During the wait we had some OK cocktails. After visiting some of the craft cocktail lounges in Chicago, I have to say that Chef Bayless needs to hire a better mixologist. One issue that turned me off was that the margaritas are pre-mixed and iced at the bar and then shaken at the table, diluting it improperly. On to the food, the sampler platter guac good, "quesadillas" okay, flautas okay, the jicama salad was great. I ordered the Catfish "Pibil" excellent especially with habanero sauce (seemed like a Mexican boullaibaisse). One this about the food is that it uses too much of his smoked chili salt. It was interesting at first, but then got pretty boring. I would definitely come back here to try out new dishes. A very solid restaurant that may need some work on its cocktails.
