I'll admit it, I go to Wilde mostly for the atmosphere. Their menu is not super vegan friendly, but if you're okay with soup and/or salad, I'd recommend it. Perfect for warming up inside on a blustery day, a fun place to go with friends, and they have a cute little patio for the warmer months. Nice selection of wine and beer, as well as a full bar, and I love that they have a "drink local" section on their menu. I highly recommend the "Soup Veg" which has kale, white beans, carrots, and a whole slew of other veggies.
