This review will be in respect to their burger... It was very average food for very above average prices. I had "The Gage" burger, 17 bucks for an okay burger, it didn't taste any better than a burger you can get at any other standard eatery. Also, 7 bucks for a pint of Guinness? That's kind of dick, even if you're supposed to put forth a swankier image. Verdict: In the context of a fine beer and burger, it makes me long for Paramount Room, for 1/3rd the cost, I actually get a higher quality and yummier burger, and a delicious pint. For what is touted as a Gastropub, their beer selection was very mainstream and standard. (Guinness, Smithwick's, Harp, etc.)
