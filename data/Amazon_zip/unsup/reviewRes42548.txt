This is the 2nd time I have gotten delivery from them. They were on time and very nice. Seeing other negative reviews, I think I had great service experiences because I ordered on a weekday during the day and they weren't that busy. Their smoked gouda is top notch on the pizza! Get anything with smoked gouda, they will cover the whole pie in it! I was also impressed that they don't skimp on the ingredients. My whole pizza was covered in proscuitto as well, and not little bits here and there. Large proscuitto shavings all over the gouda covered pizza with a perfect sprinke of artichokes. Very flavorful! The gouda is very creamy when you chew it in your mouth. It coats your tongue with a wonderful flavor. I did find that it masked the proscuitto a little. So you might want a stronger meat, like spicy sausage or pepperoni. Their chicken is tasty as well. I love the burnt parts. Fall of the bone, and moist through and through. Peruvian rotisserie is more flavorful to me, but this is still excellent chicken. Garlic mashed potato-great Black beans and bacon-delicious! The bacon added a lot of flavor.
