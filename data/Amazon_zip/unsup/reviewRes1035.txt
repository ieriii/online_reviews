OMG amazing. That's about all I can say about this place. After I saw Anthony Bourdain devour a foie gras hot dog on No Reservations, I knew this needed to be on my list of things to visit when I was in Chicago. The line is insanely long but oh so worth it. Apparently, I got there when the line was "manageable". I still waited 45min. I love that they have a policy that if you have not ordered, you can't sit down. Somehow, there is always a place to sit once you order! You have to get the foie grad hot dog. It's just amazing. But you know, the standard Chicago-style dog is great too! And don't forget the duck fat fries. This is a must-go. It's a little out of the way but who cares. Make an effort and go. I can't wait to go back.
