This is a bold statement: I think Art of Pizza has the best deep dish pizza in the city. Argue with me if you want. You know I'm right. I always refer people who are looking for "real" Chicago deep dish pizza to Art of Pizza. And they always love it. Rightfully so. Their pizza is the bomb. Super-doughy, ultra-cheesy and slathered in tomato sauce, my mouth is watering just thinking about it. Sure, the actual restaurant is a little divey. Who cares? When they're serving up 'za like this, the dining establishment could be a shack as far as I'm concerned. It's clean, simple and doesn't mess around. Ohh.. their fried zucchini is pretty tasty, too.
