Just had a wonderful leisurely dinner, flights of wine and dessert with friends from AZ. Our server was awesome and there was no rushing, hurrying to move us out because they had tables to fill. The crowd was consistent and it was bustling without the noise level of eating under the L. It's been 6 years since I dined here and would definitely be back! I don't need trendy BS, just great wine and food pairings in a relaxed setting!
