If you are a fan of Indian food you will love this place , and if you are not a fan of Indian food you will be . They have a wide selection of food to choose from there really is something for everyone. Start with naan which is like or is a pita bread. You can dip it in the bowl of Tamarah ks shorba ( tomato soup with a splash of oh so good to it. ) The customer service oh so flattering very friendly, i like to come here at least once a month now. I am bringing my aunt here today I can't wait to show it off ! Food prices aren't that bad either you will like this place!
