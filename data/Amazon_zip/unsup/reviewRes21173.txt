I have never had a dining experience like this one in the sense that what we got for the price and the overall layout of the restaurant. I tried the seafood soup after hearing great things about their cauldrons they have; it was delicious. The dish was like 12 bucks and it came in a huge bowl with generous amounts of shrimp, mussels, and catfish. My buddy got the pork belly soup and the most amazing part about it was, that there was pieces of avocado in it that did not wilt whatsoever. We were both eating our soups for over 30 minutes and in that whole time the avocados did not become brown, soggy, or nasty at all...amazing.
