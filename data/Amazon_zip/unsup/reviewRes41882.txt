I never really understood why so many people love Ruth's Chris until now. Out of all the steakhouses in Chicago, I never thought that this would rank among the top one, but it is my new favorite steakhouse. Even though it's a chain, it gets a big 5 stars from me.  Let me start with the service, I've never been treated so well at any steakhouse in the city like I was here. I called and made reservations for my boyfriend's birthday because it's his favorite steakhouse, so when the waiter came to the table he greeted me by name which was very nice. The service was absolutely excellent and the steaks were amazing. So buttery and salty that it just melted in your mouth. So delicious! Then the waiter came and handed a dessert menu to my boyfriend and said anything you want- it's on us for your birthday. He ordered the chocolate espresso cake and it was very tasty. I was so impressed with the service, the food and the atmosphere that this is my new favorite steakhouse. I highly recommend this place!
