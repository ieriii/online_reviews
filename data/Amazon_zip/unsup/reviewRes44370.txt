After trying the delicious red velvet cupcakes at the recent Yelp event, I knew I had to stop by and check out the bakery for myself! Driving down Division, you can't miss it, there is a huge neon sign above the door. The bakery itself is a bit small, and has a few tables outside to comprise a patio.  The prices were extremely reasonable. A whole cheesecake for $13, the red velvet cake for $20. Cupcakes averaged $2-3. One thing I should note is that the size of the actual cupcakes seems to be a tad smaller than those that were served at the Yelp event. They look delicious, however, it seems as if some of the nicer details may have been lost in the shuffle from kitchen to display case, as some of them were a bit mushed. They also were a bit dry, I prefer my cupcakes to be a bit more moist. Employees were nice and took the time to answer the few questions I had to the best of their abilities. I will definitely be coming back. I would be interested to see how others who only tasted the cupcakes at the Yelp event would rate the bakery after actually having gone to the store itself.
