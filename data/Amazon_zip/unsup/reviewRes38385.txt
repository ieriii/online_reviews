Came to town for a weekend with friends that live there and some that have spent a considerable amount of time in the area. We thought about other pizza places, but my friend determined this was her favorite and I now happily agree. We each ordered a large stuffed pizza to bring some home with us. We knew about the 40 min cook time and ordered some cheesy garlic bread to tide us over. It was light, lovely and not too filling. Just perfect. The stuffed pizza is amazing. I am looking forward to having it for dinner again tonight. Our server gladly boxed up nearly untouched pizzas, even swapping out a few pieces so we could try each other's food when we got home. I'll definitely be back!
