i came here for a birthday dinner on either a friday or saturday night. anyway, it was super busy. service sucked but food was SO GOOD. my bf and i shared picada colombiana (skirt steak, rib-eye steak, pork loin, grilled chicken breast, chorizo, pork ribs, arepa, crunchy green plantain, fried sweet plantain, yuca and potatoes). there was SO MUCH FOOD on that plate! this entree is definitely enough for two people to share. i fell in love with the green sauce they give you with your entree. i must've asked for 3 cups of it. the restaurant itself is super dim which gives it a romantic feel. plenty of street parking. there's also a colombian coffee shop across the street. i forgot what this place is called but their colombian coffee is super bold. just how i like it! oh and the guy gave me a free cup of coffee in exchange of a shot of jameson. how nice of him. :)
