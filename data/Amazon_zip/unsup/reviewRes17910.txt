I was fortunate enough to try this place before it was as widely known, and I was and still am thoroughly impressed with the cocktails they make here. A friend brought me a few years back and I think it was the first time I saw what a cocktail could really be. If you appreciate quality and are willing to pay a few extra bucks for it (especially if you've been paying $10 for a drink at a club) then find the violet hour, and I mean that literally, it's semi-hidden in plain sight. No sign, good luck...it's worth it.
