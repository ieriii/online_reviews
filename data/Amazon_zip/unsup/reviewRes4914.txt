I have to admit, all I knew about this place was they had a ton of pork and it was supposed to be good. We wandered in on a whim on a Sunday afternoon. We got a spot at the bar and I was immediately overwhelmed by the menu. I didn't know what a lot of it was (I felt kinda dumb) But the guy behind the bar was uber helpful and explained everything. He also made some great recommendations. You HAVE to get the whipped feta and cucumber smear! It is to die for. I know, not pork, but still! We also loved the potato and speck croquettes and we had an amazing panini, which one is escaping me...we really wanted to try the fried deviled egg...I mean...how awesome does that sound?? But alas, it is only available for dinner. We each had an amber ale of sorts, which was awesome, and really expensive! oops! haha, oh well, it was worth it. I will definitely stop in again. The place is tiny though so probably won't go during prime time unless I am feeling adventurous. I am now dreaming about that cucumber smear!
