3rd time's a charm for mayan palace to get a review... 1st time went for my bday with waaaay too many people. food was delish, but service was spotty with half the table getting their food 20+ min before the other half. 2nd time went for a late night dinner that apparently involved waaay too many margaritas with my bf and his bff. i managed to crawl home in a (drunken) food coma. 3rd time was a double date and quite successful. great food, great drinks, great service. their salsa is some of the best i've had, we were scarfing down the chips in an embarassingly quick manner. guac is a good sized portion for the price, could use some extra spice tho. next time we'll ask! i think the supreme chicken enchiladas are the way to go - great flavor and freshness. avacados on top fool me into thinking i'm so healthy...ha! note: the back garage/patio has been remodeled and looks quite nice! the tiny secret-looking mafia hallway to the back room still exists, but now has more lighting and new paint job.
