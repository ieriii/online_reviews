This place, located in a prime spot on the MM, certainly packs them into its undersized dining area. In short, the enticing menu is variable in its execution. The much-lauded crispy pig ear dish was a tad greasy, with the pigs ears so thinly sliced and heavily breaded that they had little pork flavor. A (house-made) charcuterie and cheese platter was a mixed bag, but very good overall. The turkey leg confit, on the other hand, was one of the most memorable dishes I've had of late, rich and moist meat in a great agrodolce. Huge props are due to PP for their exceedingly cool wine list, offering up scores of intriguing bottlings from around the world (none from the USA, though!). The staff were knowledgeable and gracious despite the insane crowd. Definitely worth a repeat visit for the wine alone, with mostly good food playing a suitable supporting role.
