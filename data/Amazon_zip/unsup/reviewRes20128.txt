Here's the deal. I came for the Guinness on St. Patrick's Day- and I am happy I did. It was a jolly good time with all me lads. It was packed- but in a good way. There was live Irish music going while I was sipping my perfectly poured pint. I can't wait to come back for the food. It looked phenomenal. You've just been yelped in.
