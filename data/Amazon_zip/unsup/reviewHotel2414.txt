I was here for NYE 2006/7 and did the whole "stay at the hotel/go to the party in the hotel" thing. An awesome idea, if I do say so. Not having to worry about how you were getting home was awesome. Knowing the bed you were going to sleep in was probably made by fucking angels was ALSO awesome. And the fact that the double rooms have two bathrooms was super convenient and a really nice touch. We had one minor issue with the hotel, and it revolved around them charging us for things we didn't take from the mini-bar, but that was resolved with a quick trip to the customer service desk. I'd stay here again, but only if I suddenly became very wealthy and can afford to do so. The price is really the only thing keeping this place from a 5-star review.
