The hubs and I ate hear last night and first and foremost, we lucked out with the BEST server. Our server, Gerson (or Jerson?) really made our experience here. We were seated right away, and we started discussing the menu with our server. We went off of his reccs and we weren't disappointed. I have to ask you now to stop being Judgy McJudgerson while I tell you what we ordered: We had: Olive oil-Poached Tuna with Greek Lima Beans 6 The Salt-roasted Beets with Whipped Goat Cheese & Pistachio        Vinaigrette 5 Porchetta with Salsa Verde 9 Chicken Thigh Kebabs with Fried Smashed Potatoes & Tzatziki 9 And ended it with a fried ricotta and chocochip pastry that was delicious. When I look at this list now, it seems like there is a lot of food, but really, we took 1/2 the panini and 1/2 the chicken thigh home too. So there. I love small plates b/c I like to taste a lot of different things...and this is a place where the tastes are different. I was telling my Hubs that I enjoyed eating there b/c I had tastes that I either never had, or hadn't had in a really long time. Now, this is KEY to your enjoyment there. Get seated in Gerson's section. He is the best. Super friendly, really great at describing and recommending dishes, really attentive and just awesome.
