My boyfriend and I went here for dinner on a Saturday night. Everything was amazing! The staff was very friendly and we were seated right away. We started off with some yummy bruschetta topped with fresh mozzarella. For entrees, my boyfriend had a salmon dish and i had some pasta, both were delicious! We also loved that it was BYOB. To finish off a nice evening we split the chocolate souffle. Overall, we enjoyed our entire experience at Caro Mio and will definitely be back again!
