i don't care if any native chicagoans or suburbanites think this is touristy. ok sure you can go to wildfire in the ILL. burbs (5 locations in chicagoland/burbs) and they are branching out into a few others states now... but its because they are good at what they do. the first time i came here was on a romantic date back when i didn't eat meat. i still remember how awesome the pan-crusted fish was there. upon coming here again with BenO, MamaO and MamaO'sFriends i suggested the fish dish. it wasn't any the menu for this season but we were all smitten with the filet trios. in fact, all 6 of us ordered the filet trios. so you get 3 mini filets with 3 different crusts: i had the horseradish, bleu cheese, and bearnaise crusts. yum! all the leftovers were combined and donated to BenO and i. i had 2 repeat dinners of filet and i was soo smitten at all 3 of my dinners. the steaks were cooked perfectly - when i said medium-rare i got it. there were flights but i just had a specialty cocktail. going back id have the flight! you can get a martini or wine flight ranging from 7.50-14.75. not bad at all! we shared a group salad and a dessert. indulging at this point. the experience was pleasant, the ambiance was very classic yet comfy, it all made for great conversation and a great meal. not only is the food great but the prices are fair all around. the waitress was very good. she was on top of her service! we were there fairly long too and she didn't glitch in attention. informative for any of us with questions and very friendly in personality. so yes if you are coming to illinois, go ahead and try wildfire - you won't be dissatisfied! and if you are a chicagoan and havent tried it yet, it's a must for IL pride, like garretts popcorn and frango.
