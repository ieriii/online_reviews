I love the atmosphere here, it is cozy and clean. However, the menu is strange and very limited, and frankly the food is not great, especially for how expensive it is (for bar food). On the plus side, the beer list is pretty extensive and they have outdoor seating when it's nice out. Some of the booths are also very large and can accommodate large parties, which is nice.
