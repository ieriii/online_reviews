Great outdoor seating, especially with a 6-month old in a stroller. (We were torn between the delicious weather and the smooth, live jazz playing inside on Tuesday night!) The wait staff was very friendly and super-accomodating, something I'm learning is very important as a parent! =) We tried a few items off the tapas menu, all of which were unique but very rich. Not your standard American-Italian. I recommend this as a great way to sample a bunch of interesting food!
