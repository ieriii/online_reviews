A chop-house that has a decent vege selection shows forward-thinking and catering to a broad clientele. Special star points for that. Its a hoppin' place so get your reservations in early. We did and were seated promptly but it was packed! Its the only independent chop-house in Chicago, which is saying a lot. The fact that its not only survived but thrived in a a very competitive environment against large national chains, means its doing something very right. Eventhough it was super busy, we were never left wanting for service. Both wait staff and busboys were quick and attentive. Food was very good and ample portions. Our friends who ordered the steaks complimented their ability to cut and cook to order and the accuracy. We compliment their lovely seafood and vege options which would be proudly served in pescatorian and vegetarian establishments respectively. We come back every year we visit Chi-town.
