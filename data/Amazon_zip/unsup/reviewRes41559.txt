This was one of the best dinners of my lifetime. My girlfriend took me here for my birthday celebration and it was fantastic. We had the 7 course and enjoyed every bite. The Scallop & MD Crab motoyaki was scrumptious as well as... well everything. Plus I love the BYOB factor. Nothing like bringing two bottles of wine to diner without paying restaurant markup costs... even though we only drank one btl. I highly recommend this cozy, little spot.
