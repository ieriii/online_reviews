duck duck duck duckkkkkkkkk! Too much duck, just the way I love it. So after coming back from a trip to San Francisco, we had the best peking duck in their chinatown, so i've been on a search for a place in chi-town and luckily I came across sun Wah. They do take reservations which is always a bonus, made it for a party of 9, we were seated after like 5 min on a Saturday night, which is not bad at all. Got this really nice round table so we can see everyone with a lazy susan in the middle to twirl the tea, the soup, the fried rice and my fave, the amazing duck. The food was all delicious fresh as we ordered the $37 duck feast which is good for about 3 people, not the 4-5 that they suggest.. And we came hungry all right, the duck was the best, it was crispy on the outside, tender on the inside and with those special steamed buns, soo yummy! The only negative was the service, we had to ask our server like 3 times for water, for more buns and more veggies. They up charge you for more veggies, which isn't the best service in my opinion. HOwever, overall a great time and we will be back for more duck!!!
