We used to order sushi from this restaurant on a regular basis. However, after dealing with this restaurant tonight, I will no longer be doing so. Understanding there is communication breakdown between different languages, the management handled an error on their end as poor as any manager could have. I am honestly just shocked and disappointed in the lack of customer service that was offered and on principal alone, will no longer order sushi from this restaurant. Shame on you Wakamono. We will certainly be sure to share this story with everyone who will listen.
