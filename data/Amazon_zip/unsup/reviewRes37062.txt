Astounding beer selection. Delicious food. Kinda far out of our way but well worth it. We came here with a few friends on a Wednesday night and it was packed! We hung out around the bar to try a few of their HUGE selection of beers on tap (and they have another list for their beers in bottles I believe). Be prepared to wait since they don't take reservations. When we were seated, we were starving and the food didn't disappoint. We ordered mussels for two for the table just so we could try their specialty...but we didn't expect them to give us so many! We chose their Belgian-style sauce (white ale with sliced shallots, celery, thyme & bayleaf) and I would've drank the sauce itself because it was delicious. My boyfriend and I shared the Potato-Gouda Croquettes, Sauteed Veal Sweetbreads, Roasted Beet salad, their daily soup which was celery root, and some stew that he ordered (I can't remember the name). Everything was so good! I love sweetbreads and these were good as well...but I was sad that it wasn't a bigger serving. We were definitely full and content by the end of our meal. It was a struggle trying to finish the huge pot of mussels along with all the food we ordered. Hopefully we'll be back soon!
