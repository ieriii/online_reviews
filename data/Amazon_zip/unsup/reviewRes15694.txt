The thing about Andersonville, as much as I hate to express it- is that one after another- every restaurant and little shop has something interesting to offer. A friend of mine and I spent the evening wandering around the Clark strip trying to figure out where to get dinner. We originally wanted to go to Great Lakes Pizza but the HOUR AND A HALF WAIT encouraged us to go elsewhere. My friend suggested Calo and because I didn't have any other suggestion, we strolled in, ordered a large pizza to go and wandered around some more. A half hour later, we walked back in- and the hostess forgot entirely who I was (how do you not discriminate an Indian amidst a sea of white faces?) and tried to seat us. I reminded her we were there to pick up our pizza and she looked around nervously and left to fetch our grub. For $20, my friend and I ate like a king and queen on her back patio. Ate and drank and had a glorious time. This is what living in Chicago is all about.
