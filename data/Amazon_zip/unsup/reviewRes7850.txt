We landed at Spacca for Father's Day - he is a pizza fan yet had not experienced a wood fired pizza. What a treat for everyone! Starters: Anchovy/arugula/tomato salad: spicy arugula, flavorful OO and tomato a perfect accompaniment for the anchovies Roasted eggplant Caprese Eggplant was our least favorite but still good. Pizzas: don't recall the names... white pizza with porcini and truffle oil, sausage with mushroom and one more... ALL very good.  I'm glad i got the reco on this spot, I wouldn't have ventured to Ravenswood otherwise. Will return.
