Mojito Monday - oh so good! $5 for one of the best mojitos I've had in ages. The appetizers we had here were quite good too - especially the guac and the empanadas. My only real complaint here is that the glasstop tables all seemed to be greasy, slimy, just plain dirty. However the food was so good that I definitely want to come back and try Carnivale for dinner.
