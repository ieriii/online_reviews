Took the parents here, so it was one of those experiences of just hoping that no Seinfeld-esque moments happen with the waiter. Only a few did, so it wasn't so bad... Anyway on to the review. Food: the food was solid but far from spectacular, a little on the oily side, especially the pizza. However, they have some interesting pizza combinations. Some of the pasta dishes we had worked out and some didn't. In general, the seafood dishes were better than the landfood ones. The bread, though crusty, didn't taste like anything other than white bread. Ambiance: a busy restaurant on the loud side. Upstairs is a bit more quiet and intimate. Not bad all around.
