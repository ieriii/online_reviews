So yet again flagged by the those that want to hide the truth about this place. Anyone giving this place over 1 star is either vested or paid. Terrible service, sub-par food, rotten produce, expired products, slimy meat selection, crap shoot if a product is in stock, on and on...Worst grocery store in the area. Restaurant is overrated and looks like the retirees in the area congregate there for dinner.
