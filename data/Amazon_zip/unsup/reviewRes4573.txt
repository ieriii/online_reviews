I LOVE this place. Like, love, love, love it. I've been lucky enough to grab a table a few times. There have been a couple of times when the wait is 2+ hours and those days were sad days. First - trust your server. The servers know what is up, what is fresh and what you should order. I've always ordered a cheese plate with recommendations from the server. In addition to tasty toasted bread, it comes with a few jams to kick up the flavor. My favorite dish is the roasted beets with goat cheese. I could have that as a light dinner on its own. The bone marrow is also good although small.  The location is a discrete alley right off Michigan Avenue. You wouldn't think you could find superb food on a touristy shopping street but there it is. It's my favorite spot to eat in the area. With the exception of the long wait times, this place is the best - down to earth and comfortable and lacks that River North faux hoity toity vibe. Best to go on off hours, then you don't have to wait and you get extra attentive service!
