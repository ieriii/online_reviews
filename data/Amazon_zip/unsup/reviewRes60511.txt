My friends and I went to Wilde over the weekend and had a great time. The interior is really nice and the place is really big. I love that they serve late night food (please see Isabella W's review). The wings were really awesome and the fries were so-so. My friends and I eat way too much =/ I was SO EXCITED when they had frog's leap wine but turns out they ran out of bottles. Really sad :(  Anyways, I do plan on going back!
