Went here last month with a co-worker looking for Viennese food. I had never tried it so we decided on Le Colonial. He said the menu was not what he was used to. He was used to more a fast food take out type style. The food was Very good. We both had selfish allergies and they had a separate menu for us. When our food arrived we both realized we ordered way to much. We shared both of ours, which was good to try different things. Drink menu was extensive and my co-worker got one of the specialty drinks and liked it. I just got the classic Whiskey and coke. The atmosphere made if feel as though it was relaxed, but waitstaff made if feel very upscale. It was a bit confusing. We were dressed business casual though and fit in fine. Overall a good experience. Pricey food, but worth it for a business dinner or date.
