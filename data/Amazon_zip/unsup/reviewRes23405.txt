Not awesome. Feel bad giving it just 1 star, but it falls on that side of 1 1/2 for me. Went here with out of town family based on Yelp reviews and preference for seafood amongst our guests which made Greek seem like a nice choice. It has sort of a tacky family-friendly charm, and it seemed busier than the other restaurants in Greektown, so even though I got excited when we first walked in I would not go here again based on the disappointing food and service. We ordered beets, some spicy feta appetizer, and fried zucchini to start. The beets were good, the spicy feta tasted fine but looked unappealing on the plate, and the zukes were over-breaded and under-fried. The entrees were a disaster. My hubby wanted the lamb bbq special, and they were sold out at 7pm! He got a lamb loin instead, and it arrived as a grey mess in liquid. So gross. The rest of us ordered fish, I had the sea bass. All of the fish dishes were very overcooked and underseasoned. I'm a starving pregnant lady and craved fish that day so that sucked. The veggie side that came with the entrees was a mushy overcooked ratatouille. Maybe we ordered the wrong things and should have stuck with greek classics like moussaka or something. The server kept running away after asking us if we wanted something, so it took like three speedy visits for him to actually take our order even though we were ready. It was weird. I really don't get why the reviews are so good for this place.
