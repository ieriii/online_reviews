TOO MANY BRAZILIAN STEAK HOUSES! This neighborhood should be renamed to fit the fact that there are now 3 (maybe 4) of these types of eateries in a few block radius. I do a lot of business in this neighborhood and find that Brazzaz is a good lunch value. The salad bar is delicious, and complete, the meet should be served more medium then rare as it always is. I believe they need to do this not to waste any meat. Give it a shot for lunch keeping in mind dinner is over twice the price. Yes they do have a bigger salad bar and bring out more meat at night, but is it worth it? BTW, the deserts should not be overlooked.
