I have been here twice the past two saturdays and it is a great lunch/snack place. I had the chicken sandwich both times, once with the buffalo sauce and once with the seoul sassy sauce. The seoul sassy sauce is amazing and addicting. I want to get a bottle of it and pour it on everything. Nothing against the buffalo sandwich which was also very tasty, but the seoul is just great. Good atmosphere, the owner is nice. A very cool trendy little joint with great food. I plan on having many a lunch there.
