Geja's is a romantic place with live acoustic guitar resonating in a candlelit cave. Service was prompt and friendly. The ingredients were fresh and did not seem all that greasy after basically being fried in hot oil. Because the space is dark, it was hard to tell when the food was cooked (I ended up overcooking some items) and items that fell off the skewers were pretty much lost in the oil. The best part of the the meal was the myriad dipping sauces provided. For what I paid, I must say I have had tastier food. Good place for a date though.
