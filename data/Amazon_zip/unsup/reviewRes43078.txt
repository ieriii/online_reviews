This was amazing Deep Dish Chicago style pizza, Yummy! They have a good deal because their pizzas aren't loaded with cheese like Giordano's, but rich thick spicy sauce...I'm getting hungry just thinking about it. Remember deliveries over $20 come with a 2 liter bottle of soda, so make sure you specify or else they bring you the sodas they can't get rid of like Mountain Dew. We can't wait to order again...well we couldn't order tonight (Sunday) because they close at 10pm, so I guess we'll have to order somewhere else. :(
