In a word, disappointing. Shortly after we sat down, a group was seated at the table adjacent to us. One in the group had a cough that made you wonder about what disease he was carrying. We asked the waiters if we could move and their limited english, it seemed, was a challenge. They did not quite understand our request, or perhaps did not care. So, we enjoyed our meal next to another patron who sounded like he was coughing up a lung. We tried the recommended favorites from the reviews listed here: Tony's Chicken Three Chili and the Green Beans in a Black Bean Sauce appetizer. And, we each had a bowl of hot and sour soup. The only thing noteworthy was the tea. The soup was simply tangy broth with tofu, but it did arrive at our table quickly.  The green beans had grains of salt (or was that MSg?) making it terribly salty, and the chicken was fried chunks of chicken dust. It has been fried so long that there was virtually no chicken, only dough in every bite. Plus, the dish was so overpowered by sugar that I felt like I had eaten a bowl of Frosted Flakes. The final tab was insulting: $22 plus tip. Never again will we return to this restaurant. We left there and found a bakery selling BBQ pork buns just to eat something that had a bit more protein and was pleasant to our palates. I do not recommend this place, EVER!
