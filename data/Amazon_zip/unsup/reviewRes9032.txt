It doesn't even feel like I should be bothering to write a review but after two visits LC is now on my short list. It's not cheap but also not terribly expensive. Most of the dishes are $15 to $25 heavily weighed around the low $20s. Perhaps my favorite thing is that it's the only Asian restaurant I know of that also has a good bar and a decent wine list.  I think the whole 'French' Vietnamese thing just means 'really awesome' Vietnamese. Dishes are reasonably authentic but authenticity has nothing to do with the Viagra Triangle so walk away if you want $5 pho (baby pho is $7 actually). Both times I had curry dishes, once I had the veggie curry and the other time I had the jumbo shrimp with Japanese eggplant. I will be back for the Shrimp / eggplant mother mercy...
