While I'm not from Chicago, I visit atleast twice a month (long distance relationship) and Wilde is a staple when we're looking to have a good meal but not spend TOO much money. The atmosphere is incredible. I love the fireplaces and especially the library--unfortunatley it's always full when we arrive. In the summertime, the entire front of the restaurant opens up to the street! I've been for both brunch and dinner and let me tell you, the bloody mary is amazing! It has just the right amount of kick to it. Also, the mac n' cheese and the chicken pot pie are both extremely good. Definately worth going too...
