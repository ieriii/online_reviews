Great place for a nice, quick lunch. The sandwich are fairly large and you can add soup, salad, bread etc to it. I'm not the biggest fan of middle eastern food, but Sultan's is certainly very good. The atmosphere and ambiance is pleasant as well--maybe not a place for a date, but a quick lunch will certainly be welcomed here.
