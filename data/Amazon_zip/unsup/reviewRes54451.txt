The sweet potato fries are extremely addictive, and this place totally satisfies my burger craving with their veggie version - the Creole mustard you get with the burger is so good, I ask for a small container to take home! A great little place for vegetarians looking for some satisfying, yummy food in a friendly atmosphere...
