This place is a great place to hang out with friends and watch a game. I won't take a date here necessarily because the noise level is pretty high. The service is great! I tried the burgers and they were FANTASTIC. The ambiance was pretty crazy but it really depends on what time you go.I would go back with my buddies for some brews!
