Grand Lux is a restaurant I never get sick of. The menu is huge, the portions and you gotta love the location on Michigan avenue. I always always always tell everyone who is going there that they must order the asian nachos. I would not usually pick that off the menu but years ago someone told me to order them and I can tell you that they are to die for! The salads are big and I usually stick to the beet salad which is always great. I had to subtract one star because I hate the fact that you can't call ahead to make a reservation and you are usually stuck holding on to the pager for quite some time. So try to check it out some week night because it is not nearly as bad otherwise you will prob be looking at a 45-hour wait easily on the weekends. Also-be careful because every single time I go there I near fall on my way to the bathroom. The floors are very slick and slippery (usually you can notice majority of workers wearing ballet flats or something similar and I don't blame them!)
