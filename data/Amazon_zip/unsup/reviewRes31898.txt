I understand some people had a negative experience in this place, but it can happen at any place really. Just like having a bad hair day! I, a vegetarian not vegan, had a great brunch of scrambled eggs and home potatoes yesterday and today went for dinner with my NOT vegetarian husband who also enjoyed it. He said he didn't expect the taste but once he got used to it he liked the soup, the polenta we shared and I had a spicy 'chicken' burger (I couldn't eat the bread because it was too big). We had a mango raw pie for dessert, not bad. Overall it was really good food, not bland in my opinion, the place was full and the service was decent too. We paid $38 with tax which is not cheap but considering the amount and how organic/vegan food is always expensive anyway, I think it was ok.. Remember I went to Las Tablas and it was a rip off: I know what that food is worth, it's the typical food of Cuba, Venezuela and other Latin countries. Chigago Diner was not overpriced in my opinion but it wasn't a gift either. I'll be back. For sure.
