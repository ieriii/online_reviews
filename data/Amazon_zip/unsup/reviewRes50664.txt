I enjoy this place. There is always a crowd on the weekends but the wait is never that long. It is very similar to other popular break fest places, except that it has some delicious southern dishes. I very much enjoy the shrimp and grits. I order it every time. My friends enjoy the array of egg dishes but what is most enjoyable is the large selection of beverages they offer. (Both alcoholic and non). If you do visit this place be sure to come hungry because the portions are huge oh and have a biscuit, they are great.
