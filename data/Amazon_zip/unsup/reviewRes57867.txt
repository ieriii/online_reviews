This was our first experience with Ethiopian food and what an amazing experience it was. The service was very friendly and fast for a Friday night, especially since every table was taken. The food was just amazing. Perfectly spiced with lots of flavor. We would recommend this restaurant to anyone and we sure will try to get back there,
