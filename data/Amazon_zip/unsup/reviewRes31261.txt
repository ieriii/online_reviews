When I hear about Vegan/Vegetarian places to eat, my first thought is "anywhere else but..." I was introduced to Chicago Diner a few months ago and have gone back a few times since then.  Even if you are not vegan/vegetarian, you will definately find something on the FULL menu to enjoy. I've had the gyro a few times and it is delicious and filling. Some garden burgers, I don't care for. But, they have an excellent garden burger.  My favorite item there is the blackened tofu. I had a bite of it from the person I went there with and was hoping she wouldn't eat all of it because I liked it better than what I had (Luckily for me she only ate half of it and gave me the rest!). That's what I have ordered the last 2 times I picked up dinner from there.  They do have a beer selection there, which they make a note if it is vegan friendly or not. Great place to go, service is great. Even meat eaters will appreciate this place!
