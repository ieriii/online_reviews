A nice boutique hotel in the heart of the city. Location can't be beat, views from almost every room are great, and the staff really make the place come to life. Everyone from the doorman to the housekeeper was friendly, smiling, and seemed genuinely happy to serve you. I can't talk about the cost, because our room was paid for as part of a wedding party we were attending (thanks, E!), and yes, valet parking is the standard downtown $45-50/day. So if you're stuck with driving, you'll pay the price. Our room was definitely larger than expected, well-appointed (though my wife thought it was a little dark -- more lamps needed?), and comfortable. There was a large medical convention group staying there that weekend as well, but despite the hotel being full, our room was always very quiet. The bathroom was also quite large, but the tub/shower looked like it had seen better days, with the chrome tarnishing and some of the grout starting to flake. The adjustable shower head was also no longer adjustable. In spite of these small missteps, we loved being able to walk everywhere in the loop, and we loved the cheerfulness of the front desk folks every time we returned for the night. It felt like our personal urban oasis.
