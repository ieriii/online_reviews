Pretty much exactly what I wanted out of it. We arrived at 1045 with a line that went down the block, and didn't leave until 1245, so keep in mind that the wait really is that long. I had two hot dogs, and an order of duck fat fries. The foie gras dog was very good, but I wasn't a fan of the way the foie gras was prepared. However, the duck sausage and the truffle aioli was unbelievable. I definitely don't regret ordering it. My second dog was the Ale and Chipotle Buffalo Sausage with Bacon-Garlic Mayonnaise and Maple-Smoked Cheddar Cheese. I honestly cannot think of anything that I've eaten in recent memory that tasted better than this hot dog, and I am not exaggerating at all. The duck fat fries were very good as well, and 1 order is large enough to share with 1 or maybe even 2 other people. I will definitely go back, but will wear a warmer coat during the winter to make sure I don't catch a cold while waiting in line.
