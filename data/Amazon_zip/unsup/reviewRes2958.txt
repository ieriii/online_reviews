Perfect service, wonderful atmosphere including stunning artwork on the walls. The staff was so informed and helpful and took the time to give you of the best dining experience you could have. The cheese cart was awesome too. It's expensive but worth it! If I only went to one restaurant in Chicago - this would be it. It's pricy but worth every penny.
