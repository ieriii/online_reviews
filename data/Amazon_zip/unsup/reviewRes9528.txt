I went with my family to Sprout in celebration of my Graduate school graduation and was thoroughly impressed. The food was amazing. It was refined, yet approachable. The flavors were spot on, everything was delicious and everyone in my party of 6 enjoyed each and every dish. Portion sizes were perfect and we were pleasantly filled by the end of the 3 course meal. The intermezzos were also delicious and left you wanting more!  The staff was extremely accommodating to my quirky family's special needs. They were professional yet had a sense of humor and were very flexible and attentive to our needs. They were also very well versed in all of the items on the menu and took the time to educate us on each dish. The atmosphere was really great - love the high ceilings and the overall decor and feel of the restaurant. It made for a really pleasant dining experience. Only two complaints were more front of house issues - the coffee served to my dad with his dessert was cold, but it was quickly and very apologetically replaced. Earlier in the meal they also forgot his drink order... However, these slight mistakes did not hinder the experience at all, and I stand by the five stars I give to them because the food was excellent and the staff was pleasant. Overall I highly recommend Sprout. It was worth every penny and I will definitely go back in the future for other special occasions.
