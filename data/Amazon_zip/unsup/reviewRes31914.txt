UGH! This place just keeps getting worse... Normally my biggest complaint about Demera is their poor service. This time the service was actually okay---but still not good. Now I have something even worse to add... THEIR FOOD IS HORRIBLE. Yeah, you heard me right. I've NEVER come across an Ethiopian restaurant with just horrid food---but WOW. I'm vegan, so I ordered the vegetarian tray with Kik Alicha (seasoned yellow lentils), Shiro (powdered chickpeas with berbere sauce), and Shimbera Assa Wat (chickpea dumplings with berbere sauce). I've had these same dishes at multiple Ethiopian establishments including this one, so I didn't expect anything less than awesome. WRONG. My Kik Alicha & Shiro were flavorless, and my Shimbera Assa tasted like-----well Charlie Sheen's face. I couldn't even finish, it tasted so much like a combination between road kill and feet! GAH! I've definitely also had at least two other friends go here in the past month and say they hated it... *Martin voice* "Damn, Damn, DAAAAAAAAMN!"
