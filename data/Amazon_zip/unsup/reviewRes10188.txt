My girlfriend and I went for dinner in April. We were able to get a reservation the night before online through OpenTable. The food was delicious, and the flavors were good. However the portions were too small for me; even with the bread basket, calamari and dessert I was not full, but it was enough for her. Our waiter was fun and friendly, but the service was otherwise normal. Price range as expected. I had the Ravoli Piccolo Sogno, which I found rather tasty but small. She had strachi?? which I thought tasted even better.
