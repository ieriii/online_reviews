My absolute favorite lunch, brunch, breakfast cafe in the city. With a long list of unique sandwich choices that make it difficult for me to decide or breakfast egg dishes if I am feeling that- exactly what i expect for a weekend brunch cozy, moderately priced, in and out, incredible pastries- specifically the carrot cake. I recommend the grilled chicken and bacon sandwich for that right kind of full. All of the breakfast options are great. I just think its perfect. Unfortunately I do not live walking distance to Milk and Honey but want to move closer so I can go more often.
