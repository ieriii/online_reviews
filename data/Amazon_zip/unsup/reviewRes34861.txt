Not sure I can add much to the great reviews already posted.Somehow in the course of trying to find a place to eat down on North Ave/ Milwaukee area I missed this place. To think I could have been having delicious shawarma, and falafel but instead I had potbelly's yet again(not that there's anything wrong with that). This is some great middle eastern fare in a pretty cool setting. The decor is great and I love the tiny booths tucked away on the side. Have not tried it but the cold bar looks pretty good and well stocked, plenty of choices. The menu is fairly extensive and the variations available are great. Lots f little side snacks and a selection of random beverages up front give a nice variety to your standard coke/pepsi fountain you see at a lot of places. The food is great I have not tried that much but everything I have has been great. Best of all of course the prices are on the cheap.
