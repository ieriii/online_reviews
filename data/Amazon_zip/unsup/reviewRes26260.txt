We went here with 4 other friends, based on reviews from Yelp and other friends. Pros: Location (on Michigan Ave.), outdoor seating, nice upbeat ambience. The food was good - some dishes better than others. Try the mango sorbet - it has a spicy kick that I've never tasted before. Cons: overpriced. The portions are small, and the prices are inflated - even for a tapas place. Service was okay - they're busy, and the waiters seem to have their attention diverted. And, we were constantly rushed. The waiter even took my bill before I had placed my credit card inside the holder! Talk about hints. Overall: The place was 'meh, I've experienced better'. Worth trying, but not going back.
