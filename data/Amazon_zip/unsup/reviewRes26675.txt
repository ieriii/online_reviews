It almost feels like a waste for me to add another review of this place... I would list all the same delicious things as everybody else who enjoys it, the crust above all else. I love that they deliver (even though it's much tastier in the restaurant than after riding in a box for 20 or 30 minutes) and that they'll do half toppings, so I can split an enormous small with a meat eating friend. I think I could eat pizza every day and not get get tired of it, and if I ever were to undertake such an endeavor, Pequod's would definitely contribute.
