Meh. I came here on a Sunday night on some low key stuff. My boy wanted some drinks and wings, and I just wanted some drinks. The place was definitely not packed, which was great, and we sat outside on their patio. Great patio right on Division. They had a collect-a-cup deal going on w/ big plastic cups, so I got a cherry limeade cocktail, which didn't have nearly enough vodka in it. And it was $10. And I had 2 of them and I was barely pushing tipsy. Beers in the same cup are $8, which seems like a better deal. At least I got 3 cups out of it? The food was also mediocre. We got boneless wings, cheese fries, and a chicken caesar salad. The cheese fries were the best part, as the portion was HUGE and the fries were waffle fries...THE best. Also, it wasn't that cheap ass, plastic-y nacho cheese, it was real cheese! The boneless wings definitely left something to be desired...they were kinda dry and tasteless. The chicken caesar salad was ALRIGHT at best, which I guess is what you get when you order a salad from a bar. Overall, this place was not the greatest. The service was pretty good, and the patio was really nice. However, the food was mediocre, the drinks overpriced, and the ambiance was ruined when 4 douche bags in tight t-shirts and overpowering cologne sat down at the table next to us. Boo. I would come back here, but probably for drinks only on a night they have some specials.
