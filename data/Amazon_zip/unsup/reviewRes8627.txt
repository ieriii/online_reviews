Spacca is one of Chicago's best pizza's. This pizza truly takes inspiration directly from Italia. Chicago is known for it's deep dish but I truly enjoy the thin crust pizza. This crust is judicious and thin and helps to deliver the lovely fresh basil. The basil leaves are few but strategically placed. My pizza had mushrooms and sausage and I could have eaten two. The salad I started with was a transport back to Tuscany. The food and service were even and well delivered. I look forward to going back to this restaurant to enjoy another pizza.
