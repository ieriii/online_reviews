There is something just a little off about Sunda. Kind of like your neighbor who you secretly believe to be a serial killer, or the guy who may or may not have recently had a nose job. In Sunda's case, I can't put my finger on exactly what it is. It may have to do with how you can't tell where the bar ends and dining tables begin. Or maybe it's the cooky mirrored effect in the back. It all adds up to it not quite delivering on the club-esque, Sushi Samba affect it's looking for. The crowd is the same as Underground. But instead of observing them in their cave at 2am, you now get the treat of seeing them in Sunda's sobering light. And it is here where their unpretty secrets are exposed, which I'll reveal in a modern 4-4-7 rhyming haiku: Orange fake bakes Bronze makeup cakes All inducing double takes I know, I know, it's apparent why I'm a poet laureate. And I didn't even mention the steroid bodies and ladies of the night in red (no, not talking about me). All that aside, it's a good dining experience. The service was surprisingly attentive. And the sushi is pretty solid. Though they push some of the other specialties, they don't quite stack up to the chef's earlier days at Koi.
