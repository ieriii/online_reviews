It is torture for me to write this review because my mouth is watering from thinking about Icosium Kafe's food! It would almost turn me vegetarian! I love sweet and savory food, which is exactly what Icosium Kafe offers through its menu of crepes and salads. I ordered the Crepe Marrakesh (toasted Almonds, Raisins, baby Spinach, caramelized onions, fresh mint, cream cheese, Sun dried tomatoes, olive tapenade) and had to pace myself from devouring it in a few minutes. The crepe was light, the ingredients were healthy and organic, and the tastes came together beautifully in a sweet and savory harmony that even had my friend proclaiming "Wow." My friend had the Crepa Iberica (Home made Olive Tapenade, fresh Roma tomatoes, pistachios, fresh pineapple, Organic Mix Green, Ricotta cheese, Fresh Cilantro, Scallions) which wasn't as tasty as the Marrakesh because the ends were spinach heavy, and the center had all of the pineapple. Prior to our entrees, we each had the lamb stew that was more soup than stew, and with barely any lamb, but it was still delicious. I recommend putting lemon juice and all of the mint they give you into the stew. With tax and tip, our entrees were $13. Not bad! The ambiance is relaxing and ethnic, where the seat cushions match the tapestries on the wall and in the ceiling panels. The servers are nice and will coax you into getting dessert, but note that your crepes come with some orange slices, a piece of cantaloupe and a sliced strawberry. I will be back to try the other crepes with fig jam and dates, and the Algerian tea with honey.
