Piece is a great find in the Wicker Park area. I went there on a Friday night, and after not being able to find parking for 20 minutes (I know, shocker), we did the valet service, which was cool cuz then the car was parked right out front when we were done with dinner. The place is outfitted with flat screens all around, a huge bar, an open seating plan, and fairly loud music. It reminds me more of a club than a restaurant--but obviously one goes there for the food. The service was a little on the slow side, but not bad considering how busy they were. People were waiting up to 45 minutes for tables. The pizza was awesome; and so was the bruschetta and goat cheese appetizer. Actually, I think Piece nailed the New York-style pizza better than most New York places I went to! I would definitely come back here; though maybe on a weeknight, as i couldn't hear myself think in there.
