By far my favorite Mexican restaurant in Chicago. All right, so I haven't tried THAT many Mexican restaurants, but it's because I went here for the first time last winter, fell in love & never looked back. Why risk eating at a shitty place when I know I'll be satisfied every time I eat at Mayan Palace? There isn't anything on this menu that I don't like. I have been going here at least twice per month (typically three) since May and have tried a bunch of stuff on the menu. I highly recommend the queso fundido appetizer, Mayan enchiladas entree or Quesadilla Supreme entree with chorizo. My boyfriend loves the Burrito Suizo and our friends enjoy the chicken fajitas. Go on Tuesdays or Thursdays for half price margaritas. Pitchers are $20, but the first pitcher always comes with full glasses for everyone in your party, so you're really getting a value for your dollar. In the summer you'll probably have a wait for a table if you go between 7 and 9, but it's worth it and I've never had to wait more than 30 minutes (usually it's around 20). Also, make sure you get Berto as your server. He is my FAVORITE.
