I have a special place in my heart for Belgium, even though I've never been there.  I imagine a magical land synergistically merging the best of France, Germany and the Netherlands...a people who possess French joie de vivre, the German love of beer and Dutch individuality without any of the Gaullic pretension or Saxon stoicism.  At least that's what I think of when I hold a frite in my hand.
