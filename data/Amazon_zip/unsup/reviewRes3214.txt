Usually packed and the only drawback is that it's a small operation. Regardless, their Korean fried chicken, sauced with my two favorites Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ, easily beats fast-food franchises like KFC or Popeyes. Word to the wise if you get their burrito, expect it to be one BIG and packed burrito that you'll have to finish. I also plan on trying their Buddha bowls that everyone has mentioned. I would also suggest their onion rings as a side,especially if you take advantage of their $20 walk-in value deal (2 Half Chickens, I believe, 2 sides and 2 drinks).
