Oh Frontera and Rick Bayless, you are the reason we flew all the way to Chicago and you made it all worthwhile. So glad I made reservations a month ahead. All I could get was 9pm on a wednesday, so I nabbed it. We arrived a half hour early and they seated us immediately. The highlights were the fresh guacamole with sun dried tomatoes and the fresh dry packed scallops ceviche and the cochinita pibil on a banana leaf. Oh the dessert was yummy too, sour cream ice cream and toasted peanuts with dark rum drizzled with goat milk caramel. I never thought Mexican could be fine dining. Rick, you proved me wrong! Oops they were going to serve us our entrees which we were still eating apps. So the server turned around quickly. But I noticed later that our dishes were warm and sitiing on the counter for a while. Beans were mushy. My husband was impressed that the waiter was able to get him a beer that he was eyeing at the next table. They did not have any more at the restaurant so they went next door to their sister restaurant Xoco to get it. Yipes! The Baudelaire IO from Jolly Pumpkin was not cheap at 25 bucks! (but it was cheaper than Publican which was $36!) it was a rare brew and was delicious. Pricy but very fresh foods. Can we see your rooftop garden next time?
