This place is as good as it gets for what they are; a cocktail bar with talented staff. The secret theme was really fun. We literally walked past the entrance 2-3 times before noticing the door handle in what looks somewhat like a boarded up store front. We LOLed. Then I walk in and was in complete darkness. Only reaching my hand in front of me because I thought I had seen another door before the one behind me closed. It was a curtain. A very heavy dark velvet curtain. Once on the other side the rooms were dim and separated with more velvet. The speakeasy theme was working well. There is no signage for the restrooms and they are down a hallway with doors that look like you are walking into someones home. It was a Sunday and we got right in at the bar. It was just what I was hoping for. Our Mixologist was friendly, well-spoken with a Chicago accent, nicely dressed and very knowledgeable. The bottles, the droppers, the tools, the movements and history were quite entertaining while we waited for our drinks. What did I have?... HELL, I can't recall. Our bill was quite hefty and we had not gotten dinner yet. LOL. I always have my mixologist make me their favorite whiskey cocktail and discuss beer cocktails until one sounds right for me. I can see why locals will pass on this place unless they have a fascination with the art of mixology.
