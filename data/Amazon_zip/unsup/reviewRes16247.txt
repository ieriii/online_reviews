This lively and festive place hits the spot whether you are dining as two, a group, or as a family.  I give two thumbs up to the skirt steak entree which is a level above what you encounter in most latin or mexican restaurants. Expertly cooked, and presentation is superb. But the real attraction for us was the service and the appetizers that are amazing, and for the two girls in my life, they typically like to make meals of appetizers or small plates. This place fits the bill for that type of dining nicely. Perhpas the best guacamole we have ever had, and we are not easily impressed. It was chunky, flavorable, fresh, and well but not overly flavored.  Highly recommend any of the ceviche, their spin on chicken empanadas, and their variation appetizer constructed of short ribs and plantains with a chile glaze of sorts. Each was as strong or better than the previous and there were no disappointments with any of the selections. Service is strong, and although we dined at 5:30 pm on a weeknight, we were well surrounded by other "early" diners. Clearly this is a place that fills up later, especially with their wonderful wine list, outstanding mixology offerings that favor festive latin beverages, and weekly salsa dancing. Highly recommend it if you have not been, and if you have been and it was long ago, recommend you give it another visit. We can't wait until our next!
