Ruth's Chris is a typical "generic," Chicago steakhouse as far as atmosphere goes. The wait-staff is always attentive, and the food is always great. If you like lobster bisque, this might be some of the best in the city. I'm a fan of filet, and they do it well at Ruth's Chris. The sides are also great, like the shoestring fries, or the garlic mashed potatoes. If you like getting your steak spitting hot butter at you, this is your place. There is no better first bite of steak in the city.
