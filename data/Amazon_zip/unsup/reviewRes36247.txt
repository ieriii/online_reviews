It's about time for an update!  Since my first Meli trip, which was on a warm, sunny weekend day, I've returned many times. Coming for a weekday lunch makes it easy to avoid the horrible brunch waits. Meli is an excellent place to come for office birthdays (on the boss' dime of course) but I'll even throw down some of my own change on occasion. The chicken pesto panini is still my favorite, but I've recently discovered the housemade crisps, and their juice. I like to call it science juice. Their fresh pressed apple juice is just as tasty as Nana's, but cheaper. I also tasted a couple of other concoctions. I recommend the apple, carrot, celery. Crazy? The color of Carrot Top's curly locks? Yes and yes, but it will increase your night vision. We all need increased night vision.
