Everything..... mean EVERYTHING is wonderful - the moment you stepped in the door of Sunda to time you leave! Servers and people are very warm and welcoming! The food is to "die" for and to top it off - affordable/reasonable for restaurants found in Down Town Chicago. I would highly suggest for the appetizer - Kobe beef on top of crunchy rice; for the main course - adobo and for dessert - Taro pudding (!!!!!)
