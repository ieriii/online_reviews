the age old question: is the staff at milk and honey so rude because the customers are jerks, or are the clientele jerks in response to the rudeness of the staff? i had taken a long hiatus from this place, having witnessed an altercation between staff and customer nearly every time i ate there. i am pretty easy to please, and keep my special requests to a minimum, so i never had a run-in, but you could cut the passive-aggressive tension with a knife. i caved and brought two out-of-town friends here for brunch/lunch today, and had just finished explaining to them that the food is great, but it's hard to enjoy because the staff there go out of their way to be rude. no sooner spoken, i got into an argument with one of their employees, the substance of which was so banal, it was mind-boggling we were even arguing over it. i actually raised my voice at her because i felt she was never going to stop arguing otherwise. it was an altogether unpleasant eating experience that not even their fantastic huevos rancheros could save.  i guess i have to conclude that the staff (and management) spends so much time making rules and saying no to special requests that the customers just want to feel like they have some control over their experience. so it turns ugly. and i turned into that ugly jerk customer no one wants to be around. i don't want to be treated the way i was treated, nor feel compelled to act the way i acted, so i think i'll just have to let the yummy food be enjoyed by others who can stand the bad vibes that permeate the place. the one exception was the very nice hostess. i hope that job works out for her, but i have a feeling she's just too nice to stick around.
