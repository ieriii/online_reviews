I cannot understand how, in my 26 years of existence on Chicago's northside, I have never stepped foot in this place. I must have passed this restaurant a million times while driving down Berwyn. It never caught my attention nor did it conjur up any curiousity......until..... I yelped!!!  I was reading the many reviews and when I went to check out the location, I was surprised. "Hmmm," I thought, "is this actually the restaurant on the corner that I pass literally almost everyday of the week?" It was, and immediately San Soo Gab San was on my list of "must eat" restaurants. I went there this past weekend and was elated. It was a nice, clean place and very orange. I thought it was so cool how they have those areas where you can actually sit on the floor...sounds like an idea for my next birthday get-together! My bf and I were too lazy to grill, so I just ordered a bulkoki and he ordered the spicy shredded beef soup. When my bf had questions about the soups, the waitress bluntly said that those certain soups are liked more by Koreans, so she pushed him towards the more American likings. It was funny. Anyways, when the food arrived, I received my soup, rice, bulkoki, and 15 sides while my bf got his steaming spicy soup. Everything was delicious!!! Loved the sides, loved the soups, loved the meat!!! Man, I will definitely be frequenting this restaurant more and bringing everyone I know to try it out. The next time I go, I'll definitely be doing the BBQ.
