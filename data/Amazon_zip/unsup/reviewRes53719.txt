i am not sure what kyung was talking about. no chicken will compare to the standard from korea. NYC /LA is not the best either. not sure where she gets this information. ignorance is defintely a bliss, for closed mind folks. enjoy!! and im glad that crisp is finally in the lakeview area. travel to chicago for work from nyc and it's nice to stop by.
