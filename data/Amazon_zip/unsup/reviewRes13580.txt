This place is awesome. I saw this place on "diner's drive-ins, and dives" and had to check it out. (you can youtube the place for the clip). The cornbread stuffing and catfish with the spicy hollandaise was my favorite thing thus far. I've been back a couple times with my lady and my family. We have never had a bad thing. My only recommendation is to go early or late as it can get busy and there is nowhere to wait for a table. Highly recommended.
