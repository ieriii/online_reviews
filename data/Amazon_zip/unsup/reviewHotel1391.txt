While I've never stayed at this hotel, as the former chair of my grad program's Winter Formal Planning Committee, I spent my fair share of time at the venue itself and interacting with the event planning staff. Throughout the planning process, they were very willing to work with us to keep the event within our budget. They also ensured that everything ran smoothly on the day of the event, from allowing our committee to show up early to do some setting up, to being ready to go with both the coat check and the bar. They were very accommodating of our large, at and times rowdy, group. Everyone loved the light up dance floor. And everyone in attendance had a good time.
