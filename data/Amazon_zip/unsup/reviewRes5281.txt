I'm making this my first Yelp review, as by far, The Purple Pig is one of my favorite restaurants in all of the US. I'm from the NYC area and I travel quite frequently to Chicago for work - hands down, this is the best restaurant in Chicago and is worth the wait for a table or seat at the bar (however long that might be!). I've been to the pig twice, once with a friend and dined outside in the heated tent and once by myself, and dined at the bar. Both times, service was phenomenal, recommendations were on point, and food superb. The wine list is spectacular, and if you are unfamiliar with wines, ask the bartender or your server... I've heard them recommending wines and explaining them in details to other guests, something most bartenders cannot do with such an extensive list. A few of my favorite dishes: -Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg (someone tell me what makes this dish SO damn good?!) -Deviled Egg with Arugula & Caper Berries (If you are dining with someone else make sure you order two orders, comes with just one egg, and you will definitely want your own!) -Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs Smear (Best bone marrow I've had anywhere) -Eggplant Caponata with Goat Cheese Smear (Eggplant and goat cheese... you can't go wrong) -Pork Neck Bone Gravy with Ricotta Smear (Just as good as my mom's neck bone gravy, which is pretty hard to beat) -"JLT" with Fried Hen Egg & Lemon Aioli (throw a hen egg on anything and it's gotta be good!) -And I've saved the best for last... DESSERT! I refuse to ever order anything other than the Sicilian Iris here. It's like a giant zeppole with cannoli cream inside... and remarkably, just as fantastic as the first time I tried it at Siciliainbocca in Rome. No one else has come close to their recipe, and the Purple Pig has mastered it! Again, worth the wait. One of the very few places that I can say I will wait without a reservation!
