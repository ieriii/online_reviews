I've been to Nuevo Leon many many times. My rating for food is 'OK'. Most dishes are ok, food here is not gourmet. stick with basics - tacos, tortas, and gizados. Usually dishes with seafood that I've ordered are dry or left over it seemed.Gizado de puerco is the best if you're a pork eater. I wish they did their chicken enchiladas with diced sauted chicken rather than pulled-chicken since pulled chicken there is usually very very very dry and then they use a lot of it.The place could be sized down - remove a couple of tables - most of the times when you sit on tables with individual chairs you're right up against somebody and people are walking right in your face and food when it's really busy.Also don't ever peek into kitchen area.....I'll leave it at that. The waiting staff is usually friendly the people at the register are not. The no credit card thing is very inconvenient - but they do have a cash machine inside - use at your own risk....I usually bring my out of town family and friends here and they seem to like it too. Somebody posted a comment about a dead cockroach in their chips - good thing you caught it.....The place looks generally 'messy' in the dinning area - I expect the kitchen area to be a disaster. They do have a good certificate of inspection passing grade, so...I will continue to frequent this place especially since they have a free parking lot 1 block away and food continues to be ok.
