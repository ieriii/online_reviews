I've wanted to stop into this place for several months now after seeing it on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives on the Food Network. And it's literally a five-minute walk from my place. So with some pleasant company we slipped into Glenn's for an early lunch and had a good experience. The menu is fairly typical diner fare but the seafood is what sets this place apart. I had to pass on the breakfast and go for a seafood dish. I enjoyed the lobster roll which was packed will flavor and a decent portion as well. It was accompanied with cole-slaw and a pickle which was devoured up pretty quickly. My accomplice had a breakfast dish but I'll leave that review to her. One cool thing I noticed is 30 different cereals they had to offer for breakfast - but at 4 bucks a pop I'm going to have to pass. Sorry that's a bit steep when I can get a full box for the same price! I'm giving 4 stars because the prices were a bit high - even for breakfast items. I understand seafood prices being up there in the Midwest but some of the items were straight up sticker shock! The atmosphere & service was great so I can't sell them short on that aspect! Overall: If you're in the hood stop by - or even make a quick ride to the Montrose stop on the Brown Line - you won't be disappointed!
