Just had an iced tea and a spinach feta croissant, which was rather delicious. The room next door to the cafe with couches and tables reminds me of a place I'd hang out in, if I was still in undergrad. That's not to say it's not cool or anything - I am rather fond of those days - but half of the power outlets don't work and I'm not sure when anything was last cleaned. Overall pretty groovy, but on a Monday afternoon, I think the clientele would chase me out of here if I sat with a friend and tried to have a conversation. Meaning it works for the quiet book reader or the cool chick with a Mac but not so much for soulful chats or conference calls (I must sign off now to walk to the rental car where I can gab without disturbing anyone else).
