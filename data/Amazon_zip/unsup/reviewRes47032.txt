My in-laws took us here and I didn't want to complain because it was very nice of them to do so but they probably don't read Yelp so: I thought it was really weird how I ordered the fruit with yogurt and granola...a bonafied, full-fledged entree on the breakfast menu and the waiter just brought me plain fruit and then acted like I was trying to scam him when I politely asked why there wasn't any yogurt or granola included. I know organic food is expensive but it just came off as really stingy.
