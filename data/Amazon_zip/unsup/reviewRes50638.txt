We loved our meal! The service was excellent too. Three friends met here and we wanted a sweet wine. The server said they did not have a zinfandel or muscato and recommended a drink that taste even better. We had the fried mushrooms and grits, shrimps, asparagus, and fried okra. Everything was excellent and not greasy. The cornbread they give you is the best I have ever tasted. The restaurant was a very good choice. The only thing my friends noted is that the decor looked Asian, not Southern.
