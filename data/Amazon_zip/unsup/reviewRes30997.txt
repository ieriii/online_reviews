Out of this world good. Arguably the best beef in this town. Sure you could make a case for Morton's or Gibson's but this place is absolutely on par with them. AND they have this gargantuan double porterhouse that just screams out to your rapacious genetic programming demanding it's consumption. It's 48oz (that's 3 pounds folks) and they pre-cut it for you. Good thing, too as you would seriously exhaust your arms trying to carve up the entire thing yourself. I killed it! I killed the sides, had a few beers and even hit the appetizer at the beginning. I didn't need to eat for the following two days. I felt like a caveman. True story. Also, the bone-in Kansas city is probably the best tasting hunk of cow to ever cross my palette. That place in Wicker park called Feast needs to change it's name.
