India House. Definitely hands down one of my favorite Indian restaurants anywhere! I've been here for both the lunch buffet and for dinner. It's really nice and has an upscale kind of feel to it, however you can wear jeans and T shirt and fit in just fine. I came here for dinner with a friend it was about $30 per person including tip. We had Lamb samosas which were really good, an eggplant dish, and a spicy lamb stew. The service was good and attentive. All of the food is very good. Albeit, it's a little more expensive for Indian food than most people are used to paying, but the ambience, quality of food, are well worth it! Go w/ friends for lunch and go for a date for dinner!
