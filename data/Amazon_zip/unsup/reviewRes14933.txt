Want a perfect evening with some real close friends or your lover-- check out Sabatino's... it has the mood and much much more. Also, be sure that you come with plenty of cash because before you know it you're ordering full course meals with wine, and then some. But seroiusly, whatever it costs it has been totally worth it. My fiance and I have been there on 3 seperate occasions and each of them have been just as good as the last. In fact, for couples you can request (if you make a reservation) a closed off booth (which they have a couple of) and it really adds to the privacy and mood to the whole experience. If you love Italian, and want to treat your loved one or family to a really really nice dinner than go to Sabatino's right now.
