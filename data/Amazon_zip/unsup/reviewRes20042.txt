Well I've been here a number of times and eating in isn't too bad. The atmosphere warm and the wait staff has been nice (although they did charge for a dessert even though it was my friends birthday. Kind of cheesy). The best part is the BYOB. However I feel like they get away with hiking up the price for mediocre fish because of it. Also the wait is OUTRAGEOUSLY long even if you have a reservation. It is walking distance though so I can't say i won't be back. I ordered take out and found that the fish was actually worse than I remembered. It was actually kind of mushy...eeeewwww... Hopefully just a bad day for fish in general.  So next time I will probably order Sushi Wabi and have my own BYOB in my living room.
