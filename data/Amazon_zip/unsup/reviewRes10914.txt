Worst. Service. I've. Ever. Had. I carried out a pizza from here, and found the staff to just be rude and unhelpful. I ordered it in person and planned to have a beer cocktail or two while I waited. The person at the counter kept making me wait while she took orders over the phone- I thought she could have put them on hold so I could finish- after all, I got up off my ass to order. Anyway, when my friend and I sat at a table to get those beers, the waitress told us she wouldn't serve us unless we were ordering food. The fact that I was waiting for a pizza for carry out made no difference. The bar area was full and crowded and I didn't feel up to standing. So, instead of selling me beer and earning a tip, I bought nothing other than my pizza, which, when I came back to pick it up, was flat, tasteless, and just way too salty. Another friend convinced me to go back for his friend's birthday party. Granted, we had a big group and I realize that's tough on a waiter, but ours was just really a jerk. He'd be away from the table for 20 minutes at a time and just never bothered to bring the water that several people asked for. He got pissy when a chair was borrowed from another table. The icing on the cake was when my friend left a stack of coins with the bill in order to cover exact change. The waiter had the gall to tell him that my friend needed to count that out and tell him exactly how much was there because it wasn't his job to sit there and count change. The pizza was much better this time around and their beers were fine, but I see absolutely no reason whatsoever to give this place a third try. Sorry for the long review, but this place really buttered my biscuits.
