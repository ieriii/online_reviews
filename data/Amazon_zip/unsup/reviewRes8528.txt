This place is great! Great service, great pizza, great neighborhood feel... Let me first say my husband and I didn't get to fully enjoy SN. We came on a Friday during Lent, so no meat! :( But despite the fact that we ordered 2 types of mushroom pizza it was still tasty. The pizza is delightfully chewy. I also was quite surprised that while we were waiting the owner (I think) came by with a black truffle pizza offering a slice to everyone waiting. Nice touch.
