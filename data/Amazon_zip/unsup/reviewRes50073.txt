In general side by side with any average restaurant this is probably 4 stars, but side by side South American restaurants that I have been to it is more like 2 stars. Food was good as was service. The atmosphere was pretty cool and unique. But I'd rather go to Tango Sur or Carnivale. For that reason I won't be back unless a group of my friends are already going. Good food but nothing special.
