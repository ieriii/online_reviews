Sassy, Holler back girl..... You delicious!.... Can I get cho digits? Wait, I forgot, you don't have any. You're just delicious chicken wings! Sassy must be the new word on the block! Sassy Eggs at Over Easy Seoul Sassy at Crisp Next would be Italian Sassy at (___Sassy R'us___) It's Sassy Craze- Mania! As you can tell, I got the sassy wings from Crisp. Nice big crispy chicken wings with a soy garlicy glaze. The BBQ was quite different that I'm used to. It was quite spicy and it reminded me of this Korean Paste that Koreans use on all their food. Cannot put my finger on it. But the Sassy wings definitely hit the spot. You can also order a side of rice if you like rice with your meat. I guess it's an Asian thing. The Buddha bowls were also a hit with me. It was basically bim bim bap with a different name and a little more franchised. This place reminded me of a korean Chipotle. I wouldn't be surprised if this place expands and take it to the streets of Chicago. The Buddha Bowl hit my korean spot , if I had a spot that was korean. I opted for the small Buddha bowl because I had an order of humungous chicken wings. Yes, I overindulged. Oh, well...... I'll give gluttony a new name..... Amy L. There is also 3 long wooden tables that serves as a dining area for all it's customers. So take a seat next to some strangers and dig in. Don't be shy, grab some paper towels on the table and get to work. Like someone else said, you can always peer at someone else's meal before you order. Always a good way to make a decision! All in all, I will return Crispy to devour some more Bim Bim Bop and some crispy wings. But Whomp Whomp, I didn't get Sassy's Digits.... "She gave me the finger"
