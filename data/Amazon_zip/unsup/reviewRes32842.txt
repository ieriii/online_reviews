I dined here for the first time a couple Friday nights ago. Typically I would not order brussel sprout or duck salads and we ended up getting both. They were delicious! The brussel sprout salad had some fried goodness in it that made the dish. I would rate their sushi as above average, but not the most amazing I've had in the city. Sunda is definitely worth visiting even for a cocktail and checking out the decor.
