Loved it, totally loved it. I give Crisp a 4.5. Christina P and I went on a Friday night not really knowing what to expect. I know nothing about Korean dishes really so not sure what to rate this against but we both had the Baby Buddha Bowl- asked for brown rice and added beef due to the cashier's reco saying "it's really F*%ing good." Ok sold. Next time definitely want to try the fried chicken.
