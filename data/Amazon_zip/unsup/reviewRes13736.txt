Holy crap. We love 90 Miles.  The first time I tried this place I did all the specials and had a fantastic experience. The appetizer special was a coconut shrimp with a dipping sauce. My husband and I randomly still talk about eating this dish. "Remember that coconut shrimp at 90 miles?" "Oh man, I could have just drank that sauce." We have this conversation on a regular basis. I also had a pork shank for the first time. Where has that been all my life? It was tender and falling off the bone. Served with spinach and sweet potatoes. Very flavorful. The calamari with marinara was tasty and I really want to try the Cubano sandwich. I love the lounge place they have for you to wait. It's cozy and intimate. You can actually have a conversation and start your night as opposed to standing around and waiting outside.
