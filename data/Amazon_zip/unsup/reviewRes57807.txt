Wife and I were the 2nd customers as they just opened this morning.  First impression is very good. Quite daring to be opening an organic restaurant in Bridgeport but this place might fly if highly successful Chinese eclectic Han 202 is any indicator. A heck of a lot healthier than another supposedly Healthy restaurant in the neighborhood. Mushroom crepes were light and fluffy. Wife's fresh tasting veggie omelet was not too big, light and accompanied by the best hash browns we've had in a long time.  Fresh squeezed OJ and rich coffee. We liked that they don't automatically give you a pile of toast. Can't wait to try hemp pancakes and other treats soon. A bit overstaffed but to be expected when you have no idea on initial popularity. Obviously a family related labor of love.
