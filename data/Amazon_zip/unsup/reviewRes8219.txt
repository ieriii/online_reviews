Awesome, authentic Italian pizza, within walking distance from the Metra and El? YES PLEASE! I have a hard time breaking away from the simple and delicious Bufalina (can't go wrong with buffalo mozzarella), but if you must have meat on your pizza, the Funghi e Salciccia (mushroom & sausage) is great. Ask the servers to describe the daily pizza specials as well. For dessert, try the panna cotta (especially during rhubarb season), or just save a tiny bit of room for a complimentary cannoli on your way out the door. Only reason I gave 4 out of 5 stars: sometimes the service is so fast that we're out of there in 40 minutes, and I'd typically prefer to linger a little longer. Then again, they're super busy so I can't really blame them. Things seem a little more relaxed in the summer when the patio's open, so if you don't mind a few minutes' wait, go then to get the full experience.
