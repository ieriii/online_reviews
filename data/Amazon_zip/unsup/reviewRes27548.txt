restaurant is pretty cheap and the food tastes good. I especially like the fact that there is always an amuse bouche, and it is different every time. The waiters and waitresses are also dressed up in mexican clothing to complement the colorful environment and food. It is usually packed at peak hours but the wait seems to go by fast and it is worth it. There is also a parking lot across the street, which makes parking a lot easier.
