My hotel room was mostly clean (accepting the candy wrappers half way under the tv cabinet that were there when I checked in & when I left) and sort of run down, chipped sink, peeling wall paper. The bed was really comfortable and the internet was pretty speedy. (But really $15 a day for wifi? Glad my conference included it.) The meeting rooms were mostly easily found and the coffee shop & cheaper breakfast/lunch place were fine. So why 2 stars? Normally I would leave it at 3 but c'mon. My room was over $250 a night. Yes, I realize I'm in downtown Chicago and that my room rate subsidizes the meeting rooms, but for that you can glue down the wall paper and give me towels that don't seem so tired.
