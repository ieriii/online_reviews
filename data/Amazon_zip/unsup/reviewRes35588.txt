Ever since I came to Chicago a few months back, I have been fiending for roast pork over a bed of rice and some asian greens. Luckily for a new friend of mine lives in Viet town here and introduced me to this place as one of the two destinations I would go to for a Vietnamese food binge. As soon as we got here I knew exactly what I wanted, the roast pork. I wanted that salty porky goodness along with the crispy skin of the pork inside me ASAP. We also ordered barbequed pork as well as an order of shrimp gyoza soup.  I have to admit as soon as our order came out, I had to try to play it cool. Because if I didn't I would have ravaged the food because it looked so good. The roast pork with rice and greens was simplistic... exactly the way it should be.  With a little bit of saltiness and sauce dripping off the pork, it was definitely a spot that I hadn't hit in my appetite in a loooong time. The barbequed pork was awesome as well. This order came without rice but still a heaping portion of pork. The sauce was great on it and my friend would say it was an even better choice than my roast pork. Maybe that is true... maybe it isn't... you should go and try them both. The shrimp gyoza soup was good as well. The soup base was okay but the dumplings were some of the better ones I have had in Chicago so far. Before I knew it I was starting to get full. My eyes may have been bigger than my stomach this time... but was I going to admit that? Hell no! I had to man up my gastric self and truck on through as much as I could before quietly conceding that I had my share. And the price? The three dishes added up to less than 20 dollars. A great price and plentiful food to split for two. I have yet to even try to duck here which will happen the next time I am there... that or probably the roast pork again... or bbq pork... hmmm this could be a good problem to have next time.
