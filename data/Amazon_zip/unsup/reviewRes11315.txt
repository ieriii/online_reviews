I've been craving Piece Pizza for weeks - ever since my roommate brought home leftovers and let me eat most of them - so we decided to make the trek to Bucktown and suffer through the long wait. Got there around 7:45 and were told there would be a 45 minute to an hour wait. We decided to walk around the area a bit (plenty of people out and about) and checked in to pester the hostess every twenty minutes to ask if our table was ready. A couple beers and an hour later, we were seated in a roomy booth. We ordered the goat cheese appetizer to start (loved it, but a little too much like pizza to eat before pizza) as well as a sample of each of their 7 house brews (only a dollar per sample). I would highly recommend the samples - they have a lot of great beers and it was fun to taste beers that I would typically not order (their dark beers had great flavor but were not too bitter, which I liked).  Now to the pizza, we ordered a large red with a bunch of toppings (half artichoke hearts, garlic and mushroom/half sausage, mushroom and green pepper with goat cheese on everything). It arrived fairly quickly and piping hot. It was, as expected, delicious. I'm a crust girl, and theirs was thin with a perfect balance of chewy and crispiness. I also liked that it wasn't overloaded with cheese, just enough to cover, and cut into slices not squares, as pizza should be. Bill was about $50 for beer samples, app, and pizza - well worth it considering we have about a dozen slices leftover to enjoy! They should open a second location - would cut down on the wait and let everyone enjoy this amazing pizza.
