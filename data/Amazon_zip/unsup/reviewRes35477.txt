I am a SunWahphymaniac. I'll eat here while cheating on my partners (dining partners, i.e., Amaliya L, et al.). I've been accused of and admit committing friendship adultery here twice in the last week. I just can't help it. I'll eat here with anyone. Anytime. I'll eat here alone. The menu looks different to me. Maybe it's easier to appreciate the versatility. Sun Wah's repertoire is vast; they know many ways to please. There are numerous dishes of seafood, chicken, pork, beef, and duck with rice, Low Mein, BBQ combos, congee, many soups in "small" bowls that feed at least two people, and unending choices of entree combinations. Sauteed Squid, BBQ combo (chicken, pork, and duck), BBQ Pork with Black Bean Sauce, Broccoli with Oyster Sauce were among this week's delights. You can have a sensual epicurean experience and get filled up starting at $5.00. Always a happy ending foodgasm, which is why I'm a Sunwawphymaniac.
