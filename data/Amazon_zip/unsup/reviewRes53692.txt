I should share this personal detail first.... Recovering vegetarian here. Doug helped me cross back over to the land of encased meats. The line vs. the fabulous dogs? I am lucky enough to live in the general area and don't have to treat Doug's as a destination restaurant. But the line is a bit overwhelming on the weekends (Friday and Saturday at hot doug's). and the weekend is the only time you can get the fabulous duck fat fries.Everything I have ever tried has been fabulous. I am particularly fond of the Portuguese linguica and Catalonian pork sausage with their particular toppings. (saffron aioli, aged manchego, etc.) Perfect combinations of flavors that you won't find anywhere else. Don't forget cash only. (I have seen one couple wait in a long line to get to inside and see the cash only sign; by the time we finished our dogs, they were again at the front of the line.... persevere, my friends) Enjoy.
