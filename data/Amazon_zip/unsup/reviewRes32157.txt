OK, so, at the beginning of this year, I became a reluctant vegetarian. I miss bacon A LOT. I miss encased meat products. I miss thick juicy steaks and baked chicken. This Thanksgiving, I am sure I will miss my great grandmothers gizzard gravy that I have eaten every year for the last #*^%* years... but, more than any of those things I miss corned beef. Corned beef is delicious -- it's fatty, fleshy, pickled meaty goodness -- and I love it... errr.... loved it. I thought I would never eat corned beef again, and then we found The Chicago Diner. Now, we did go at about 3 in the afternoon, so we had no trouble getting a seat or parking, but that part of town is usually a bitch to park in or around, and I can see how if the Diner got even a little rush, it could be incredibly uncomfortable to wait for seating there. I ordered the Reuben, my hubby had the Polenta Lasagna. My Reuben was as good as any real meat reuben I have ever had-- maybe even better than many. As a side, I ordered tortilla soup: FANTASTIC flavor! The portions were tremendous. I was SO SO happy. The Lasagna, on the other hand, was really just a huge chunk of polenta (a peasant food that, for some reason restaurants charge an assload for -- here it was 12.99, kind of ridiculous) with herbed butter, on a bed of greens, topped with squash, zucchini, and purple onions...*yawn*. He ate it because he was really hungry but I probably wouldn't have. For desert we spilt a piece of AMAZING chocolate pumpkin cheesecake -- so good it made me want to stand up on the table and sing. The bill was $31.00. Kind of high for a late lunch that does not involve the slaughter of another creature (which would have been much cheaper!) but worth it, I think. I love this place. Not a day goes by that I don't think about that sandwich I had. Dear Faux Reuben, Most Cleverly Disguised Bean of Soy, I will return for you again some day, My Love -- someday soon.
