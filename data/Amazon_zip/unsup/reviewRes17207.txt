I love Violet Hour. The place has a very classy yet relaxed vibe. The music is not too loud and the food looks good. Great place for a date. The drinks are made with unique liquors and ingredients and are mixed very well. Bonus points for being one of the few places that serve absinthe. I deducted one star for having to wait in line out in the cold.
