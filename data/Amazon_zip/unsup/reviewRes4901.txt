HELLLLLO! Mama I've died and gone to HOG heaven! If you could imagine pig, pork, bacon...Miss Piggy cooked in every and any delicious way possible...The Purple Pig is the the place to be! From the nommy bacon fat roasted, rosemary, garlic almond app to the bone marrow spread on bread to the greasy-buttery jowel with apricot dressing...this is the place to be for any pork lover out there! I was hesitant on a few dishes, but my boyfriend (who I NEVER trust, when it comes to food) convinced me to give these dishes a whirl. And, I am so glad I did. Every bite was as scrumptious as everyone around me described. I looked forward to the next bite like a fat kid who loves chocolate! Ambiance was great! However, if you are not a socialite, like myself then I recommend you ask for a table for deux. As seating here is informal and you will be sitting next to a grandma look-alike, or Indiana neighbors visiting for the weekend. I loved "The Purple Pig!" I can't wait to go back! Nommy Nommm Nommm nommm nommmmnommmmm....
