This is the location of the most romantic meal I've ever eaten. This restaurant is just lovely, actually it's my favorite fondue restaurant ever! (and i LOVE fondue) The storefront is kind of nestled back a little away from the street, there are vines and flowers and reasonably priced valet out there. Inside is a lot of deep dark wood dcor dimly lit by a minimal amount of soft lights and candles. The staff (from valet, to hostess, to wait staff back out to valet) really takes care of you while you're there the staff all works quietly and attentively (filling wine glasses, switching courses) all the time uninterruptive of your date. The food is unbelievable. Fondue in general is more intimate then prepared food because you have a lot of time to sit and chit chat, but this place was beyond your average fondue place, it's just nicer, more quiet and overall way more romantic then any fondue place I've been before. They have their own house wines that are totally delicious and won't break the bank. In fact, for the excellence of Geja's Caf it's really not expensive at all considering the quality of the food/wine/experience. I know a lot of my friends are suburban dwellers, but this place is very much worth the drive to the city. I really cant say enough about how pretty/romantic/sweet/cozy this place is - I think you should take your girlfriend here and thank me later. I suggest making reservations, because this place is just wonderful.
