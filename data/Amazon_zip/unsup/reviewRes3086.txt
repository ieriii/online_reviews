Jumbo wings. Delicious sauce. Reasonably priced. Good stuff!! It took us forever to find parking. If I had to do it again, I would definitely not drive. Was it worth it though? I definitely enjoyed the wings, and I had already had a full dinner before eating these wings and I still enjoyed them! So yes, it was worth it! We ordered two orders of Jumbo Wings, one in Crispy BBQ sauce and one in Seoul Sassy. Crispy BBQ was my favorite of the two. The Seoul Sassy really did not have much flavor to me. I guess I should have eaten it first before moving on to the BBQ. Each order comes with five wings. So we had a total of 10 jumbo wings. Between the three of us, we had two wings left. Not too shabby considering that we did already have dinner at the Girl and the Goat ahead of time. Two great dinners in one night. You can't beat that!! Finger lickin' good!!!! There is not a lot of seating area here so try to get here early or take your food to go.
