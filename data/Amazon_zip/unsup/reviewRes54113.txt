My first experience in Rick Bayless restaurant was amazing! The food is delicious and also affordable! The second time I went there he was actually out of the kitchen and a lady asked him to take a picture with her. His body guard was next to him but he agreed and made the customer happy! He is a great chef. I love this restaurant!
