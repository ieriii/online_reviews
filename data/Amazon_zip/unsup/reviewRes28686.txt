O.K. This is one of those Chicago spots you must try. It is not about the service or the atmosphere. The pizza is the best in the city. Hands down. Four of us went to lunch for 33 bucks plus tip. We each had a personal deep dish and a drink. It was so reasonable I thought it could have been a mistake.  We called ahead of time to place our order. Our pizza was on the table five minutes after we sat. If you think the pizza is burned you really do not know food and do not get the concept. If you bothered to eat the caramelized crust you would taste the light sweetness and great texture it brings. Keep up the great work.
