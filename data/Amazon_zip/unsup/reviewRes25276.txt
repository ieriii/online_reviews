Chicago deep dish is awesome, but for me its a rare treat since you know...it's packed with cheese. When I do eat pizza, I try to go out of my way to go to Pequods. Its not your typical deep dish, rather a pan style with some decent toppings. The crust is amazing and its just awesome. It's between Bacino's and Pequod's for me.
