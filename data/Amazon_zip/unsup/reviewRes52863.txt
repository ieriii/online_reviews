I had the ropa vieja. I really liked this entre. The beef had some kick, which i liked. Plantains good. Rice good. I added some of the house hot sauce, which provided strong heat, and nice flavor. The fried yucca would have been much better with twice the garlic sauce. Sandwiches looked tasty - I did keep wondering, with all the other Latin restaurants in the neighborhood, some of them have gotta be better... but that being said, 90 miles was completely satisfying.
