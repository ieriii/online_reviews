I had been wanting to come here ever since it opened- so disappointing. I went here with a friend who's a chef, we couldn't believe how off the food was. Got the fondue for an app- good but not great (hard to mess up melted cheese). Also got the smoked haddock cake- very dried out and over-salted. My entree was the semolina dumplings, which had a flavorful mushroom, tomato, and pecorino topping, but the dumplings themselves were bland. My friend had the sausages, which he said were almost inedibly overcooked. Also got a side of baby carrots- again, oversalted and underseasoned; we didn't touch the dish after each trying it. We did go on a Monday night- maybe the chef was off and the kitchen hasn't gotten things down yet- go for the location, not the food.
