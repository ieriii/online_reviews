First of all, never drink with an empty stomach and tired after work. Haa, I got a little buzzed stealing drinks from others ( I lost my ID therefore I stole) anyways I went there and I just love the atmosphere.. The seatings are great, and the service? Awesome. One of the dish really stood out for me.. The Irish Curry.. ( so I'm Asian I have fetish for spicy curry.. Not sweet..) but the waitress was so nice to bring me a sample.. Conclusion? No Irish curry please .. :P Then I ordered the Rosemary Chicken.. It was soooooooooooooooooooo goooooood only fall back is that its a little too salty for my liking. I ordered my usual Red Bull Vodka and the mixes are just right.. Love the drinks ;)
