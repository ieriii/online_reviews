I dined in a few years ago, and was really impressed with the atmosphere. I remember not being blown away by the sushi. I recently ordered delivery from this place one night to try it as an alternative to SushiX for delivered sushi.  The worst! All our sushi was freezing cold. The spicy tuna had next to no meat in it, and was obviously siting in a fridge prepared god knows how long ago. If I want cold, old sushi I'll go to Dominicks.
