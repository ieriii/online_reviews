BYOB? Check. Amazingly fresh sushi? Of course. Good Value? Bet the farm. Been loving Coast for nearly 10 years. Friendly staff that knows their stuff and aren't afraid of sharing their knowledge in a unpretentious way. Food shows up seemingly tight when you want it and I've never felt rushed to vacate the table. Love me some Coast.
