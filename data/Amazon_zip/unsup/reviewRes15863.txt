So, as most people will write or tell you, this place is a bit pricey, but I knew that going in. I had read a few reviews in magazines. My only real complaint is that it was purty dark in there. The music was good, the decor nice, it was quiet. They don't allow smoking or cell phone use inside. I went here with some friends, I wasn't trying to "meet" anyone; I just wanted to enjoy some conversation and drinks. I had the Honeysuckle drink first, and then El Diablo. Both were very good. I also tried the crimini and ricotta "sammie," which was quite good. I'm telling you, these drinks are potent! I needed the little bit of food to prevent me from being drunk when I left...I am a bit of a lightweight. I say check it out. It's a nice change of pace from obnoxious trendy bars.
