I easily go the Diner once to twice a month because it's one of the few places I can get a completely vegan, absolutely tasty, filling dinner.  The atmosphere is very laid back + cozy. I've had nothing but kind, helpful servers. I always feel at home. Their vegan Chicken Caesar Salad rocks! Even my omnivore, Caesar crazy boyfriend loves it. Granted, from what I remember, the dressing nor the "chicken" tastes nothing like actual original but it stands as a great salad on it's own. The downfall of the diner is their cakes are DENSE as hell. If you're looking for sweets, I suggest you try their chocolate chip cookie or their absolutely amazing cookie dough peanut butter shake! Despite the Chicago Diner keeping a very dear space in my heart, I avoid bringing my non-veg friends here. Every time I've brought omnivores they always seem to order the most cheesy, meaty dish on the menu and they leave somewhat unfulfilled. However, they have equally as great take out! So your boyfriend can pick up Taco Bell before you run by and pick up your dinner!
