The Meli Cafe is an excellent breakfast nook. I've been here with my wife, my sales team, and with friends. I highly recommend it. I like to try different breakfasts and so far have never been disappointed, from omelets to crepes to waffles to french toast to just straight up eggs 'n bacon. They also use Bay's, a local food bakery, for their English Muffins, which I think is AWESOME. The wait staff is fantastic, especially very early (which is usually when I've been there). Coffee filled frequently and frequent (but not annoyingly so) checks to make sure all is well are appreciated. I always feel appreciated on my way out as well. This place gets 4 stars and would get five, but I often see people lined up 50 yards deep around / after 8am on the weekends which, for me, would be a deterrent. They open at 6am every day and I try to be done and out by 7:30am at the latest when I go.
