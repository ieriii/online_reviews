Chicago pizza at it's best. Every time I visit I make sure to eat at Giordano's as it has the best pizza in Chicago. This location is in the heart of the city and can't be beat. Be ready for a wait when you go as deep dish pizza isn't a fast food so you'll be there for a while. But, wow, it is definitely worth it.
