The Crowne Plaza did a nice job of renovating the old Allerton. The exterior is sharp with its masonry walls complemented by a newer glass awning over the main entrance. Only so much could be done with the old rooms. While they are pleasant enough, they are small by modern standards. The location is primo, right along Michigan Avenue where all the tourists want to be.
