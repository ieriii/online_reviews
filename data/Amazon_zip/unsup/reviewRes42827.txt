I had passed Fogo many times on the train and wondered what it was until finally I used this magic invention called the internet to figure out that it was a pizza slice place in a spot where there shockingly aren't many thin slice places. Since then, I have eaten here twice and found the food to be decent. It really seems like it is one of those places where if you just ordered a whole pie, the quality would go up a ton, but as the slices sit and potentially get soggy, the taste goes down with it, but I feel like this is the dilemma faced by most by the slice places.
