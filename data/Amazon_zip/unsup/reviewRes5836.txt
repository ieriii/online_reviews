Dreaming of Wildfire's Homemade Chocolate Cream Pie... I realize there is an unwritten rule in the Yelp Law Book that it is not cool to do a review on: 1. a chain restaurant such as a Lettuce Entertain You establishment; 2. a restaurant that already has so many reviews. But frankly, my dear, I don't follow the rules. I love Wildfire - I have always loved Wildfire - I simply have never had a bad meal. I have never had bad service here, either. Ever. Still dreaming of Wildfire's Homemade Chocolate Cream Pie... From the appetizers to the salads to the entrees to the desserts. Every single item I have eaten has been delicious and has kept me coming back for more. Continuing to dream of Wildfire's Homemade Chocolate Cream Pie... See, I don't always need ethnic foods or bizarre and outlandish foods like bull testicles and fried brain and pig anus and chicken feet. Nah, sometimes I just want: - a good salad. And their House Specialty is fabulous w/ roasted chicken, avocado, tomato, blue cheese, bacon, scallions, tortilla strips, corn, tossed with citrus lime vinaigrette - fabulously crispy fried calamari - extra crispy for moi - oh baby! Best I have ever had. The sauces are perfect. - shrimp and crab bisque - mouthwatering steaks! To die for. Every bit as high quality as some of the big name steak places in Chicago. - a reasonably priced nightly special such as spit roasted half Long Island Duck or a eight hour barbeque platter featuring baby back ribs, pulled pork, sliced brisket, cornbread muffin and baked beans. And one more thing - I would walk on hot coals for their Homemade Chocolate Cream pie. It's seasonal so get your piehole in there before it's gone. You can buy a whole one, too. You're welcome.
