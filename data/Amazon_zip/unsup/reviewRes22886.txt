Another good review! 8:45 on a weekday, outside was full, but no wait for the tables inside. I really am not sure why this place is as popular as it is, it is very busy. The food is good of course, but there must be something else to it. The service was average, I almost did not recognize the server due to overly-casual attire, no apron or anything, just a guy in jeans walking around. The chili renellos was good, there was one hard piece in it, but other than that it was great. I appreciate the veg-friendly options on the menu. I had a black bean empinada, also excellent. The fried plantains are awesome! It is BYOB and cash only, the prices are moderate for what it is, with good portions. One suggestion to the restaurant owners: It is unappealing that you serve salsa out of a greasy plastic bottle.
