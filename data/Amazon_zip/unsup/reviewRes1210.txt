I firmly believe that there's nothing I can say about Doug's that hasn't already been said. In fact, I bet that someone has already written the EXACT sentence I just wrote. We all know that Hot Doug's provides the greatest sausage concoctions ever. EVER. Inarguable. So I thought I'd take a second to focus on the negatives. 1.) Hot Doug's is over 400 miles from my home. Even if I fly to Chicago, get in a cab, get to Hot Doug's and wait in line, I can't have a sausage for probably 3 hours. 3 hours is a long time to wait for this goodness. 2.) I have friends who live in Chicago who have never been to Doug's. This is inexcusable. It's like living in Paris and never seeing the Mona Lisa, it's like living in Cairo and saying, 'man, those pyramids are just TOO far away,' it's like living in Amsterdam and never contracting an STD in the Red Light District. 3.) I know people who plan trips to Chicago, and at my insistence, promise to go to Doug's. When they get back, they say, 'oh, my grandma was having heart surgery in Wheaton and we just couldn't find the time.' Fuck your grandmother. You FIND the time. 4.) The hours are limited. This is self-explanatory. I'm not advocating a 3am close. You can't truly appreciate Doug's unless you're of sound mind and body. Plus, late-night hot-dog places breed animalistic tendencies. I don't want a 'vanilla milkshake,' wherein Doug bares his breasts for $20. Go to Wiener's Circle at 3 in the morning. Enjoy. It would be nice, though, if I could have dinner at Doug's. 5.) Hot Doug's is over 400 miles from my home. This is a big one. If I could marry a sausage-emporium, it would definitely be Hot Doug's. I'd treat her right, make sweet love to her and have little half-human/ half-sausage monster-babies. Then, we'd have to kill them in infancy. And eat them. Because I bet they'd taste pretty great too.
