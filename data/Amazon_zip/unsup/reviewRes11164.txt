Walked in to piece on a Saturday night around 11pm. There were a bunch of open tables in the back where my group of 9 sat down. We were starting to get comfortable when the host/busboy walked up and told us we had to move because we hadn't "been sat" by him. We got up and stood awkwardly by the bar. After standing around for 45 mins we asked the front if we could sit and they so nicely informed us that they weren't seating anymore and we could sit anywhere we wanted. Great...thanks for the info. I wanted to order a pizza but after sitting for 20 minutes without any server coming up to us, I got over my desire for pizza and just tried to have fun with my friends. Service = bad (I hope it was just a bad night for them. Based on the other reviews, I would like to believe that this was a fluke) The karaoke does sound amazing when backed up by the live band. Since it is so loud you can sing along at your table and feel like you are part of the action. Tip: It is VERY loud on saturdays, VERY.
