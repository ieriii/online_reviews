I don't get the hype surrounding Superdawg. I've been here twice now and have left unimpressed both times. The dogs/sausages are ok. I just hate the fact that they cram them in a tiny container with fries. Everything gets smushed. I like to enjoy my food unsmushed! Is that too much to ask?? Go to try the Superdawg and take a pic of the giant wiener on top of the joint.
