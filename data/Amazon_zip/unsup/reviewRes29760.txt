We live close by and eat here a lot. This is our favorite Thai restaurant in the city because of the variety of the menu and the consistency of the preparation. Branch out from more typical dishes to try, for example, the Opart Beef appetizer, the Moo Ping pork skewers, or one of the many salads. And the catfish dishes are varied and excellent.
