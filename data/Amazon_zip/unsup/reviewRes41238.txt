Out of amazing availability of Vietnamese places around the Argyle area, I am always surprised by how packed Tank Noodle Restaurant is. First time I came here about a year ago, I hated it, and vowed never to come here again. However, based on how this place just keeps being busy, I decided to try it again to see if I get a better experience. The Result? The food at this place is very average compared to some other Vietnamese places just east of Tank. There is little flavor, and little meat - mostly just rice and vegetables. Looking around, my guess the reason this place is so popular is because its right at the corner of Argyle and Broadway- and the "white" people are just too scared to venture a little more east. So, I guess the location is the number #1 reason for success of this place- no other reason. Vientamese food is amazing, but I would highly recommend Pho 888, Hai Yen- maybe 3-4 minute walk from Tank. Do not go to Tank noodle, you may be disappointed- and feel like Vietnamese food is dull, and service is rude - this is not the case. About the only good thing about Tank is that it is BYOB, but there is not much good about this place.
