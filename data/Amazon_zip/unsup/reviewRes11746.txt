best thin crust pizza i've had in Chicago so far. LARGE PIES. even the small is really large! i had pepperoni and jalepeno (my fave) and the peppers were SO hot (i loved it!) my nose was running and my friend literally downed a whole pitcher of water!haha this was a great pizza. also had the guacamole for an app which i wouldn't expect to be that good but it was really yummy and fresh. the beers here are phenom. loved the Golden Arm, hated the Cameltoe (i should have known from the name of it). service was excellent, atmosphere is fun and prime for a game-watching spot, good crowd, overall 2 thumbs up experience.
