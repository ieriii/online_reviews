I really used to like lao sze chuan because they make their food SPICY. But my last dining experience was awful which says something since I'm pretty tolerant of bad service from Asian restaurants. I ordered mapo tofu and asked if it came with meat. They told me 'no' so I asked for them to put some pork in there. When I got my dish there was a THICK red layer of oil on top and about a teaspoon of ground pork in the middle. It was disgustingly salty, too. Needless to say, I couldn't finish it. They asked if we wanted rice. We thought that was strange but shrugged it off.  *tip* If an Asian restaurant asks if you want rice, ask if they charge for them. We both got charged EACh for our bowl of rice. They told us it was endless refill but only after we asked why we were charged. I'm sorry but Chinese restaurant charging for bowls of rice is just appalling. I wish they would have told us about charging, too, because we didn't even eat it. Anyways, the service is always horrible and this experience did it for me. No more.
