This place is pretty awesome in my book. When we got there it was PACKED (Saturday evening during NCAA tourney after all). They quoted us a 2hr weight for a party of 5 but in reality it was 1.5 hours. We were able to nab some seats at the bar for the ladies which helped pass the time. As far as drinks: The Dark 'n Curvy was spectacular. Was that a hint of banana bread I taste? Oh yeah.... We loaded up on pizza, you really can't go wrong. Just order a lot. Worst case scenario: you go home with left overs. Cons: People need to realize that you can't try to navigate through a crown with a baby stroller the size of an M1 Abrahams tank. THREE people did this; it was obnoxious. This is obviously not the fault of Piece, only their customers. The servers were very accommodating and changed the channel as we requested. Well played Piece, I'll be back!
