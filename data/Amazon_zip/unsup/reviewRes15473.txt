Was really, really unsure about this spot when my date and I entered the "waiting line."  Was early (enough) on a Saturday, not quite dinner time yet even.  So we wait.........and wait..........someone comes from ou t the velvet drapes..."how many..?" we wait some more. (25-35 minutes in total). My date and I were about to just bail thinking it can't be the "all that." Plus we were really starting to get hungry and thirsty for that matter. We finally get sat, and a nice little ottman duece in front of the fireplace. It would've been great if there were a fire going on or at least some candles lit in this hearth (under utilized it was imho). Drinks were stiff, but not too stiff....WELL MADE like cocktails are supposed to be....Had a lil appetizer, came quickly not too long of a wait on the grub. Bottom Line: Comes off really pretentious, and it may very well be.....BUT they turned it around, trully did. Great atmosphere, romantic, "exclusive", hip, above average service. I don't see myself becoming a "regular" but it is definately a cool, unique and fresh experience.....
