I've waited years to try Frontera and finally got my chance this past weekend. The wait at 2pm on a Saturday, was still an hour. The wait isn't bad due to the great bar, tasteful decor and accomodating staff. The music level is kinda loud, but works. It's loud enough that you can't overhear the table next to you. The artwork is tasteful and keeps your eyes as entertained as the food does for your tastebuds. As far as the food, it was right on par with what I expected. We started off with the sopes rancheros. The flavor combonation between the spiced beef, tomato and avacodo against the fried masa was great. I do with the masa cake was a little more crisp though. For entrees, I had the duck tacos and my wife had the chicken mole enchiladas. The duck had been marinated in adobo and seared over hardwood fire, giving it a nice spicy and smokey flavor. the duck wa served with sauteed poblanos and onion, along with fresh masa tortillas. My wifes mole enchiladas were great as well. The mole was sweet but not overpowering, with nice notes of cilantro and garlic anlong the cocoa. If you have the time, don't hesitate to try this place.
