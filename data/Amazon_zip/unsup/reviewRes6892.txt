A higher-end BBQ joint that doesn't quite justify the price. I went here on a first date and we did order quite a bit of food. They start you off with potato chips (good) and pickles (okay). I ordered the brisket with cornbread. Both were fine, but not world-crushing. My date ordered baby back ribs and fries. Also good, not world-crushing. We also had the greens (fine) and the cheddar bacon hush puppies (fine). Four beers between us, plus tip and I walked out $99 lighter. Granted, we got more food than we could eat. And I appreciated the quality service. Plus, you get four different sauces with your barbecue. That's a nice touch. But I can't say anything I ate blew my mind. It was all good, just not great. I mean, you pay $6.75 for five hush puppies. That's $1.35 per hush puppy. And that's steep for something the size of a donut hole. You couldn't even really taste the cheddar or the bacon. The brisket was $20.75. Think of what you can get elsewhere for that much money. Hey, I'd pay that if it melted in my mouth, but it was just okay. Also, not a great date spot as it was really, really loud. I might come back, but I would order less food.
