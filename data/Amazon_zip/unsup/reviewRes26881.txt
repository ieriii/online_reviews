*hands down* The best meal I had in Chicago! The food lives up to the hype and Rick Bayless is undeniably a Top Chef Master. Now I know why people line up before this place opens. As a tourist from L.A., spending the time to wait in line with the locals was worth it. Luckily, we were able to get a reservation, walk around downtown, and come back for a wonderful meal. Review based on the June 5 - July 7, 2012 menu: Chips & guacamole: best guac ever. everrr Limonada, always better with limes than lemons Old School Frontera Trio: fronterizo ceviche was amazing, the corn masa quesadillas with artisan cheese and epazote were cheesy and delicious. taquitos were alright Biscocho de Fresas: strawberry shortcake, orange-black pepper cream biscuit, crema, "amazing" berries, orange liqueur, basil... so damn good, i wanted to order another.
