The Gage is exactly the place I was looking for this weekend during a night out with two of my girlfriends. A classy, upscale pub with a great selection of beer, unique menu and an atmosphere that makes you feel right at home. Plus, they have a staff with a knack for recommending tasty delights, even when seated at the bar. Bartender Sterling advised us to try the Skirt Steak, Mussels and side of squash....all were de-lish! I'm looking forward to going back for a full dining experience.
