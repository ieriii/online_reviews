I'm sold. We were looking for something open on New Years day while heading back from the south side and found this on Yelp - so glad we did. Everyone is right about the Bread with Ricotta and Honey - to die for. Everything we had was fantastic and the place is cozy and warm. We can't wait to go back - Saturday night dinner, Sunday brunch, Wednesday - who cares. I'd be there all the time if I lived closer.
