After many a recommendation and much hype to this encased meats emporium, it was time to give this puppy a shot. Tucked into a small cafe-like space with a large menuboard packed with a substantial variety of linked options, this cash-only food counter seems a bit intimidating at first, but I gotta say that dissolved immediately when the guy running the counter (who I found out later was the owner) was incredibly nice and helpful. Seriously, huge points for the hospitality. After making your order, you can grab a seat and wait for your food to be brought out to you. I have to say, if you're looking for a juicy, tasty sausage of any type and you don't mind paying a slight premium for fresh and fanciful ingredients, this is the place for you. I got the duck sausage topped with foie gras, and man, oh man, the combo was so good, and the cheese fries my wife got with her sausage were great as well. My only issue with the joint has to be the fact that if you're in the mood for something simple like a hot dog or polish sausage, you'll be paying unneeded premium. I thought my foie gras duck sausage was right on point in terms of price, but my wife's sister just got a Chicago-style dog and it was a bit too pricey for what was essentially a good hot dog (of which you can find in many places for much less). Still, I cannot fault the hype for this place, as it is a fantastic experience if you're looking for a sausage with a little extra sumthin' sumthin' (get your mind out of the gutter).
