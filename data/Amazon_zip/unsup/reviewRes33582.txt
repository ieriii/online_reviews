I had a great experience at Yolk. My mom was in town, and we went there for a Mother's Day breakfast. It was only about a 45 min, which I thought was pretty good! The restuarant is pretty large with plenty of seating. This really helps speed up any wait times. The menu is expansive with great savory and sweet breakfast/brunch items. I had an excellent Big Texan Omelette with a side of pancakes. Everything was delicious! Also recommend the Tour de France of french toast that my wife had. Will be back for sure!
