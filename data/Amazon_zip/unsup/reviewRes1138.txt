I may have tainted my Hot Doug's experience slightly... After waiting 45 minutes in line for my first Hot Doug hot dog, I figured "I better make this count." So I ended up trying the Gator Dog and Foie Gras Dog to broaden my horizons, when I probably should have stuck with a classic, for a real comparison.  Neither of the dogs were particularly outstanding, but were still worth the experience. If you're a newbie, I recommend fighting the urge to try the obscure dogs first.
