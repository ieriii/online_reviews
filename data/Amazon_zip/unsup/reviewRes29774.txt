This place is fantastic. I took my husband there a couple weeks ago for his birthday. One piece of advice: Make reservations as soon as you can! My original plan was to take him to Topolobomo, however, they had no openings even though I was calling 3 weeks in advance. All they had was a 9:15 at Frontera Grill so I took it. I was pleased that 2 days before our rez they called and said they now had an opening at 8pm for Frontera.  Well I must say I was not disappointed that we ended up there and not Topo. The food was wonderful. The ceviche trio was to die for- I could eat that all day! I'd go back just for that appetizer. Then I was thrilled that one of their entrees had two of my favorite things in one dish- duck and mole. It was incredible. The duck was crusted with chipotle, cinnamon, cumin, and other warm spices. Even the rice was great. There was not a single morsel of food or drop of sauce left on my plate. My husband had the ribs, which neither one of us would have ever considered before at a Mexican restaurant, but they too were great.  The only thing I was not that impressed with was the desert we chose. We had the homemade ice cream and it was just "eh." However, I had a coffee made with tequila, Kahlua and chocolate and it was the perfect ending to the meal. One more thing that our experience great was that we purchased one of Chef Bayless's cookbooks and our server had Chef personalize it. He signed it and wrote Happy Birthday even though he was dining with friends in Topo. I highly recommend this restaurant!
