Stop reading these reviews, go the store and see for yourself. Lamb, veal chop, orgasmic bone-in filet. The butcher will make sure you get that which is the source of your meat focus. And the wine selection is wonderful. You can spend from under $10 to more than $300 per bottle, so that you should be capable of pairing that bone-in filet with something that will suit you. My mouth is still watering. The service is outstanding, at least six stars!
