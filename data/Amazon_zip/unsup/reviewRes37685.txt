Fox & Obel makes me wish I knew how to cook. Luckily, for those of us who don't they have a great selection of pre-made sandwiches, sides and salads, sushi and that are perfect for those who don't know how to make anything other than a mean grilled cheese or frozen pizza. I work not too far from F&O, so I like to pop in from time to time for a special treat when I'm having a bad day. If you work or live in the area, I'd definitely try F&O for a quick bite -- it's a fresh change from Corner Bakery and other run-of-the-mill lunch spots.
