Most of my reviews are overflowing with detail and description...I will tell you this I have been on a quest for the best Chicago style Hot Dog and I have found it it costs $1.75 and it is at Hot Dougs... I also tried a few of the premium dogs and guess what they were good but next time I will be sticking to the signature dog! My only complaint is location couldn't you open closer to me please?
