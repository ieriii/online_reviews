Chicago, the city known for their deep dish pizzas! I must say I'm definately a California girl who likes her specialty pizzas and thin and crispy crust! I thought it was toooooo deep for my taste! It was deep I must say that. We got the special which consisted of sausage, bell peppers and onions. I rarely ever saw the sausage but I sure saw a lot of cheese! Way too much for my taste! We started off though with the family appitizer which wasn't too bad. It was $22 for a load of mozerella sticks, fried zuchinni, fried mushrooms, chicken strips, calamari, fried shrimp and the best thing was that it wasn't oily like they normally would be! It was pretty good but hey, usually fried foods are always yummy.
