The food is good but really didn't blow me away. I must say it's not worth the 1 hour 15 min wait. It's just hot dog, people! I had the Chicago dog and the bratwurst, and frankly I think they do a better job with the bratwurst than the classic Chicago hot dog. The toppings are standard stuff, not anything fancy. And the duck fat fries is purely a gimmick, can't tell the difference from good old oil fries at all. Prices are right and portion size is good. Would consider coming back if there was no line, but don't think that will happen any time soon. Simply overrated and a victim of food television that turned what used to be a good neighborhood place into a tourist trap.
