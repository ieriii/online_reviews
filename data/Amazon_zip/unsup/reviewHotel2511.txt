I will definately stay here next time I am in Chicago again. I really liked how fancy this place was. The concierge and operators were incredibly helpful. We called for a toothbrush and got it in 5 minutes. They have computers in your room that help you find local restaurants, shopping and entertainment. There are over 17 floors in this hotel, but they have 14 elevators, so you do not have to wait long. Check out is a breeze- you can literall phone it in. Beds are so comfortable that we considered hanging out in bed all day. The TVs have limited channels, and our remote only worked from a certain angle. The bathrooms are really nice and the bath products were great. Plenty of towels available, and the softest pillows you will ever sleep on. I loved this place, highly recommended.
