4 stars because the waiter said we had to wait 1 hour+ but she was nice and got us in within 30 minutes. i had a group of 17 people.  you can't beat this place for the experience/value. I was ready to spend $500 for dinner that night, but my bill only came out to $175. Everyone had their fill including drinks and beer and everything! What a bargain! $10/person. and it was everyone's first time trying chicago pizza. awesome deal!
