I LUV Gilt Bar!!! Definitely one of my favorite places in Chicago. Ok, so I've been here 3 times, and every time we've been here the food has been great and consistent. And the atmosphere is great here too- lively and dark. The cocktails here are good- I've had the St. Germaine, which was a lemony kinda champagne and others which I can't remember the names but I remembered liking as they were balanced and not too strong yet not weak.  Everything we'd ever ordered here was tasty. Our favorites are the bolognese pappardelle, the bone marrow and the foie gras and pork liver mousse. We've also had a rabbit pasta, the orecchiette with sausage, the gnocchi, the pork belly and the pot roast. You can't go wrong with anything here. Everything is well seasoned and well portioned. The desserts are ok here. We've had the chocolate cream pie (think refined French silk pie) and the brown butter apple cake. Both good, but I think the savory stuff is definitely better here.  Make a reservation early if you plan to come here during normal dinner hours. Every time we've dined here our reservations were 8:30p or after, and there is always at least a 15 minute wait until you're actually seated.
