After many lunches and dinners at Glenn's, I can honestly say that the service has a serious lag problem between appetizer and entree orders. On one Sunday night, we also could not get our waitress to bring a check...we saw her later on the phone outside of the restaurant...I guess she forgot to tell her buddies to cover our table. Anyway, many of the entrees sound better than they actually are, but it would not be such a problem (since the atmosphere is so pleasant) if one did not sit for 20-25 minutes waiting for them, anticipating them, before they arrived. Glenn's needs to work on its timing.
