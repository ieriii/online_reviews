My nail tech just moved to a salon down the street from Alliance so I came across the place by accident (pulling up to park at the MUTHAFRIGGIN HIGH @$$ Parking Meter). So anyway..... as I walked by I noticed all the cutesy pastries in the window. On my way out since I still had 5 minutes on the meter so I went inside to grab something. Everything "looked" good. I decided to try the cupcakes in three different flavors. First of all the cupcakes are way overpriced. I don't care how cute they are. Give me a an ugly cupcake at a reasonable price. I got one chocoloate/chocolate, one red velvet, and one carrot cake. The chocoloate was super dry. I actually had to stop and get something to drink. The red velvet was good especially the frosting. However, I'm not sure how the carrot cake was because when I went to eat it the next morning with coffee it was super dry and the frosty was rubbery. This pissed me off. They should package them to last at least a day. They should also lower their prices or at least offer a package deal like 3 for 5 or something like that. 2.75 is WAY TOO MUCH. We are talking about flour, eggs, sugar......... I've had better cupcakes from Dominicks.
