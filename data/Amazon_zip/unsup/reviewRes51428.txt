I love this place! I mean, any restaurant that sells guacamole by the pound is tops in my book! One of the reason I love going to Mexican is the free chips and salsa. I find Garcia's salsa a little spicy so I order a side of guac and mix the two together-I'm not kidding it's heaven in your mouth!! I always get the avocado burrito and I usually end up sharing it or bringing half home. It's HUGE!!! The first time I went I was speechless when the food was set in front of me. I mean, I'm a big eater and I can only finish half-that's saying something! My roommates and I are within walking distance so we frequent Garcia's and on the way I home I always get what I now call Garcia's Belly. You know the feeling.  It's when you are walking so slow you doubt you'll ever make it home but somehow you still manage to have a side ache from over exertion. We often share a pitcher of margaritas and no matter what flavor you get it really just tastes like tequila (not a bad thing necessarily) so I recommend just ordering the regular and saving a few bucks by not getting a flavor. The pitcher arrives almost over flowing and the glasses are full upon arrival too...awesome! Good thing we're with in walking distance! It's not a place to go if you're looking for ambiance or if you are trying to woo someone. It's the place to go when you're hungry and want good food and drink.
