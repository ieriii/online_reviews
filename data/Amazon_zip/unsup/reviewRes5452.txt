This is definitely my kind of place. My wife found it and stopped by on a Friday night for dinner. The atmosphere is very casual, with group seating at large tables, a bar and small booths. Overall the floor plan is cozy, it was a bit smaller than I was expecting. Our waiter was very polite and attentive. The wine list is reasonably priced and loooooooong and you can order a bottle, a glass, a 1/2 or 1/3 bottle. It's a great place to try something new. Our waiter was very helpful in his recommendations without being pretentious at all. The menu has a multitude of cheese and cured meat selections, again a great chance to try something new. We ordered a cheese platter and told the waiter to surprise us and had some cured meats with it. The rest of the menu is divided into appetizers, dips (or smears, as they called it), fried items, salads and entrees. We stuck to the apps, dips and fried items. Everything was a "small plate" perfect for sharing. We stayed for almost 3 hours sampling wine and grazing. Everything we had was delicious. I can't even remember it all. Deep fried prosciutto balls....how can you go wrong with that?? The lardo crustini was delicious and so was the pigs ear with crispy kale. We didn't try them on this visit but even the salads looked awesome. All in all this is a great casual place, has great service, an expansive wine selection and a fabulous menu for tasting all kinds of new things. I will definitely be returning.
