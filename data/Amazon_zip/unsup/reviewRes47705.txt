This is not like Fogo or texas de brasil. It has a similar style to them but with some very unique influences. They dont have quite as large of a selection of meat, and they didnt seem to come arouns as often, but they did have fish and some sushi which was different. The salad/harvest table before the meat was smaller than others, but had some very unique foods. Truthfully...I think the chili was the best thing I had all night. As for the meats I really enjoyed the rump roast the best, followed closely by the salmon and peppersteak. The decorating was top notch. Very nice, but a little on the dark side lighting-wise. Service was very good, everyone was very attentive and helpful.
