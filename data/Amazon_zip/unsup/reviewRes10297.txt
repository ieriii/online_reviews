So my fiance and I walked into Piece one beautiful Thursday afternoon last week, we were in town visiting and simply stumbled upon this AWESOME PLACE!!! We were immediately greeted by a dude named Matt who was super helpful in sharing his thoughts on his favorite beers (they make all their own beer in-house here...SWEET!!) and favorite pizzas, suggestions were on point!! I loved the white pizza and the yummy Dysfunctionale, my fiance liked the beer sampler. The bar was cool, lots to look at, lots of beers to try and cool locals to talk with. Thanks Matt and thanks Piece for helping make two San Franciscans feel at home!!! Can't wait to return and have more pizza and brew!!!
