Alright, let's face it, with close to 2,000 reviews, I don't think what else I can add. Just this: Get the foie gras with duck sausage. I'm pretty sure truffle aioli is the best invention in the world. Get 2 of those. Even if you're not that hungry. You'll regret it, and by this time, another 2 hour wait isn't that pretty. There is street parking, so don't worry about that. Don't wear a black tshirt. You will be standing under the sun for quite awhile, and you'll have to take turns hiding in the shade with your fiance whom, for some reason, also wore a black tshirt.
