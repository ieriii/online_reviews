This place is definitely FRESH FRESH FRESH as someone else said.I think one of their appetizers the fresh vegetarian rolls are really good. Avocado wontons and the shrimp springrolls are always ordered when my friends and I come in. We're regulars at this place and the owner Tuan always loves to send us out extra drinks. Their service is always consistent and working to get you fed. some entrees I've tried here in the last few months that I recommend to everyone are as follows:+pineapple callamari+sate shrimp+simply it's beef+simply it's beef noodle soup (for those cold days)+vegetarian delite+lemongrass chickenWe've come in just about every weekend and each and every time has always been fabulous! thanks Tuan!
