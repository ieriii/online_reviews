Nomma Nomma Nomma this place is delicious. If you're craving a sandwich, avoid those regular cold cut sandwich joints and come here instead. I went here on Sunday and had a Cuban, El Bistec, beef embpanada, and tostones. The sandwiches are less than $7 but for a around a buck more you can get a pop on the side or cafe con lech. The meat, veggie, bread ratio was all good. Not too much meat or bread, all deliciousness. Also, they come with fried plaintain chips very crispy and not v. oily. The tostones were a good size, like the size of a coaster and not too thick. I agree with another reviewer, I think they should add more garlic sauce. Also, I wish the steak in the bistec sandwich had a bit more flavor it was a little bland. The place is small and only has about 10 stools. Not a real good dine in experience. All in all a solid meal and I'll definitely come back. mmmm good
