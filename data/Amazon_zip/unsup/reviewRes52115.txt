Wednesday night at 7pm. The spot wasn't terribly busy. Our group of five had two members stuck in traffic. The hostess wouldn't seat us until everyone had arrived. We stood up and waited...and waited...and she kept asking annoying questions in an exasperated tone, like "Do you know when they'll be here?" and "Are you ready to order for the entire group?" Uh, what? Order for the whole group? While standing in the lobby, waiting? Can't I sit down and sip a beer first? This kind of ruined the experience for me. They wound up seating us anyway with only the first three of us who were there. Why we had to wait 40 minutes for that to happen is just beyond me. Rude hostess. Food was decent, but I've had better Chicago style pizza. (And I'll take New York style over it anyway.)
