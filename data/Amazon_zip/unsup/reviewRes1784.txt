Loved it! Foie gras was interesting, good if you like it, but a bit much for me. Enjoyed the spicy dog. Hubby LOVED it even more (he wants me to give 5 stars, I had a hard time deciding!) - said he agreed with the rest, best veggie dogs he's ever had! On one he got horseradish havarti cheese - so good! Line was to the end of the building, took about 30 min to place order, but didn't feel too bad. Also, like the choice that you can either get an upscale dog, which is kind of pricey, or stick with the basic meats, which are cheap. Wish you had longer hours, but we'll still be back!!!
