I just discovered their wings... their beautiful, big, bold wings. By now, I've eaten here more than a handful of times and if there was ever a reason to move to the Ukrainian Village, Lockdown would be it. But back to their wings. I split the wings half sweet ginger and half bbq. The sweet ginger had a nice and tasty glaze and the bbq had a sweet thick and tangy sauce. Both were finger licking good. I barely touched my burger because I couldn't resist those wings! Oh, I'm not really a fan of bloody mary's but I gotta say, if you like the thinner and not TOO spicy BM, I'd recommend theirs. Anyways, my verdict stays the same. 5 stars. And because it's already my third re-review, this will probably be the last unless my opinion changes. Lockdown is still my favorite burger/bar place in the city. Hands down.
