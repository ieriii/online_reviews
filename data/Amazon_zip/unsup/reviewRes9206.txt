LIves up to it's reputation. Baba Ghannouj delicious! Definitly a must order everytime. Have had better nan though. I ordered the Soltani Plate. The meet was tender and the dill rice delicious. If you're not a fan of dill rice, you can always get the plain white rice. Definitly coming back again and again....
