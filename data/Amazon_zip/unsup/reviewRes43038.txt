Awesome deep dish pizza! I ordered for delivery and got Art's special - sausage, onions, mushrooms & green peppers..Nice blend of all the ingredients. Their sauce is delicious! The taste of the sausage wasn't overbearing and the amount of cheese was plenty! I don't usually eat crust, but I had to this time. The only thing that sucked was that I waited about and hour and 20 min for my order to get delivered.
