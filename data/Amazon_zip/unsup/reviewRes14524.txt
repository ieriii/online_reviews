I love everything I have eaten there! The garlic bread is fantastic, the shrimp and scallops were so tasty, and they have a great selection of coffees (like the bailey's and coffee I had) that just hit the spot on a cold, snowy day in Chicago. The servers are really nice and helpful - Glenn's is definitely a little gem!
