One of my favorite restaurants in the city and anywhere else. Authentic mojitos and amazing food. What more is there?  Tops:  Dinner - Chicken Comal Lunch - Ropa Vieja Brunch - Tamales Verde The wait can be a bit of a pain, but it's worth it. Not a place you'd want to dash in and dash out of anyway.
