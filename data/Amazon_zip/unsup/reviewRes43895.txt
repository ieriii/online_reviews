Not impressed with this place. We mistakingly came across this place because we couldn't find a different breakfast place (turns out we needed to go one block futher) so we settled for this place since it looked good because there is ALWAYS a line out the door. Ill agree with another reviewer, the people who work there are snotty. There are NO exceptions to their menu -- you like all that comes with your meal or you need to order something else (allergies are no exception to the rule!). Their seating situation always seems to be worse than what it is.  There were at least 3 dirty tables that the staff let sit there for a good 10-15 min. NO WONDER IT WAS TAKING US FOREVER TO GET SEATED! The food was mediocur... overpriced in my opinion.
