Now that I only live a block away from the Hopleaf, I know that I'm in trouble. This is my idea of a perfect bar. The music is classy and not too loud. The food is innovative, but not too stuffy (and reasonably priced). The ambience is cozy, comfortable, even romantic. Most importantly the Hopleaf has turned this girl into a beer drinker. I have never seen such an extensive selection of brews. I now find myself craving a chocolate ale or creamy citrus brau weisse. Last night I sampled the famed CB&J and Stilton Mac & Cheese and knew I was officially hooked. Hopleaf will be seeing me quite often!
