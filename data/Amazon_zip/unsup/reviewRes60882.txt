I don't know if I just went on a horrendous night or if some of the other reviewers have low standards, but my experience was awful. My wife and I went with another couple and had a reservation (12/2). Things didn't start off well with us being seated over 20 minutes late, but grabbed a drink and didn't let that bother us. Had I known that was going to be the highlight of the experience, we would have left for another establishment. Upon being seated, our served notified us that there were a few adjustments to the menu. No salmon, instead walleye. No wagyu, instead short rib. There were one or two more, but these adequately convey that the substitutions were for much cheaper and inferior products. The people walking around with the meat were also very scarce. Normally when dining at a Brazilian steak house, one leaves feeling stuffed and feeling like a glutton. This evening, we actually had room for dessert, but decided to head elsewhere for fear of extending a very poor dining experience.I do love their roof deck during the summer, but have had much better "Brazilian" experiences at Fogo de Chao.
