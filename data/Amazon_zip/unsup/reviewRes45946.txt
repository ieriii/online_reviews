I just had dinner here since it's located directly across the street from the hotel I'm staying in. First impression: total Cheesecake Factory "knock-off"! Everything, from the decor to the lighting, the menus to the take-out bags - even the dishes - were very similar. For a second, I really thought I was in a Cheesecake Factory, especially since the place looks almost identical to the one in San Francisco (inside Macy's over looking Union Square, I believe). What else was similar? The food. Don't get me wrong, I love Cheesecake Factory - so I was a happy camper. The food might have been a smidge better though. We ordered a Manhattan Salad, a Club sandwich, the Chicken Enchiladas, and the Molten Chocolate Cake. Everything was really good; the only thing I didn't like was our server. He was nice but wasn't as attentive as I hoped he would be, and didn't really seem like he cared at all. Oh well. Everyone else was really awesome though. Attentive, friendly, quick on their feet - especially the front desk. We plan on eating here again during our stay in Chicago. If I'm ever back in The Windy City again, I'll definitely stop by. ETA I just Wiki'd Grand Lux Cafe and they're owned by Cheesecake Factory. Well... that explains a lot.
