It's weird staying at a hotel in a city you live or used to live in. "Am I now one of those tourists who would annoy the hell out of me as I went about my daily life?" you think to yourself. Actually, it's kind of cool being a tourist in your own hometown. It gives you a fresh perspective, as I learned while staying at the Amalfi: 1. There are no patches of grass in River North (only noticeable if you have to walk a dog). 2. There are a lot of hotels in River North (why didn't I notice this when I lived in Chicago?). 3. Despite the fact that it's a tourist trap, the nearby House of Blues hosts some great acts (blues and non-blues). 4. The Chicago River (and the buildings along it) at night is still a damn gorgeous sight to behold. 5. It's fun to be a tourist in a city you know how to get around. Staying at the Amalfi was also a fresh experience, as I had never been at a "boutique hotel" before: 1. It has a mod lobby in orange and turquoise. No floral upholstery here! 2. Hotel staff wear clothing that matches the hotel decor (I'm serious!). 3. Free FRESH breakfast is provided. I could have stashed a couple of those chocolate croissants and slices of cinnamon bread in my bag. 4. Cleaning staff are friendly. Actually, this is not a good thing because I hate having someone clean up after me. So I always clean up before the cleaning staff clean. No, it does not make sense. 5. No extra fee is charged for having a pet. 6. Free cocktails and appetizers are provided in the evenings. I'm still dreaming about the skinny breadsticks with sundried tomato and black bean and corn dips. 7. Cost was reasonable. I always compare to the Federal government per diem rates for lodging, which tend to be on the low side, and the special rates at Amalfi were actually lower.
