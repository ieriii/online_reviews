3.5 stars but i don't think my 3 star rating will even bring down their average so whatever. Friday night, 7pm, 3+ hour wait. Not worth it for me but because me and my party committed to it, we decided to just get drunk. The bar area gets crowded too so we ended up at another bar down the street... check out Rocking Horse. Anyway, finally got seated and the food was good. Everything was good. It's one of those places that has their own take on everything. Has good presentation and flavors were nice. We ordered like 5-6 dishes so I think I had a good taste of what they're all about. Whiskey and Scotch flights were also a good touch. Oh yeah... frog legs taste like chicken. dont be scared... try it. I can't recommend anything for anyone reading this. I'm sure if you're thinking of going there, you already have an idea what you want. Huge turn off was the 3+ hour wait. I might go back on a weekday but I think I've had enough of them. Good luck to longman and eagle... hope you guys great success. Oh... and everyone there is super nice. Even the host who probably had a person come up to him every 3 seconds asking how much longer their wait will be was very polite. It is true that a good restaurant is represented more by their staff than their food.
