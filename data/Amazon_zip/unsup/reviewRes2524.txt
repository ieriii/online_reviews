Yeah, yeah, 'encased meats' blah blah blah. You've heard it all before. It's delicious, worth the wait, all that. But i'm going to jump on my soapbox here for a minute. I hear the duck fat fries on weekends are delicious - they may be. But my issue is not with the cooking medium, it's the technique. While the term 'fresh-cut fries' sounds nice, it sucks. Fries need to be blanched in oil at a moderate temperature to cook through, then refried in hot oil to be crispy. It also helps to rinse them really well to wash off excess starch. That's how it works. 'Fresh-cut' then straight into fryer results in limp, greasy sticks of potato, NOT delicious, golden, crispy fries. I'm just saying. Serving fresh-cut fries doesn't make you a bad person; it just means your fries should be better.
