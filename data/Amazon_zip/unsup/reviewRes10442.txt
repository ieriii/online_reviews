As I was finishing my dinner tonight, I told my husband - I'm yelping this place when I get home. Uh oh - that means one of two things - I either had a phenomenal dining experience or I thought the place royally sucked. It was the latter. Unfortunately. I don't get it - this place came highly recommended from a couple of my work colleagues/friends. And I literally had to book this place a month out in advance to get a decent dinner rsvp on a Saturday night. Needless to say - I'm not going to trust either in the future. First of all, I do have to say that the outdoor patio is lovely. It is quaint and romantic. And, let's see, what other nice things to I have to say about this place . . . oh yeah, nothing. This place was filled with senior citizens!!! I mean, seriously, it was 7:30pm on a Saturday night when I went and I sh*t you not, the average age of the people dining there was probably 68. Old suburbanites. A double negative. But enough about the atmosphere. The food is the most important, right? It was crap. Crap! We got the antipasta appetizer platter. It had some cooked vegetables, proscuitto,and cheese on it. It was not horrible, but not good either. Very, very average. For dinner, I had the gnocchi and my husband had the pappardelle with lamb meatballs. Both were horrendous. The gnocchi was incredibly bland. It tasted like some boiled puffs of flour with some Hunt's canned stewed tomatoes on top. Yum. And the pappardelle - including the meatballs - was completely dry. The meatballs looked like something right out of a can of Dinty Moore. Yum yum. It was just bad. This is an Italian restaurant - I certainly expected some good, basic Italian pasta dishes. And I certainly didn't find it here. I've said it once, I'll say it again (at the risk of having this place fill up with a bunch of 70 year olds from the burbs) - Riccardo Trattoria is still my fave Italian spot.
