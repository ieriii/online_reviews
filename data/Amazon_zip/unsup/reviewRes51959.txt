Went here on a Thursday it is the thing to do if you are a tourist it seems! So be prepared. Sine this has been reviewed ten billion times I will just cut to some tips: Quick tip, do not wait in the line if you are with one other, you can go sit directly in the bar area. Skipped the hour line and sat right down. Service at the bar is bar service, exactly what I expected, relatively quick.  Place your order right away if you want the pizza, it takes awhile to cook, like any deep dish place. For the high tourist infused price it was fine, nothing to write home about but I will write this on Yelp as it does not use trees.  Please check where you sit, someone might have just used white out or a marker to leave their name. The try to be kitch is an attempt, but it backfires when your clients get the crap on their cloths. Other then that if you are hankering for deep dish, its worth a stop by but you can say done that no need to come back.
