For anyone looking to try something new to step outside of your food comfort zone, try this place. The food is authentic Vietnamese. Tank Noodle is located in North Chicago in the Uptown/Edgewater neighborhood at the corner of Broadway and Argyle.  I'm not going to lie, the menu is a bit overwhelming, especially seeing all the different choices that I wouldn't normally expect to see on a menu. I would suggest taking your time and read over the menu or else you might get something like cow intestines, oh yes that is a possibility.  The table turnover is relatively quick so wait time is minimal. The prices are all typically under $10.00. The atmosphere is very informal, nothing fancy. There were alot of children present, so very family friendly. The wait staff was always incredibly prompt, sometimes maybe a little annoying. So overall, give this place a try. I don't think you will regret it. Go in with an open mind and the willingness to try something new, you just might be surprised. I know I was!
