Are you ready for some meat? And I mean, A LOT of it...  You better be.... A bit pricey but definitely worth it if you can eat. Make sure you take a few trips to the beautiful salad bar and load up on veggies, otherwise you're probably not going to be able to poop with the overload of protein. Sorry, TMI. There was never a dull moment - different kinds of meat was coming out on large skewers left and right. The friendly wait staff carved the meat table-side, and have you utilize your tiny tongs to grab the goods. Everything was tender, juicy and delicious. The sides on the table are so good, I could get full from eating those dishes alone. Unlimited cheese bread, fried polenta sticks, mashed potatoes and fried bananas - YUM! I literally ate until I felt like I had to unbutton my pants. Our waiter recommended the papaya creme for dessert. He said it'll help digest our meal. The man wasn't lying! After devouring the yummy goodness, I really felt like I could continue eating. So if you're feeling beasty, go for round two. Why not right, it's all you can eat!
