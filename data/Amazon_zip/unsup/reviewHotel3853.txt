Terrific service, awesome location, great views of downtown. Everything here is reasonably priced for such an upscale spot. Two tips: try to get a corner room and order breakfast from room service at least once. The breakfast was so unbelievably good and fresh tasting! I will be recommending this spot to anyone looking to experience Chicago in style.
