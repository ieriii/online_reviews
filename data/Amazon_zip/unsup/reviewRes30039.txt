This is the second time for me to eat lunch at Frontera Grill. This time I had a pork loin with mashed potatoes and a chipotle sauce. It was absolutely outstanding. Bayless has an understanding of subtle flavors working together to produce unexpected and delicious flavors that other chefs can only dream about. I am very critical about my food, and continue to be impressed with this restaurant. It is expensive, but worth it.
