OK, so we've been to Big Jones on three consecutive Saturdays for brunch. The food is unbelievably freaking good. The cuisine is "coastal southern" which works out to lots of hearty southern fare with a more than your usual mix of seafood, crabcakes, etc. This isn't diner food -- while brunch is clearly a great idea, it's up a notch from the Golden Nugget. The food is, without question, among my favorites in Chicago. It's also locally and sustainably sourced, which is rad. Things I like there: they do a biscuits and gravy that is so complicated you feel like that traditional white gravy was somehow cheating you. It's a redeye gravy over sweet potato biscuits, and comes with a big pile of southern greens and andoulle sausage. Mwah! The Eggs New Orleans is also ridiculously good. Poached eggs over crab cakes over hash brown potatoes. So money. There's other things to like about Big Jones -- wait staff is friendly and prompt, decor is interesting, drink list is complicated and good (a Bloody Mary is thick with actual spices and veggies, not pulped mixer). But mostly, it's the food. The glorious food. I never have a problem getting seated right away, and at $10-15 for most of the good stuff, it's a steal. We did brunch for two with coffee, ticket was under $30.
