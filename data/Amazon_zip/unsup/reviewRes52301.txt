Compared to the other major deep-dish joints, Gino's East is in my opinion on the lower end. The crust isn't bad but everything inside is sloppy and mushy. The pies aren't as deep with toppings as the other places. But ultimately, it's still an awesome pizza that I will gladly eat any time. They also have a sweet lunch deal that includes a personal size deep dish pizza for like $7.
