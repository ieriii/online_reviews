One of the best restaurants in Chicago. Inexpensive, fresh, and delicious. I have had every single thing on the menu several times (used to work down the street & ate lunch here nearly every day), and there is not one thing they do poorly. The addition of a diverse salad bar (kim chee, octopus, and beet salad, anyone?) has only made this place better. I highly recommend the baba ganoush, curry rice and you MUST try the chicken soup.
