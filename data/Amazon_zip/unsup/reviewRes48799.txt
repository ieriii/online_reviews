One of my favorite restaurants in the city and it could get pricey but it's worth it every time. Best chicken I've had in this country, ever. Oh and the pig...phenomenal. I don't see how the purple pig is also four stars, this place is on a different level. But then again, none of the blackbird fam of restaurants have ever cooked up anything disappointing.
