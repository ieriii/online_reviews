Excellent food and excellent service! With that said, you should expect to wait anywhere from 30 mins to an hour to get a table here on the weekends. Luckily, we were able to snag two seats at the counter. The service behind the counter was awesome. Never did we have to ask for additional coffee, water, or condiments, they were very attentive and made sure we had everything we needed. As a huge breakfast lover, I am always torn between the sweet and the savory. What's the best compromise? Get both! The Bongo room lets you order french toast and pancakes individually as opposed to having to order full stacks. I ordered the BLT benedict, the bf ordered the breakfast burrito, and we had 1 red velvet hotcake to split. The BLT benedict was good. The eggs were poached to perfection, but the english muffin should have been toasted longer. It was very soggy by the time the plate arrived. The breakfast burrito seemed to be average. It is basically scrabbled eggs and guacamole stuffed into a giant tortilla. The best part of breakfast was the red velvet hotcake. It is as delicious as it sounds! If you're not up for having sweets in the morning, this is not for you. The red velvet hotcake was moist and topped with a cream-cheese'sh glaze. We devoured it in under a minute. All in all, I would definitely go back to the Bongo room and bring some friends with! Love it: Red Velvet Hotcake Leave it: Breakfast Burrito
