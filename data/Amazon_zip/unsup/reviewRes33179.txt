this place used to be unbelievable. & the salad bar still is. if you're willing to pay upwards of $20-they are smart to charge by the pound. everything on it weighs a ton. i want them to be as good as they used to be. but they just aren't anymore. & this is NOT based on one trip. i've eaten here several times after feeling this way just to make sure. but last weekend was the last straw. i was charged for food i did not purchase. i did not realize it until i got home. my shwarma sammie was disgusting, soggy, filled with bones & cartlidge. disgusting. i need to find a new middle eastern restaurant. anyone?
