I go to this place at LEAST once a week.. it is great. The spaghetti and meatballs are yummy, servers are always pleasant/friendly/attentive-but-not-overly so. Atmosphere is casual and I feel very comfortable here. Also the food is very reasonably priced.. Great food, good prices, good service, nice atmosphere...I'd definitely recommend the Past Bowl!
