No sign. A wooden plank for a door and thick velvet curtains separating the people waiting patiently to enter from the patrons inside the lounge. The place makes itself feel more exclusive than it have to but I guess it's all part of the appeal right? The set up in the lounge is excellent. When you first walk in, you see little pods of seats with high backs that allow couples all the privacy they want (or they would like to think). There is quite a bit of PDA going on in there but it works for some reason. I don't get grossed out, which is good. Lights low and music not too loud. Servers tend to you just the right amount. Great spot to catch up with friends! There are booths in the middle section for larger groups.  To the drinks - extensive menu which I like. I don't always chat up the bartender but from I've learned, Violet hour tries to support midwest breweries. There were a couple pretty good Michigan brews I've tried. I'm bad with remembering beer names so it helps that the waitor/bartender has no problem helping me select one. Haven't been disappointed yet  One gripe I have is that the last time I was there before I entered the lounge, I was asked by TWO not one but TWO ppl whether we have a friend joining us. I gave them her name. My friend doesn't show up at our table until 20 minutes later. We realize she was held up in the front for most of that time. The bouncer kept telling her there wasn't a group in the lounge waiting for her. They were apologetic but still, don't ask if you won't do it. Miscommunication? Maybe. I'll still give them 4 stars.
