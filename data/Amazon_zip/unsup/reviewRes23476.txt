Such a fun atmosphere! The staff here is so lively and friendly. It is spacious and decorated like you are dining al fresco. Come here with an open mind about the food if you've never had Greek food before, you will hardly find gyros as their staple dish. As a matter of fact, there's at least one page in the menu that is all lamb. There are a couple of "family" meals that offer much variety, as well. There are "safe" dishes too like chicken and seafood. Even Greek dessert is great! The waiters here are helpful and knowledgable. Lastly, I believe there is free valet parking too. What other reason is there not to come here?
