Great, but small restaurant on Diversey. Their lunch specials are great and love both the chicken and pizza. Would recommend the 1/4 chicken with bean and rice or 2 slice deal (normally under $7 with a drink). I really like the buffalo chicken pizza and Brazilian chicken pizza as well! Would recommend to anyone looking for thin crust pizza or rotisserie style chicken.
