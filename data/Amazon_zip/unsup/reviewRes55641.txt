Do NOT waste your money and time, There are better Cuban restaurants in chicago,  I was there last nigh with nine other people and we will never go back. The service was horrible. The waitress forgot one drink, she never brought us an appetizer and a menu. Hostess was very rude, she kept giving us attitude because our party was not complete. When one of us asked a questions she snapped and got into an arguement. The food is not even good, I had four scallops with a scoop of rise $22.50.
