I started writing this review after a dinner at Big Jones but decided to hold back until I had a chance to return for brunch. I'm glad I did... Big Jones got bumped up from 3 stars to 4. It's a lovely room, long and narrow but not the least bit tight. The wall of windows facing Clark Street help make it a bright, airy space. The food... is good. Not outstanding, but solid. Fried green tomatoes -- excellent. Crispy, tangy tomatoes in a creamy, spicy remoulade. Shrimp and grits -- good. I expected more from my shrimp... maybe more of them, maybe bigger ones... I don't know. It was tasty, but not completely satisfying. Pepper and goat cheese biscuits -- Wow. The goat cheese helped these little buggers brown a little more than your standard southern biscuit... and that's okay. Crunchy on the edges, fluffy in the middle. The rhubarb compote was a sweet counter to the peppery tang. Eggs New Orleans/Benedict -- I sampled both dishes at brunch and left happy and full. Both are built on a pop-over instead of the standard English muffin. The benedict added a nice piece of smoky ham, the New Orleans a moderately-mushy crab cake. The benedict was the superior of the two dishes.
