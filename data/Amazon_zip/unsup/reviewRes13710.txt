Good fish, for good fish prices. My date loved the clam chowder and char-grilled salmon (personally, the clam chowder was a bit too thick for my tastes.) I had the pan fried alaskan halibut with the bleu cheese-horseradish sauce on the side. Sauces are what do it for me, and it was good sauce. Service was great, atmosphere was great. The prices are high for dinner, but for good reason.
