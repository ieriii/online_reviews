The food was great, don't get me wrong. Discovering that the valets had stolen my brand new unopened air mattress and sheets out of the trunk while I was eating? Not so much. I highly recommend that if you go, you take all valuables out of your car before hand, because the food is great, and it's worth it if there is nothing worth more than 15$ in your car.
