Clean. Cheap. Quick. Delicious. I took a bud here that was saying he's never had good Chinese food. Now he's changed his tune. There are few things as tasty as roasted duck with crispy skin and juicy (fatty) meat. Went in on a Friday night without a reservation, but it's large enough to where we didn't wait more than 10 minutes. Medium BBQ duck. Chinese broccoli. Duck fried rice. Just over $20 and more than enough for leftovers.
