Of all the places my friends took me to in Chicago, our brunch/lunch here on a lovely Sunday afternoon was by far my FAVORITE meal of the whole trip!!! Between the 4 of us, we split 5 dishes plus 1 side + everything that touched our tongues was nothing less than spot on delicious for a hearty meal that not only filled our stomachs but touched our souls. Entering the restaurant, it wasn't crowded yet so we were given the option of sitting either outside on the patio http://www.yelp.com/biz_, at the long communal tables in the center of the large dining room http://www.yelp.com/biz_, or in the pig pen booths along the periphery of the room http://www.yelp.com/biz_. Of course we went with the awesome pig pens because who wouldn't want to have our own swinging private doors enclosing our table?!? Once enclosed, the first thing we ordered were mimosas: one of each of the regular Mimosa (white wine) + the Publican Mimosa (served with beer). http://www.yelp.com/biz_ Delicious accompaniment to the meal, but not really worth the price tag. And as for our 5 dishes, I'm going to rank order them from the AMAZING to the very good. Because truly... for a meal like this, there was not a single bad dish that we didn't like.  Country Ham Schnitzel http://www.yelp.com/biz_ If you've ever had katsu before... imagine it 1000x better! The crunch of the batter coating on the outside was perfectly light + crispy while the pork on the inside melted in our mouths. The fried egg on top was a nice touch as the gooey of the egg blended with the textures. As this was actually the last dish to arrive at our table, I'm glad we had inadvertently saved the best for last. Soft Shell Crab Sandwich http://www.yelp.com/biz_ Perfectly cooked! The whole crab was deliciously crunchy without losing the taste of the crab, itself. Slathered with a tomatoey-mayonnaisey remoulade + lettuce, the flavor almost reminded me of the pork belly sandwiches at Forage in Silverlake. The fingerling potatoes are cute touch, but I don't think we finished them all.  Bouchot Mussels (half order) http://www.yelp.com/biz_ Bigger portion than I expected for being a 1/2 order! The mussels were fresh + especially tasty when slurped with the some of the buttery beer garlic sauce pooled at the bottom. The roll on top wasn't memorable other than using it to soak up the last of the yummy sauce. Red Wine Poached Egg http://www.yelp.com/biz_ This is one of the highlights according to the Yelp reviews, + we weren't disappointed! While we couldn't really taste any wine flavor to the eggs, they were cooked perfectly + oozed over the sourdough bread. The key is to get some of all the ingredients (prosciutto, arugula, egg with bearnaise sauce + sourdough) in each each bite.  Fulton Market Quad http://www.yelp.com/biz_ Phallic innuendo with the plating much? LOL... That aside, this dish was a bit of a confusing combination of ingredients as essentially an upgrade of eggs with sausage + toast... plus a couple random little pickles. While each ingredient was delicious + cooked well, I probably wouldn't order this again since everything else had more of a cohesiveness on the plate that we enjoyed better.  And then of course, we had to go with the waiter's suggestion of a side of the famous Maple syrup Braised Publican Bacon! http://www.yelp.com/biz_ DELICIOUS! Sliced thick, it's essentially maple pork belly with a crunch on the outer edges + soft fattyness on the inside that made this as irresistible as many of great pork belly dishes I've had back in LA.  All the dishes here were so simple in their preparation + plating that the flavors of the pork + seafood most definitely stood out as nothing other than quality ingredients. I definitely recommend coming here with a decent sized group so that you can share + enjoy multiple different dishes. The idea of the communal enjoyment of food is key here from the table arrangements to even the design of the bathrooms. http://www.yelp.com/biz_ This was one of those meals that leaves you not wanting to eat again for the rest of the day just so you can hold on to the satisfying feeling of utter contentment with the remnants of the last bite still lingering in your mouth.
