Although I am not much of a meat eater, I was really impressed with this restaurant. The staff was beyond courteous and helpful. The drink they recommend that they describe as a Brazilian mojito was very good and I would consider it a must. If for whatever reason you do not want to eat any meat, you can have just the salad bar for $25 which is half price for a regular meal. The salad bar would be more than enough to satisfy most people. As for the meat, it was easily the best I've ever had.
