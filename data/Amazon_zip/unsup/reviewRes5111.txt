Was in Chicago for 2days and went here twice. First tried the bone marrow. As another reviewer said, don't think. Just do it. Like butter. Herb salad cuts the richness. Place was a buzz on a Sunday night. I sat at bar and watched chefs. So fun went back on Tuesday and tried the castelfranco salad and liver pate. Both delightful. I could feel my cholesterol rising but it was worth it. Don't miss this. Something for everyone if you don't dig swine like I do.
