I always walk out of here pretty happy. They have some of the best hamburgers. Thinking about it makes me want to run out and get one from there! As well, there used to be this mustard crusted chicken sandwich on a pretzel roll that was GOOD. They unfortunately don't serve it anymore :( The sweet baked potato is really good as well and HUGE. The atmosphere is nice, typical steakhouse feel dark and woody. Definitely a must try!
