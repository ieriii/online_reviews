ZED is pretty much amazing. I first came here with my friends 1 year ago for my 1st brunch in Chicago and it was amazing then and it is now. I recently came here for brunch with the same group of friends. Of course the raising the price to $29 ALL-YOU-CAN-EAT is not bad at all, that is if you want endless amount of goodness. This is not your typical place where you come for brunch. There are not unlimited momosas and you actually have to get off you arse to get food (side dishes)...The REAL food (entrees) get served to you! With 12 different entrees being served, it would be impossible for you not to find something that you love. Loves: -Cinnamin Rolls (if you have a sweet tooth) -Salmon (SERVED RAW) - - Ignore the "(VERY fishy)" ignorance below -All the meat ranging from chicken, pork belly, filet migon, duck, shark -Crab cakes -All the fish: white fish, salmon, ahi tuna -Cheese selection The Menu/Entrees change frequently so check out the website before going and love food with an open mind. There is so much to choose from that I will doubt you'll leave unsatisfied. (If you do, get off yelp b/c you obviously don't like food) -----My service has always been great here. Always welcoming and friendly and caters to needs (not like there are any given the entrees come to you and you go get your own sides). - - (Once again) Ignore the "we either served ourselves or had the guys with the meat service slicing things for us." from below. Because A) YOU DO SERVE YOURSELF and B) THE GUYS W/ THE MEAT ARE SUPPOSE TO SLICE THINGS FOR YOU. :o) Cheers!
