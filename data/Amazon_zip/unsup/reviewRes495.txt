First time there? Yes Will I go back again? Yes, we're already planning. I went with one of my friends and his wife- They've been 3 times so far. We had 2 bottles Billecart Salmon Champagne and the reserved wine pairing with dinner. It was excellent. There is nothing I could write that would do justice to the food and experience. Just go.. I flew in Saturday from San Diego for dinner and left the next morning. Well worth the time and experience.
