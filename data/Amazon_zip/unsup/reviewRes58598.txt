This place is very festive and has great food. But some of their practices and thoughts about themselves are questionable.We went here for Nye dinner and a overall great time. However when we asked if they had salsa were told they don't want to be known as a typical neighborhood Mexican joint. Yet they have flan and tres leches cake on the menu. Figure that one out. For dinner one of us ordered the steak special only to find out from the receipt it was a whopping $70. The most expensive meal on the menu is less than $50 so I'm not sure how they justify that cost. Finally, every item on the Nye menu was 25% higher than what is posted online....and it was the exact same menu. I would call that false advertising but they can get away with it by the disclaimer prices subject to change .Minus all the terrible antics we dealt with the food is very tasty and the ambiance is cool. I probably won't be back because there are so many other enjoyable restaurants in the city worth trying but it overall it was decent.
