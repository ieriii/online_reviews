DO NOT WASTE MONEY AT THIS RESTAURANT!!! I forgot where I was for a moment at this small neighbourhood restaurant. THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!!! We had heard great things about the food at this restaurant. My friend made a reservation a week before, and she also called to confirm our reservation before we arrived. It was for a party of seven people for my birthday dinner at 6:30pm on Saturday night. Myself and a friend arrived at 6:30pm (our reservation time) to get our table but they do not seat incomplete parties.The short man who was helping us needed an ETA, which we gave of 10-15 minutes. The cubs were getting out, traffic was really bad, and life happens. He told us this was not good enough and asked us, You would'nt be late for a job interview would you? WHAT!!!!???? I told him that this was a nice dinner out and for entertainment purposes, in which case he responded, Your table is cancelled! Where am I? The WORST customer service EVER!!!! I felt like crying - it was a Saturday night and we had made plans to eat and put a considerable amount of money down for my birthday. I will use all my verbal power to make sure everyone knows what a terrible place this is. I have never felt so unwelcome at a place where I'M PAYING TO VISIT.
