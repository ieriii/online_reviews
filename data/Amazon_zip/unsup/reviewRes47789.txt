This was my first time dining at Zen, I've walked past it sine it opened but never made it in until now. I went with my girlfriend and another couple who we were setting up on a double date. We started in the bar where we had a round of drinks. The California something was basically juice. I ordered an "Old Fashioned" or something like that, bourbon with muddled berries. It was great but my first was much better than my second so they can be inconsistent. As for dinner: the flavor, quantity, and varieties of meat seemed to be lacking overall. The catfish and chicken were good while all other dishes I tried left a lot to be desired. Ambiance was great If you have some vegetarians in the group, check out Zen, if not I'd go to Fogo de Chao, which has better quality, more flavorful fare (both in terms of meat and vegetarian options). Zed may have the variety, but many different kinds of food that lack in flavor and quality combined with the price tag when compared to Fogo makes it a 2 star destination in my opinion.
