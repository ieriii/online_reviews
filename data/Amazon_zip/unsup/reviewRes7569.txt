Simply a meat lovers paradise. Yes, the salad bar is very good (though my recollections from 6 years ago was that it was even better then). I managed to have at least one of every meat tonight, except beef ribs. Bottom sirloin was our table's favorite. Personally, I loved the pork ribs with salt and lime.  Other times I passed on the fried bananas, but tonight they we're very good. I have always loved the polenta side dish a great way to say your had your vegetables. ;-) Service was very good, though at one point a manager offered to arrange to get us some ribeye and we never did get any for his efforts. We had reservations for 6 that may have not been needed, but by 7 pm and later they are a must. The place was hopping at 8 pm when we left. A wonderful evening, made even better when my brother picked up the check.  Final tip: somehow arrange to walk a bit after dinner, we walked nearly a mile to get home and it worked wonders.
