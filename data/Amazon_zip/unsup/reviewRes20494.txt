Simply the best pub in the city. The interior decor is a perfect setting for any occasion whether it be a drink after work, a romantic meal or just a meal amongst friends. The buildings interior features subway tiles, exposed brick, lantern style light fixtures, and a wood top bar. The service in The Gage is exceptional with knowledge wait and bar staff that know the menu and are more than willing to suggest pairings for your meal. The menu features several traditional pub foods including The Gage Burger which in my opinion is the best burger in Chicago to more exquisite dishes such as pork belly, steaks, fish, and salads. The drink selection is great including many different import beers and wines to suit anyones taste. All together The Gage blends the atmosphere of an old world pub with the charm of fine dining to create a truly unique and enjoyable experience.
