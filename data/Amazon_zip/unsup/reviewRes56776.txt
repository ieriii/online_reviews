I've been trying to find an Italian style pizza in Chicago worthy of Pizzeria Mozza and Otto in NYC same place basically both Mario Batali. My girlfriend and i went there on a friday night at 8pm. we had to wait 15 min which wasn't that bad. We had the Prosciutto and mozzarella to start. probably some of the best fresh mozzarella that i've had in Chicago, the prosciutto was just ok. as for pizza we tried the mushroom pizza with black truffles and truffle oil and the sausage with basil. the truffle pizza didn't have any truffles on it, but the price wasn't $30 as most black truffle pizzas i've had. it was fair probably 2stars out of 5. the sausage was much better but both pizzas the crust was soggy. it wasn't under cooked or at least i don't think it was bc i saw some black charring on the crust.  so not sure why it wasn't crispy.
