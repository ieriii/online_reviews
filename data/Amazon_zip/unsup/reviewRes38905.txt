We came here for brunch, so this review only applies to the brunch items. I think they open at 9am on Saturdays. We got here at around 10am, and there was a 10-minute wait already. No problem, it was a relatively cool day, we sat outside on the bench, and after about 15 minutes, they seated us outside at the patio. Normally I'm not a outdoory eating person, but I didn't want to wait longer, so we sat down. Then it started raining before we ordered anything. Even with the cover on top of the patio, I could still feel the rain drop on my face. So I asked the waiter if we could be moved inside. He was very helpful and happily seated us inside at the last remaining table. Score! It was definitely way louder inside the restaurant. The tables feel smaller and closer to each other. I got the bloody lawrence (bloody mary with whiskey) and my husband got the bloody mary. We ordered the Sunny Side Duck Egg Hash with Duck Confit and Pastrami Spiced Pig Head. I LOVED my husband's sunny side duck egg hash! I normally don't eat potatoes unless it's in the form of fries, but this hash had a very unique taste to it, coupled with duck confit. I just couldn't stop reaching over and eating from his plate...This is not to say that my pastrami pig head was not good. It was amazing as well. The pig head was tender and melts in your mouth, the sauerkraut added a little acidity to it, then I chased it with the apple and watercress salad. Best flavor combo!  We also ordered the donuts as dessert, because every table around us had it. It was a HUGE donut, filled with strawberry jam. And the best part? It's only $3! When we got the check, it was only $55--including two drinks, two brunch items, and a donut. Score again!!! Will definitely come back and try their dinner.
