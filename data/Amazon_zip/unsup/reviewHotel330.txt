I have mixed feelings about this place. It is the cheapest place on that area of downtown, but it is in very sad shape. The lobby is not nice but is a LOT nicer than the room. This is the only Travelodge location I have ever seen that does not include a free breakfast. The elevators are really, really slow... up to a ten minute wait at busy times. But the front desk staff was excellent. The carpet in the room needs replacing badly. There were iron burns on it and it was filthy. The room was very noisy as we were on the same level as the elevated train, which corners by every 6 minutes. The room was large but most of the space was wasted due to a terrible layout that put one of the beds blocking the entry to the bathroom. The bathroom was nice but there was literally no surface space other than the floor to put anything. They put the tissues on the desk because there is nowhere to fit it in the bathroom. Strangely, the bathroom is quite large and would have plenty of space for shelves. If you are looking for a bargain, this is your place, but if you have the money, I would recommend staying somewhere else.
