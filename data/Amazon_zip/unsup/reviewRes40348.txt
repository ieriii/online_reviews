I think in high school, one of my profesoras del Espanol (Senora Smith me thinks) in "el barrio autentico" in the western 'burbs damned us all to being made fun of by those who were truly authentic (100% orgullo) by telling us the way to say something was so-so, or just OK was "asi asi." What she told us was the literal translation for the word "so" and therefore told us to say "so-so" literally. Which of course doesn't mean a damn thing to Spanish speakers. I should have known better considering it was coming from someone named "Senora SMITH," but I digress... As usual... Why bring this up now? Why not?!? You see- every time I have eaten La Pasadita, no matter what it has been, it has been nothing more than "mas o menos" (more or less) which is the real way to say "asi-asi," or just OK, serviceable, nothing special. Don't get me wrong, there are some redeeming qualities to this restaurant with location identity issues. Late hours is cool. Drunken people watching is cool. BYOB (maybe? I can't imagine anyone would try to stop a group of already drunk people from coming in with brown-bagged 40 oz. of Icehouse to help wash down their carne asada tacos). Ten year-olds with peach fuzz on their upper lips working 12 hours shifts to said drunk people at said late hours is cool. Well, not that last part. Besides, I really don't know if that dude is only ten, but he doesn't look a day over thirteen, that is for sure!
