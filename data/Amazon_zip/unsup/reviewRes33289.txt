Had a nice breakfast at Yolk. Got seated immediately at the counter in a very busy place. Had a great front row seat to watch the grill men, order preps, waiters and bus staff move a LOT of orders very quickly. It was a fascinating look at the organized chaos. The restaurant "pinch point" seemed to be the prep counter--it seemed too small to work efficiently, and the grill men were stacking up orders faster than the 2 prep guys could tray them and pass them off to the waitstaff. They had to constantly shout "Jennifer, pick up!" rather than whisper a subtle "33" over a microphone or light up a number board. My waiter, Danny, was prompt and friendly. My meal of an omelet "with the works" plus red potatoes, coffee and an unusual but good strawberry-orange juice--all very good. Final total of $18.28 plus tip seemed a little high, but perhaps I'm not used to prices in the South Loop anymore.
