I brought in 2010 here, and it was fantastic! It's a Mediterranean family style restaurant. And by that I don't mean a Greek family cooks you dinner. Mediterranean means any country on the Mediterranean, it's actually more Spanish and Italian heavy dishes.  Every item we ordered was fantastic! Not a single complaint. We started off with the Salt-roasted Beets with Whipped Goat Cheese and Pistachio Vinaigrette, the Sepia with Toasted Almonds and Fried Rosemary & the Pork Neck Bone Rillette with Mostarda. I mention these three because they were among the best, and I was most sober while I ate these, so I remember them best... Other offerings worth mentioning are the Pig's Ear with Fried Egg and Calabrian Chilies (my absolute favorite of the night!), the Quail with Salsify and Pomegranate & the Octopus with Fregola and Swiss chard. The service was perfect and the owner was extremely friendly. I can't wait to go back.
