Okay Publican, I owe you a 5 Star review and here it is... I brought the 'fam here for my birthday this year and so glad that I did. I found my new favorite beer at the recommendation of our waiter, Lagunitas Little Sumpin Sumpin mmmm. Our waiter was even able to identify a beer that my mom liked (not an easy task by any means). Food was wonderful: Mussels, pickles, prosciutto perfectly grilled fish cooked whole and prepared tableside. Publican- I will be seeing you again, that is for sure
