I was totally underwhelmed with my dining experience at Garcia's. The chips and salsa are the stand outs, but not much else was any good. Our server was really uninterested in our table, maybe she was having a bad day. The margaritas were weak and syrupy. I can forgive syrupy 'ritas if they're strong, sadly these had nothing going for them and were honestly difficult to finish. I ordered two tacos al pastor (pork), and was saddened to find lots of gristle mixed in with the pork. I don't think that I will be making a return trip to Garcia's any time in the near future.
