Who doesn't love beer on a warm crisp Wednesday evening? "HOLLA" Came to entertain a client on a Wednesday Night and I had the pick of the litter in choosing whatever I wanted. ("air high five ) I had a couple of apps to start off with, the watermelon and pork belly was pretty exotic and had a real interesting flavor palette. I could have eaten the whole dish myself. The potato cakes were pretty good too with the red curry sauce. My entree was the beef stew with mashed potatoes. I thought the beef should have more flavor but the sauce was pretty good itself. The mashed potatoes were really good though. My other companions amazing burgers and when it came out, I had a sad puppy face. (Epic Fail) Deserts was really good, I had the lemon scented Cheesecake with blueberry compote as well as the poundcake with berries. Yes, these meetings are slowly turning me into a fatass. But a tasty fatass at that! I had a great time here. The atmosphere, food, staff was great! But a note for next time, burgers and brew only... Who could has thunk huh? Note: Sitting next to the open sides is really nice on a warm summer night. It's the epitome of a being a brewery!
