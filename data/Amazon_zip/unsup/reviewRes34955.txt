i've eaten here a few times and i always feel the same way...it's mediocre. nothing great, no great flavors. today, i was in the mood for babajanoush and hummous and stopped in to pick up two side orders. i got home and again, disappointed. I'm not going back. flavorless. i had to add my own salt and fresh lemon juice to spruce it up. not happy. :(
