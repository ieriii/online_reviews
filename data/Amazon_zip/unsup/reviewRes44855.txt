I think Chicago-style pizza is a great novelty. If the mood strikes me where I want to feel excessively full, fat, and truly uncomfortable after 2 1/2 slices of pizza I can just go to Giordano's. Unfortunately, I don't feel like that often, hardly ever.  I prefer Gino's East based on the cornbread crust and ambiance. It just seems less touristy there.
