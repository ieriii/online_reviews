Dunno whats up with the 2 & 3 star ratings around this review... Best food I've had since I've moved to Chicago from San Francisco and I've been to more 'upscale' or expensive places since getting here. On an aside, I heard someone mention Chicago was recently rated "best food city" in the US and I almost choded on my sandwich. I guess whatever magazine published that received Daley's bribe. But let's move on: Le Colonial was one of my favorites in SF, and their excellent food, service, atmosphere continues at this location. To recap: Food - Appetizers:  Spring rolls are a necessity....these actually had taste as everything was fresh; including the mint. Tuna tartare was also excellent.  Entrees: She got the duck....never been a huge fan of eatin the little guys; but this was tasty nonetheless. most duck I've experienced even at nicer establishments comes either fatty or overcooked...this was neither and had a great tamarind sauce to complement.  I ordered the filet dish with yams and string beans. it was the right amount of food and it was mmm, mmmmmm bitch!  dessert: get involved with the banana wonton.  service: great! um, yeah. atmosphere: as everyone has already covered, its a beautiful place. if you have a smaller group try to sit upstairs. downstairs isn't bad but it doesnt have the same vibe than the 2nd floor. got it ? good.  the end.
