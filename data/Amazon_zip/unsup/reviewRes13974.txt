Nothing is more disappointing than ordering a "Three Napkin Meatloaf Sandwich" and barely needing one napkin.  Nothing except of course ordering crab cakes and king crab legs for a starter and never seeing either of them make it to the table even after reminding the waiter and the food runner both. Would have loved to sample that crab cake to see if it compared to the amazing Davis Street Cafe's, which I'm told this place was somehow affiliated with at one point. The food that did make it to the table in the painful hour and a half that I spent there for dinner was on the bad side of mediocre and not at all worth the fuss. Maybe people are raving about breakfast instead? I don't plan on finding out. Nothing is sadder than spending $50 on a meal and wishing you had gotten Boston Market instead. Oh and who runs out of shrimp cocktail before 7 PM on a Monday?
