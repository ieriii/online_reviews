Chef Michael Carlson, "everyone needs to fucking relax"... "your tripping me out and it's hard enough to cook on mushrooms"... "I don't know... maybe it's this guys mustache (points to my boyfriend)... maybe it's my beard... I dunno... I'm gonna go in here (kitchen) now". ...is how the first 5 min at Schwa played out. i have to be honest... this is EXACTLY WHAT WE EXPECTED AND HOPED FOR. my boyfriend and I knew this was gonna be a trip. we opened our wine. handed over a bottle of Makers as a gift (which was used within the hour... and btw they prefer Jameson for next time. never single malt though). what we did not expect is how small Schwa was. correction...HOW PERFECTLY SMALL it was. so intimate. so perfect. first amuse (red hook) arrived. unsure I hesitated and asked chef "drink or eat first?" Chef, "just eat the fucking cherry!" ahhhhh. ok! happily! 9 courses turned into 16. thank you so much to the entire staff. a group of chefs who truly love what they do. it is an unbelievably fun and unique dining experience. such a small space. such a smart and well executed concept. they know exactly who they are and what they want to do. there were a couple courses that I had not seen in any pictures of schwa recently. dishes they were "working on". and they were fun dishes for sure. it's so awesome how they involve you in their creative process. I am not gonna tell you what dishes they were... then you wouldn't be surprised, dumdum. in closing... if your not sure if you will like this restaurant DONT GO. let someone else who doesn't suck get your spot instead.
