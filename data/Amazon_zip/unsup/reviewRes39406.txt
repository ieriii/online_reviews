I went with two other friends here today. One is actually Korean. He was able to explain all of the eleven or so side dishes that come out. Most of it was cabbage. Different kinds of kimichi. They brought our a couple plates of meat, then they bring the fire. We trusted our Korean friend to cook the meat for us table side. He did a fine job. The experience was fun. I did however think that it was kind of expensive. I had one beer, the rest had water. Our bill was $100, plus tip. We didn't really seem to order that much. But it's a must check out if your into this sort of thing.
