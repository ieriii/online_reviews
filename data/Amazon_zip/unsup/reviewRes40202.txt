I can't even give this place 2 stars, and here's why: Our experience at Longman & Eagle was absolutely criminal for a place charging the prices that L&E charges. Burger/Fries - simple enough, low-class fare, right? They couldn't season either of them properly - the burger was way over-peppered (to the point of physical cringing), and the fries were so overly salted they were hardly edible. Appetizers - the scallops, while delicious, were absolutely criminal. $12 netted a grand total of two small (as in, barely bigger than a quarter) scallops. No scallops are that good. None. Now, the place has potential, and I wanted to love it - but if you're going to charge high-brow prices and try and attract a high-brow crowd, you've got to be able to season something as simple as a freakin' hamburger and fries without making them barely edible. I'm more than willing to pay top dollar for top notch food, but on no planet is $12 a fair price for two miniscule sized scallops. I really wanted to love Logan Square's latest tasty eatery, but to me, things like this are just unforgivable.
