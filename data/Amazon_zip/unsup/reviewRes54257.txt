Costa Rican food at it's finest! It's just like being there.... I usually dine in, but most recently I opted for take out. I ended up choosing the Palmito Salad with chicken. The beets add beautiful color and flavor with the cabbage, hearts of palm, tomatoes, avocado and tomato. The 'dressing' is basic: oil, lime and a bit a vinegar. It's simple, yet delicious.  Again, portion was large, but I feel like I'm getting my money's worth and enjoy having lunch for work for the following day. Forgetting that they only accept cash, I went in to pay with my credit card. The owner was so nice he told me to take my food home and stop by and pay whenever I had a chance. (They do have an ATM, but I didn't have my debit card.) I returned to pay later that night and he offered me a free batido de avena (oatmeal shake)! I know, you may be thinking, 'an oatmeal shake? eck!' It's actually amazing! It's has the creamy, cinnamon taste, but is so smooth! If no one told you, you wouldn't even know there was oatmeal in it! In the past I've had the Chicken Casado, the Chicken Tico and the Tilapia Tacos; all have been delicious and well prepared.  I have yet to venture to any beef items, but plan to do so eventually. This restaurant can be busy on the weekends, especially since it's BYO, so expect a wait. Waiting room is limited, but if you go when it's nice out, they let you hang out outside.
