Yep, one of the best hot dog places ever!!! They have all kinds of weird sausages with all types of toppings but it's amazing!! There's always a wait, so go EARLY! I went there at 10:40 and we still had to wait 1.5 hours but it was definitely worth it. i would suggest getting one of their specials ordered 3 types of hot dogs and shared it with cheese fries. 1. Tequila, Black Bean and Lime Chicken Sausage with Sweet Jalapeno Mustard and Salsa-Jack Cheese - FILLED WITH FLAVOR AND SO JUICY 2. The Cheesy Atomic: Damn Spicy Jack Cheese-stuffed Pork Sausage with Spicy Passion Fruit Mayonnaise and Habanero-Jack Cheese - VERY SPICY BUT DELICOUS 3. Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel - GOOD, not too much taste like the others but i like foie gras so it was still good. i can't wait to come back and try other hot dogs, i'm willing to wait in that long ridiculous line.
