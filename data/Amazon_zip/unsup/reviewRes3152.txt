Did Ben Epstein and Cam Calderon ditch their Crisp clothing line to open up a Korean Fried Chicken restaurant in the same name? Although I don't live in the comedic world of How to Make it in America, the wings here are better than their New York Bonchon counterpart.  The wings are colossal and it made me wonder if they came from Big Bird. My friends and I ordered the Crisp BBQ wings, Seoul Sassy wings, and a Seoul Steak bowl. The Crisp BBQ sauce is an Asian spin on a spicy barbecue sauce that reminded me of BW3's Asian Zing. The trendy pick of the group belong to the Seoul Sassy. The honeyed sauce prepared with ginger, soy, garlic and other spices left fashionable smudges around my lips. I saved that residue for later for when I got hungry again. The Seoul Steak Bowl is a massive crater of a bowl with bulgogi, rice, and other fixins. The beef was sweetly marinated but engulfed with a copious amount of rice.
