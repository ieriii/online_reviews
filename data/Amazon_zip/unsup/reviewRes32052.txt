i like the meat. i do. yep, i'm a carnivore... so when the roomie and i stumbled into the chicago diner, i was a little apprehensive to see it was a vegetarian (and very vegan friendly) establishment. however, my uneasiness with bean sprouts and tofu burgers soon subsided. with my first bite of the red pepper ravioli, i knew it would all be okay. roommate enjoyed her spinach and artichoke dip, as well. the place is a little crunchy, as can be expected from a vegiphile restaurant, but this prepster felt right at home. the staff was friendly. the booth was comfy. and the ravioli was tenderlicious.
