It's your regular Sheraton hotel. Nothing too fancy, nothing unexpected. It is a big hotel, so the lobby is always busy. Location is good, a few blocks away from Michigan ave, but on the lower side so you would actually have to take the stairs to go up to Michigan... and it's about a 10 minute walk to it. Pool is nice too, the view from the pool area is also very nice! Could be bigger but I find nowadays that almost all hotel pools are on the smaller side. We didn't use the hotel parking, because we were there on a weekend and the metered spots are free at night and on Sunday when we were there (it may have changed)... so we were able to locate street parking for free or for a nominal fee! Apparently the last floors of the hotel, the windows of the rooms are bulletproof because a President stayed there once, I think our guide said Busch ... I didn't pay attention which one. After I had booked the hotel, I had emailed the customer service rep and had asked if we can have a room with a view of the lake because we were going to be in town celebrating my husband's birthday. She emailed me back saying that we would be upgraded to a room with a view and when we got there, the view of the lake was partial and really disappointing. Anyway! If you get a good deal, stay there, otherwise try to get a hotel on or off Michigan ave, if prices are similar!
