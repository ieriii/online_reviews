When you live in Chicago....sometimes a Chicago-style hot dog just isn't enough. Granted, it's the best hot dog in the USA...but when the bar is set so high, how does one surpass it? Enter Hot Doug's. I don't care if there is a line going out the door. Foie Gras, Rattlesnake, Bison, Lamb, ApplePork, Chcken...these are a few of their specialty sausages that take the hot dogs at Hot Doug's to a whole new level. I ordered a hot dog here that tasted like a Gyro! Tzatziki sauce 'n all! Duck-fat fries are available on the weekends Yeah. And of course you get a Polish or Brat. I don't care if there is a line going out the door. Sometimes I still order a Chicago-Style! It's worth the wait!  Just look at their "Specials" tab on their website: http://www.hotdougs.com/ ***CASH ONLY***
