mmmmm. nachos! do yourself a favor and order the nachos supreme with shredded chicken. and the queso fundido. and a huge pitcher of the raspberry margaritas. put all of those things together and you have yourself a fantasically tasty night.  (apparently the burritos are pretty good too. but i cannot get past the nachos, myself)
