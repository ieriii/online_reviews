Cafe con leche is good. Bistec sandwich the first time was flavorful but disappointing, they use a thin steak and not much of it, compared to other Cuban restaurants in the area. I've had their bistec sandwich a small handful of times, their quality has been inconsistent. The first time the meat was good, after that initial visit their meat has been tough and unsatisfying to the point where I did not want to finish my sandwich. I do not plan on returning anytime soon, at least not for their steak sandwiches.
