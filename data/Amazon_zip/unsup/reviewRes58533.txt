2nd time with Davanti Enoteca. Took my husband back because I liked the wine prices and tasty italian eats. In my book, there is only one way for this restaurant to get 5 stars...consider your music choices. While I am a fan of Crazy Train by Ozzy Osbourne & Barracuda by Heart, they dilute the dining experience at this lovely Italian find on Taylor. Please change the tunes :)
