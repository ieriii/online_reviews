This place has the best falafel sandwich in the city. Always warm and I think it's important to note they always put the part of the pita they cut from the top at the bottom so the sandwich doesn't explode when you eat it. Smart. Guys are always cool. never rude and I used to always get the ginger beer with it. This is probably my favorite cheap lunch in the city. Falafel sandwich and can of coke is less than $6 including tax. The shwarma is also great, never dry. Only giving Sultans 4 stars because it's cash only.
