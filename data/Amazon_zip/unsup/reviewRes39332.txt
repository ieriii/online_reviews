Their food may be pretty good, but their service is the worst ever!!! One of the waitresses there had the audacity to talk back to us and gave us attitude, and we would have to ask for things at least 3-4 times before they actually brought it. I thought maybe they treat the non-korean customers better, but looking at some of the other reviews, it seems like they're just like that to everyone. As for parking, their lot is so small and it's so hard to get in and out. I don't think I'll be going back...
