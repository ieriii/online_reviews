Yelp tells me that 3 stars means "A-OK"; well "A-OK" just sounds like I'm holding a thumbs up in the air with a cheesy grin. Since that's not happening after my experience here, I'm going with 2 stars because I've definitely experienced better. The highlight of the evening was definitely the grilled octopus which was tender and seasoned perfectly. And, I'll even give 4 stars for the pasta with duck in it. From there, nothing else seemed to impress me. The pork was astounding and huge, but alas, it was not tender. The risotto...cooked too al dente for my taste.  The waitress...oh I can say a lot about her, but I'll simply mention that she was rude and gave us all attitude (she could at least pretend to like her job). What made it worse is the bread was so delicious until I saw her not wash her hands after taking care of all of her tables (cashing out, etc) and then barrel her hands into the bread stick bucket to grab them. Then she continued to handle the other bread with her bare hands. Look, I've worked in restaurants before and I know how it goes, but please do it where I can't see it! Please! All in all, I probably won't come here again, but glad I tried it since I've heard so much about it.
