The cedar plank salmon was absolutely delicious, and so was the manhattan chopped salad. YUMMY!!!! There was only a 10 minute wait on a sunday at 7. Not terrible, but not awesome Overall: 4/5 (We definitely want to come back to try other things!) Taste: 4/5 (Lukewarm food isn't always tastiest) Originality: 5/5 (I guess you can't find such an extensive tasty menu with such giant portion sizes elsewhere right?) Value: 3/5 (Average I guess...it ain't cheap) Service: 4/5 (Our server was polite but he mixed up two people's doggie bags)
