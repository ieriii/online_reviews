I loved the food here! We were given complimentary popcorn seasoned with truffle oil, parmesan, and pepper, which was a great, tasty starter. We went with the five-course tasting menu that came with a deconstructed caesar salad, butternut bisque, seared scallops, wagyu beef, and s'mores. We also ordered the fois gras with pop rocks, which was amazing. The lettuce of the caesar salad was perfectly seasoned and came with a delicious brioche twinkie. The scallops were cooked to perfection with a sweet coffee sauce. This is the best scallops i've tasted. The wagyu beef was perfectly cooked as well and came with a warm, comforting truffle consommee, root vegetables and sprinkled with freshly shaved truffles. The s'mores came with a delicious peanut butter ice cream. The only dish I did not love was the bisque because of its strong ginger flavor. The presentation of the food was interesting. All of the liquids came in science lab glassware - think Erlenmeyers and beakers.  The only downside was the portion sizes for the five-course tasting menu are very small. I felt bad for my husband because I knew he left hungry. If we go back, which I hope we do, we will either order the ten-course menu or order a la carte, which apparently is larger portions. The wait staff is dressed casually and lends an unpretentious vibe to what should otherwise be a fancy restaurant. Our waitress was friendly and helpful. We were served by a number of other people throughout the meal and they were all very nice.
