i have ordered two cakes from alliance - one for a wedding shower (almond cake with vanilla buttercream frosting...amazing!) and the other for my son's first birthday (chocolate with a hazelnut/praline mousse). both were outstanding - moist, delicious, reasonably priced, and beautifully decorated. the decoration on my son's birthday cake was fantastic (they replicated his invitation motif perfectly!) - we (and our guests) were incredibly impressed.honorary mention to their stock Niagara Falls cake, which is also a favorite in our house!thanks again, alliance!
