Mary Vasuta-Parejko (that's my grandma, bless her soul) is rolling over in the grave right now...because she never had Kolachy like these from a bakery. Despite the fact that this is now a standard bakery with some hipsters thrown in for good measure, at heart it's a Polish bakery, and it clings to its past life with these fine Eastern European pastries. Unlike most Kolachy you get from bakeries (or whatever those things are at Jewel), these were flaky, with delicious apricot centers that didn't have that nasty consistency of gumdrops and jello like some I have had. They only had Apricot and Raspberry when I was in, but it was around 5pm so I suspect they have a greater variety earlier in the day. I tried spritz cookies and a vanilla cupcake as well. The spritz were crunchy - a nice change from the typical shortening-laden crumbly ones. They make great Intelligentsia coffee drinks, and do serve iced drinks even though the sign inside doesn't state it. They also have free wifi and an outdoor cafe where you can people watch the mommies, strollers and overpriced clothes on Division. What to steer clear of: cupcakes. My vanilla cupcake screamed "Jewel Bake Shop"...and that is by no means a compliment.
