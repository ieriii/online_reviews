The Purple Pig has been on my radar for a while, just about a year I'd say. I was excited. The anticipation was killing me. My hunger was killing me. And ya know what else was killing me? The wait. The place is pretty much always packed, so prepare to wait. What's nice is that you have the opportunity to take in our fine city while waiting outside...that is, if it's not winter. Lucky for my fiancee, friend and I it was decent out...just a bit nippy. We wound up waiting like an hour, and were seated outside next to a couple heating lamps. Oh wells. Our server was nice and attentive, recommending dishes as we perused the menu. TPP's headline is "Cheese, Swine, & Wine." We opted out of the first and third, jumping into a number of swanky swine dishes. With that said, realize that much of the menu will be fried, salty, or savory. Don't be surprised when your swine comes out. Some highlights: I've gotta say that I thought I knew bone marrow...boy was I wrong. I've tried it a couple times and thought it was meh, but I think that's because I wasn't eating quality prepared bone marrow. So savory. Melts in your mouth. For being all about swine, TPP does chicken and red meat pretty well. Chicken kabobs with fried smashed potatoes were delish, as was the wagyu sirloin tip. I understand the Bib Gourmand love from the Michelin guide...kinda. Walking out, I felt a little hungry, and my pocket felt a little lighter than I'd hoped. I'm not sure how well this fits the Bib guidelines ($40 or less for 2 courses, glass of wine, and dessert). Oh well, I'll probably be back to feast on some more swine (I'm still not comfortable using the word "swine.")
