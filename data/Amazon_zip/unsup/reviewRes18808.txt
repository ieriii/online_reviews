Yup, still 5 stars. But let me tell you about what's going on in there on Monday nights. Open-mic comedy 3 Mondays a month, with a showcase on the 4th (I don't know which is which....I feel like the next showcase is on June 14th?). It's called the Bad Apple Rotten Comedy something something...you can find it on facebook. I went to the first showcase, and laughed until tears flowed, my cheeks hurt, and my sides ached. For real. And, I'm not drinking these days due to the buns in my oven, so...it's actually very funny! No lube needed!  I've only been to one of the open-mic nights, and there were some really, really funny comics. (of course there were some duds, but, come on!) Anyway. You should go to that.
