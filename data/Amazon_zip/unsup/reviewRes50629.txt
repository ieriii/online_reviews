Well not as good as what I want it to be, I have fairly given Big Jones four chances to make me happy. The only reason why I am upgrading you from your previous 1 star review is because I am willing to admit I was a little harsh and your little bignes are so good. Breakfast and brunch is your saving grace... but I can't change what I feel about your dinners. Previous 1 Star Review: Utter Disappointment were the words uttered from the four of us that dined at big jones this past sunday evening. Who ever wrote the menu is genius because everything sounded amazing, unfortunately the food doesn't live up to the descriptions. What is popcorn rice? which seems to be the standard side with all the entrees....we still don't know as it was suspiciously like jasmine rice in appearance, taste and texture. The consensus was that every dish was like someone was trying to mimic Paula Deen's foodnetwork show without ever having experienced the food for themselves. It was like no one took the time to learn about this food in it's true cultural setting with all the romanticism surrounding it. The food was not even technically correct and the biggest problem: SOULLESS. The flavor is not there in this overrated daily candy hyped restaurant. And it is pretty sad when a braised rabbit comes out dry and tasting of leftover chicken. What was even worse is that while we were eating the staff was putting up the chairs on the tables and sweeping the floors at 9:45. Obviously the front of the house has no charm as well.
