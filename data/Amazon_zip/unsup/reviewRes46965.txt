How did I pass over Uncommon Ground for so long??? Came here for lunch once, then breakfast the next weekend and was impressed with the whole shebang. The setup of the restaurant as well as the cafe are open and inviting - even when the place is packed, you feel like you have room to breathe. The service? Phenomenal - drinks were prompt as well as the food - a great sign that Uncommon ground can keep up with what I'm sure are busy dinner shifts. But the food? Oh my, the food! The macaroni & cheese I had for lunch was SPECTACULAR! 3 kinds of cheeses, bread crumb topping, and apple slaw? it was like consuming a hug. And then the french toast the next weekend was also just as fantastic. I cleaned my plate both times! The ABSOLUTE best part though, had to be the chocolate chip banana bread pudding. That put me over the edge. I was pleasantly full after both meals that I just wanted to take a nap in the sun to continue on with what started out as blissful mornings!!!
