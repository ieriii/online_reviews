Service was awful, the wait was awful, and I've had better Chicago-style pizza in Saint Louis.Yes, deep dish pizza takes a long time to cook but we were probably at our table for less than 30 minutes of the TWO HOURS we spent at Giordano's - i.e., we weren't enjoying a leisurely meal and a bottle of wine, we were standing around hungry for an hour and a half. The wait staff is too busy moving customers in and out to really "take care" of you; perhaps they're just too European for me.And yeah, I said it - I've had better deep dish in Saint Louis. Blackthorn Pub on Wyoming Street has great deep dish that is MUCH better than Giordano's bland, overhyped stuffed pizza. Not worth the wait.
