I can't say enough about how much I like this place and how much I rave about it and how much everyone I bring here raves about it. You know what else we all rave about? My choice of pizza. Try it. You'll thank me. Although you may have garlic digestion issues for the next couple of days, it's worth it. Trust me. Ready for the ingredients? Here we go! Order the white pizza with chicken, ricotta, and fresh basil. It's delicious. Ricotta on any pizza is amazing, but mixed with chicken, basil, and garlic makes the dish unbeatable. Go there and try it and then tell your friends to try it and then come back on here and thank me. ;) And their beer! Oh lawd- do I have room to rave about their beer?! It's delicious with naughty little names that make it fun just to order. Like "Camel Toe." hehe. Oh, and the womens' restroom has one special stall with an elephant. Look for it. It'll amuse you. I'll post a pic.
