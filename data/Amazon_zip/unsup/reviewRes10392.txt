To all y'all haters out there (i.e. those who compared this place's al fresco to South Beach or Puerto Rico)...this is Chicago, not the tropics, and Piccolo Sogno has the hottest patio in this great city. That outdoor seating is unreal. I went there for the second time tonight and was wowed once again. Sat promptly, great table, server was outstanding and friendly, food was exceptional, prices were not outrageous, we weren't rushed out of there, people-watching was fantastic (sat next to a gentleman whose name rhymes with Pritchard Baley, very friendly guy actually)...in short, this restaurant does it all well. Take your family for a birthday, take your out of town guests, impress your clients, take your wife if you want to score big points, go by yourself and you'll still have fun. Can't say enough- just try this place.
