the place that started me off...my family owns this spot....gave us the means to open La Palapita...im here every night especially on weekends as security...love this place cuz without it i would probably be nothing...awesome food, quick service(depending on which of the 3 u go to), and safe atmosphere....great for a night out with the guys/girls and especially after hittin the bars and clubs on the scene...great food..and im not sayin that cuz it family...it is genuine....grandma cooks like this back in texas and so do we in our private parties...family recipes make for great food...and hey...its been open since '76...obviously we'er doing something right...-Peace
