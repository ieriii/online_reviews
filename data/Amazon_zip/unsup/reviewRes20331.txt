Food was ok but nothing to recommend. The service was great, atmospher fun, location perfect.... I feel like maybe the head chef was off sick or something. The food concepts sounded wonderful and the other great reviews this place has gotten makes me feel like I went on an off day because every thing my group ordered was sub par at best. I hope other people don't experience the same thing I did because there was nothing of the five entrees ordered that I can say anything good about.
