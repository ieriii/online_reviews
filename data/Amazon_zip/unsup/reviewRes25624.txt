I had the best dinner in Chicago here. We got the chef's tasting menu and I don't exactly recall what the dishes were, there were 9, but every dish was exactly what I wanted. We were there for 3 hours, not because we had to wait, but because we were having such a good time. I remember leaving the place warm and happy. Next time I go, I want to get the whole suckling pig. Those who may be interested, let me know.
