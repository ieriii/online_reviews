I am a huge fan of any place that serves all you can eat meat -- and really, really GOOD meat too! I hadn't been to Texas de Brazil before but had to at the last minute put together a dinner for about 15 people for after a work event for some clients/prospects. I chose Texas de Brazil and it was definitely a fantastic choice. Everyone loved it.  They have a HUGE selection of different kinds of meat -- it all came out hot and you even had a choice of how "done" you wanted your meat. Awesome.  The salad bar -- ridiculous -- however, don't fill up on it. Keep your tummy empty for the mounds of meat that will come your way. Trust me.  I like how they have a lady on a trapeeze in the wine room -- never seen this before. Pretty cool.  Bathroom are located upstairs -- we were on the first floor. A tad annoying but whatever -- they were very clean and well kept. I'm big on how a restaurant keeps its bathrooms.  I would recommend this place to anyone. It was wonderful. I left in a total meat coma. Mmmmmmmmm...........red meat..........
