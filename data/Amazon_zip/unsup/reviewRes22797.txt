I came here with a group, because that's just the best way to dine in Greek Town!  The food was great, the atmosphere was great and the service was great! I got lamb, because I wouldn't dare eat chicken or stick to veggies at a Greek restaurant! If you're going, make sure to wither go all out on seafood or get LAMB!!!! You didn't come to Greektown for some fancy chicken, because you could get that ANYWHERE!!! I didn't do dessert, because everyone had that look like they didn't want to be the only reason everyone is waiting to go home and pass out. =( Unfortunate. Greek Islands and Santorini both have my favorite combo of good food and great atmosphere, so if you want to feel like you're in one of those Comfy Christmas movies with a fireplace and warm decor, this place does it for me =)
