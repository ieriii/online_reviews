The portions are huuuuuge. I'm definitely a quality over quantity kind of girl, but I can't complain when a restaurant tries its best to do both right. Every time I go there, I think I'll try something different, but I always end up getting the fajitas. There's not much to say about ambience and decor except that it's always bustling, the service is quick, but sometimes lacking and the salsa is so spicy, I swear there must be a conspiracy for the horchata business. The refried beans are probably the best I've had (and this is coming from a girl who lived near the Mexican border). If you're really good to your body, you'll leave the place with leftovers for the next time. The price ranges from about 8-15 for an entree/taco dinner. I always make room to go to BomBon across the street.
