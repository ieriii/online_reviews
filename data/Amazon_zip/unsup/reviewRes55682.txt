Be careful of this place. We went for a midweek dinner. Even though they had plenty of tables the entire time we were there, we were forced to sit outside between the noisy EL and the smokers next door. More troubling was the lack of prices on the fish menu. Only the daily special had a price to it, and when we got the bill, they had charged us more than the posted price. When I pointed out the discrepancy, they claimed that the clearly posted price was incorrect and refused to change our bill. Added to this was the slow service, mediocre food, and a refusal to let us bring our stroller into the restaurant. Needless to say, we won't be returning.
