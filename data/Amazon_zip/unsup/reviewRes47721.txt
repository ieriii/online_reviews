ive def. experienced better. The music was confusing as hell. On the speakers, i was listening to Rihann's top 100 hits and in the lounge, I could barely make sense of what the live singer was trying to perform. the waiter was about half an hour late on the bread but did apologize after I asked him if this 48.00/person meal came with bread. Also, the food was salty and just not very good. The concept of Zed451 compared to all the other brazilian steakhouses is that the actual line cook/or "chef" comes to your table to serve the meat/fish/etc. however, everytime they would approach the table i felt they they were trying to hard to sell their dish. Meh, i've experienced way better.
