Looks nice, but the food is just plain weird. I think they thought, "Let's take the strangest Southern foods and lump them together, people won't care what they taste like!" I'm not going back until they put squirrel or some other road-kill on the menu. If it's legal in Kentucky, it should be on the menu here. Otherwise, where is the novelty?
