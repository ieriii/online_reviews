ooooooooooooooooh, my god. All I have to say is that you need to order the Cappellacci di Zucca (pasta stuffed with pumpkin in a burnt butter sauce with butternut squash, sage and pinenuts). It is absolutely incredible. This might be one of the best dishes I've ever eaten. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because our service was lacking. We had to track down two servers (couldn't find ours? He disappeared) for wine refills. And the restaurant is a little too dark inside, in my opinion!
