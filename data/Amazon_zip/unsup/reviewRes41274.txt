Great concept, promising food, lousy service, could use more professional wait staff. Not worth the $$$$, more like $$ and a half. Made dinner reservations for 8:30 and our table was not ready until 9pm. We asked where we could wait and were told to either stand right in the middle of the restaurant (over everbody else's tables) or wait on the street.  It looked like we were the last seating of the evening and the execution of the food got worse and worse as the evening progressed. The main entree came out in random sizes.  Then they magically lost one of our unopened bottles.
