I havent had better falafel in the city., then again I havent went to many places where I've had the option to sample new falafel. Mayhaps its time I change that? Either way, I like it. The spicy option was too damn hot for me, my mouth was baking. I guess I'm kinda wimpy when it comes to spice lately but still. I always say I'll try something else when I come here but I keep getting the same delicious thing.
