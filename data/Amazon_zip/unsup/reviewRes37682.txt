Heard this was one of the best bars in Chicago to go to for a nice beer selection. I don't actually recall seeing the beer menu, but we did order from the seasonal list & I asked the bartender for suggestions. I had Bell's Two Hearted & my friend had Three Floyd's Zombie Dust; I wish I would have ordered beer that is not so easy to come by. All in all, I like the feel of this bar. We went in the late afternoon, but it was relaxing. I would definitely go back.
