We couldn't come to Chicago without having Chicago style stuffed pizza, now could we? Who cares if it takes forever for the pizza to show up on your table (takes 30-40 minutes to cook I guess), it's DELICIOUS. There is a nice courtyard type area right in front with a fountain feature, which came quite in handy while we tried to entertain our 12.5 month old son during the wait. The crust makes the pizza!  p.s. that's our little guy on my avatar at this Giordano's location. He loved it, too!
