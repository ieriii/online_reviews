Great food, service and decor. Drinks were across the board - draughts beer, b+ wine list. Very nice beer menu. We started with tuna carp with ground cherries - genius, though *very* small portion. Then onto watermelon tomato salad - which seems to be ubiquitous in locavore restaurants these days - nonetheless done proficiently. "Three ham" plate was delicious, country ham was unusually (in a good way) thin which helped offset the required salty taste. Very nice bread and goat butter went perfectly. "Ribeye steak" looked great on the plate, a little tough and a bit overcooked, but totally palateable and certainly well seasoned. The "half chicken" turned out to be the strongest plate, wonderfully complex dry rub, perfectly cooked, juicy, not dry. Pomme frites were pretty decent, though certainly not quite the proverbial "crack" that previous diners promised. Waffle desert just okay, but not bad. Nice staff, outdoor tables lovely, nice clean bathroom with great handsoap.
