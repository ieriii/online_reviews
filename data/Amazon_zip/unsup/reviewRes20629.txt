There are so many byob sushi places all over Chicago, and Coast is one of my favorites. Some places are full of what I think of as cheap imitation sushi: gigantic rolls stuffed with things like cheese and fake crab, covered in sweet sauce and suffocating in tempura flakes. Blech. Coast is not like those places! They have a great selection of rolls with fresh ingredients, that are not overdone. There is also authentically prepared, delicious nigiri. I had both uni and ama ebi at Coast, and they were amazing. This is definitely a keeper in the Bucktown neighborhood.
