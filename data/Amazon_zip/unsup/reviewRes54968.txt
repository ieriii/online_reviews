2 words. F*@!$%*& rad. If you don't like interesting food go down the street and get some pizza and quit your bitchin. The chef is outstanding with how he puts things together. I have been in this place 5-6 times and everytime have a totally unique experience with his food. Favs: PORK BELLY crispy on the outside really tender and any prep they have for it is perfect and well worth the $22. Scallops melt in your mouth, get freaky and try the duck testicles they're rad, agnolotti super tasty, wonderfully put together cocktails... their old fashioned is the best I've ever had and I don't even like whiskey all that much, dark and stormy, and whatever the one is with the housemade blueberry syrup.They also keep the kitchen open late even on Sundays - we ate on a Sunday at midnight. One of the best restaurants in Chicago hands down, I feel honored to have them in the neighborhood.
