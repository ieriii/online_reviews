One of favorite pizza spots to visit when I am in Chi-town. I even had a dinner during my bachelor party cause it is pretty much an institution.  Thick, hot pie, oozing with cheese and great sauce.  Your typical red and white tablecloth kinda joint....it has a lot of character and meets all expectations of an italo Americano pizza stop.
