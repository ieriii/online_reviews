Absolutely loved this place!  **Warning - do not go here if you're aren't patient. We waited about an hour and a half for a table of two, but the 4 top behind were told it was 3 hours! They do not take reservations. ** But it was OH SO worth the wait! Immediately after we put our name down, the bartender made eye contact and handed us drink menus. They have a great drink and beer list. We lucked out on a seat at the bar, and the service there was great. We had the scallop appetizer. Delicious! The bartenders are friendly, knowledgeable, and don't come across as "too cool for school," which you'll get a lot of in this neighborhood! For dinner we split the short ribs entree and the pork belly entree. The short ribs were the only thing that fell short, lacking seasoning, everything else on the plate was delicious. The pork belly is something I'll go back for!!  And for desert we had something that involved fried dough and goat cheese ice cream. To die for!! This place is one of the best places I've ever eaten...and I thought Girl & Goat was good...this takes the cake. I will be back!
