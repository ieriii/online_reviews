Go here for the pho? Pho sho! (ok... lame pun. I apologize profusely) This place has really good broth for their pho soups. I've been to other places around Argyle, but it has been a while since I've been to any of the other places because the soup at Tank satisfies my pho cravings. I generally get some sort of beef based pho (tendons, brisket, etc, etc) and I have not been disappointed once. Make sure you add the sprouts, basil, lime, jalapenos, siracha, hoisin until your soup tastes juuuuust right! The bowl sizes are pretty big for a pretty cheap price. You will not leave hungry!
