Sadly, it took me long enough to review Sprout that most of the details of my experience are no longer relevant since they change the menu frequently, but I truly enjoyed the experience. We tried to get into Girl and the Goat and got laughed at when we called, so we checked out Sprout. I haven't been to GATG yet, but I'd go back to Sprout anytime. I tasted many of my dinner companion's meals, and there wasn't a weak dish in the bunch. I was skeptical of the desserts... I ordered a chocolate milkshake, which to me, sounded like a "chef's dessert" rather than a proper dessert, but it was hands-down the best chocolate milkshake I've ever had. (And I didn't think there would be a difference!) I'm looking forward to going back to see the new menu items. I also JUST found out they have brunch! I now intend to check this out ASAP. It's kid-free no less. Now I enjoy kids and all, but I get severely annoyed when I have to make room for your double stroller in bongo room at noon on a Sunday, when you should know better than to think a PERSON can jam in there to wait for a table, let alone a double-stroller. Anyway, looking forward to checking out brunch sans stroller.
