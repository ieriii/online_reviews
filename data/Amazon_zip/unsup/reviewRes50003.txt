I've been going to this place for years. Food is superb. SERVICE IS TERRIBLE. Prices get higher all the time. This time, I went on a Thursday evening. There was a sign that said "Please wait to be seated" but no host. The bartender walked over to the host stand hesitantly and could not find the waitlist, scribbled my name on some random sheet of paper. When asked how long the wait would be, he said "oh, its gonna be a LONG time." He didn't say "15-30 minutes" or anything of the sort. Funny thing is, at the time, half the restaurant was empty. This is not a new restaurant, you would think they would know how to operate a waitlist, but they do not. When our table "is ready," we start to follow our "host," but he disappears into the kitchen before leading us to our table and we're left stranded in the middle of the restaurant. When we approach another server, she alerts another lady who leads us to some table in the corner in a totally empty wing of the restaurant. Before we are seated she asks us to please make sure we stay less than two hours. I didn't understand her request at first-- thought she was saying it would take two hours to get our food! I laughed, surprised. She had asked us to leave before we even sat down! We sat there for 5-10 minutes before anyone came to our table. First thing we were asked by the server that finally came to our table (after she had looked around) was-- did we already have a server. Apparently, at Las Tablas, servers are not assigned to specific tables? We ordered two maracuyas (passion fruit juice) in water. One was visibly very diluted. Both tasted more like water than anything else. Ordered wine. It arrived after our doggy-bags. We thought waitress had forgotten. She said bartender was really "busy." Food was delectable, but there really is no excuse for the service. Maybe it is better on a Thursday AFTERNOON??
