Always a wait (I've never had to wait more then 20 minutes) yet totally worth it. This spot is located in a very trendy area of wicker park, surrounded by boutique stores and plenty of other eateries. However it's unique food options (omelette's to breakfast burritos to specialty pancakes), friendly staff, and quick service totally make it an awesome place to have breakfast/brunch.
