Transcendental caramelized cheese crust! I usually ordered a pie with just green bell peppers. The dough itself is a little bland, but the sauce, cheese, and high quality toppings make up for it. And did I mention that crust?! Mmm. One of my favorite Chicago memories is of eating Pequod's and watching Flatliners.
