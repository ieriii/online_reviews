SO NOT WORTH THE WAIT. We waited for an hour and 15 minutes just to be seated and I don't know how long for the the pizza. The do cook the pizza made to order, so I understand the food wait, but tacked on to the wait for a table and the canned sardine like atmosphere- the experience turned out to be not so good. They restaurant is super tiny and super crowded. I will say that I had an excellent salad!!! The lettuce was fresh and all of the leaves were perfect. Given that I am not a fan of deep dish pizza, the rest of my meal was blah. I found the dough to be under cooked and there was way too much sauce. If I were being forced to eat deep dish pizza, Pequod's would not be my choice.
