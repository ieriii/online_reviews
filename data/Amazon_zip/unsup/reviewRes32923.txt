beautiful restaurant and on the whole, really nice food. with the exception of the miso soup, everything we ordered was very tasty but the corn fritters were really our favorite (kind of surprising). the only downside: even with a reservation made well in advance and confirmed the day of, we waited 45 min for our table and the bar was too crowded to have a seat and wait with a drink. once we were seated however, the service was good and our waitress was very friendly and professional.
