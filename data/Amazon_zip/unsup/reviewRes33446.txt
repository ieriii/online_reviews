Everyone critiques the falafels because that's what this place is known for. But just so you know, they have other yummy things, too! If you go...try out the hummus (DE-lish!) and get a pie -- I've tried both spinach and meat and both are very tasty. Very VERY tasty. So tasty that you should probably just get both. In fact, get 4 and take 2 to go so you can have them late at night. Mmmmm...midnight snacks...
