Three of us came here on a Saturday night when the place was packed. We had to wait 20 minutes outside the restaurant, but luckily it was a warm evening. Here's what we ordered: 1) House special duck in beer sauce (in hot pot with bone) 2) Boiled sole fish fillet in Szechuan sauce 3) Stir-fried peapod leaves 4) Sliced pork with dried bean curd and chives I definitely don't recommend the duck in beer sauce. If fish wasn't cooked properly and served fishy, I wonder what's the right term for duck? The duck was literally swimming in a bowl of hot oil and we had to fish them out. Worse part was there weren't even that many pieces to have. I really like spicy food but oddly enough, Lao Szechuan's wasn't capturing. I think my favorite dish of the evening was the sliced pork with dried bean curd and chives. P.S. The wait staff was very patient with our questions even though it was a busy night. They were understaffed while tending to a party on the second floor. Kudos to our waitress for recommending the sliced pork with dried bean curd/chives!
