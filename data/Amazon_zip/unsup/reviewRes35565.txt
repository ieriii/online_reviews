I wanted to say that Shaws has some amazing customer service. Not only was the host extremely warm and welcoming but understanding when I ordered something I thought was something else. Oops. THe waitress was just as nice dealing with my ignorance of that particular dish. They didn't charge me for my mistake and the food was great!! Great experience in a great city!! I'll be back next year!
