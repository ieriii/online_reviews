If you're looking for an "upscale" BBQ joint, this is the place for you. The decor here is great - looks like a trendy, Southern home on the inside. The BBQ is also pretty good, although, I still think the selections at Smoque are better.  My table and I ended up trying most of the menu, from the brisket, to the dry rubbed wings. We also got racks of the "Competition" Baby Back and St. Louis ribs. I found the wings to be quite good, but the pork ribs were not that impressive -- at least not at the price of $35 a rack. It was good, but almost a bit too fall off the bone tender where you lose some of the pork flavor.  The bruleed mac and cheese here is fantastic though, so get that. Didn't try any of the "regular ribs," but I am sure they will be decent. Service here was also pretty good, so all in all, a solid spot in the city for BBQ.
