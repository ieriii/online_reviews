My wife and I dined here last week for our anniversary and it was killer! We haven't really eaten a whole lot of fondue before, but after this meal we definitely will. It was such a romantic night. Cal took care of us so attentively while peppering it with precisely timed moments of humor! We had the Conniseur and it was delicious. Everything was awesome; from the service to the food. A+ all the way!!!
