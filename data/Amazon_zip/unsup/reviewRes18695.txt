so i've been to cara mio three times. based on the first time i would maybe give it 5 stars. but i have to base it off all of the times and that brings it down to a 3 star type-of-deal. the first time i really enjoyed the special gnocci...delightful. i love the waitstaff, decor and the fact that is a no charge byob. however....the food has taken a turn for the worse in my opinion. everything is over creamed now...meaning they just add heavy cream and cheese to everything. maybe i just need to branch out and get something else. i crave homemade pasta but the flavors are just not doing anything for me there anymore. go to buona terra for amazing italian.
