The food was fantastic! Service was also good, and it was a nice change to have fine dining with BYOB. The outdoor patio looked cute but we sat inside because we wanted the A/C due to the humidity. The only problem inside was that they had an issue with fruit flies last night (which doesn't appear to have been a problem for any other reviewers thus far, so it may be an isolated incident...the patio door was open too, and this may have contributed?) Regardless, the food was so good that we will definitely return :)
