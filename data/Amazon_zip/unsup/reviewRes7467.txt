Hands down, one of THE BEST Italian restaurants I've been to in a while. We cam there on a Saturday night to see that it was packed (now we know why). So we gave them our name and number and they said they'd call when they had our table ready. It was cold out so we decided to go to the bar right across the street from the restaurant. had a few drinks and laughs when the host actually came to get us! how he knew we were there? I don't know but it surprised all of us. Maybe that's what everyone does? We ordered the lobster ravioli which were stuffed to the max with amazing filling and a semi sweet sauce. The seafood risotto was cooked perfectly, creamy and comforting. The bolognase sauce was perfect, felt like it was cooking on the stove for days. Wine selection was pretty good and the tiramisu... Oh my, amazing. We found parking in what seemed to be a very hard place to find parking. maybe we got lucky.
