Meh..it hurts me to write this. To be honest, my first two experiences here were for brunch and they were incredible. Those experiences were a long time ago and if I had written a review for them I would have given 5 stars both times, for both the food and service. My third time ( I guess wasn't the charm) was this past week for dinner. I figured I should expect the same wonderful service and delicious food (the burger was my one of my favorites in Chicago). I unfortunately got a very different experience. I am not one to pull apart every detail of a dining night out, but I was pretty pissed about some bigger picture aspects. The waiter was completely aloof and acted like his girlfriend had just broken up with him. He was pissed, I mean pissed, and we were all very perplexed and confused by his lack of personality and service. When we asked whether we should get the burger or the sloppy joe he said rudely, "Umm I eat the burger more but the sloppy joe has more flavor" ....umm okay, wtf does that mean? Then he forgot one of the entrees, lied about it, did not take it off the bill nor bring a complimentary beverage or anything. He pretended it was the kitchen's fault. Overall, just a lack of menu and drink knowledge with a combination of a big attitude. Besides the crappy waiter, my burger was very sub par in comparison to the two previous times. It was half the size and dried out. My previous servers were awesome, friendly, attentive, and cool...this time I had some angry dude who had no clue what was going on. I guess they are becoming skimpy on the quality overall? I don't know what's going on Longman, but shape it up or I'm moving on to other more consistent joints with way better service.
