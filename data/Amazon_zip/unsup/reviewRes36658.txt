Brunch is amazing here, and you'll know it by the line of 30 some-odd people waiting outside on Saturday or Sunday mornings. If you don't want to wait, get there before 10 for any chance of not waiting. Pancakes and egg dishes are fabulous, and their homemade butters and jams are delish. Lunch dishes are a little underwhelming--they definitely shine more in the breakfast department.
