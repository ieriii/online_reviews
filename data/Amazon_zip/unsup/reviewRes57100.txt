Absolutely disgusted on our wedding night.Great reviews, atmosphere, and food but the service was a ZERO. 3 hrs of sitting at a table waiting to eat.We had a reservation for a wedding party two weeks in advance and showed up with all in a limo at one time. We discovered that we had one waiter who also had responsibility for other tables. He took our drink orders, brought the drinks, took appetizer orders for some but not all people, had to be asked 3 times to refill drinks, and it took 15 mins and two requests with two waiters to get a Mojito. After 1 hr and nearly eating the appetizers (for those who ordered), I walked across the restaurant to inquire about ordering our meals to which the server replied that he was waiting for all to finish their appetizers. I told him that was ridiculous given the current wait for food, starving kids, and the time to cook a meal. He then took meal orders which took another hour+ to receive. I complained to the floor manager about the ongoing issues and delay in receiving food to which she concurred with all of my concerns and said she would get our food. Later we discovered that other tables received bread baskets and we were left to sit with nothing. They compensated our mass bill a small part and offered free dessert which we didn't accept. Everyone was disgusted, ready to leave, and not willing to wait anymore. Our limo was rented for a certain amount of time and we wasted 3 hrs in the Carnivale when the plan was much shorter to allow for time to ride Chicago and see the fireworks at Navy Pier. Unfortunately time didn't allow and we went immediately to the hotel thanks to the lack of service at the Carnivale.  The beautiful atmosphere and wonderful food was appreciated by our mix of Hispanic/American/Asian friends, yet negatively impacted by the lack of service and attention to the needs of our wedding party. Never again. No excuse.
