I've been going here for years. An ex-girlfriend actually introduced me to this little bakery in Bucktown/Wicker Park. I come here usually for a cup of coffee and once in a blue moon have a sweet tooth. I think their pastry's are a bit pricey but worth it....if you are craving something petite and delicious.
