Have eaten here twice now. Here's my take... Atmosphere: Cozy and quaint with softly dimmed lighting. Nice romantic spot for a date or dinner with a few close friends. I wouldn't recommend for large groups due to the overall size of the restaurant and speed of service. Size: Small and Cozy (e.g., you can share your food with the table next to you) Service: Relaxed. (Okay, it's slow. But why are your rushing? Bring two bottles of wine. I think the waiters are also cooking sometimes, but that is unconfirmed.) Food: It's very good. If the waiter offers you homemade noodles, TAKE THEM! They are delicious. Menu offers variety and the restaurant is accommodating, so it's a good choice for veggie/carni couples/groups. Drinks: BYOB. Hooray! When to go: We went during the week both times and have never had to wait. Price: It's on target. Plus, since you're bringing your own wine, you get a great meal and a great bottle of wine for the right price.
