Was excited to stay at such a historic hotel...but instead of old fashioned charm..just ended up with old. The rooms are super small and noisy (requested a room change so we ended up with a quieter room that was slightly larger), and it's really hard to even turn around in the small bathroom. But the bed is comfy and all the neccessities are there. Plus it's such a great location; and it's steps away from the train. I got such a great deal for the hotel on priceline that I was satisfied with what I got...but if I had to pay even remotely their regular price it'd be 2 stars tops. Oh...and the hairdryer is hanging on back of the door...just in case you're looking...
