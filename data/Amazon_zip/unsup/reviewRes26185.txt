I absolutely love this place!! Everyone is so incredibly nice. I always order for delivery. And love that they give sliced oranges w/ every order. The other day I went for the first time to the restaurant and at the end of the meal, they gave my friend and I a free banana and ice cream dessert which was incredibly delish! FOOD: the food here is probably the best I have had at a Vietnamese restaurant. The bamboo shoots w/duck has a sweet soy sauce taste. Very good and I think it's pretty unique since I have never seen this dish at any other Vietnamese restaurants. The pho here is phenom. Very fresh! The flavor is perfect. (so much better than Tank's in Argyle). Lemongrass beef appetizer... This comes with rice paper so you can make your own spring rolls. The taste of this dish is to die for! definitely one of my favorites! The only dish I did not like very much was the catfish in the clay pot. First off, I'm not even sure that it's catfish and second, it had a fishy taste (I know, it's FISH but I've had this before and I've never encountered it tasting fishy). Dessert: I am a huge fan of fried bananas and was going to order it anyway, but they gave it to us for free and boy was it amazing!!! Probably the best fried banana I have ever had. I'm drooling thinking about it! All in all, I am in love w/ this place!
