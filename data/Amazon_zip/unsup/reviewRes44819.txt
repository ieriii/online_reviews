Visited Chicago for Independence Day weekend. Wanted to try Chicago style pizza. I tried Giordano's since it was very close to my hotel (Hyatt). The wait was.... LONG! 30 min wait to be seated. Once we were seated, the waiter asked if we had "Pre-ordered", I wasn't aware that this was an option... I asked the hostess 3 times how much longer to be seated and she never mentioned anything about Pre-ordering... I now know better.. After we placed our order it was another 50 mins before the pizza made it to the table... Im deducting a star for the incredibly long wait. Now for the good, the pizza was AWESOME, FABULOUS, DELISH!! We all LOVED it!! We ordered Sausage,pepperoni,mushroom pizza. As this was our first Chicago style pizza we had no idea what size to get... we went w/ a large for 3 people... sigh.. we each had one slice and we were stuffed. "Pizza: 1, Us: 0" - Took the rest back to the hotel to eat later. I also tried Lou Malnati's the second day. While it was also good, I preferred Giordano's. I wish i could pack them up and take them back to Texas with me..
