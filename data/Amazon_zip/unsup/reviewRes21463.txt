I had been waiting to go to Xoco once the hub bub slowed down, but it seems to be going strong! I went on a Tuesday night and it was crowded, but I went early enough and still got a seat. At first I was turned off by sitting at the long wall table, but it was actually very comfortable and communal. The food: Awesome. I had the wild mushroom sandwich and it was incredible. It was filling, but in a good way and I am excited to eat the leftover half today! Warning: not much for vegetarians. The hot chocolate is fantastic and the churros are yummy!
