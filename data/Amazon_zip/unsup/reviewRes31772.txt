I love this place!!!! I surprised a friend with dinner and Sunda and we were both very impressed. The service in the beginning was a TAD slow, but it was freaking busy as hell on a Tuesday! So I got over that in like 4 seconds. Our servers name was Rachel and she was very quick on her feet and knew a lot about the menu. We both started with two specialty drinks, the pear martini and lychee martini...both amazing, and they tasted even better when we were on our third round! Food comes out as its ready and I love that, everything is shared and there's always something new on your plate. My companion and I ordered the roasted duck hash, black cod, shrimp tempura maki, hand cut spicy tuna, and the number nine maki roll (I am currently looking at the menu, no photogenic memory here). Everything was very delicious and flavorful. When the duck hash arrived, our server said the best way to eat it was to break the egg on top and mix up all of the ingredients. After we thought that was a good idea, she grabbed the utensils and did it for us... talk about service! My favorite dish, and the one that keeps me recommending Sunda to others, was the miso blackened cod. There was some sort of cinnamon roasted eggplant at the base of the dish that made me die, twice, at the table. So delicious! I work at a nearby bar and whenever anyone suggest great food, besides ours, I send them over to Sunda, especially on Sunday when everything is half off! You'll see my name on the reservation list soon, promise.
