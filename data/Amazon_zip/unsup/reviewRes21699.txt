Meh. Service is slow. Very tight quarters. Eavesdropping is very easy if you're into that. The food is very bland, salsa is very watery. The server did not offer up specials until we already placed our order. I ordered fajitas and the veggies were barely cooked. I probably won't go there again as there are plenty of decent mexican places in the neighborhood.
