My boyfriend and I had the 4 course menu plus 1 extra course called "duck, duck, goose". GET the extra course if you can because it was delicious. In fact, it was my favourite dish of the night. We loved every course with the exception of the starter with octopus and lobster. The octopus had an amazingly soft texture but the lobster was overdone. But we loved the soup, the pork with popcorn (!!) entree, the special course as mentioned, and the dessert wasn't as horrible as others made it out to be.
