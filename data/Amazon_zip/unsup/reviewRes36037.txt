Just went there for a brunch. Most in the party liked the food. I ordered a Chihuahua omelette and my girlfriend got the eggs benedict. She wasn't too fond of the sourdough English muffin, but she thought everything else was fine. The omelette was large and tasted good. I wish they had chopped up the jalapeno peppers into smaller bits since it made some bites spicy and others not so much. We were a group of 3 couples. The waitress would not split the bill for us, and I was annoyed, but did not press the issue. If I am paying 10-15 dollars for an omelette or a waffle, I expect little better service. Sorry. Won't be going again.
