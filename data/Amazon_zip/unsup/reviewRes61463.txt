Jeremy and I tried the naan, which was fine. The roti was a lesser version of the naan. The chicken tawa rice (spicy chicken chunks mixed with white and saffron rice) was tasty, but very spicy. No scary bones or chunks of fat. We had the chicken charga (heavily spiced, then fried chicken), which was delicious. The star. We also had gosht daal (goat with chickpeas). That might have been my favorite. Mild and lovely. Neal and Julie had the handi gosht, some other kind of goat stew. It was spicier, redder, less spectacular than ours. They also tried 'mixed vegetables' which ended up being an earthy mix of peas, potatoes and carrots in a curry sauce. Everything tasted really good, but the oil (ghee?) was SO HEAVY. Neal had to separate the oil from the veggies before he put in the take-away. They also tried the paratha, a fried version of naan. The plain was good. the one with potato was unnecessary. Mostly it just tasted like bread anyway. Neal and I each got a mango lassi. It was fine. Kind-of orangey and less creamy than Ghareeb Nawaz. But everything was about twice as much as Ghareeb. The bill came to $62 without tip for the 4 of us. Don't know if I'd make a trip here again, cause it's so close to Ghareeb Nawaz, which is so much cheaper, and maybe better? Again, the stand-outs were the fried chicken and the goat daal.
