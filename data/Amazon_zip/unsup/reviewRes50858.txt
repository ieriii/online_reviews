Crunchy, corn flake encrusted French toast? Where do I sign up? I've been to Wishbone several times in the past and am actually quite surprised I have never Yelped it. I went again a few weekends ago and it was as delicious as ever! This French toast I speak of is pretty darn tasty and a reason I always go back when the mood strikes! Actually, everything I've ordered, I've found tasty. The staff is always very nice, as Anette was this day. I like Wishbone. It's a bit out of the way for me but always worth the drive when my Wishbone craving strikes!
