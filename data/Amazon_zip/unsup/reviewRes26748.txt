I was really excited to try this place out. Unfortunately, I was pretty disappointed. It was an expensive meal that did not satisfy. My wife and I both got the "Repertoire" tasting menu. Each serving was pretty much a bite of food. I thought the beef, evoo, milk, and doughnut servings were good and I wanted more. I didn't like the crab serving (I thought it was too salty). Foie serving was ok, but I think overrated. And the foie-lollipops were gross. Each serving looked pretty but seriously, a bite of food. One bite of beef, give me a break. For me, liking only half the servings (out of 12) is not a good percentage for the amount of money being spent. I wanted to like this place but I can't recommend this place in good conscious. Plus, we didn't get to try the famous popcorn serving (I guess they don't have it anymore, what the heck?) I was going to give this place 2 stars, but then I think about how much we spent and it makes me angry. 1 star it is.
