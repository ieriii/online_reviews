I thoroughly enjoyed my experience at this Bucktown sushi hub known for trendy everything. I usually order for carry out because the clientele that i see in there is usually a bit overwhelming for me. Loud drunks due to its BYOB policy and people who use sites like this to find something "different" and "hip" or the best "something off the beaten path."  The quality of food for the take out portion without all of the ambiance was impressive. The spicy Miso soup is the s&^* and is a surprising accompaniment to the sushi that they have. I personally think its a bit pricey for what it is but Sushi has this amazing price stigma attached to it these days that its hard to find any kind of normal pricing for something simple like salmon or tuna make. Otherwise food is solid to my taste. Dining in the restaurant itself is a bit daunting because its so freaking dark and full of "trendies" that love to eat sushi anywhere and everywhere and try every single sushi restaurant because it sounds cool to people who may be too squeamish to even try something like raw fish. They sound daring-good for you. Regardless of the dark settings, crowd, loud bar like atmosphere and moron server, the food did hold its ground and was still delicious. Which in the end is always the most important thing-especially when it comes to something like sushi and delicate flavors. Hence the four stars.
