I was tasked with suggesting a diner spot for my culinary literary agent and her mother, who happens to own the agency. Oh, and she also once cooked dinner for Julia Child. No big deal. Did I mention that I'm a strict vegetarian and my agent is gluten-free and egg-free? Oy vey. So I tweeted a cry for help and smacked myself in the forehead with a big fat "duh" when numerous people tweeted "Sunda!" in response. I've only been working out of the office directly next door since the day they opened. We were seated promptly at 6pm as per our reservation, and were happy to be in the hands of a server who knew the menu inside and out. Not only was he able to rattle off every veggie-friendly dish on the menu, including substitutions that made several seafood dishes vegetarian, but he also got us started with several gluten-free options. If he wasn't sure about something he checked with the kitchen, and he never seemed the least bit put out with the number of times we sent him running. Not only that, but the woman who helped write the allergy guidelines for the chefs came out and spend several minutes with my dining companion explaining all of the options she had. I can't even remember everything we ordered - with so many options we over did it a bit. The warm spinach and mushroom salad was delicious, as were the corn fritters. The pad thai was light and citrusy and we also had these smokey hot peppers that we couldn't get enough of. The only dish I wasn't overly into was the eggplant and tofu toban - but I'm put off by mushy tofu, so that's a personal preference. Overall I left full and happy, and really impressed by how easily they were able to accommodate our requests. I will definitely be stepping down my office steps and hanging a left for lunch again soon.
