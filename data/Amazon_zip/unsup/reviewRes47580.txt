Fun, lively, tasty, not that expensive considering how much food you get. The space is really, really cool. There's a very organic vibe with lots of woods and stone all over. It's trendy but mellow at the same time. The harvest table area is amazing. Our waitress told us that the items on the table are all made on-site and are seasonal. When we were there, they had a tuna crudo situation that brought the happy. The various salads, fruits and cheeses were all splendid. Their deviled eggs, however, are something I could go back for over and over. They also bring you hot cheddar biscuits with tangerine butter. Eat the heck out of this, and then let them bring you more. Then, the meats. Oh, the meats. My favorites were the waygu beef, the scallops and the smoked sausage. The chefs who prepare the meat are the ones who bring them to your table (making it mildly awkward to turn down any of their offerings). They explain the cooking methods and cut things up and put 'em down on your plate for you. They'll keep coming back to you until you're so full that you beg them to stop. One other awesome part about Zed: they have a shuttle that they use to take you home, thus saving you a cab ride home and making the experience even more cost-effective.
