I had taken a few friends here for a "thank you" for helping me pack my place up for a move. Since they were doing Paleo, this place sounded perfect for them and it was, all the meat a caveman could want. I can't say anything bad about the service, the servers were great. The salad bar, not bad. They get a plus for having a huge trough of bacon, can never go wrong when bacon is involved. Decent wine list. But the meat- sub par and tasteless. My friends and I came to the conclusion that the meat was institutional grade. There are plenty of better places to choose from in this city.
