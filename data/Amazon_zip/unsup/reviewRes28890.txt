We just went on Tuesday because Chubby Weiners next door was closed.  I keed, I keed. I do enjoy this place because I can get my standard Thai (read: not Thai, not authentic) food, which is mixed vegetables and tofu with rice. The price is slightly high (+$1 for plain white rice for an otherwise all-veg dish? wha?) but the portions are big and there aren't things like tomatoes in the veggies.  I had a chicken egg roll last time that was nothing special really, but my companions liked their orders (pad thai and a noodly soup) and we were in and out in an hour.   The location is a plus though, since there's street and lot parking (easy spot at 6:45 on a Tuesday) plus the Brown line overhead.
