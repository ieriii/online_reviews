Came here with a group of friends, it was a very pleasant experience. The food was very good, the service very attentive. I'm sure this is a given, but I'll emphasize it anyway, come prepared to eat a lot of meat!! Especially if you are planning on milking the $50+ you pay to dine here. If you are a vegetarian or a vegan you probably should stay clear of Zed451 unless you plan on being sinful. Although this place is akin to a Brazilian churrascaria, Zed451 is not really Brazilian. Still, the marinated meats are very good. I really enjoyed the rump roast and the filet, they were probably my two favorites out of the meats that were served to us. As for the the salad bar, really enjoyed everything, but loved the cured meats, cheese and olives.
