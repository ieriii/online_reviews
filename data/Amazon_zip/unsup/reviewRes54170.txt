Xoco is one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago! Rick Bayless really hit a grand slam with this Mexican street food endeavor! I often bring out of town guests here and it's always a hit (great food and ambiance). Two glorious words for you: COCHINITA PIBIL (slow-roasted suckling pig) torta! A word of caution: the habanero sauce served with it is HOT (will burn the lips right off your face)! Their caldos are amazing too, especially the mariscos. For dessert we always order the hot from the fryer churros with a side of ice cream (quite spectacular)! Parking in that area is a pain, and the wait time may be close to an hour (just serve yourself some sparkling water w/ lime or peruse the menu), but once you get a table number and order, the food comes out really fast. Buen provecho!
