This is as advertised! Had heard about it and on a long layover in Chicago I headed over to try it out. Had the special Jack Daniels Sausage Dog, Nice! got there at 2:30 no wait but it would have been worth it. Looks like Doug is printing money here!!! If I lived in Chicago this would be on the weekly rotation.
