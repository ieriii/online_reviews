I really loved 3rd coast. I lived in the building above the restaurant, so I ate there often. It was always easy to convince friends to meet there on Sundays for brunch because it was so good. Parking near the restaurant is tough, but if you can walk it, then do. The breakfast was always really good and the lunch/dinner options are also good. IIt is a smaller place, so there can be a wait, especially on Sundays when it is warm. It is a very warm restaurant with a nice look and the people that work there were friendly even when they were slammed. There is a full bar and a good wine list. Overall, I would say it is a great atmosphere with good food, but not gourmet. If you want a bloody and a great brunch with your friends in the gold coast, don't miss this place!
