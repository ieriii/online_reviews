Cheese flights + wine flights = very happy me. We went for dinner, but filled up on cheese on accident. It was so much fun, that we just kept ordering flight after flight. The cheeses were unusual and delicious. The wine flights were fun, too. I was able to sample some wines that I'd never heard of, from countries I didn't even know had a worldwide presence. It was educational, and the wines were good. In fact, I like a particular Spanish one so well that I purchased a couple bottles to take home. Best part? This place is not expensive.  I'm just waiting for my chance to go back - for the flights. To be honest, the dinner menu doesn't really excite me. UPDATE: I keep going back again and again. I've helped my friends fall in love with it, too. Excellent wines, excellent cheese and excellent food.
