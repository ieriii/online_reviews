holiday weekend w/the family took mom for a cocktail, seriously the rudest/insecure bartender in the city, it's the bearded guy and stay away, girl w/ponytail rocks, makes great drinks and friendly. The dude has a real problem. When was the last time you acutually told a 69 yr old lady to f off because you (the bartender) were inept. Way to go dude, hope you feel like a man
