We had a great time at this friendly neighborhood hangout for locals. The service was prompt and very nice, although I would suggest getting there early as it seems to get packed as early as seven on a Friday . Probably the best beer selection in the city, almost overwelming - I will try them all in due time.... I saw liquor bottles there but I don't think this is the place to be drinking libations. A good mix of people here ranging widely in age and culture, which I found to be a great recipe for a local pub.
