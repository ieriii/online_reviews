When in Chicago, you have to eat at a Bayless place. XOCO was the easiest option and light on the pocket. After a long wait of 45 minutes, we were able to order and that is where the fun started. I got the Pibil (sucking pig) torta and my wife got the Gunthorp Chicken torta. Who knew sandwiches could have such complex flavors and textures. The pork on the Pibil was tender, juicy, and covered with an amazing combo of pickled onions and spicy sauce. Yum! The wood fired chicken and tomatillo salsa on the Gunthorp was a great combination too. Also, if you like spicy food, order extra habanero salsa. This stuff is potent and delicious. To round out the meal, we ordered a Aztec hot chocolate and 4 churros. The coco was a little thinner than I expected, but very tasty and the churros were superb. Crusted with sugar and perfectly crunchy (not greasy). The staff was super efficient despite the enormous crowds. I loved the food and I definitely think this should be on your list on places to hit while in Chicago, but not sure I would stand in a long line at lunch on a regular basis.
