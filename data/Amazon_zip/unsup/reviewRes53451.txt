Wow. I mean, what else can I say that hasn't been said already? Everything about the place is absolutely top-notch. Food: The best meal I've ever had and my first experience with molecular gastronomy. The presentation was fantastic and with a clear focus on form over function (i.e. eating rabbit loin off a smoking maple tree branch). We did the twelve course tasting w/out the wine pairing and I was uncomfortably full afterwards. I can't imagine doubling that up. Service: Extremely professional and much friendlier that I had anticipated. I expected snooty but everyone was very nice and extremely helpful and did a great job of everything from helping us pick out a bottle of wine to describing the dishes and answering our questions.We went in October and a few of the dishes definitely had a fall focus so I would love to go back and see, no wait, taste how the menu changes with the seasons.
