Absolutely terrible. I've heard amazing things about this place and really wanted to throw a large bday dinner here (25 people). Unfortunately they do not take reservations but I was transferred to the general manager to see if maybe it could be done. She lets me know that it would be $90/ person because we would be taking up about 1/4 of the restaurant and it's very busy on Saturdays. She sounded very rude and made me feel like I was asking such an absurd thing to want a reservation for 25... And $90/ person, are you kidding me?!
