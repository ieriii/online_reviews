Great thin crust pizza (which can be hard to find in a city full of deep dish). Lots of tvs showing a variety of sporting events, and generally good music. I recommend ordering with extra cheese, otherwise they tend to under-cheese the pizza. Good topping combos include: extra cheese, chicken, and bacon; extra cheese, pepperoni, sausage. Go later on thursday (karaoke night) and see Stass fall into a burning ring of fire. It burns, burns, burns...the ring of fire.
