After much fanfare we took the stroll for some much needed brunch. My word of the day seems to be "meh..." After a brief wait we were seated admist the communal tables. While a great idea in theory the tables minimize conversation of two people when a roaring party of 10 sits next door. Dislike. Another issue of the tables came up when Mr. Man having ordered coffee searched for some sugar that was just barely within reach if he could reach over that lady. And now I need some butter, sorry to interrupt your story but could you pass me some? Dislike. With a glass of oj and a plate of lox I was ready to conquer... wait my food is gone. While my salmon, goat cheese, beets and mircrogreens were tasty the portion was small. Being of the ravenous noon eaters group I was highly dissapointed that for such a high price, the take was bad. Dislike. In the end the food was good though the portions small, the atmosphere was rocking for groups of people and when I saw the bill. Eek. Me thinks I will stop for a donut on the way home.
