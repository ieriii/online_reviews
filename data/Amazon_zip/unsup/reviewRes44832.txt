I normally prefer thin crust pizzas, but visiting Chicago it way my duty to try the deep dish, twice. I love the crust here. Normally, all that cheese and bread bothers me, but this pizza is just delightful. And I love the sauce. Toppings almost don't even matter. I've had a hawaiian style and some sort of combo. Salads are also pretty good. The wait can be a little insane, even when you go during what I'd consider "off" hours, like not lunch or dinner, but in between. This place is always packed.
