I have been here a couple times.  Even if it is completely full or just 75% full, it is very noisy. You need to go here at odd hours if you don't want to wait.  The great food and affordable prices for food and wine make it a very busy place. All the pizzas I have tried are pretty good. Risotto Carbonara - great dish, I order it every time. Riccio di Mare e Granchio - great dish, I should order this every time. Uovo in Raviolo 'San Domenico' - Pretty good, but only one giant raviolo and not as good as I was expecting. I wouldn't order it again.
