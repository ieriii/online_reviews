We dined at Anteprima for the second time last night and for the second time enjoyed the food, but were disappointed by the service. Maybe it was because we weren't ready the first time the waiter came to take our order, but after ordering and beginning to drink a bottle of wine, we waited what seemed like an eternity to order food. A similar painful would-be eternity came between the dropping off of the dessert menu and the return of the waiter.  Ok, so I sound whiney. But there's just something maddening about seeing your waiter flit across the room, cut bread at the bar, and chit chat with co-workers when you desperately want to order! On a more satisfying note, the food is delicious. We tried the octopus starter as many yelpers suggested--wonderful. The portions are sensible. So the food is great, service questionable. My final comment is on the phenomenon of small, trendy restaurants like this that pack in diners to create a very loud, claustrophobic atmosphere. Why do we flock to these places? Is the food really that great? or does the reservations-only buzz create a false sense of urgency? I mean, I'm not gonna lie--I felt somewhat special being a part of this seemingly elite room. "We know what's up. Look at us and our delicious, expensive food." Makes everything taste better, I guess :)
