Pretty much I fast all day before going to this place. The salad bar is pretty good and extensive, but the main focus is trying all the meat (all you can eat). The cuts are prepared very well with pretty much every type to please any carnivore. The service is exceptional, and as soon as you want more, you'll definitely get more.
