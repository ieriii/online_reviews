There is a reason they created the McDonalds dollar menu...it is for nights like this. My roomates and I just had Pasta Bowl delivered and are absolutly disgusted. All three pasta dishes were equally as bad. No flavor and I am not a picky eater and I can say that i will never never order from here again. Do yourself a favor and order from anywhere else for a Saturday night with the girls.
