My husband and I went here for dinner one night not too long ago and used a groupon. Because we used a groupon, we definitely got our moneys worth of food. I am not sure if I would go here and pay full price for the meal, but I do know that they do lots of coupons and specials online. I greatly enjoyed the salad bar, which had an amazing selection of salads and other items like sushi, soup, cold cuts, etc. I could have had the salad bar as my meal. We had fun choosing what meats to have from the variety of meats that we were able to select from, as the waiters walked by our tables. We did not have to wait very long for our table. Our short wait gave us a chance to try drinks at the bar which I remember being pretty good. I have not been to any other Brazilian restaurants in Chicago to compare this to, but we did have a good time and did enjoy our meal.
