I recently went back to this place and sat in the outdoor seating on one of these hot summer days. It was really nice, since it's shaded by the trees. I happened to crave a burger, but wanted to go the healthier route. I ordered the chipotle turkey burger, and it was SO good. I highly recommend it. I ordered it with slightly toasted wheat bread instead of a buttered bun, and had the mayo on the side. It was REALLY good.
