Simply phenomenal!!! This is the second time I dine at Sapori Trattoria, and I'll be sure to return every time I visit Chicago.Not only do they take the concept of pasta to a whole new level with sauces that are out of this world, they also offer exquisite appetizers, the freshest seafood, and a wine selection to please just about anyone.The staff is most friendly, and the service was fast, considering that they were completely packed on a Monday evening.For appetizer I had the 'Crostini di Avocado'. No... it's not guacamole! It's much lighter and more sophisticated. A perfect balance of flavor, lightness and creativity. Next, I had the Spaghetti Barese. 'Nona' will have to forgive me this time; I used to think she was the one who made the best meatballs in the world, but Sapori's are just to die for. And as if I hadn't already eaten enough, I decided to go ahead and splurge on the seafood. I chose the 'Bass alla Piccata'. What else can I say? Simply heavenly! A delicacy that is fit for a king! My friends and I shared a sampler of their luscious desserts. I need to call those guys at Merriam Webster, the chocolate raspberry cake they serve deserves an entry of its own on the dictionary.What an evening! What a meal! Thanks Chef Anthony... Sapori is one more reason why I love Chicago so much!Rodrigo Guedes - Newark, NJ
