From the food to all of the employees, kudos to Xoco. I go there quite a lot now, but discovered this place not too long ago. I walked in and immediately the hostess was as nice as could while being casual yet proffesional. i have eaten plenty of tortas and sandwiches and the hot chocolate is awesome, the desserts are awesome. I am aware that i am using awesome a lot but seriously. one of my favorite places. If you go, you must order a a main course sandwich, desert and one of the traditional mexican drinks. whether it be jamaica juice or a hot chocolate. Xoco does no disappoint
