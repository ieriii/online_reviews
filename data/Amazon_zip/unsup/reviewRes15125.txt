No trip to Chicago should be complete without a night at the Violet Hour. Definitely an occasion to get a little dressed up for! Yes, there usually is a wait (tip: if you have a group of 5 or more..they will usually try and seat you sooner so be sure to let the bouncer at the door know) this place is definitely worth the wait though. The drinks are like nothing I've ever tasted before! The Romeo & Juliet is amazing, but on my last visit a friend recommended I try the Whiskey Smash..which isn't on the menu anymore..but they were able to make it and WOW. I dream about this drink now and no other whiskey drink will ever top it. I love that you use candle light to read the menus! I would recommend getting some appetizers with the drinks, as they are pretty strong. It's really dark in there so you don't wanna be stumbling your way out the door.. :)
