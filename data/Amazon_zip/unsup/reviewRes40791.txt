I am absolutely in love with this Mexican joint. A friend brought me to La Pasadita about 4 or 5 months ago and I have been going at least once a week ever since. I'm addicted to the flavor they are serving up. I grew up on fake, American/Mexican food. I had never had so many authentic Mexican restaurants to choose from until moving to Chicago and this place is the best by far. The food is delicious, it is fairly clean, and the waitresses are all very nice and polite when I completely butcher the names of the menu items (still working on the Espanol). I usually order the Tampiquena with a side of two tacos- add cheese and sour cream, and two diet cokes to wash it all down. This is a lot of food and I can handle it all. The food is tasty, authentic, and filling. I have never been myself but I hear this place stays open pretty late for the drunk crowd and the food is just perfect for a hung over afternoon lunch. Love this joint, just not real clear on why there are three of the same restaurant on a single block of Ashland. Could they be that popular?
