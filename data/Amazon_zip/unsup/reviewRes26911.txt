I am going to keep this short and sweet as plenty of other people have already gone over the details of most dishes. I have a great deal of respect for the Charlie Trotter "graduates", after all my wife is one of them. We were very exited to go to Elliot's restaurant. My wife worked with him about 9 years ago and we follow his career as well as other "C.T. graduates" closely. I was glad that the food did not disappoint. It was absolutely delicious. My wife and I had the 10 course meal and 9 out of 10 of the courses were almost perfection. The cauliflower was amazing and I hate cauliflower! Every other plate was full of surprises, very creative and delicious Service ran like a well oiled machine. I actually made a comment to my wife mid dinner to point it out and she had also noticed this. Where the restaurant disappointed big time was on its value. Our dinner was the equivalent of 10 mise en bouches and a bottle of wine. We paid over $400 for our dinner and we both left hungry. It does not matter how great the food and service was, there is no excuse for this to happen. To put it in perspective, when we went to Tom Colicchio's Craftsteak in Las Vegas we spend a similar amount of money and we literately could not finish our meal. This was not an ideal experience but at least we left satisfied with how much food we got. In simple terms, I feel robbed.
