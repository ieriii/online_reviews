I love Mexican. I love things loaded with everything I should feel guilty about eating, but with cheap up-charges I am going to get cheese and crema EVERY GOD DAMNED TIME. Their food is cheap and one burrito will last a few days. Frugality aside, their food is good and undoubtedly worth more. I have some complaints, however, with the following: their guacamole left something to be desired. We ended up just mixing the salsa they give you with it to make it worth eating. Their vegetarian burrito is a tad bit flavorless without any sort of salsa. I can vouch for their chicken tacos and pork burritos as being virtually flawless. And oh my god, it is cheap. I'm sure if I were drunk when I went, I'd think it was heaven on earth.
