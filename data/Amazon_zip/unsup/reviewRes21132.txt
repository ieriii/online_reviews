There is one vegetarian option on the menu for lunch -- the woodland mushroom torta. So, thankfully I like mushrooms, garlic and goat cheese, 'cause that's what I was going to have to eat. The sandwich was really good. The bread was toasty and delicious, and the spicy red salsa was a perfect counter-point. I also had a lemonade -- sugary, but good. Overall, I think the price is a little high for what you get. The food is yummy, but not a revelation. My sandwich was about $10. I'd maybe go again, but I wouldn't go out of my way.
