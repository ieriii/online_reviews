We started the day with donuts in Roseland what is the obvious place for lunch? A cool hipster gastropub in Logan Square, naturally. So many people had recommended this to us, including the waiter at the last place my husband and I went out for brunch. The fun vibe of a Friday Adventure on a Thursday continued as I took my daughter out to lunch for her upcoming birthday.  We split a melon, goat cheese and fig salad which was quite pleasant with unexpected heat from the cheese. I then ordered the Cubano sandwich with pork belly, ham and zucchini pickles because I adore Cubanos and this one sounded unique. It was so filling and so good. I could only eat half and now I wish I had brought the other half home.  My hands down favorite part of the meal was my Goslings Ginger Beer, what a zing of tingly ginger. I adored it and seriously, does anyone know where I can buy this in the Chicago area?  Plus, while we were having our leisurely lunch, my daughter downloaded Draw Something for me on my phone. Great afternoon all the way around!
