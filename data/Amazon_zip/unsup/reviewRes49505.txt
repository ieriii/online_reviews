Delicious! Huge portions and tasty food. This is my first Colombian steak experience but it was absolutely yummy! We tried their mixed seafood grill which was amazing. I would eat this as a main next time if I wasn't in a steak mood. I tried a combination plate that had steak, chicharron, beans and rice. It was a great deal and more than enough for 2 meals. My boyfriend had the Steak and Chicken combo. The meat was really tasty but there was an overwhelming amount of starchy side dishes that came with his plate. He looked like he was a little parched afterwards. We got a pitcher of their soda-beer beverage which was really tasty. It didn't quite get us tipsy because I have a feeling there was more soda than libations in the drink. The soda part of it tasted like Guarana soda that you can get at Brazilian and Argentine places.
