Mmm! We were trying to find a place to have lunch, and stopped in here... you could immediately tell that it was going to be a good experience by the sunniness, spaciousness, and that there were a fair number of people in the place, despite being not centrally located and not lunch rush hour. Very easy on the eyes. All thoughts of ordering a normal lunch item flew out the window when I saw the expansive breakfast/brunch items and the descriptions. We ordered an assortment of items, and they were all very good. I got the honey cakes just to see what they were like, and they were not what I was expecting, but I was pleasantly surprised. Portions are generous -- I did not finish my plate -- and prices are very reasonable! The only prices I was surprised by were of the juices, but it *is* a juice bar. I didn't try one, though. Thanks to Meli, I was able to finish my Chicago trip with a happy stomach and sunny attitude!
