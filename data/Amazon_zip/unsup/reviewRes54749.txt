A co worker took me here after finding out I was Greek, being new to Chicago I appreciated having some Greekness around me, she recommended Meli. The juice bar is superb, and the food was pretty good. Back home there are not that many Greek authentic places and it was nice that there is a Greektown here for me to visit when I miss Greek food. I had lunch and it was great. Breakfast seems to be the favorite but lunch is just as good. Definitely get something from the juice bar.
