I've walked past Piece hundreds of times, and always told myself I'd try it out someday soon. Well that "someday soon" took over a year and I'm really kicking myself about it. The pizza at Piece is great! I personally enjoy the White Pizza w/ Italian sausage and spinach. Nice, crispy crust and great flavor. On Sundays you can order (for pick up only) a large pizza and a growler of beer for 25$. Such a great deal! Not to mention the large pizza is huuuuuge and you won't have to wait for a table only to be annoyed by the complete morons sitting next to you. Though the girl standing in the middle of the parking area while I was trying to pick up my order via car is almost just as bad....
