This is really a 3.5 star review. Alas- Yelp does not allow half-stars, so three it is. I went here early in the dinner hour and they seated us right away. We sat in the back half of the restaurant, which was very open, not too noisy and a little chilly. The Pros: -Great beer list -Decent burger selection with interesting options. I got the Red Spruce Springsteen and enjoyed it. It wasn't the ginormous burger you get from Kuma's, so it was a good option for a hearty burger without overdoing it. -Burger patties were cooked perfectly to order -fries were a-ok. One of us got the chipotle seasoned fries which were spicy and good. I got the regular fries which tasted good on their own (more on the homemade ketchup in the cons). -Good host The Cons: -Service was slow. While our server was friendly and nice, it took a long time for her to take our drink order, return with our beers and take our dinner order. -Beet salad was not so good. -Husband's red dragon burger was cooked fine and had some heat but was completely devoid of flavor. -the homemade ketchup was d.i.s.g.u.s.t.i.n.g and tasted like plain, watery, tomato paste. Gross! If I return, I would honestly think about stashing my own bottle of heinz- it was really that bad. -our table was near the wait stand and the bus buy noisily threw dirty plates into the bus tub every so often which was distracting and unnecessary. -Pretzel buns on some burgers are considered an "upgrade" and cost extra. All in all, I would return if I don't feel like waiting at Kumas and don't feel like traveling the extra few blocks up to the Grafton. So honestly, a return trip isn't likely.
