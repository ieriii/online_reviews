Best place in the area for brunch! We went on Sunday for brunch and the food was great. I had the Down on the Farm skillet and it did not disappoint. If you get toast, the fresh jams and honey butter that accompany are delicious! We ordered a side of pancakes- my only complaint is that you can't substitute pancakes for toast as you can at many diners. You have to add it as a side order for an additional cost. Lines are LONG but head over to 9 Muses for a drink while you wait for your buzzer to buzz.
