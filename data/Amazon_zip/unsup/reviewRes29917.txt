My favorite shakes in all of Chicago! At first I was hesitant due to the soy milk, but now I am in love! I only order chocolate cookie dough because it's the best! Sometimes we drive by after work just to get shakes to go! My other favorite item is the black bean burger with sweet potato fries. Yummy all around. Those fries will make any day brighter!
