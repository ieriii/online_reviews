This is my favorite place in Chicago. My cousins introduced me to this place. There is a long wait, but like the last reviewer, its worth it. My cousins ordered french toast, pancakes, and an denver omlette. Both are delicious. I think their omlettes are cooked to perfection. My only complaint is the wait and that its super crowded on the weekend. But Overall, this is my favorite breakfast place. I would come here on a date or to meet with friends.
