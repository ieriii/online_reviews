Went at 6pm on a Tuesday. It was pretty sparse when we arrived, but bustling within 30 minutes. The menu (both food and beer) is extensive. Our waiter was very helpful, and the service was pretty good, not at all intrusive. Here are my faves, in order of deliciousness: THE BEST! -ASPARAGUS - SOOOO GOOD! I had no idea I could be absolutely in love with asparagus, but I was. It sounds weird, with escargot , bread crumbs and hazelnuts, but it's excellent. TRY IT! -pork belly - a big slab of candied pig love. It's served with grits and snap peas and is just delicious. -waffle - Golden Nugget, this is not. This waffle was light, but rich, smothered in rich butter and tart cherries. It went together beautifully, but was ultimately too rich and filling to finish :( The Good -mussels - I LOVE mussels. We ordered the half order to split between two people, and it was enormous. They were good, but I feel like I've had better. Not knocking them, but I prefer a beer based broth. -daily pickles - I didn't realize I liked pickles so much. The brine had almost a cinnamon or nutmeg flavor. It was pretty darn good. Meh -spiced pork rinds - they garnered mixed reviews on yelp, so I tried them. They were ok, I almost forgot I had eaten them.
