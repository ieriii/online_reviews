Calos is a staple in Andersonville. The food and cocktails are always reliable as is the service. It is a really friendly, family owned business. I generally eat here about 2 times per week. Everyone talks about the free focacia-and it is delicious. Just be sure not to eat too much of it because the portion sizes are pretty big. You can generally count on bringing some home for lunch the next day. Prices are very affordable for what you get.
