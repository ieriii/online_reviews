So I decided to order online, because they were offering free garlic knots! So I order my large pizza- with tomato, garlic, and mushrooms. I was not able to choose mushrooms on the choice of ingredients cus either it was not there or I couldnt find it. They have all of their ingredients in alphabetical order, but its hard to find the things. For example, I was looking for tomatos but it took me A LONG time to realize it was under F, for "Fresh Sliced Roma Tomatos". All of that description is not necessary. So because I couldn't find mushrooms, I wrote it in the description and assumed they would either charge me extra or at least add the mushrooms, but instead they just disreguarded them. Next comes delivery. I placed my order at about 5:50. Estimated delivery time was 7:00 which I believe is more than enough time. At 7:25 I called and inquired about my delivery. The man on the phone said it left about 10 minutes ago. So 15 minutes later, I called again. I told them I had already called once and I only live 5 minutes away. The guy said, "I'm sorry we have been messing up orders all day." Then I told him that I wanted to know when my order would be here and all he said was," All I can do is say it is on its way." No apology, nothing. The food arrived and I was disappointed when I got a pizza wiht just tomatos. Not to mention that my garlic knots had obviously been sitting for a long time. And the fact that the number on the box was crossed off and changed was reassurance to me that they had in fact been sitting for a while.Needless to say, I was very unsattisfied.
