WOW... walking into this place is AWESOME!!! being a meat lover I loved to see all the ducks and other meat strung in the window for all to see.. NICE! Had a variety of things from soup to nuts... everything was very good.. Beef with peapods was my fav by far... but still have some things to try before I make a final decision. They packed everything in plastic containers and I love that cause it makes it so easy to transport and reheat. I will be coming back again and again
