Food was good and our waitor was super nice guy. The issue was that the manager really has poor customer service. We had a large group of 14 to celebrate a birthday. We had brought a cake in for the birthday. We understood that they would charge us because we brought a dessert in, but they wanted to charge $4 per person "cutting" charge for the cake. Because we had 14 people, we would have paid $56 just to cut the cake. Absolutely outrageous. Manager was also very rude in explaining their policy to us
