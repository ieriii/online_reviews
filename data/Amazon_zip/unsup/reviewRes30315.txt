Always consistently delicious Pan-Asian fusion style "japanese" food. I've been there a few times and it's never disappointed. By far their best deal is the "Sunda Social" 4-6pm (I think) offer on weekdays where many of their appetizers/rolls are half off! A few favs: -Shishito peppers as a starter is always delicious. They're not too spicy and nicely charred. -Brussel Sprout salad is fantastic. -Oxtail Potstickers are delish -The Duck Hash is INCREDIBLE. One of the best things I've ever had. -The "oh no you didn't ultimate handroll", but ask them to make it into a regular cut roll. I think its their best roll next to the lobster and waygu roll. -Any of the tatakis are truffly and excellent. Service can be somewhat slow sometimes, but the ambiance of the place can't be beat. Great for happy hour meeting friends or for a date. Sometimes it can get a bit loud, though.
