LOVE this place! I'll start with the one and only con:  The smell at first when you walk in. You know how Asian families who cook Asian food all the time... how their houses kind of have a certain smell? Well this place smells like that at first... but after 5 minutes you seriously don't notice it. And the food is AMAZING! Prices are VERY reasonable for Asian cuisine. And the presentation is fabulous- last time I went I got the Calamari... it was served in half of an entire pineapple! And was SO delcious. My cousins love the soups- which are HUGE. The papaya salad is awesome- a little "weird" if your just used to American dining. OH and make sure to get the spring rolls as an appetizer! If you're not used to food like this I guess they look "weird." But are SO good. PLUS this place has BYOB Beer and Wine with NO corkage fee! The staff is also very helpful and friendly. Oh! And if you drive... and go after 5:00 p.m. you can park in the parking garage for the children's hospital that is one block away. Bring your parking ticket into Simply It and they'll validate it for only $6 !  And you can stay parked there ALL night while you go out drinking afterward. Cheapest parking in the city I've ever found!
