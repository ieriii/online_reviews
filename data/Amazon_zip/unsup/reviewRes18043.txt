The 1st time we tried to eat here, we were completely ignored at the door, and just left. The second time, we felt like we were interupting something and felt unwelcome, mostly by the unfriendly attitude of the staff, like 'what do you want?'. There is not host station, so you just stand there and hope someone wants to seat you. They sat us at a table that was really close to another table, and when I tried to move our table a few inches so I could sit in the chair, I was told I couldn't do that because the waitstaff needed room. WTF. My salmon filet was good, but it was DROWNING in a plate of overpowering, sweet, thick balsamic vinegar sauce, when it should have been drizzled delicately on top. Also no vegetable came with the dish, only a crappy side of pasta. The waiter didn't even know what the dish came with and had to ask the chef. My boyfriend got the spicy whole what pasta with sausage, which we both thought was mediocre. He was ok throwing out the leftovers. The bread they give you sucks, real bland and small pieces. The polenta was decent. At least it was BYOB, as this was the only saving grace because we loved the beer we brought ourselves.  How others give this place 4 or 5 stars is beyond me!
