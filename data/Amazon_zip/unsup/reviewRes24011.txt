I had the steak sandwich costa rican style and a tostada...the portions are pretty good but flavor wise was just not impressed...My friend had the Steak Dinner and liked it. Also they try to upsell you a lot w/ add ons which is not cute....peppers/avocado/cheese .50 cents each : / Shoulda said that when you asked if i wanted it...but it's BYOB and there was not wait at 530pm on a sunny saturday sooo que bueno!
