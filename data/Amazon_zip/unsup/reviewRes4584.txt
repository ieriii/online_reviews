The caliber of food in Chicago ceases to amaze me. A perfect place to share Mediterranean/European tapas for a reasonable price. For a group of 4, we shared around 10 dishes with 2 drinks each and came out to just over $40 each! Great value, best money I've spent in a long time on food. Highlights: Milk braised pork shoulder - creamy, fall off the bone meat Salt-roasted beets with goat cheese - never liked beets, but topped with herbs, salt and goat cheese, these thick beets were incredible Calamari with fregola - fresh, soft calamari with israeli couscous Pork neck bone gravy with ricotta - imagine succulent pulled pork in a thick marinara served with toast I'd stay away from the bone marrow smear. Personally, it was a nice to try once in a lifetime kind of dish but honestly it tastes like very rich butter. It's especially hard to discern the taste when you're expected to eat it on buttered/oiled bread. Next time, I'd like to try the charcuterie/cheese platters. Excited to dine on more swine in the future. Addendum: AMAZING patio during a warm summer night.
