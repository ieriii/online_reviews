Went there on Sunday night with a couple friends. Pros Good food Nice decoration Patio seating +++ Cons Had to wait 15 mins to get us a server Had to wait 10 more mins to get a water Had to wait 10 more mins to order Ordered appetizer and a drink, but both came after we had our main dish BAD SERVICE !! During all time we were there, the place was NOT busy. We had to go inside and look for our waitress.
