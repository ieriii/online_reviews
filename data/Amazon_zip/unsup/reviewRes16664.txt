I'm not sure what took me so long to finally eat here! The food and drinks are wonderful, and the atmosphere/decor just enhances it - so vibrant and lively - but that is what you're paying for. And that beautiful ceiling in the dining room will make you happy just looking at it. This would be a fun place for anyone. Be warned, though, that even if you make reservations for dinner, you might have to wait still. Good thing there is a large bar/waiting area because it actually does get full. Lots of people are willing to wait it out for the food! My favorite items here: APPETIZER - "ropa vieja" appetizer (shredded braised beef on top of sweet plantains) DRINKS - ginger mojito - "agua fresca" drink (aka, fruit water) ENTREES - "arrachera" (grilled skirt steak with chimichurri, rice, and beans) - "chivito" sandwich (wagyu ribeye, ham, bacon, fried egg, cheddar, and garlic mayo on pretzel roll) DESSERTS - blueberry tres leches FYI - valet parking is only $5, and street parking isn't that difficult in this area.
