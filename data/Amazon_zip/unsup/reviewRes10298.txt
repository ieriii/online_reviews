Ate dinner last night on the patio. I wouldn't really call this a patio as much as I would call it a hidden garden oasis in the west loop. When we first walked in we had the option to eat in or outside (we had a reservation, don't go without one), the inside looked so beautiful I wasn't sure i'd want to sit outside. Once I got out there, i "got it" about why the foodies are all atwitter about this al fresco dining opportunity. There are many, many outdoor tables, but they are far enough away from one another that you definitely have your privacy. It's not noisy at all, which is fast becoming my biggest gripe about chicago's hippest new dining spots. Now. Onto the food. We ordered the panzanella (after reading about it in my daily tastingtable email) and the antipasto to start. Both were excellent and enjoyed with the generous portion of breads they give you. Also, don't miss the balsamic on the table with the bread- it's to die. You could tell how fresh everything was, truly delicious. Apparently Chef Tony Priolo gets most of his ingredients from a local farm, which is very apparent. For dinner I had a pasta that was basically like a puttanesca, and again i could just taste the freshness in each ingredient, especially the tomatoes. My boyfriend had Pesto pizza with figs which was also excellent. All enjoyed with a tasty, summery white we plucked off the 600-bottle wine list, at a modest $30 for the bottle.  Service was excellent and unpretentious. It was threatening rain and our server made sure to let us know if it rained not to run inside where we came out, but to go to the private dining room, and he would replace our food.  All-in-all a wonderful dining experience, I would definitely go back for a special occasion.
