Lets start off by saying a few things about this awesome atmosphere..the armitage location is my favorite. the outdoor area, in the evening, soft lighting, comfortable seating, great music and the food...oh boy...my favorite is the masas de puerco... salty, roasted pork with sweet garlic on top, I like the rice white and black beans on the side... perfecto! Last night I went and our server, Felipe, was excellent. He up-sold us twice and everything he offered was as satisfying as he suggested it would be. Great service, awesome food, everything was wonderful!
