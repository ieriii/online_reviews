I absolutely adore this place. I was devastated when I moved to the suburbs because I was no longer within walking distance. The beer selection is extremely large and well thought out. The menu is warm and comforting. If you can go in the winter time and sit next to the fire you will be in heaven! I highly recommend the steak frites! The mayo that they serve with the french fries is unbelievable...I could eat it by itself. I have never gotten dessert...just order another beer and enjoy the atmosphere!
