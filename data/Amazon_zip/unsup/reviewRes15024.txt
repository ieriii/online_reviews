Hmmm, I read all the reviews before I went and expected a crowded place with good beer and good food. We got there on a Friday at 7 pm, probably the worst time to look for a table in a restaurant that doesn't take reservations.... We were told the wait was about an hour and 15 so we ordered a beer and settled in (in fact it only took them about 30 min to get us a table). Lot's of room to hang out and wait for your table so that's good. But the noise level: incredible. Rock concert like loud! We were only a party of 2 so we just kept yelling at each other and it was sorta fine. But we did hurry out after the dinner to have another beer at a place that was quieter: a Sports Bar! The beer from Revolution I find to be just okay (here, I have to admit that a) I am from Germany and b) I live in Portland, OR, so I might be a little hard on new upcoming microbreweries...). The stout was kinda flat and boring, their IPA too sweet and their Pilsner didn't taste like a true Pilsner at all. Disappointing. The food was medium at best but the pricing was reasonable. I had the Hombre Burger that was recommended on Yelp and it was good but the fries were just a step above awful. Soggy and to greasy. My friend had a pizza that was really good, like original Italian pizza. Altogether 3 stars for patches of really good with lots of mediocre and noise that could fall under dangerous if exposed to it for too long!
