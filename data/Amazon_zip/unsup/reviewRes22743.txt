I recently stopped by Greek Islands with my old Greek high school football coach who was in town. He vouched for the restaurant's authenticity. While they don't take reservations on the weekends, there isn't much of a need. I've never waited more than 20 minutes. You can always enjoy a Greek beer while you wait. Food wise, I'd recommend the baby octopus. Squeeze some lemon on those bad boys and you are ready to go.
