I checked out a day early and drove 4 hours in the middle of the night to get away from this hotel. This is a warning for you, even if you think the price is good! This hotel is terrible and the photos at their website are grossly misleading. Even understanding that is an old building, that doesn't excuse the other issues going on inside the rooms. First of all, we asked for a new room after being put in a tiny corner room (that looked like a prison cell) on the 8th floor because it smelled so badly like urine and mildew. Our second room (the exact same room, only on the 11th floor) wasn't much better. It was mildewy, but less of a urine odor. To be honest, we didn't spend much time in the room the first day. Here are the other issues with the rooms: the elevators are very slow, the TVs are old and have horrible reception, the air conditioning is via a window unit which barely works and only blows air through the mildew smelling curtains (which you have to keep closed because there are people working in the buildings adjacent), it takes forever for the water to get warm let alone hot, there were dead bugs smashed on the bathroom wall, hair everywhere, mold on the shower curtain and just an overall feeling of uncleanliness. We left early due to the fact I have mold allergies and I began to develop an upper respiratory infection. The manager still charged us for 1/2 the day, but we were just happy to leave. We drove 4 hours back to Detroit to get away. Yes, we left the Chicago Travelodge for Detroit if this gives you any idea of how terrible this place was. (I've never missed Detroit so badly!) The mold is something that is embedded in the carpet, tile, etc. The mildew sheets and curtains could be better if they used better laundry techniques, so I felt that this is just a cheap place to stay. I would never stay here again, or recommend it to anyone.
