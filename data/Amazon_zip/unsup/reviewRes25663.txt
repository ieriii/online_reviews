As an appetizer we ordered the fried zucchini. It came with ranch sauce and the combination was delicious!! We also ordered the pan pizza with sausage, mushroom and onion. The pieces of sausages on our pizza were huge! While many yelpers raved of the caramelized crust, I was not a fan of it. The crust looked more black and burnt than caramelized to me. No thanks. The bottom of the crust was more bread like (fluffy) and not crispy than what I've had from other pizzerias. However, service was top notch. Everyone was very friendly. We were checked up upon multiple times by multiple people. Since this pizzeria is a little out of the way for me, I don't think I will be visiting again for a while.
