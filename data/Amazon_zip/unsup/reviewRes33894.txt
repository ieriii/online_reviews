I had a nice meal here on Wednesday night. There were no appetizers that caught my eye, however there were many entrees that looked good. I went with the quattro formaggi ravioli in a vodka creme sauce. It was delicious! The menu was handwritten and changes frequently. By 730PM, this place was packed and LOUD.  I want to sit outside when I return in the future.
