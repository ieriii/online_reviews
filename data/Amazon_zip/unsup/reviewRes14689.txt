I'm gonna give 'em the benefit and say "working out kinks" I'd do a 2.5 1) Beer, thought it was reasonably priced - YAY!, but house brews pretty flavorless/ not well developed in flavor, watery - BOO. 2) Decor and space is awesome, had a party of 15-18 and they let us stand around our tables and just keep ordering - YAY! There was a giant flat screen tv and it was off, hoping they'd show the olympics - Boo. (and dang that place is crowded!! not necessarily a negativo) 3) Food. hmmm. menu read great, bit of burger i had was outstanding - YAY. the pizzas were horrific, one bite would be good with a crispy crust, the next soggy with broccoli/basil STEMS, no leaves only bitter undercooked stems, nastified - Boooooooooo. Lots of pro's, but unfortunately still lots of cons. likely i'll be back at some point if i hear that their beer skills improve cuz it's a cool place to hang.
