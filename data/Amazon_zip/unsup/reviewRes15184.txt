Love, love this place - can't say enough good things about it. The food is very good and always solid. The beer...well, I'm a little picky about what I like when it comes to beer. But, there is always a good selection, and I can always find multiple types of beer that I like. The beer menu has a few standards, but they have a good rotating selection, and there's always something new to try. We tend to sit at the bar, even when getting food...but the service has always been great. So happy to have this awesome staple in the neighborhood!
