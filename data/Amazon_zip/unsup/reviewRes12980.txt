I came here with a group of friends about a month ago and all I can remember is how tender and flavorful the meat was. And I mean that for all the meat-- including the chicken (which is the best I've had at a place like this). Maybe it's because I'm a salt person, but this was some of the most delicious beef, chicken, and pork I've had at a Brazilian steakhouse. And their salad bar (along with a sushi bar) was fabulous. They had me at big wheel of Parmigiano-Reggiano and delicately thin slices of prosciutto di Parma. Everything is just sooo good. I felt disgusting afterward since I completely overstuffed myself, but honestly . . . I'd do it all over again (on a night when I have nothing else to do so I can spend 3-4 hours alternating between eating and resting). That would seriously be the good life.
