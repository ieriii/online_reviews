I've heard over & over that this is a Sox bar. Not sure why to the point that I'm wondering if that term, "Sox bar" is a pejorative. The beer was cold enough but the food was just OK and oddly expensive, as if I didn't know any better. Sorry, I wasn't drunk enough not to notice I was being ripped off. It's bad enough my White Sox are pretending to be the Cubs this year (aka "sucking") at least break off a deal or help me drowned my sorrows without going broke.
