So I never really know what to make of those places that get featured in one of those Food Network shows like "Best of...[insert city name here]." But I saw "Hot Doug's" featured on one of those types of shows and it stuck with me because they had crazy things like Ostrich sausages, etc. Maybe I made that up. Anyway, I just knew that I had to try it. Along with everyone else and their mothers, of course. The line was about 2hrs long. But strangely, it wasn't all tourists. There were definitely a good number of locals in that line. I guess in my mind, Hot Doug's line was sort of analogous to the Shake Shack line. And I am very glad we waited in that line. We ordered the celebrity sausage of the day which was a knackwurst with cheese on the inside and outside, a "Bacon and Cheddar Elk Sausage with Bacon-Garlic Mayonnaise and Beer-Washed Truckle Cheese," and of course, a large order of their fresh-cut fries. It was my first elk experience. It was delicious. You could definitely taste the smokiness of the knackwurst which I thought was a very nice touch given that both sausages were char-grilled.  The table next to us ordered maybe about 3 different types of sausages/hot dogs per person, which we should've done and will do the next time I am in Chi. Finding a table/seating was also NOT difficult at all despite the huge crowd. I also thoroughly enjoyed all the kitchsy hot dog products and paraphenalia. Definitely worth the line.
