I went to the Purple Pig last night with high hopes. Unfortunately, our experience was an overall disappointment. In concept, this place is genius. Cheese, swine and wine, what's not to love? This place is tiny and overcrowded - even by New York standards. Also, the service at our table, and at the bar, was god awful. Most importantly, it was pretty expensive. You can get better wine, better food and better service in a far more comfortable setting at Quartino or Bin 36 any day.
