Great fast casual street Mex joint by Mr. Bayless - who seems to float in between his latest Xoco (saw him last night!) and his fancier joints Frontera Grill and Topolobampo next door. Interesting ordering and hostess-seating system is surprisingly efficient, as the line at 7pm on a Saturday night was snaking out the door. From the hot chocolate menu, had the almendrado (chocolate shot+almond milk) and classic (server's recommendation), and definitely preferred the latter.  Churro was warm and crunchy (but small), and coated with sugar and flecks of chocolate. The pepito torta (braised short rib sandwich) was well prepared but surprisingly bland, even topped with artisan jack and pickled jalapenos. Would return to try other items on the menu and for the warm and buzzing vibe.
