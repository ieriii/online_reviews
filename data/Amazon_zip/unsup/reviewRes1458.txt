I saw this place on Bourdain. I wanted to like it. I heard about the 45 Minute Wait for the Hot Dogs. Sorry Doug, I can't say it's worth the wait. Despite all the Sausages that are at $6-$9 a pop, they are just "Encased" meats. Worth it to say you talked to tv star Doug at his spot. Unfortunately... No exactly the religious experience as a Pinks or Sweatman's.
