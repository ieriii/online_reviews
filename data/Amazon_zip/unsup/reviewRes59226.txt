I love and dream about Sun Wah, but I'm actually a little sad that they moved to their new location. I'm thrilled that the bathrooms are clean now, but it lost something now that specials are no longer written on the back of a paper plate and taped to the wall. That being said, the food is great - especially the rice noodles with vegetables (extra crispy) and Chinese broccoli.
