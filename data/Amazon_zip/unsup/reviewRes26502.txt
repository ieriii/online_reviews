I had to try this place after my coworker kept describing the food to me. I tend to not go to Vietnamese restaurants because I will always say that my mom's stuff is better. But surprisingly, what we ordered for the most part tasted authentic, but had it's own style. We ordered the catfish sour tamarind flavored soup with the stewed catfish in the pot. YUM! I love these two dishes. Also go the Bo Luc Lat (steak cubes), so tender and buttery. The duck salad with fish sauce. This one tasted very unique and the fish sauce was very mild. Our party came here on a Saturday night and it was packed! We made reservations but waited about 10 minutes for a seat. Not too bad. Expect to feel like you're in a warm Italian/Greek restaurant with all the close tables and noise. It's BYOB friendly, so it's a must check out.
