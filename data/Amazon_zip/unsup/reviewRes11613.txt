1 hesitant star, in full acknowledgement that I should return on a weeknight. Weekends in Wicker Park/Bucktown remind me why I would never want to live in the suburbs. Bleckgh!! At least the yokel masses flood our fair town but twice a week. So, 8PM + 2 hour wait (for pizza and beer, as a reminder) + feeling like I'm at the Cheesecake factory in Naperville = I don't think so.
