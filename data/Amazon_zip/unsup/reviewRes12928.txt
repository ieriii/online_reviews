I first went to Cafe 28 over 10 years ago and have been back as recently as February 2009. The food is still amazing, the staff is still excellent and the drinks are still strong! I have dreams about the duck...melts in your mouth. But the best thing here is the brunch. You can't find a better breakfast burrito in the city...add some Cuban coffee and I'm set!
