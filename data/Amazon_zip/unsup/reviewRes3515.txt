This is a very COOL twist to your traditional korean restaurant. The experience is one of a kind. The food had an explosion of flavors in every bite. Sauces are to die for! We went on a sunday just 1/2hr before they close, although we were a little confused when we first walked in there partially due to its seating and ordering style. The guy at the counter which helped us out was very nice, helpful, and welcoming. The place is quite small with a limited menu and seating area (which felt more like a take-out joint) but packed with huge flavors! You definitely get your moneys worth! So we'll be back...Thanks Crisp!
