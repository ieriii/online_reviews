Woahhhhhh AMAZING MEAL!!!! A++++++++++ (if this was an ebay review lol) This is def the up-and-coming trendy, scene place to get seriously the best steak and/or seafood meal of your life!!! The service is crazy, amazing, excellent. It's like having servants tend to your every need. The wine list is out-of-control. For all you wine-os out there, you will fall over dead with this list. We had the server-recomended Zinfandel, which was amazing and only $40!!! Oh did I mention our server was young, nice AND a SOMMELIER!!! He told us it was the best wine on the menu for the price point. I got the bone-in filet medium-rare and Masto's knows how to cook meat, it came out medium-rare, juicy and steamy. The plates are actually sizzling hot so you can cook your meat further if needed. All of the sides were awesome, we ordered 4 of them I think--just wanted to try stuff out. You can't go wrong with any of them in my opinion. They are known for their Lobster mashed potatoes and Gnochi. I couldn't have the Lobster b/c of allergies but the rest of my party was drooling over the food. THE DESSERT IS TO DIE FOR. Order it with a cappucino and complete your meal. You're worth it. Instead of getting FRATTY this weekend and buying an obscene amont of shots and booze at the bars for your brahs and some hos, save your $$$$, grab a few of your classier friends and HIT UP MASTROS. You'll thank me later... Wait, Mastro's will call to thank you.
