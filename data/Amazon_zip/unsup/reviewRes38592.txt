I like beer a lot...but know nothing about good beer. Coming to Hopleaf is great because they let me try little cups of beer until I find something I like. I never remember the name of it later, so I don't usually have the same thing twice.  Boyfriend had been hyping the food for a longggg time, and last night we finally had french fries and mac&cheese. It was pretty not good at all. Very bland and disappointing, and he smelled like garlic mayo this morning when I rolled over for a kiss. GROSS. Granted, that last part isn't really their fault...but I wish the french fries tasted incredible without being coated in gross nasty mayonnaise. The three stars are basically for the beer and the bartenders. It's always packed, pretty smoky (though not for long...) and kind of expensive. It's a fun place to go every so often...but not for food.
