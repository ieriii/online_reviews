Great location, great front patio, and overall good food. I have been here for brunch and dinner and really enjoyed the food each time. I loved grilled tomatoes on any menu and Wilde does them right. Beer menu is pretty solid and their bloody marys were great. All in all, this is perfect place to stop on Broadway for a drink or a meal.
