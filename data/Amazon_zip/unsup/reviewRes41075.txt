I came here for the first time yesterday for a post-civil union lunch type deal. Yay Illinois for getting with the program! A group of about 25 trickled in (the newly unioned pair had called about a week before to make sure that this would be okay to do) from a beach a few Red Line stops to the north and they were very accommodating and friendly about it, giving us all individual checks, keeping on top of the groups needs, and handling all of the orders in a very timely manner given our groups size. The food was great. Everyone seemed quite pleased with what they ordered and this was a group ranging from vegetarians to pork enthusiasts so I think that says a lot. I was a little overwhelmed by the menu which is a hardback illustrated deal roughly the size of a children's book and ultimately settled on rice noodles with stir fried veggies and shrimp with a pineapple smoothie. The noodles were the wide flat kind when I was expecting thin ones, but the only downside to them was that they were a little bit harder to eat with chopsticks. The pineapple smoothie was second best only to Irazu and the chunks of fruit on top were an excellent touch. The piece of watermelon on mine was fresh and flavorful but I was kind of bummed by the three chunks of mango just because as much as I like mango, it makes my tongue and throat itch so I elected not to sample it. I was the person Rod S was referring to as being short changed. But they were great about resolving the issue, though it did take a minute to convey the situation just due to a bit of a language barrier.  I'll definitely be back and I think next time I'll be giving their wonton soup a go.
