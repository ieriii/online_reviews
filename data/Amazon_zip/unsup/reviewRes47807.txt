A really special Sunday brunch setting. Incredible variety of well made foods. I know I overdid it but worth the calorie splurge. The hot skillets of individual cinnamon buns, frittata and maple glazed slabs of bacon and eggs benedict as starters would have been more than enough, but these were only the starters!  There are buffet tables spread with variety of salads, veggies, cheeses. The skewered meats were juicy and tasty. My favorites were the sirloin steak and most moist turkey ever. Save room for the delectable, bite size desserts y'all. Their size was perfect and offered variety of flavors. Especially enjoyed the dark chocolate and the passion fruit wedges. Embarrassed to tell anyone how many I ate!  There were also mini carrot cakes, brownies as well as cookies. My date said I missed the velvet cake. And forgot to try the sorbets. Service was attentive and friendly. Definitely will be back for more.
