Very eclectic menu and very nice drink selection. Definitely bring your lady friend for a date here if you want to seem smart. Just make sure you do your research on Wikipedia first so you know what you are ordering. I went simple with a Wild Boar Sloppy Joe and beef fat fries. It was completely delicious (but to be fair, anything with beef fat is pretty much a guaranteed win.) I also had a Horchata with a little rumplestilskin in it and couldn't have been happier. Nice outdoor seating. They lost one star for service, but I can't really complain about anything else. Delicious!
