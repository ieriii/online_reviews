In the city that perfected pizza - Pequod's is perfect pizza. The service is always friendly and quick. The pizza is amazing.  We go about once a month and get a pitcher of Blue Moon and a large sausage pizza. (The pitcher is like 18 bucks so we are considering alternatives.) The servers are always on the ball - they are very relaxed and just do their thing. The pizza is thick - not really deep dish in the purest sense of the word. The sauce is sweet but not sugary - the sausage is fresh - not pre-cut or prepackaged. The thing is - though - the crust. The crust is crunchy and light and flaky and delicious beyond Yelping. What my people would call a peasant crust - I can't get enough of it. We are going tonight - get our table near the window - and get lost in the best pizza Chicago has to offer...
