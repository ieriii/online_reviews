I was very excited to come here for the Southern food, mainly the brisket, but this place was a huge disappointment. We arrived on time for our reservation (which wasn't necessary) and were seated right away by the hostess who also brought us some chips & salsa....then we waited 10 minutes before the server even stopped by to tell us she'd "be right with us". I'm giving this place one star because I can't give it none....honestly, the only things I like were the mac&cheese and mashed potatoes. Other than that, the brisket was bland and the garlic horseradish it was served with was really just yogurt. My sister ordered the strip streak, medium rare; it came out well done, unseasoned, and very tough. Other than the food sucking, the decor was all over the place, there was a fly in my "beer of the month" which turns out isn't any sort of special, and the tablecloths were FILTHY.
