Went for the Sunday buffet, which from my experience is one of the best I've ever been to. They don't skip on the quality or preparation on any of the food being served, and the price is what should be expected.The ambiance and is very pleasant, with everyone dressed as business casual or better. The decor is classy with heavy use of wood, but nothing is over done. The drinks are in line with the food, and the buffet layout flows well, minimizing large crowds at certain spots.
