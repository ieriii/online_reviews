Great beers, excellent food. I had a totally unnecessarily ridiculous burger with pork belly, onion jam, gruyere and some other stuff, which was insanely good. I could only manage to eat about half of it though. The bacon fat popcorn is to die for.  A great place to grab drinks and some great bar food.
