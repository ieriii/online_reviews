I'm a born and raised Texas beef brisket barbecue girl who was probably eating it second-hand in the womb and never stopped since. I married a born and raised Memphis pork barbecue man who is pretty much the same. I may not know how to cook it myself at home (because I'm super lazy in the kitchen) but I know good barbecue when it's on the end of my fork. And q here is good barbecue. I got my grubby little barbecue-loving hands on every single kind of meat they offer here, with the exception of the $305 pork shoulder. (When I go back to Chicago next August, I fully intend to spend my 5-day allotment of dinner money on that pork shoulder and just eat it for the rest of my stay. Maybe. Probably.) I can personally vouch that every single kind of meat they offer is tasty as hell. The kobe beef brisket was especially remarkable - juicy and tender without being overly fatty. The service was a little hilarious though. We had 4-5 people waiting on us throughout the night and none seemed to be communicating with each other (which is how I ended up with a metric ton of chips to take home, not that I'm complaining), but they were all still incredibly attentive. Their lack of communication only benefited us in the end!
