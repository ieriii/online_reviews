How did I not get to Glenn's sooner....if you're interested in going on a Thursday, Friday, etc., make a reservation!  The fish menu is outstanding, huge variety of fish and ways it's prepared. The mussels appetizer is YUMMY! I had the Rainbow Trout with Pecan butter - Deelish! I plan on becoming a regular at Glenn's.
