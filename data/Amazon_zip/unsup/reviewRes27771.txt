Maybe it's because I'm from L.A. and used to good Mexican food, or maybe it's that I really can't taste the organic and locally raised through the expensive prices and small portions, but my first meal on a recent Chicago visit was less than satisfactory. We were seated during a Friday lunch at a two top in the bar area. We started with 2 Topolo Margaritas, which at $9 a piece were small and lacking flavor. My roommate, who knows her margaritas, would have been disappointed. Our two entree selections: Enchiladas $14.75 and Duck Tacos $15 were both alright and although we could have used more tortillas and asked for them, but our server was lacking in the attentive arena. The mole sauce on the enchiladas was just , well not great. Rick needs to take the recipe from Guelaguetza http://www.yelp.com/biz/ Our server upsold us on the guacamole, which at $7.50 for a small amount was crazy. Don't mean to toot my own horn, but I think my guac is much better. Both versions I make. Finally, our server Alejandro was just absent after our food was served. We asked for both water and tortillas and were ignored. I had to flag down another server to ask for water and he didn't even bring us any. Alejandro finally brought water right at the end of the lunch, which of course probably could be seen as a blatant stab at service before the tip is decided. Total, excluding tip, was $61.60 The bottom line, for me, is this...If you were to take Frontera's food and service and move it to a small strip mall in the burbs, rename it, remove references to Rick Bayless, would the hype still be there?
