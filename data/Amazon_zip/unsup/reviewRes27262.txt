In terms of Chicago-style pizza, I think this is the place to be. I'm also a fan of Pizzeria Due, but I think Pequods wins out on taste; don't jump on my back for this judgment, I know that Chicago-style pizza loyalties are serious business. Anyway, this is a great spot to go for pizza, a Hawks game on TV, and some pretty decent beers on tap (all great options). Mind you, if you're thinking 'oh, I'm getting pizza, this will be a cheap night out,' it's not that kind of joint. While the atmosphere is very laid back, Peqouds adds up price-wise, though you really get what you pay for, and will never leave hungry.  Parking on the street kind of sucks, but transit isn't bad, nor are the bike routes getting there.
