We had an OK stay at this Marriott location. The room was beautiful and clean, bathroom was large and accommodating for me and my daughter to get ready for our night at Lollapolooza. When we checked in the housekeeper was just finishing up our room which was fine. But once we returned from a long night of partying we realized there was no hand soap and only 1set of face and bath towels was left. As a frequent guest I would have thought my 'profile of preferences' might have made a difference, but it turns out they treat us all same even with the customized customer data available. This may seem a little particular to some, but having a full curtain to block the blazing summer morning and the UIC medical center's ongoing ambulance sirens would have been a nice touch as well. Instead there was only a full sheer curtain that made certain you didn't miss the 11am checkout.                Service was decent. Drive up valet was haphazard and the driveway was extremely narrow with no one regulating check-in. When a bellman did come out he asked our last name and verified valet service, but they did not offer to carry luggage to the room or supply a cart for us to manage on our own. There was typical poor service when you hand the attendant your card and they place your card on the counter. Lastly, after a night of Lollapalooza, the front desk didn't seem too happy to receive my request for towels at midnight...although it could have been avoided by reading my 'preference for extra towels' on my profile.  I appreciated the housekeeper NOT ignoring the 'do not disturb' door sign and rapping on my door prior to the checkout time this time. I also appreciated the FREE shuttle service up to 1 mile away from the hotel. There's plenty city you have access to within a mile and a minimal taxi ride fee. However, if you don't ask for it, they will NOT offer. Anyway, we had an AWESOME late night dinner at Hackney's (I'll save that review for their page).  In all at the hotel was nice, but for the $270 price tag you might be able to find a more service focused hotel to accommodate your needs.
