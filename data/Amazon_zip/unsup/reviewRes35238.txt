Shaw's. Damn you know how to put on a good show. I've always loved the place for its cool as a cucumber 50's vibe, it's amazingly fresh seafood and incredibly fresh and diverse oyster menu. But I never knew you liked to party, too! Chalk me up for my first Royster with the Oyster event. We were lucky enough to get on the list for the Tuesday slurp off - twelve contestants slurpin' down a dozen oysters as quickly as possible without using their hands. I feel like I did okee for a noob - suckin' down 9 oysters before "Two-at-a-time Tony" next to me put his big paw in the air as the winner. I felt honored just to be in the same field as a living legend. We came back on Friday for the big tent event. Great bands playing da blues, sudsy brews and amazing food - including a butterific lobster roll, fried jumbo shrimp, tasty jambalaya, and, of course, cold as the North Sea oysters. It was a pearl of a time and I'm already looking forward to next year. No worries though, I'll be back in at Shaw's oyster bar when that goober mood strikes.
