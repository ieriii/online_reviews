Comfort food is epitomized by Sultan's Grandma's chicken soup, their lentil soup and the warm rice-and-lentils salad. Just try the magical salty goodness of the soup, since it will make you drool AND magically cure whatever sickness you had. As for the rice and lentils made with soft golden sauteed onions, add the Jerusalem salad on top. Wow.
