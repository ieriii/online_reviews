So 6 hours later I was having palpitations, chewing on baby aspirin and fighting for air as my heart rate raced trying to sustain my body. I still had a smile as the smokiness of the pig I ingested coursed through my arteries and as a last meal it was damn fun. Is wonderful to see how creative one can be with good beer and horny tummy and big slabs of pork to cut, to carve, to smoke, to marinate, to prepare, to honor, to celebrate, to enjoy. This is a pub to satisfy the carnal primal voices, to share with the world, to share with the friends, to weed out the tightly wound "foodies", to bring together the enlightened and hungry. so I write a song to make the whole world sing... "I ::fart sound:: ate this I ::fart sound:: ate that I ::fart sound:: : and had a heart attack I ::fart sound::  had fun I ::fart sound::  even for a party of one I ::fart sound::  love the pig I ::fart sound::  I see in me I ::fart sound:: yay me! "" ;p yay Mary, the most awesome server!
