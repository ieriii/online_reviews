Horrible Service! I live in the neighborhood and have been to Artopolis many times because I like their coffee and food... but each time I leave frustrated because the service is so terrible. The waitresses completely ignore you and I NEVER see them crack a smile. One woman in particular, I believe her name is Jelena, is really bad. She is always in a miserable mood and you have to hunt her down to order, get refills, get the check, etc. I hope they improve their service soon. It is a shame because we really do like the atmosphere and the food, but today may have been our last time there.
