OK-more like 3.5 stars because it is just a cool Chicago icon to visit with car-hop service and kitschy charm. Ordered the all-beef Superdawg with the flourescent green relish, pickle wedge and mustard. The dog had the right bite, and was served in a box with crispy french fries. Window Service was smooth and friendly-and I really didn't see the car hops. Meal in a box for $4.95 plus a drink-how can you complain?
