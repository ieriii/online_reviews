Overall, it's a good dining experience, but I can't recommend this place as a "good" Steakhouse. I tried three steaks during my visit: 24oz Porterhouse, 12oz Filet Mignon, and the Chef's Cut 33oz Ribeye. Bottom line: these steaks don't have much flavor in the meat. The "add-ons" (butter, char crust, etc) are overwhelming. Maybe it was just the night I went, but I did try three different steaks during my visit, and never found that prime beefy flavor I was hoping for. I'm sure improvements will be made! I went not long after it opened. Service is excellent. Five stars to the waitstaff, who were attentive and very kind. Service, appetizers and sides were great.. and the bar looks like a good time. I may give this place another shot in the near future.
