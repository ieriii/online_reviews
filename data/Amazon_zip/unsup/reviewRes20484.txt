Champions of mediocrity. The entire place is cliche and everything about this place is a tease. After starting you off with a decent appetizer (the crab on a stick appetizer was good but the portion was puny) the meal continues into an unmemorable serving of sushi. I'd say it's average sushi at best and their portions are on the small-ish side for the price.  If you're in the mood for sushi and don't have the energy to find a better sushi joint, Coast will suffice.
