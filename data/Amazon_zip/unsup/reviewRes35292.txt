So, I am the first to admit that Chinese is NOT my favorite food. Ok, maybe American chinese food just doesn't suit me. It is usually just too sweet and greasy. And, I really despise any kind of fried rice. It just doesn't suit my taste buds...... Dumplings as appetizer. Burned. Literally. Burned. Nothing else to be said about that. With that being said, I agreed to go to Sun Wah on the premise that they had really good Peking duck and barbeque. Ribs and whatnot. Order spare ribs. Mm. Cold, like they had been sitting in a tin plate under a heat lamp then coated with sauce that was hot. Crusty. No, not in a good way. Chicken entree. Peking chicken I assume, it was at least made specifically for us because I saw the steam coming off of the meat. But the chunks of chicken they breaded were mostly gristle. Really? Your prices are not that cheap to bread the gristle. Totally unimpressed. The duck was meh...the whole experience left me with a stomach ache both figuratively and actually. Had a good time with the friend who took me to dinner but I shouldn't have to write a review about our conversation because the food was so bad. Step it up, seriously.
