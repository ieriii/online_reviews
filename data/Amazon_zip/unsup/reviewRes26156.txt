I'm not sure that I'm qualified to review this. This was my first Vietnamese experience, so I'm not sure what it's supposed to be like. But anyway, here goes. The appetizer we had, lemongrass beef, was delicious. I would eat it again in a heartbeat.  The main dishes, enh. I didn't like my duck with bamboo shoots at all, and I'm fond of bamboo normally, and all the other duck I've ever had I've liked. But this was gray and greasy, and the dish was SPICY. I like spicy food, too, and this was too much for me. The other diners had clay pot chicken and beef with asparagus, and both were okay, but had sweet sauces, and I just don't like sweet sauces on things. So I'm ambivalent. But the jasmine rice was perfect, and the fried rice? It MADE the meal. 40 million times better than greasy Chinese fried rice. I would order food from this restaurant JUST for the fried rice. That good. And the after-dinner plate of fresh fruit? Kind of a nice palate cleanser. But on the whole, this was a mixed experience, and I'd like to try some other restaurants before I judge whether or not this truly is a three-star place. We'll see.
