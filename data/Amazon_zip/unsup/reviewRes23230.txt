Loved it! The dining room is really nice, spacious and very clean. The service is not the quickest ever, but it was perfect for my girlfriend and I to catch up and chat and (sort of) get through the tome of a menu - literally, it is a book. Really enjoyed that they provide you with hot tea, ice water, and spicy cabbage right off the bat. We ordered wonton soup, which was one of the best I've ever had, then we shared the Kung Pao Shrimp and the Tony's Chicken. I loved both our entrees but preferred the shrimp - the chicken was great but it was fried and therefore kinda heavy but had a wonderful sweet taste that I've never had before. Both of our main courses had one chili pepper next to them, but I honestly didn't think they were that spicy. Just perfect. Delicious meal - perfect choice for having a delicious dinner on a winter night with a friend. Next time I might even upgrade to two chilis ;-)
