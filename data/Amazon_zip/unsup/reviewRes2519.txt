Overall, it's a good place. Definitely not worth standing in a long ass line for, though. The specialty sausages are my favorite, which is what I solely get when I'm there. Most of them good; occasionally, one of them isn't so great, but at least he's experimenting. Doug's Chicago style dog and the other standard fare are so-so. (ie: I've had better). I never understood the fascination with the duck fat fries; they taste just the same as the regular fries! I do kinda wish that Doug had longer hours. I think part of the problem with the long lines is that they're not very efficient at handling all those people. A lot of people will chat it up with him, and he'll be more than happy to oblige. Sometimes I wish he'd channel the Soup Nazi a little just to get things moving.
