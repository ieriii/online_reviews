Do not come here with a group of friends who treat the bar as a tool to get sloppy and ridiculous. Come here with a small group that will appreciate a finely-mixed cocktail, possibly the best cocktail they have ever consumed. Come to appreciate the very carefully-cultivated atmosphere. Some people will hate this place and I can kind of understand why. They have some rules that you will be unaccustomed to and you might try to rebel against them. The rules are in place for everybody's enjoyment though. My only qualm is when I have been there early, like 6pm, to meet a friend. I also expect maybe two other people to join me in the near future, but it isn't a sure thing. The hostess' are not very accommodating for groups like this. They pretty much want you to know exactly how many will be in your party and select a table that can hold that precise number of people. They are not very flexible at all. But, as I said, if you just go with it, it is possibly the most enjoyable bar in Chicago.
