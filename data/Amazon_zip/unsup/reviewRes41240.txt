Wow! This place has received over 500 reviews? I ordered the Pho and the fried shrimp eggrolls. It was good, but nothing really mind-blowing. The service is quick and efficient. Can't complain. The menu is huge; like a book. I'll be back, trying other things. But I just can't write the rave reviews that others have.
