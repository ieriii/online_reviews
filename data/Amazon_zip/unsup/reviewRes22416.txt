Perhaps I'm shortsighted or just stubborn but Greek Islands is the only restaurant I go to in Greek town. To be slightly fair, I did try another place but quickly went back to where it just feels right. Free valet is a good start as I don't have to worry about that at all whenever I want to make a visit. I also don't end up waiting more than 20 mins or so to get a table too. There are many great dishes to choose from but I always have to start with Saganaki, lots of pita bread and tahini sauce just for good measure. I also go for the combos as I can mix and match a bit to try different things every so often. Their baklava is very good and perfect to finish off a meal. The service has been consistently great as they are very attentive and friendly. Even when the place is busy, I have no problem with the wait staff.
