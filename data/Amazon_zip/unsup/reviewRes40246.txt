Came here after going to Bangers and Lace for a drink. They say greasy foods taste the best after drinking, and this may very well be the reason for me thinking their beef tongue taco was something wonderful. My friend got the steak taco which I thought was marinated better. This place has become a monopoly on this street. They have 3 different locations all within a few feet of each other. But out of the 3, only 1 stays open til the wee hours of the morning. Go to this location to get your late night taco fix. Expect a full house when going, no matter the time.
