So this is how a food shrine looks like. Whenever i feel like spoiling myself or friends, this is where I shop. Amazing selections of meats including Wagyu steaks, oxtail is always available, fresh sea-food (largest shrimps i laid my eyes on), plus, if you want a specific fish, you can order it and they'll make sure its available for you. Real sour dough breads, and not the instant-fake ones you are so used to. Real patisserie, selection of Olive oil from all over the world (Italy is enough for me!), Rare balsamic selection. Tasty selection of cheese from all over the world (although you cant taste it all, only some) I can go on & on about this place, but whats the point? if you feel like cooking tonight, pay this place a visit! Free valet parking is also a bonus. (even though i dont like others to be driving my precious) prices are not cheap, but how can they be?
