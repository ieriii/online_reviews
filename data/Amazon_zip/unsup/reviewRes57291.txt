The food is amazing, unfortunately you have to deal with a rude host stand and snotty server to enjoy it.It's a shame, with a menu as impressive and delish as this, you would think the staff would have better service skills. There are other places to grab sushi in the city with just as great a menu and a cheerful, more knowledgeable staff. Check out my review for Sushi Samba.
