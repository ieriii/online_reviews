The Grand Lux Cafe, located just off Michigan Avenue, is well-known as a place to lunch when in the city. Even though the food and service are just average, and the menu is similar to that of Cheesecake Factory, this huge restaurant is always packed with people waiting for a seat. Large rooms filled with oversized booths make it a fun atmosphere for group dining.
