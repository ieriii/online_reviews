We chose Big Jones because they were close and had an available last minute reservation. We figured if it was disappointing at least we hadn't driven across town. However, I think I can speak for our party that this food is certainly worth a long jaunt. The guys started with some interesting cocktails and the ladies had ginger sweet tea, which has an interesting presentation. Appetizers included crabcakes and fried green tomatos, both served with the same remoulade, both excellent. The crouquettes were deliciously warm and cheesy as well. For entrees, I had the gumbo which was served with sides of pickled serranos an powdered sassafras. The seasoning was right on for my taste. I could have used some bread to sop up the remnants in the bowl! Others got the pork chop and the lamb. Lamb had a sweet tangy BBQ like glaze while the pork was done perfectly with marvelous sweet potatos on the side. We were too stuffed for desert. We will definitely be back.
