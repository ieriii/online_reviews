The BBQ combo mixed grill is a big plate full of delicious duck, pork and chicken for only 6 bucks. Add a bowl of rice for 50 cents and a free pot of tea and fortune cookie--it doesn't get better than this. I perversely enjoy a minimalist vegetable-free dinner like this from time to time. The food is well prepared and all of high quality. The room is large and airy, a high-ceilinged loft-like space. Servers are friendly and efficient, there when you want them, but they don't hover. The extensive menu, beautifully designed with tabs for different categories so you can hone in on what you're looking for quickly, has a fairly large selection of rice or noodle dishes, congee/jook and more complicated dishes, as well as the signature barbecue items. There should be more places like this one. My only minor complaint is that it would be nice if there was an option of a very small cup of soup available, suitable for dining alone; it seems like all of the soups listed have a "small" version which is still too large for one person to reasonably eat, especially combined with a barbecue main course.
