We decided to go to Coast on a whim on a wednesday night and as we walked through a silent bucktown we got a little nervous that they might have closed ealry. Wrong! this place was packed and thought we had to wait 10 minutes for a table it was worth it.The sushi was top notch, I have not had better in a very long time(try the eel, volcano, and wasabi rolls) . It was also affordable; we had 7 or 8 rolls of sushi for the four of us and our bill was under $90. The BYOB policy didn't bother us either. We had two bottles of wine and they lasted just fine. so why only 4 stars? the service. It wasn't horrible, it just wasn't terrific. All in all a great time, great food and worth the trip.
