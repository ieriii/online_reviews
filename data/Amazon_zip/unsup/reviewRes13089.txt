Had a great experience while visiting here for the first time a few months ago when a friend took me here; I would put it as among the top 5 for Brazillian steakhouses. Enjoyed watching the trapeze style wine barrister do her mid-air flips--at first I thought I was delusional when I saw her doing flips in mid-air above the bar. Very cool concept. Great place to take a date or out of town friends. Would recommend going there if you haven't already.
