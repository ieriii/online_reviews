Joined a friend for dinner here and the food was very good. Had the Lamb Shawarma sandwich and it was among the best I've had. The lamb was great as was everything else packed in the tasty pita. It is BYOB with no cork fee but be warned that, unless you bring your own glasses, you'll be drinking wine out of a red plastic cup. To give a sense of the popularity, there was a consistent line of at least 4-6 ordering for the entire hour and half we ate and drank. Cash only.
