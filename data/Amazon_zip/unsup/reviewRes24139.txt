I've never met a crepe here that I didn't like... This place is my personal heaven. Traditional crepes suzettes and design-your-own versions with goat cheese, spinach, roasted peppers and pine nuts (my own creation) are delicious alike. The French/North African flavor twist is unbeatable, as is the decor . Service can be slow at times - order a quick bowl of the pureed vegetable soup to pass the time. You won't regret it!
