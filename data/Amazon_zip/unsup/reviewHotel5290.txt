I stayed here for St. Patrick's day. I always use yelp to check out hotels so i figured I would contribute. Its a little bit of a walk to the red line. I believe it was the Grand stop. The hotel was pretty much as expected. Small bathroom but it served its purpose. Beds were a decent size and appeared clean. Plasma TV was nice. about 100 bucks a night. It seems Brett C. had some trouble with parking. I used Midway Easy Park and it worked out fine. 10 bucks a day and the drive you to midway airport, just hop on the subway and go into the city.
