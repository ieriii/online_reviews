Stayed here for 4 nights and was very happy with it. The location is great. The staff was nice and friendly. The room was set up nice. The Bed was comfortable. A great thing was the room service was 24 hours and reasonable and the food was good. They have a lounge on the 1st floor and an upscale louge/ club on the top floor called Vertigo. Both were great.
