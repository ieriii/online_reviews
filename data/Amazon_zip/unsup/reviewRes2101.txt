Whether you chow one of the weekly specials (alligator, duck or smoked anything) or order from the regular menu (say a Don Rickles with raw onions, kraut and honey mustard), the only way the H.D.'s experience could be improved upon would be an addition of a green room with hammocks for after the debauch. Lordy, considering the amount of dinero I've dropped in this joint, Mr. Sohn should name a wing of his mansion in my honor. And in a perfect world, H.D. would already have an internationally observed holiday named in his honor.
