If you ever have friends or family in town this is the place to take them. I think I've been 3 or 4 times now and it's a great spot. I recommend starting with the fresh guac that is out of this world. The ceviche is extremely fresh and has wonderful citrus flavors. I'm yet to go and not get the braised short rib for my entree as it's the absolute best. I have tried the paella a decent amount and think that is delicious also. They have very fun drinks and enthusiastic wait staff. Definitely a must go.
