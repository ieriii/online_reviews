Absolutely delicious. I ordered their delivery, and we got a small baba ganuj, a meat combo, and a veggie combo. Everything was great. They have some of the softest pitas I've ever eaten. Their falafel is just as amazing as all the other reviews say. The rice and lentils that came with my veggie combo were delicious too. The only negative thing about this place is that it is cash only. I don't have a problem making an exception for them, since our whole order only cost $24 and was delivered in about 15 minutes. Now that's delivery. Other places need to take note, you've got a rival!
