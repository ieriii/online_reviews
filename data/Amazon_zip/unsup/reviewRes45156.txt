A neighbor suggested Anteprima after we were having trouble deciding on a spot for a Friday evening meal in Andersonville. What a cool vibe! A very casual and rustic, but classy room where I felt instantly at home. No pretense, the complimentary "amuse bouche", no haggling over bottle vs. tap water had be won over before the food even arrived. While I'm no sommelier myself, the wine list seemed complete and seemed to have quality options at all price points. We all shared the orecchiette, pappardelle and asparagus risotto dishes and all were delicious. Our server was attentive and was truly interested in our having an enjoyable evening. We found ourselves too full to enjoy any dessert this night, but we'll be sure to save room next time!
