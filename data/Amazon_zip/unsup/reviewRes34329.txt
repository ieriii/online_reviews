9/16/2011 I went to Yolk for the first time today atound 7:30 am. It was not crowded at all, the interior design is quite lovely. My silverware had not been washed and had reminants of chunks of cheese or something yellow on the knife, the fork was also dirty. My friends silverware was not as dirty. The waitress response was just nonchalant oh I will get you another one I had the pancakes, two eggs, two meats breakfast that is advertised for big appetites. The big appetites remark made me feel greedy. But that's ok because I am. The food was luke warm, bacon barely cooked, the pancakes dense and dry. I asked the waitress for hot sauce, she brought tabasco sauce and when I said thati is not hot sauce she insisted it was, because that is what they have on the menu hot sauce. I could have accepted that since most restaurants bring tabasco when you ask for hot sauce. She was snippy and dismissive.  Overall, I would not stand in a line for more than two minutes to eat here.
