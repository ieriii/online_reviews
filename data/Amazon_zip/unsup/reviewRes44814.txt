Staying at the Fairmont nearby and wanting to try something distinctly Chicago, I ended up at Giordano's on my first night. I've never eaten "authentic" Chicago deep dish or stuffed pizza and was pretty excited at the prospect. I've always enjoyed thicker crust pizza and from the praises and aesthetic of the Chicago pie, what's not to like. The execution of this beast of a pizza was quite bad by any means. There was just way too much going on, and none of it good. Too cheesy, up to a point where it was hard to eat. I imagine a depp dish crust to be crisp buy yet chewy with a nice give. But this crust had the texture of a cookie / biscotti. Too god damn hard. I'm sure this doesn't represent Chicago pizza as a whole and may as well be one of those places where tourist such as myself go to experience Chicago pie but this sucks regardless.
