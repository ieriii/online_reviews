Ultra-chewy risotto (can you say styrofoam peanuts?) and inferior service. Told our waiter that we needed to have a timely departure to make a theatre curtain, then went ahead and ordered an extra course at his urging.  You guessed it: despite the waiter's initial and interim assurances, the main course didn't arrive until about 10 minutes before we had to leave. Then our waiter messed up the bill (in the restaurant's favor, of course) and ignored all my subsequent efforts to attract his attention. I finally had to walk the bill to a cash register, where a manager rudely threatened to make the bill even higher before acknowledging that I was right all along and correcting the bill. No apology for the rudeness, however. And no allowance for the taxi we wound up needing for the 2-block ride.
