I never get tired of going here. It's definitely in my top 5 favorite Chicago restaurants. I too often end up with the Pig Platter and a five cheese platter. It's always amazing and usually different every time I go. I'm not sure I can say anything that hasn't already been said in previous reviews.  But, what I will stress is how helpful and attentive the staff is. Every time I go I have questions. The staff is never impatient or annoyed. They genuinely like to help and give suggestions. Good customer service gets me, every single time. Kudos to the staff of The Purple Pig! Keep it up, I will obviously be back.
