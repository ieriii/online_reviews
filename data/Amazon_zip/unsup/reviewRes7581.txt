Fogo de Chao is really wonderful. We've been there three times in the past year and really enjoy it. The service is good, the staff is friendly, and the meat is really great. If you ask any staff member to bring you a certain cut, they drop everything and get it. My water glass is always full at Fogo.  Albeit being the most expensive Brazillian Steak House, downtown, I'm very impressed with the food, management and staff at Fogo. Note: If you're a vegetarian, ask for the grilled vegetable plate.
