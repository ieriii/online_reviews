I have to say the place is pretty crowded for a Monday night when the food is not that spectacular. I live in the area and have passed by this restaurant numerous of time. A friend of mine was in town and she was craving steak so I Yelped and based on the reviews decided on Kinzie CH.  We started off with the steamed mussels which was pretty good. Then proceed to share the wild mushroom risotto and an18oz bone-in Delmonico. Figured 18 oz would sufficed for 2 girls that are used to eating 8oz fillets.....lets just say 18oz is not as big as you think..... Sad to say but we were both very disappointed in the steak. I have no complaints about our waiter except that he failed to mentioned their special for the night which was the Kansas City crusted with parmesan reggiano, blah blah blah....sounds delicious! (overheard from another table with another waiter). Oh and also pushing wine on my friend when she said no 3 times! Guess I am complaining... Back to our steak....our waiter highly recommended the Delmonico and stated it was very flavorful. We agree and decided to go with that medium rare. The steak came out looking delicious but once we stuck the fork and knife in it....it was almost 30% all fat.  It was a slab of meat with chunks of fat and very bland....I wouldn't consider undercooked fat flavorful!  So disappointed! Would have spent a little more and gone to David B or somewhere I knew was better. Oh well.....hope your experience will be better!
