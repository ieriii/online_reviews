I don't have a strong visceral reaction to Bin 36 one way or another. I like it fine, but the mention of it gets me just about as excited as eating plain bagel. Don't get me wrong--I'm a wino. But their flights fail to impress me, and sometimes, I feel like they just don't progress in the right fashion. The vast majority of their domestic wines are California--I'd like to see some more Oregon pinots or Washington cabs thrown in the mix. The South American red flight ain't too shabby, though. And the cheese. Oh the cheese. I mean, you can never really say bad things about cheese. But all the antipasto platters are great to munch along with your wines. Do the hummus. Stat. The space is great for groups, and they are very accommodating to large parties. I do find, however, that there always being at least several large groups in the restaurant at a time, the service rather lags. And the servers I've had actually haven't been all too helpful with the wine selections or descriptions of the flights. Watch out--all that wine & cheese can add up veerrrrrry quickly. Expect to lay down a pretty penny if you are going to do multiple flights. But I suppose that's the nature of wine.
