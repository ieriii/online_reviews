snugged into a cosy little corner next to its cousins frontera and topolobampo, xoco is gourmet sandwiches at its best. i have been there more than once and have always come out impressed. the chicken tinga, gunthorp chicken, the pozole bowl and even the desserts are of very high quality. my only problem with the place is that it is totally packed during peak hours so it is hard to find a place to sit. however, i guess thats just the price you have to pay for a great sandwich.
