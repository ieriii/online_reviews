Hot Doug's has given new meaning to my life. I have found a new mantra and it is, "There are no two finer words in the English language than 'encased meats,' my friend". I do love hot dogs, but that has not always been the case.  As a child I was an avid fan of the television program, The Simpsons. The character Lisa becomes a vegetarian during one of episode and the final straw for her is when she imagines different meats that she could possibly eat. The final image in her mind are the ingredients of a hot dog. The ingredients included a rat tail, raccoon feet, pigeon head, and boot tongue. After this I completely gave up eating hot dogs.  After many years I decided that this was silly and found a new love for hot dogs. I recently have happened upon the restaurant Hot Doug's. Their gourmet hot dogs are something that will blow your mind. The combination of tastes that each specialty hot dog employ have me going back for more. The different games are also something that are exciting. Who knew that boar was delicious topped with Gouda? Uhh I did not until the other day. Would anyone ever assume that foie gras would make an excellent topping for duck sausage? At Hot Dougs all of these dreams have come to fruition. The exciting tastes and delicious foods are something unique to this wonderful restaurant.
