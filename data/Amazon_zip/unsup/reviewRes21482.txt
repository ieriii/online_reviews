Went back with my mom last week and it's just as amazing as it was the first time. Maybe more so because the hostess was super considerate and seated my mom and I before many other people in line (sorry), seeing as though my mother is visibly handicapped and she could see that my mom was unable to stand for a long period of time. Ordered the Ahogada again and the Choriqueso this time to split. Ahogada reigns as the best torta ever. I want to eat this sandwich every day. I will continue to go here until I can say hello to Rick Bayless, and then probably after that too...
