Just left a two day/night stay at the Palmer house & have zero plans to return. The "old charm" of the place is valid, but wears off when your room has no hot water, you end up having to change rooms & then get the worst neighbors in the room next door. Being an older building, you can't expect sound proof rooms, but when the hotel refuses to do anything about your neighbors loud singing, loud talkin & then wild kingdom sounding like mating ritual, well that was under impressive. Mind you this was occurring between 3 & 4 in the morning. Only posting 1 star because the engineer worked really hard trying to fix the hot water issue.
