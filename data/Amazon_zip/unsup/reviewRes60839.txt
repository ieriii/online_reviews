This place is my favorite eating and drinking spot in Chicago! You have to go there to see what I mean. If I were a millionaire, that would be my usual hang-out place (the food is a bit expensive but so healthy).  Parking is a little tricky but if you drive around the block a bit, you will find street parking. Roof-top bar open in the summer, which makes it a trendy place for the young college crowd.
