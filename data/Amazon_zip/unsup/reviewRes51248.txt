Service IS horrible. Drove about 35 minutes to get here and have dinner with my parents. We were a party of 7. Had just settled in with 3 kids. Waitress asks us if we could move from our table. We said no the baby and toddler were at peace. Waitress tells her crew and they all come (5) out asking us to move. We stay firm with our no. Original waitress comes back and asks us if we still want our margaritas since she didn't know if we were staying. Really!?! At that point we all got up and left the place.
