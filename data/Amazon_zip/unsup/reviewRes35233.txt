Chicago's best deal, hands down. The $37 Beijing Duck Dinner (which coincidentally can be served for lunch also) is a feast and was a much appreciated meal after our gorging at some of Chicago's finer and pricier restaurants. What you get is a beautifully lacquered duck carved tableside, with fluffy buns and pickled accoutrements, a wintermelon soup made from the duck carcass, and a hearty plate of duck fried rice. You do get a couple scoops of sorbet as an afterthought. The other 3 is what you should be heartily chowing down on. We couldn't finish everything so we brought the rest of our duck and fried rice to go. Go make your reservation and reserve that duck! You won't be disappointed!
