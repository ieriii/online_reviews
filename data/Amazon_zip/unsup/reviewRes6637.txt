This place is unreal. Love everything there, surprisingly good brunch too. Fairly priced wine.... Every time I go I get the Ragu of the day with the polenta and it never disappoints. Ricotta and honeycomb combo is awesome.... cant really go wrong with anything on the menu here. Small plates, good for a group of 4 so you can try several different things. Expect to wait... good service at bar though.
