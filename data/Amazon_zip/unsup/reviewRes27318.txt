LOOOOVE me some pequod's !! Can't believe the first time I dined here I ordered the thin crust! What was I thinking!?  "I guess I wasn't." :-| Their pan pizza with the caramelized crust is of the most perfect thickness....you can eat it w/ your hands OR a knife and fork. The service is always friendly and the atmosphere is always lively. Pequod's offers a decent beer list and boasts a fully stocked bar. I would have Pequod's at least twice a month if it were closer to my house.
