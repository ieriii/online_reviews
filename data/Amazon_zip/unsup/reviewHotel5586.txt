This is a very nice Westin in an excellent location downtown. From the outside it screams 1980's, but it's clear the owners have poured a decent amount of money into it since. We were upgraded to a suite, which had an awesome view over the Chicago River. The suite was very large and well furnished, even with its own iMac. A few annoyances: the aforementioned iMac kept crashing. Oh well. The club lounge was small and had a very limited breakfast offering. I had intended to hit the Westin Workout, but never made it. Decent room service, but no frills. Overall, a very nice property - I'd return.
