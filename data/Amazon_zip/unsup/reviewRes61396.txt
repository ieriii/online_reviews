We were disappointed. I was going to go to Laguardia Cuban rest a half mile east on armitage but decided to try 90 mile. The parking is awkward as the side street is zoned on one side and no parking the other side. Then we walked passed a smelly grease container by the kitchen rear entrance. We came in and sat in a hot room that reminded me of a brown tent. We got the menus when we were seated. It took a few minutes to get the water. We ordered a bowl of black bean soup, some fried bananas and a pork sandwich on whole wheat roll. The soup was salty, the bananas greasy. The sandwich had about one teaspoon of pork on the whole thing and the bread didn't look like whole wheat. The fried yuca fries were cold but the garlic sauce was ok. . The waiter acted indifferent to our needs. The bill was about $20. Never again. Next time we'll go to Laguardia
