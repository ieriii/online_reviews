There are enough reviews to give great understanding of this restaurant so I'll just state why I gave Fogo de Chao 5 stars. The food is amazing!! My favorite is the beef ribs... it's "melt in your mouth" delicious. I also very much enjoy the salad bar. I'm a big fan of their asparagus and their cucmber salad... YUM!! I would take away a star because they charge $2.95 for a bottle of Sprite (with no re-fills) and $7.25 for a goblet of strawberries and some whipped cream. But then I give them an extra star for service. Yes, the wait staff is incredible but I love the hostess. We go about twice a year and she remembers us every time. She greets us with a warm smile and she is the perfect start to the fabulous meal that is to come. Okay, just a couple of things... If you go during lunch hours it is only $32.50 per person which is much less expensive compared to their dinner rates. This place is children friendly. They make my 4 year old boy feel just as welcome as anyone else... for this alone I'll come here over and over again.
