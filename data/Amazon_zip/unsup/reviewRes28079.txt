My favourite dish of the evening was definitely the Trio sampling of ceviche. Perhaps it was the warm summer night, but the fresh, crisp salsas and chiles perfectly matched the succulent, toothsome cuts of albacore, yellowfin tuna, shrimp and calamari. As much as I enjoyed my company, I could have easily devoured all three on my own (sorry guys!). The menu seemed a bit overwhelming and intimidating, so I ultimately opted for a simple skirt steak tacos. Although the protein was cooked and seasoned perfectly and the tortillas themselves were delightfully plush and soft, I wish I had been a bit more adventurous and gotten something else that was perhaps more difficult to pronounce or spell. However, I am always pleased when dessert ends the night on a high note. If you are a fan of custards, the Duo de Flanes is great. A bit on the richer, heavier side, but please don't misinterpret that as a complaint - that is definitely how I like my sweets. Paired with a grilled peach salad and chammomile-lime, each bite was the perfect balance.
