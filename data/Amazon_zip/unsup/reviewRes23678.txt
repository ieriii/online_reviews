I left here pretty pleased. I love the old-school Greek decor. I got some delicious whitefish with tons of oregano and this lemony sauce.. how much Greeker can ya get? My friend and I also got the sakanagi (which basically tasted like scrumptious chewy salt) and dolmades which, yum. So delicious. I will most definitely be back here again.
