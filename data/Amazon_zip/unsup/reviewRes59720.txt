From the bartender Joe to our waiter Michael this establishment has brought back what a dining experience is suppose to be. They were the kindest most accomodating restaurant I've been to in the Chicago area in forever. All restaurants should model their customer service after them. Ruth's Chris made our 2nd anniversary one We will never forget. They even sent somebody to get me nose spray because i couldnt breathe well. I dont think there is another place that would do that. They didnt even charge us for literally taking a trip to a store to help me enjoy myself comfortably. in addition to all THAT......the food was spectacular, cooked to perfection and served in a timely fashion.
