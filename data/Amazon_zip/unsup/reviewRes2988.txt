I downgraded Naha for the price despite some good to great food. The food here is consistently great and it is even a bit more pricey but they get a five. Did a tasting menu - word of caution it is a LONG meal - but really good. Forgot to take notes - but from Sturgeon "caviar", to a gnocchi that was as light and delightful as my favorite one at Naha which is rich and hearty. A beautiful piece of Foie Gras on a meat dish, an amazing celery root soup, really good bread and incredible desserts by Gale. If money not an object - go! On par with Alinea for taste if not presentation theater, and a bit cheaper. And while a bit less adventuresome there were no misses.
