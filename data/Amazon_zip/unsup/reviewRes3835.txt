came here for the 4 stars 425+ reviews! (yelp rarely steers us wrong) between the 2 of us we had 10 wings- 5 regular and 5 ginger soy and we had 2 left-over! these wings are big and tasty! they also gave us other dipping sauces to try, but i think we chose the right combo. the ginger soy was great, but the plain was a good break cuz it got too salty after a while. quick great service and small but clean for eating there. not really a sit down place unless you wanna eat and run. next time i want to try the bi bim bop :)
