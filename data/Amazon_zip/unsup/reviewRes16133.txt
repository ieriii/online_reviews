I have loved this place since the first moment I walked in a couple of years ago. I have since been back many times and each time it's a great experience. One thing that I love about it is that while in line, you may hit it up with another set of people then you can be seated with them. Love being able to meet new people that way!  Great strong drinks, there is a line usually but that's ok because once you get in you actually have a seat assigned to you. So it's worth the wait. All drinks are one price $12 I think. But very strong so worth it.
