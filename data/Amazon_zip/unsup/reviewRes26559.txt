This place is a classic. I've eaten here twice. I really liked the little amuse-bouche they bring out, the budget-friendly prices, laid-back atmosphere and the sweet service. I also liked the fresh tortillas and the horchata and the limeade. We had shrimp fajitas and the combinacion plate (beef taco, tostada, enchilada, tamale, rice and salad). This is what I imagine your Mexican grandma in the U.S. might cook, but perhaps with a lot of extra cheese added. The food I tried was quite heavy and sent me into a bit of a food coma since I'm not used to eating this way, but overall it was mostly delicious. Even the fajitas had a lot of oil. I love salsa but I have had better. I like my Mexican food a bit lighter with more fresh ingredients highlighted. While I wouldn't be in a hurry to visit again and would rather check out other Mexican joints on my list, my guest from Minneapolis really enjoyed the experience.
