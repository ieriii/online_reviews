I just came home from there. Never been there before, a friend took me. We were sat quickly.....our food was brought in about 20 minutes, was good. I ordered a spinach, broccoli, rice and cheese burrito; which I know was weird, but enjoyed it. The mango frozen margarita was delicious. The tortilla chips kept coming like clockwork and the service was fine. Nothing too exciting, but nothing horrible. I would definitely go back.
