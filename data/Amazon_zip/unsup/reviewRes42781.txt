I was not as impressed with the pizza here as many of the reviewers were. It was alright - maybe my expectations were too high after reading through the reviews. The pizza flavors reminded me a lot of Connies - nothing new, but not bad. This place is decent, but when I order pizza, I definitely call someplace else.
