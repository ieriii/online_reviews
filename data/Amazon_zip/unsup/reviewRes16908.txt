A bachelorette group of 10 stopped by here on a Friday night and it was great. All except for two were outta towners, so it was a nice treat. Had I not been with someone who knew the place, I would have missed it. You barely notice the door! We waited for about 30 minutes, but it was worth it. We felt as if we were part of a secret society. Great atmosphere and service. Once seated, it was time to look at the menus. Very creative drinks! Also, very STRONG drinks. Rightfully soo...if I were taking sucha risk back then, I would expect nothing but a strong drink. If you're in the area visiting, try to stop by. Very cool experience.
