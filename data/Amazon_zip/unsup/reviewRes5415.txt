A pork lovers paradise!! I went with my best friend and her family for dinner. We were promptly greeted by a waiter who was delightful and attentive. We were told that everything on the menu is set up to be shared, kind of like Tapas. The prices range from 6.99 to 24.00. We tried the Lardo Crostini, Braised Baby Artichokes, Fingerling Potatoes, Asiago and Salami Toscana, and Sopressata. The Lardo Crostini melted in your mouth. We then decided to order Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers and Fried Egg, Pork Neck Bone Gravy with Calabro Ricotta, Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes, and Fried Smelt with Lemon Aioli Sardines with Lemon Vinaigrette. The Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers and Fried Egg was to die for. After the first bite, my best friend had a look in his eye that I have never seen before. The Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes was fork tender and so good I am pretty sure you would ask for it as your last meal if you were on death row. The mashed potatoes were average, ask your waiter for no mashed potatoes, substitute it for more pork shoulder. Definitely give The Purple Pig a try.
