Meh. That's my review, meh. If I were to base it solely on the food, I'd give it about a 2.5. This is a nice place--you can go "stylish casual" in jeans or dress up, and the restaurant has the fun feel of an event-type place, but the food didn't measure up. Maybe I'm biased as a 7th-generation Southerner, or maybe I'm biased because I lived in Texas for 13 years, but the food was just alright. I had the competition ribs, and all I wanna know is, who else is entering this competition?? I'm pretty sure I could outdo these with a Crock Pot or a propane grill, both of which are abominations to the true smoke-flavoring process of real barbecue. If this place has a 4-star average, either I ordered the wrong thing (but should the worst thing on the menu fall that short??) or, just what the heck have you ppl been eating to consider this very fine barbecue?? I think back to the best ribs I've ever had--those would be from Houston's, just fall off the bone tender and so flavorful you want to eat your sauce-covered fingers too. (Now, I don't wanna hear any crap from anyone about how "fall off the bone" means overcooked, because in my world, overcooked is tough and dry, and cooked just right means melt in your mouth.) The best barbecue in general I've ever had would go to a two-way tie between the wonderful Salt Lick in Driftwood, TX or the magically sauce-free, smoke-flavored Kreuz Market in Lockhart, TX. Both life-changing experiences. The sides were fine, but nothing memorable that would make me jump at the chance of coming back here. Service was fine. It did take quite a long time to get our check. I would want to raise this above a 2 to simply reward the nice atmosphere of the place, but Yelp says 2 stars = meh, and 3 stars = A-OK. Well, A-OK barbecue is a fail of epic proportions, since barbecue done right should basically raise the human experience to a higher plane.
