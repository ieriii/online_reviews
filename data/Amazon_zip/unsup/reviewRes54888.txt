I came here for my birthday dinner last month and had a great time. The food was amazing - my girlfriend and I shared the CB&J and Duck Reuben and were in heaven the whole meal. I also sniped some delicious mussels from my friend's plate. We sat near the entrance, where it gets very crowded and you have to order at the bar (it can be a bit inconvenient weaving through the crowds, especially after a couple of strong beers), but overall the scene and service seemed about on par with most bars.We definitely came for the beer though. Seriously, they have a selection worth getting excited about - I even slacked off a bit at work that day and devised an ordered list of beers to try during the evening. My embarrassing admission is that I didn't make it all the way through my list, but suffice it to say that any night where my lightest beer was 7% abv can be termed a resounding success.It's a bit out of the way for those of us not quite so far uptown, but I'll hopefully be making my way back sooner rather than later. A must for any fans of tasty beer and tasty food.
