Sultan's is consistently good food and fast. I get a spicy falafel sandwich with curry rice, super good. My only complaint is that sometimes I feel rushed...there is always a line that moves very quickly. If I didn't feel pressured to move the line i might pick out a drink or dessert...and this is every time I go
