I don't know if this is the best Korean bbq in Chicago, but it's pretty decent. However, like all Korean bbq, I've been here many times and it's pretty expensive and for the same taste and experience you can probably just marinate your own ribs and grill them in your backyard. Aside from their bbq--they have pretty good soup dishes. The soup base for the yuk gae jang and soon do boo is pretty tasty, always comes out piping hot, and I can't complain about the side dishes. It's a much bigger selection than most korean places. I take down a star only because I think it's kind of pricey and their smoke ventilation system is pretty horrible. When I came home, my contact was stuck to my eyeball (and I wear gas permeable) so that was a little irritating. Also, because of all the hype it's been getting, getting a table is really tedious. I recommend you call ahead for reservations (though it might only be allowed for large parties.)
