I really enjoy R.J. Grunt's. I've been coming here ever since I was really little, and it brings back good memories for me (a main reason I keep coming back). First of all, the atmosphere. It looks like it's in a 70s time warp, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Kitchy, if you will. I've always liked looking at the walls covered with framed photos of some of the original waitstaff. And the music is all oldies, which just happens to be my favorite genre. So major points there. On to the food. I usually get the temperature soup and the Gruntburger. Temperature soup for the sheer novelty of it (you pay the temperature of the lake, in cents, for a bowl of the soup du jour), and the Gruntburger for DELICIOUSNESS. It is by far the best bleu cheese burger I have eaten in the city of Chicago. The balance between dressing and actual cheese is perfect, and the onion strings complement the burger. I would eat this for lunch every day if I wasn't concerned that I would have a heart attack and die from it. Also, their burgers are served with cottage fries. I like them enough, but they're not the reason that I come here. I've had a few of the desserts, and they're all pretty good. Huge, so share them. Service. Eh. It varies a lot. I've had a few terrrrrrrible experiences here with waitstaff. However, it hasn't stopped me from coming back, so I guess that says something about how much I like it here. A final note: I have heard that their salad bar is really good. I just hate salad so I wouldn't know.
