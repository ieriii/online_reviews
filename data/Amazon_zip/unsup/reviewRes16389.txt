Seriously this place is GOOD! I'm not Indian, but i love Indian food soo much, my native cuisine gets jealous. Anyway i am in Chicago for business and I'm dining alone and so this makes me intently focused on the food and on the critic of the restaurant as there is no company to enjoy First off unlike many good ethnic indian restaurants there are no cheesy bolly wood videos, bright lights or very old school indian decorations (which are hard to relate to if you are a) not indian or b) born before 1900). Menu is very extensive, think cheese cake factory long times two but all Indian selections and all seemed ethnic and very yummy. It took me quite a bit of time to figure out what I wanted, the waiter here was very helpful and helped me narrow it down. And although I was dining alone as I mentioned above, unfortunately I ended ordering for more than one person. For starters - The waiter recommended I skip the typical samosas and get the Alo Chili Chat instead and he was spot on. It was honestly the best I've ever had... Including some at some very high end and much more expensive Indian places. For the main course ordered the Lamb Khana, Saffron Rice and Raita. The lamb was WOW so tender and flavorful had the consistency of an el dent pasta! The rice quality was excellent reminded me more of a good high end persian rice. Will be back next time I'm in town.... can't wait to try out more stuff...
