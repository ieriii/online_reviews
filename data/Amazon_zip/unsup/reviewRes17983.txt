I lived in Lincoln Square for 7 years and it wasn't until the last year that I finally stopped in to the Bad Apple. And now I'm kicking myself that it took me so long to discover this place. They have a great (large) beer selection, both on tap and bottles. The hardest decision for me is always what beer to get. The solution? I have multiple, that makes the decision making easier :) I'm not a meat eater but I've come here a few times now with burger loving friends & family and it always gets an enthusiastic two thumbs up on the burgers. I have the Strange Famous veggie burger and it is darn good. For sure one of the best veggie burgers I've had in Chicago, hands down. And oddly enough, Sage Francis, who is listed as a collaborate on the burger, is someone I met back when I lived in Minneapolis and was a regular in the underground hip hop scene there. So when I eat the burger, it brings back warm fuzzy memories and I feel 22 again!! Last but not least, they have CHEESE CURDS. All three of my siblings went to the UW Madison so there's a special place in my belly for cheese curds. I can recall many a time spent on State St eating curds & drinking beer. Again with the bringing back the warm fuzzy memories. Maybe that's why I love this place so much? Good food, great beer, and a trip down memory lane...thanks Bad Apple!
