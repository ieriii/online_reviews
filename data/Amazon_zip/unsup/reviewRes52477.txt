I love everything about Brazzaz because you can get good sushi AND juicy meats all in one meal. Genious. Come here on an empty stomach and you will leave with your jeans unbottoned.  I've always had excellent/friendly service here. If you go on a wednesday afternoon, the whole dining experience is half price.
