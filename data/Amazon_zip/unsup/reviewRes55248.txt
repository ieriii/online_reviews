I think this is the best churrascario in Chicago. I tried Brazzaz and Sal Carvao (which is closed at this point) and liked the meat at Fogo de Chao better. two negatives: 1) even if you have a reservation, you end up waiting upto half an hour 2) I don't eat pork and although I say that when I sit down they keep bringing pork.
