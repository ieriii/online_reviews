When you're on vacation do you go get food at a mall food court? Usually the answer is No, but this is different. After not realizing that XOCO was closed on Mondays I was still craving a Rick Bayless restaurant. Luckily we were with a local so she said well he has a Mexican restaurant inside of the Macy's Food Court. It was packed with business people, but the line moved fast. The food was really good. I had the tacos al Carbon it came with beef & served with roasted pepper rajas, two salsas, frijoles charros, guacamole & homemade tortillas. I was shocked I was getting solid Mexican Food in Chicago!
