One of the reasons why I heart Wicker Park. I had the most unique pancakes here. I was even lucky enough to sample 3 different ones on different plates (couldn't have the flavors coalescing together!) My favorite was the cheesecake, topped with a swirl of sweet cream cheese and raspberry. Second was sprinkled with pretzel bites and doused with warm white chocolate and dazzled with buttery caramel.  The Sunday wait was decent for brunch and the crowd is fairly young.  They have other great breakfast choices, but the pancakes quenched the craving.
