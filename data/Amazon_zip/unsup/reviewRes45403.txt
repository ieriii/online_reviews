Hurrah! A lovely pub on Broadway - much welcome addition to the neighborhood. The husband and I went Sunday afternoon for a late lunch and to watch the Bears game. Upon walking in, I immediately felt comfortable. I had some sort of cider on tap and Justin had a Guinness. Our server, Jackie, mentioned that they had the Guinness people come in and teach the bartenders how to correctly pour the drafts - and they pulled it off - great pour, perfect temp. We ordered two appetizers, the aforementioned fried potato thingies and very yummy artichoke dip. I'd give the potato things a 3 and the dip a 5/5. Yum - cheesy, gooey, artichokey dip and perfectly toasted slices of baguette (like actually toasted to be brown - what is it with people and soggy barely warmed through bread = toast???). We chilled for an hour or so and had a few more beers, watched the Bears turn it around and ended up ordering entrees. I had the fish and chips and Justin had the corned beef 'n cabbage. The fish was wonderful - great batter, not too doughy. The corned beef was incredible - just melt in your mouth awesome. Justin's was a bit luke warm when it arrived and after mentioning it to Jackie she zipped it back under the broiler and brought it out nice and piping hot.  Other highlights: The bathroom! The ladies room has FIVE stalls, FIVE! No bar has a ladies room with five stalls.  Plus, beautiful glass tiles, Kohler sinks, paper towels and one of those crazy Excelerator dryers. Beautiful! I'm reserving star 5 until I've had the weekend night experience. Absolutely cannot wait to go back!
