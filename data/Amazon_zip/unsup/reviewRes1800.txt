I feel like Yelp'ing Hot Dougs is like a right of passage for both Chicago and Yelp. What could be bad about a Sausage Superstore and Encased Meat Emporium. My rule with Hot Dougs is that you MUST try something you would not normally eat. You can get a Chicago Dog (as I did), but you BETTER couple that with something more interesting. How many places can you get a duck, rattlesnake, bison, boar, or whatever animal you are craving? I wont say anything new either, but here goes about my experience... I got there around 10:30am, not because I was scared of a wait, but I was awake and decided to go instead of going back to sleep. I am glad I went when I did - there were already like 75 people in line! At 10:30am! GO TO BED PEOPLE. I go the Chicago dog (I judge a place by their Chicago dog so I had to go simple for one) and I also got the duck sausage with orange marmalade and blue cheese. The Chicago dog was great! Grilled to perfection with everything you want. The duck sausage was tasty as well, although the blue cheese was quite strong. I wish it were toned down a little, but I know that is just means it was good cheese, which I respect. I wanted to try the duckfat fries but I was alone and couldnt bring myself to do it. I did try the regular fries and they were good! You got a ton so enough for sharing. Get there early, prepare for an experience, try something you wouldnt normally eat, and be willing to spend a little money and go all out. Hot Dougs was also featured on Anthony Bourdains "13 Places to Eat Before You Die" ..it was on a list with some VERY high-end restaurants. It was quite the honor. A few other points - -There is street parking (at least on weekends) -The menu online is very accurate and they update it everyday with the specials -Dont ask "what do you recommend" ...Apparently everything is good! -Very good customer service!
