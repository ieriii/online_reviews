I came here twice with Groupon deals. First time, my friend and I had no idea what to order so we asked our server for a messob plate of whatever she recommended. Our server brought out a good variety and it turned out well so we decided to do the same for our second visit. The different meats and vegetables come laid out on a huge plate along with some sourdough bread, which from observing the people eating by us, is torn by hand and used to scoop up the richly spiced stews. The sourness in the bread took a bit of getting used to though my vegetarian friends all love it. My favorite meats were the fish, beef, and lamb. I liked quite a few of the vegetarian items too but can't remember what they're called. Many of their items were too spicy for me but I did like the ones that I could eat. Other than that, wine good, desert good. I'm not a big fan of the sambussa appetizers because they were too spicy and too dry.
