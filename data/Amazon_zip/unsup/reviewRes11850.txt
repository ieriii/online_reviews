Love Love LOVE The Bongo Room! From the best breakfast in the city to one of the greatest cappuccinos I've ever had, the only thing disappointing about The Bongo Room is the wait. BUT - there are so many nice shops in the area I don't mind shopping while I wait! I love the fact that the menu changes seasonally and there's always something crave-able. If I could, I would eat here everyday!
