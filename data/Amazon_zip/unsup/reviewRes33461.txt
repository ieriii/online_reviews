Haven't been here in a minute, but I'm ready to venture here again (maybe today?) for lunch. My order, every time i go in: Falafel sandwich with Baba ganoush and tabulah instead of hummus and Jerusalem salad, spicy, with a side of lentil soup and coconut milk to drink. If i'm really hungry I'll get one of the baked pitas with egg on top. AHHH IM GOING HERE TODAY FOR LUNCH. but yah, service ain't great but its not supposed to be. its counter service and self-serve salad bar. Really what do you expect? The food speaks for itself. EAT EAT EAT.
