Four words to describe this place--MIDDLE OF THE ROAD. I have been to this place more than five times and have had more enjoyable experiences at taco bell. The first time my chicken was undercooked and gave me a tummy ache in the middle of the night. Brunch is decent, but again, nothing to write home about, much less in the NY Times. I am guessing it made it into that newspaper because the restaurant has rooms for rent and it's kitschy. It is definitely not worth the money. Have 4 meals at Cafe Con Leche, just around the corner on Milwaukee, instead. Also, is it just me, or is the service here weird? There are way too many people standing around watching you eat, refilling the funky tasting water; and the waiters just kind of lurk, awkwardly waiting for you to finish the conversation. A big turnoff for me. I would pass on this place, especially if you are from out of town.
