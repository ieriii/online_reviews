I've been to this restaurant many times, and have always left full and happy! Most recently I was there 2 nights ago with a party of about 10 people. We originally had a reservation for 6, but a couple more friends decided to join after they heard where we were eating. The staff was very friendly and accommodating, and had a table ready within 10 minutes despite it being a busy Friday night. The food was delicious. I am Ethiopian, and very particular about where I eat out so this says a lot. Everyone in our party enjoyed themselves, and loved the food (including a couple people eating Ethiopian food for the first time). They've got a great selection of imported Ethiopian beers and traditional Ethiopian honey wine. The portions are HUGE, we ordered the family style option so the price was very reasonable ($12.50 per person for dinner). At the end of the meal, the manager came over and chatted with us for a while. Apparently and episode of Check Please was just filmed there, I can't wait to see it! I'm always too full to try the desserts, but they look delicious. Demera, along with Ethiopian Diamond (farther north on Broadway), continue to be my favorite Ethiopian restaurants in Chicago!
