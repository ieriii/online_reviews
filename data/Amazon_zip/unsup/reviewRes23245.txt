Well now, this place is just a little gem. Having an adorable patio that is BYOB is always an easy way straight into my heart. I found the menu to be slightly overwhelming as everything looked good. I finally made up my mind and went with the veggie burrito. And boy am I glad that I did! This is unlike any burrito I've ever had. They take the veggie part of the name very seriously. It is stuffed to the max with veggies and isn't overpowered by rice and bean fillers. My friend tried a bite and said she couldn't even identify all of the flavors that are in it. I tried a bite of her cheese and spinach empanadas and thought I had tasted a little bit of heaven. Per our waiter's suggestion we finished off our meal with an oatmeal shake. When I first heard about this, I was just as grossed out by it as you probably are right now. Well, let me tell you...it is not gross at all. It is most definitely everything it is cracked up to be. Imagine an oatmeal cookie in milkshake form and then I think you'll get the picture. We got oatmeal banana which I would highly recommend. I definitely cannot wait to go back to Irazu and next time I will be more prepared for the fact that it is cash only!
