I will never go to the Bongo Room again. I have been there 3 times and the service is the worst I have ever had. It is bad enough that you order a side of hash browns with your breakfast and they get to you once you are finished with everything else ... I am the type of person that if I order something extra and they forget about it I don't mention it unless I get charged for it... Another time I waited with then girlfriend for 20-30 min for a table and they seated someone who just walked in the door leaving the two of us standing there still waiting... good food but not good enough for me to deal with the awful service.
