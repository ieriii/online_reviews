I've been here twice in the last month. The steaks are amazing. I'm actually allergic to seafood so that eliminates about 90% of the menu for me. I have, however, tried just about everything else at Mastro's. Filet is great. Bone-in filet is even better and well worth the $3 extra! Garlic mashed potatoes are sublime. Shoestring potatoes were excellent too. The onion rings were good but honestly just way too big. They'd be too big for Paul Bunyan. All the vegetables were just ok: spinach/broccoli/asparagus. French onion soup is really good. And all the desserts are great. You honestly can't go wrong in that department. Wine list is solid and they have a full bar too. Piano man always playing on weekend nights in the actual bar as well. They have TVs in the bar with sports on that matters to you. We've always had great service here. Rory was an awesome waiter the last time we went. I know this place gets knocked for being really expensive, but $40 for the large 12 ounce filet is really not that bad. Especially given the neighborhood, I don't know what people expect. That being said the caviar is $275/ounce haha. I'll definitely be going back to Mastro's in the very near future!
