Ok, so I tried really hard and I think this is la pasadita I go to (the most North on Ashland). Yes, there are three.... the one below this one is good for drunk groups/Americanized mexican food. This location, just north, has a few items, no table service, and is always awesome. As far as I can tell, the one across the street microwaves the food from this one.. I don't know, but that's what they tell me--I've never actually been to that one. This one--assuming it is the most nothernly one... is the best. They don't have as many options as the one next door, but the workers don't seem as jaded, it doesn't take as long, and they had a few arcade games in back. I once got the chile rellno nightly (cheese-stuffed pepper, deep fried, in a tortilla) but they were killing me... so much grease.. so good. They are super nice... and I think that is my favorite part.
