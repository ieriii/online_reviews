My family and I have been going here since I was 10 to pick up roasted duck and bbq pork but we never actually dine in. Then Michael J. and his family introduce me to the Dinner special. The Peking Duck dinner. You have to love duck to enjoy this meal and it is nothing I have experience anywhere in the US or in Asia( Hong Kong, Bkk, Taipai). For about $30 for about 3 people, you get a whole duck prepped in 3 ways. You starts with a little presentation of your whole crisp duck and the server is slicing the duck in perfect pieces. It's crispy and juicy. You don't get the boring mooshu's crepe instead you get the bow buns to hold your crispy duck, green onion,pickle radish, and hoisin sauce.  Best part of your meal and I love the bun so much I usually order more buns. Then they take the remaining duck back and now your duck becomes duck soup and duck fried rice. I recommend order a veggie on the side and the dinner includes 2 ice cream scoops at the end of your meal. I recommend calling ahead to make sure that they hold a duck for you since it is getting really popular since they moved to the new location.
