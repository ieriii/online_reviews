This place is so cute. I love the neon, the 50's vibe, the limited menu. It reminds me of this place I used to go to in Indiana, but I digress. The food was decent. I had a Supercheesy with only relish and ketchup (yes I put ketchup on my burger). Wierd that they dislike ketchup, but whatev. Husband had the Superdawg and he liked it tons. He had everything on it: mustard, hot peppers, sweet peppers, pickle, relish, etc. and enjoyed it and was very full after. I LOVED the Superfries. They are freshly made and they are CRINKLE CUT. One star had to go for the lack of cheese sauce for these tasty fries! My chocolate malt was also yummy. I'll be back with my family - they will feel like they are home.
