If I gave this place 2 stars, it would indicate that I'd try it again, and I wouldn't. This is easily the worst Thai food I've had in Chicago, and that's saying a lot because there are a lot of Thai places in Chicago and I've been to many of them. We went on a Monday in the middle of a rainstorm and were probably the only ones in the dining room, which looked nice but was uncomfortable since their wall length booth was broken and slanted. Overall I was really really dissapointed since I had heard "best Thai food at Opart" over and over again. The shu-mai appetizer could have come out of a Costco box, my spicy entree tasted spicy, and that's about it. Just chili, no other spices or flavors, and the beef, green beans and onions could have been presented better. His noodle dish tasted awful in a too sweet gravy that was so oily and unappetizing. The waitress/hostess didn't smile once and was sorting silverware at the counter just feet away from our table and apparently had no awareness or care to stop making such a ruckus. She was also oblivious to other details. For example, I asked for hot water and lemon: 1. She brought the hot water in a water glass, and not a mug. Too hot to hold. 2. She brought a lime, because they didn't have lemon. Really? Thai cravers, go to Roseded Thai on Leland across the street, that place is awesome.
