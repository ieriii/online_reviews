My first time in Chicago and my friend recommended this restaurant to me (Because you can't come to Chicago without getting hot dogs, right???). It was an awesome experience. I'm not really a hot dog person, but these were GOOOOOD. I got duck fat fries, 'The Dog' (normal Chicago dog w/all the toppings), and the cognac-infused lamb hot dog. Duck fat fries were fucking AMAZING. They were very crispy, which I LOVE. Their taste was very rich but I couldn't tell any duck taste or anything, haha. They were a bit pricy but so worth it. 'The dog' was good---I love their buns, so soft and delicious. It was okay, but I don't like pickles so that probably negatively influenced my appreciation of the hot dog. The lamb dog was AMAZING. It was slightly sweet, but had a very sharp/salty sort of cheese and the lamb was delicious. Everything balanced out perfectly. We came on a Friday (hence the duck fat fries were available) in the afternoon at about 2:45 or so, and we were in by a little past 3. The wait wasn't bad at all, especially after we got out of the cold and into the warm restaurant. The atmosphere of the restaurant is great, everyone here was super nice and we made lots of friends in line that we ended up sitting with to eat! (: It is cash only, which we didn't know (luckily we had plenty of cash on us). I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this place, it's delicious. I'll for sure come back here if I'm in Chicago again.
