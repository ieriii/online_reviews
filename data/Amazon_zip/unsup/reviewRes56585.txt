I've been to Chicago Mastros twice now and both times were absolutely outstanding. My husband and I travel quite frequently to Mastro's in CA and boy let me say, they have got it together here in Chicago. Impeccable service on all levels and food is out of this world. Lobster potatoes, sizzling steaks, and dry ice martinis! What more could a girl ask for? Oh, and the best part, they have a live piano bar!! Michael at the front door is nothing short of FABULOUS, he made a point to stop and chat with us on our way out and actually talked us into going to the lounge after dinner for another cocktail. Haha. This guy knows how to sell. Everyone that works here is so friendly and willing to go that extra mile. We will definitely be back. Welcome to Chicago, Mastros!
