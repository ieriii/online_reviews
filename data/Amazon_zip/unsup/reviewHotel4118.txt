This place is horrible. Over priced and overrated! I paid too much for the room. Expected. But then I got hit with a $50 parking fee. Then $15 for internet. Ordered some fries and a drink and it took an hour and cost a ridiculous $40. No robes, and overpriced drinks at the bar. If you're independently wealthy and looking to blow your money on a less than average hotel...this is the place to do it!
