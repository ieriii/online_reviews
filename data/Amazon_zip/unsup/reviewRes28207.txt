HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!! I only gave it 1 star cuz you have to in order to write a review..the service is horrible i called in an order and faxed in the order that was typed out thinking they cant possibly mess up the order....I WAS WRONG... I got things I didnt even order!! when I went to pick up the order the food was on plastic plates wrapped up with foil...they didnt even pack it in to go plates...all the food was smashed and messy due to their fancy to packing foil & a plstic plate. 22 of the taco dinners and combination plates didnt eve come with rice and beans. When I called back to talk to a manager he wasnt there and the girl who picked up hung up on me. so I continued to call and they would pick up and hang up. when I finally called from a different number they picked up it took 45 MINUTES to talk to someone she was extremely rude..I asked for the managers info and she wouldnt give it to me. I asked her how could my order get so messed up if I faxed over a typed out version of the order and to top it off a girl called back when they received the fax and "confirmed" my order. this place is WAY OVER RATED. never again will I or my work order from here again!!!
