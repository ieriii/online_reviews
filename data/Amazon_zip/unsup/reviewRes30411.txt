Place is LOUD, like evil olive club loud. My lord, I was screaming the whole night. Service was slow, it took them 15 minutes to bring me a makers neat? there is no ice cubes or anything, just pour the alcohol & bring it to me. Ugghhh. Anyways I got: Crispy Brussel sprouts - tasty a lil too sweet tho. Duck hash - weird pretty good I guess, the duck is tasty , but the egg and cabbage made it weird, I I'm not sure how I feel about this, actually. Cannot tell if its a hit or a miss. The egg made it seem cheap. Pork potstickers - gross, hella bitter & horse radish Garlic noodles - good, nothing to write home about. Oh no you didn't -Ultimate handroll - the deep fried thing made the whole roll taste like a bag of doritos. The outside of the roll was not seaweed but a weird white seasame flecked thing which I did not like. This was a total miss for me. Wack. Ahi crab cake - not a crab cake at all, pieces of sushi with somethin of a seared cake thing on top. Strongest dish for me. Very tasty. Flounder and tuna sashimi - fresh and delish. Wish I just got a bunch of this. Lime on gin & tonic was bright yellow. All of the menu items were extremely expensive and small dishes. This is not a place I plan on returning to. But they have a free coat check. But the 11.99 valet throws that off, 11.99? Just say 12! you're not fooling anybody.
