My significant other and I had a staycation this month and really enjoyed ourselves. Just one night away from the stressors of life with a comfy bed and a down comforter that I don't have to wash. Floor to ceiling windows overlooking the night city skyline, so gorg. Even my boyfriend approved of mini-bar purchases, he was having such a relaxing time. One complaint, they don't have HBO, so we settled on Showtime since the MMA fights were on and boyfriend loves that. Shower was amazing, staff was very friendly and helpful. I would recommend to anyone who is staying in the city for a weekend. You'll enjoy the trendy atmosphere which isn't snobbish.
