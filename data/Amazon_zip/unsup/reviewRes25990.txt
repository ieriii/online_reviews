This is by far the best tapas place in the city. Their plates are absolutely delicious! The flavors are so bold and the food just melts in your mouth! I'm not a fan of tater tots but they have a tater tot dish with a glaze of spicy sauce on top and it is to die for! The service here is superb and the staff is super friendly and always give you great wine recommendations. Its hard to get a reservation here so I would advise to set up a reservation a few days ahead of time.
