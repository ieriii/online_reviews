mmmmmmmmmmm so deliciious. fun place w/a fun vibe. food was great as well! i got the vaca frita (braised beef slow roasted in grilled onions and pan fried, served with black beans, white rice, and maduros). really filling and delicious. esp the maduros!  *bring your own bottle of red and they will mix it into sangria for you! how awesome is that?!
