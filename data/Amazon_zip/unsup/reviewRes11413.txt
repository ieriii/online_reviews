Totally phenomenal. The French toast was an explosion of sweet flavors that complimented each other pefectly. I also had the potatoes which were done just how I like them (chunky and crispy, with soft insides), and the chicken sausage which was icing on the cake of my breakfast. Add a bottomless cup of coffee and you've got my favorite place for breakfast. I wouldn't eat here everyday (it is pricey, although worth it) and gets prohibitively busy on the weekends. Check it out during the week and be amazed like I was.
