Let me start by saying I am an expert when it comes to good Mexican food. This place has it all- great food, variety, friendly staff & amazing margaritas! Mayan is the real deal. Complimentary salsa is great, good guacamole & the good is consistent. I recommend the steak quesadilla & Jamaican Flower margarita. If you want some good authentic Mexican food, you have to try this place.
