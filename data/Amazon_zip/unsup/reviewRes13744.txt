We were in the area and thought we'd stop by to pick up some food. The restaurant has its own private parking lot which helped us because the traffic during after work rush hour was crazy. The restaurant itself is super cute from the outside. The artwork is clever and fun to look at. The inside was a lot smaller than I had expected. It is only counter window seating and can sit about 5-6 people max. The rest is standing room only. I placed an order of the ropa vieja dinner to go. It came with white rice, beans, maduro (ripe plantains) and super tender and wonderfully flavored shredded beef in creole sauce. I highly recommend it! One of the best ropa vieja's I've tasted (next to the one's I've had in Florida where many Cubans are). I also got an order of the bread pudding. It came with a cream dressing on the side (which I was not a fan of) but the bread pudding was super good! Service was great and really friendly. Prices were reasonable at about $12 for the dinner. They offer the ropa vieja on a sandwich as well for about $7. So glad we were in the neighborhood to try this place!
