Went here with some friends last night and it was OK. I would not rush back by any means. I am also confused why it is listed as an "Irish pub?" Anywho....the service was great. Very attentive and friendly and gave good recommendations on the menu. We started with the scotch eggs and the fondu. Good, but not anything spectacular. I had the Rib-eye and it was actually really fatty, but very good topped with the bleu cheese. The potatoes were just ok. One of my friends had the burger, one had the chicken, one had the duck and one had another fish dish. Everyone thought the same...."good. Not great." Overall, that was just it...good, not great and if you want to get some pub food, I would recommend somewhere else. Overpriced for what you get.
