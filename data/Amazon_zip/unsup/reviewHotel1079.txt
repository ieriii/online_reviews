I went here for an annual work function because I'm a winner, and Fairmont in Chicago did NOT disappoint! The entrance is beautiful, lush and modern. The staff is friendly, not above-and-beyond greatness but "good". There is a nice little wine bar in the middle of the entrance and it's a great place to park yourself and people watch. My room was beautiful, clean and modern. Had all the regular amenities with wifi and flatscreen tv.  There is a nice spa in the hotel where I got a Swedish massage by a nice Russian lady. Kinda expensive, but that is pretty typical of a 4 star hotel. They also had a nice women's area with a sitting area, steam room, showers and lockers. My favorite part was hanging out at the Sushi restaurant (don't remember the name) with the bartender who reminded me of Balki from Perfect Strangers. I stopped to ask him if there were any cool lounges to hang out at nearby and he gave me a couple of tips but we ended up hanging out at the hotel anyway. I had a glass of Riesling and he let me taste a few other new liquor items (Creme Yvette!! yum!) while we chatted.  All in all we had a great stay and I would definitely recommend this hotel.
