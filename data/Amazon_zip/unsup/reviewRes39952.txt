First time i had been here good experience its alot to learn from fresh and reasonably priced if you like fondue its kinda like that but just Korean and bbq.. plus my favorite part its open till 5am thats the best part. Kind of a drive for me since I live on the south side but good food and fun just don't go there smashed becuase you will burn yourself with the hibachi grill..haha (lesson learned )
