I have nothing but good things to say about Davanti Enoteca. This place is casual, comfortable, pretty tasty, and seems to have the market on excellent employees. Everyone was incredibly nice. I stopped in to Davanti Enoteca on a Friday night. I decided to stop in for a slightly later dinner (9:00) because they don't take reservations and I turn into a 6-year old when I have to wait in lines. I did have to wait--they said it would be 45 minutes--but I think we were seated in 10. There isn't a lot of room at the front of the restaurant to stand around, so I'm glad it didn't take too long. We had already polished off a bottle of wine at the last place, so we were pretty hungry and ready to go. Everything looked good and I just kept ordering, so we had some cheeses (bland and definitely the low point of the meal), the beet salad (very good), pizza (good), octopus (excellent), and the steak (good). True to the other reviews, the wine selection was affordable. Service, from the hostess to the bar to the waiter, was consistently great. And the atmosphere was definitely upbeat and fun. This place is worth the visit.
