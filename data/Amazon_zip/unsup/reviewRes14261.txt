No. NO. NO AND NO! HORRIBLE HORRIBLE Staff. I mean inexcusable. You guys are not the only place with unique cuisine or craft beer. I did not enjoy this place at all. Spacious but man was it full of douchery. Logan square is just the wrigleyville for thrift stores. I wont be back and will not recommend this place to anyone.
