"I wish it was socially appropriate for me to lick my plate in public," were my exact words to my husband during our meal here.  We were able to get a last minute (30 minutes ahead of time) reservation on open table. I ordered the lobster ravioli and my husband got the ribs. He was in heaven and so was I. If our server would have been a little more spot on, I would easily have given this restaurant 5 stars. I had to ask the busboy for some sweetener for my coffee because our server went MIA. Overall, a great meal. We will be back!
