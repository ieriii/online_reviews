Here is a prime example of how hype and hysteria, prime visibility, novelty signage and clever packaging make this mediocre drive up glorified hot dog stand a booming success. This clever theme concept provides a good cover for the disappointing food sold here at prices, that in my eyes, are way out of line for nothing special.  It's just a steamed, skinny Oscar Meyer hot dog in a UPS style fancy box. People wake up....the food here is nothing to write home about to mother! It's all hype!
