The one thing that I think really stands out about Sapori is their Family Style Mondays. You choose different options for 4 different courses and it's only $19.95 per person. The amount of food for the money is incredible. The food itself was okay. It wasn't too bad, but nothing spectacular either. The things I really enjoyed were a butternut squash soup and Gnocchi. Everyone at our table also enjoyed the calamari which was grilled. The tiramisu was also really good. The service was also okay. Our server seemed to just sort of leave us alone after taking our order, which made me sad when I needed more drinks, but she was really nice every time she came around. I'd definitely recommend going here if you have a big group of people that want to eat on a budget.
