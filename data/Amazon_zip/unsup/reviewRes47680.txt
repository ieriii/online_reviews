Okay Friday afterwork I had a 5:15 reservation for the dining area but once I go tthere and the rain had subsided we decided to go to the roof....the waitresses were attempting to dry off the seating and we were one of the first up there so we got prime seating. The view was lovely the fondue was delicious, okay the sirloin was the highlight. I did find it strange that they gave us a tealight candle for the cheese fondue but never lit it up so I did it for myself..... :( (neg. 1 star) Our waitress was slow as hell, I mean as I stated we were one of the first on the roof and given it may have been a couple of early birds at the rooftop bar area the bartender was there assisting them and it took literally (cause I did watch the clock) 18 minutes for the waitress to get our fondue order in then come back for drink orders, once those were in we didn't see anyone for a good 23 minutes afterwords. (neg. 1 star) Service is slow, food whenever you get it is great, drinks - I suggest you order atleast two at a time but the view/seating area is marvelous. There was a long line to get to the roof on my way out but they were still letting people in although it was packed on the roof (???) at 11:00 when we left.
