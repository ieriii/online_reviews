Very nice room, stayed here for a wedding I was in. The staff did a great job putting on the wedding itself, and our room, while nothing remarkable, was clean and had enough space. The only real issue we had was with the parking. Maybe we were just spaced out that day, but it took us about three passes before we figured out the right place to turn in to park. The entrance seemed easy to miss. Then, to add to the annoyance, while we were going up the driveway the employee at the front entrance waved our car over to stop. Then he told us that we couldn't park there, and that we should keep driving...in the direction we had been driving before he had waved us over to stop. It was a remarkably confusing experience.
