I have been here 3 times now and all 3 times it was a wonderful experience. First time was 6 years ago and the experience remain the same. An out of town friend came for a visit and I figure I will let him enjoy all the meat he could consume before he go on a strict diet for navy training. I made a reservation for 3 but arrived at Fogo learning that they do not have my name on their book. The hostess asked us to take a seat and she will get us seated. We waited about 5minute before we got seated. Therefore, they earn back the star they just lost from me. (the place was packed on Saturday evening) I think the staffs at Fogo de Chao is really the main reason that make this restaurant so enjoyable. They were so friendly with us and taking their time talking to us even though they were obviously busy due to the red/green card game. All the side dishes kept getting replaced upon us finishing them and our soft drinks were constantly checked for refill. (They have a coin type card with green color on one side while red on the other. If the green side was up, then the staffs will constantly bring meat to your table. Red side mean - leave me alone I'm choking on meat) I really liked their beef rib - tender and juicy. I didn't like the chicken or the sausage as much. The seasoning was a bit off for my taste. A veggie eater would still be able to come here and enjoy the dining experience since this place offer a very nice salad bar. The bill for 3 end up almost $200. 3 soft drinks 1 cocktail No dessert
