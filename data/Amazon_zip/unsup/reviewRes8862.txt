I was smitten with this place when the first opened a few years ago, and went there several times in the first year or so. I hadn't been back in a while, since we are spoiled with so many good restaurants in Chicago. Anyway - I went late on a Saturday evening last month. We were seated right away, and the service was good. The salad we got was great, and the softshell crab appetizer special looked kind of gross, but was in fact delicious. However, the pizza this time was really disappointing. I am a sucker for the word "truffle" so we got the Bianco Nero, or whatever it's called. While I could sort of taste tht truffle oil, the assorted mushrooms were flavorless and SLIMY. My date and I both love mushrooms, and were so disappointed. They were really so bad we even ended up picking them off. The crust was still pretty good, but the flavorless pizza is sadly probably enough to keep me from going back for a while.
