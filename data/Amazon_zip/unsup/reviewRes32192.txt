Ate here tonight...it was nice and warm in temperature and in spice and really warmed me up on a coooold evening!! I agree with John H., if you like Ethiopian food, you will love this food. If not, then you might want to go somewhere else...that is all they have here! :-) The service was a little off, but I consider that part of the learning curve with a new restaurant. The decor is great with sculptures and art on the walls. Being set on the corner of Broadway and Lawrence there was some good people watching out the window too. They only have three chicken dishes and the platters were kind of hard to find on the menu. We did and I was more than satisfied. I had the platter that came with two vegetarian choices and two meat choices. The meat choices included all but one fish option too, which was really good. I had the split red lentils, ground chick peas, Yasa Wat, and Ye-Doro Tibs. Everything was very delicious and was spicy. The chicken was cooked perfectly retaining juices and tasted really fresh. The tilapia was also cooked nicely too. I love Ethiopian and I will definitely go back to eat here again. We had so much food that my friend Susan has lunch for tomorrow.  The platter of four options was only $15 and well worth it. I will definitely remember that they have a lunch buffet here!
