I hate to say this but this place is over rated. Be sure to order a glass of wine or beer to wash down the salt! Salt roasted beets - nothing special. You get a bowl of beets and a glob of goat cheese. Why is it $6? Roasted bone marrow spread - Probably the most interesting dish. The bone marrow spread didn't have much flavor. Most interesting thing about it was the texture. Pig's ear - Way too salty. Wasn't crunchy and you end up with an oil film in your mouth. Milk braised pork shoulder - pork was very tender but once again... way too salty. Pork sweetbreads - They're pretty much pork "chicken" nuggets with way too much breading. But the peach sauce complimented the nuggets very well. Pork blade steak with 'nduja' & honey - Probably the only dish that didn't leave me wanting to chug a glass of wine/water after every bite. The pork is very tender and well seasoned. My company found the 'nduja' to be the most interesting part of the dish. We were trying to guess what it was until we noticed a piece of paper above us explaining some terms on the menu. You'll have to go yourself to find out what 'nduja' is :) It's definitely worth trying and an experience. I have a feeling you either love it or hate it. I'm sure after reading my review...you know which side I'm on.
