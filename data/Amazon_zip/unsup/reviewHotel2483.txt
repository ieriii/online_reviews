I love this historic hotel! The location on Michigan Avenue acroos from Grant Park and over-looking the lake just can't be beat! I stayed in a 19th floor corner suite that had lake views. The rooms were standard Hilton-above average quality and cleanliness. The lobby bar was nice for evening cocktails. I liked seating at a table in the window overlooking the Michigan Avenue traffic. However, be prepared to pay around $12.00 per cocktail. The only thing I would change would be the size and quality of the executive floor amenities. The club lounge was tiny and there was always a line for beverages or snacks. But-let me say, the executive level staff was fantastic! They helped me arrange a dinner meeting at a local restaurant. I can't wait to come back to Chicago and stay at this hotel again.
