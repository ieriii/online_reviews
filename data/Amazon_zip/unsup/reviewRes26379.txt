This place was great. It is somewhere to go for dinner when you are looking for an assortment. Four of us went there for the prix fixe menu. It was amazing. We let the chef determine what we would most appreciate. Two of us selected the wine pairings which were great. The only drawback experience was that my friend (newly pregnant) wanted to ensure that all meat was well cooked (well done), all seafood was kept to a minimum, and that all potentially unpasteurized cheese was removed and/or not present. I love my friend...I wanted her to be comfortable with our dinner. The desserts were somewhat disappointing. Perhaps plan another destination for dessert. Overall, this was a wonderful dining experience.
