My brother-in-law's girlfriend has always wanted to try this place and we asked her to pick the restaurant so we ended up at this really swanky place. The decor is nice, the ambience is nice, and we got a really private table in the back of the restaurant to catch up. Our waiter was very nice, although he spoke so softly that sometimes the other end of the table couldn't hear him (like when he was describing the specials). They were very attentive. My sister had several of their sashimi and sushi rolls with an appetizer of miso soup. She really enoyed the toro and smoked salmon, but felt the firecracker was hotter than she would have liked. She liked the miso soup but made me eat the larger pieces of seaweed. My brother-in-law ordered shrimp & crispy rice which looked good (I didn't taste any) and the BBQ pork. My husband said it was okay after trying a bite. My brother-in-law's girlfriend had the duck which she said was spicier than she had expected. My husband had the filet mignon which was very smokey. My dish was really good: seabass. The fish was perfectly cooked and light without being fishy. Overall, it was a great experience. The downside would be that the menu was more limited than we would have guessed. Also, the food is pricey... if you don't watch out, you'll spend a fortune.
