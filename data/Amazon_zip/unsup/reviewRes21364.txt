If not for the waiting in line this would have been five stars. My wife and I each had one of their tortas. I had the Ahogada and the wife got the Choriqueso. My torta was amazing. The carnita was terrific and the spicy soup is sat in was out of this world. For dessert we got the churros which was a great ending to an amazing lunch. Would love to go back just during a time that I do not have to stand in line for 45 minutes.
