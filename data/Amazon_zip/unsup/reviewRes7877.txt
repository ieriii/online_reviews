We stopped by here for a late lunch because we were in the neighborhood and the place was recommended. We ordered 2 pizzas which were fine. There was nothing wrong with them but I have zero desire to revisit them. What left a bad taste in my mouth was the service. We were one of a handful of patrons in the place and seated in the back room alone except for a table directly next to us with an infant in a height chair... It almost felt spiteful. Our table service was unbelievably slow and delegated between four different members of the restaurant staff. To cap what was a non-enjoyable dinning experience was waiter #4 asking what we wanted for dessert; "I'll tell you what I told the 3 previous waiters that asked, I just want my check so I can leave". The owner told us to have a nice day as we departed. I desperately wish he asked us how our meal was so I could have personally told him my experience rather than post it publically. I'm quite generous with my good reviews but this was definitely a sore spot in my chicago dining experience. There are plenty of great brick oven pizzerias around, this is not one of them. (I have added a full star to my review for them having the same ceiling fan I have in my dining room, check it out, its a pretty sweet fan)
