It's refreshing to visit a night spot that is not a pub or an LP-poseur joint. Everything is old school, from an era when Chicago was still a meatpacking, industrial and gritty city. Manageable crowds even at peak times, though you'll be standing.  Generally populated by a respectful audience that tends to hush during an ongoing set....so mind your manners and shut off that phone!  +5 atmosphere, ambiance, jazz-appreciative crowd, reasonable prices/cover -2 I always hear well-played music, but never music that matches my mood
