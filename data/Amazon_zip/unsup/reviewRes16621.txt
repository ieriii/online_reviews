And now for some haikus: The India House, Okra so good and spicy, Please pass the water.  Tandoori veggies, Chicken tikka, and naan bread, My meal is complete. Channa masala I recommend you try it. Lentils? Not so much.  I hate C.E.O. the delivery service; Carry out instead. Eating Indian after I have gotten high, tastes even better.
