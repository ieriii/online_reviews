Had read a book about celebrity chefs and Grant was one of the chefs they focused on. It is amazing, young dude can be so clever. Unfortunately, he was not there the night we visited which was May 4th my dad and L's son's birthday. My dad was bragging how his new wife fiance was taking him there. I am thinking to myself, sure surprise see you in two days. My dad almost cried when he saw I was there before him. So, it ended up being $2600 for 6 people. My dads fiance at the time wanted me to pay for the bill. I have never paid for my dads dinner as he is wealthy, I am not. So, I had my dads company card since I work for him. We tried to count how many courses we were at as we did the 24 courses. We lost track at 18. For me, it was nerve wracking not being that bright trying to figure out how to put things together. Think of it as a scientific food experiment. Is it as good as French Laundry? Yes, the waitstaff is super knowledgeable at Fl, which makes the service slightly better if you get a laugh out of the formalness as L and I do. We were there until 230 but not the last table. Grant was not there because, he was getting a James Beard award. The kichen is spotless. The wine list is not as priced as nigh as French Laundry.  It was a memorable night to be at the #7 restaurant in the world. Well, worth it. Funny to me, how those in Chicago may not even know of Alinea.
