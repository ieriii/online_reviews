I've had a handful of brazilian steak houses in the city and this was takes the cake overall. The term "salad bar" doesn't do it justice...they have a seemingly endless array of meats, cheese, pasta salads, and even seared ahi tuna and sushi. Was especially surprised at the tabouleh - phenomenal! (really? at a brazilian steakhouse??) The service was commendable yet at times overwhelming (8 servers slamming skewers of meat on the table in rapid succession - I almost felt bad saying no even though I was full). Manager even came around and talked to us in detail about our desserts. It's pricey but that's to be expected given its touristy location. Still, I left the place more than satisfied. It's challenging not to overeat at a place like this :)
