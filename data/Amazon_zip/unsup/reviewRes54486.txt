The thing is, I want to love The Chicago Diner, every time I go I look at the menu and am so excited at all the choices I have to choose from. Then I order something and it's usually lacking flavor! Maybe I'd be able to give this place 5 stars if I didn't know how to cook most of the stuff on their menu, BUT I make wayyyyyy tastier dishes than they do. Being a Vegetarian/Vegan does not mean that your dishes need to be flavorless!! Is it because the cooks in the kitchen aren't Vegetarians? Do they just not care that the food lacks flavor?? I know that Jo is an amazing Chef but I'm starting to think she has no part in the restaurant anymore. It seems as though there is no quality control.To sum it up: The Chicago Diner is really a hit or miss. I've had some pretty good dishes there, but I've also had some really bad (waste of money) experiences. Do I think that every Vegetarian should try this place at least once in their life? Yes, because maybe the day you're there the food is awesome.
