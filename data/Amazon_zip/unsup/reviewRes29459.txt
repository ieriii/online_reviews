This is one of my all time favorite restaurants in Chicago. I was a vegetarian for close to 10 years and even living in Chicago found that it was at times difficult to find vegetarian friendly restaurants. Needless to say, I was really happy when I found the Chicago Diner, being that their entire menu is vegetarian!!!! They also have delicious organic vodka lemonades served nice and strong and in a tall glass perfect ! I love to sit out in their beautiful garden patio in back when it is warm out and sip a couple of them. This is not a place to miss; the service is very good always friendly and knowledgeable of the menu. And even if you are not a vegetarian you will be pleasantly surprised by how great the food is~ I have brought many of my "meat and potato" guy friends here and they were blown away by how flavorful and delicious the food is my favorites are the gyros with sweet potato fries and the enchiladas
