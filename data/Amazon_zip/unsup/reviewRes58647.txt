I have been to the Third Coast at least 20 times over the last 10 years (I live in Seattle) and have always had consistently good food at unbelievable prices. They have vegan choices and great flavor. The drinks are good and coffee is great and if you like spice the cajun chicken penne will light you up. I agree with the New York Post - The Third Coast is as Chicago as Wrigley Field, and if you are coming to visit Chicago you need to pay the Third Coast a visit.
