Oh yes, bang the drums, including bongos for this appetizing spot. We came here on a Friday because I love brunch but I hate lines. I was so happy we were able to avoid the crush and wait of the weekends; I think it diminishes the experience. We walked right in and sat right down. (Yes, I am channeling the folk song, sorry I am a child of the '60s.) I ordered the best meal of all my companions, don't tell them, but I did. Heck, I am practically a professional eater so it makes sense. I had the Tomatillo Salsa Egg white, chicken, spinach, chicken scrambler. I had the salsa on the side and the whole thing was scrumptious in spite of the fact that it sounds really healthy. My only slight surprise was the English muffin - pretty supermarket quality which was not what I expected at this cool of a place.  Was I done having made a sanely good for me Savory choice. Have you just met me? Of course we were not done, we had to have dessert! Come on, get with it! We then shared the Red Velvet Chocolate Cocoa pancakes with creamy cheese sauce with pecans. It took three of us and we couldn't finish it. Right now, I wish I had taken that last delicious morsel home with me! Great coffee and juice, good service and comfortable table all added up to one great Adventure Friday, 2012 Brunch edition.
