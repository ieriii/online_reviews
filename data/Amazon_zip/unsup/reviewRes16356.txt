Yeahhhhhhh.. it's worth the hype. wait: 15~20 minutes price: $12 for cocktails atmosphere/ambiance/decor: chic, spacious, dark...super dark, romantic, and fancy pants. T'was perfect for a girl's night out. We were seated in a booth and we all passed on the food (though next time I think I'll need to munch on something cause the drinks were strong..or I could just walk over to Big Star.. haha). I got the etiquette, which was surprisingly strong for a sparkling wine? My girls got the pimms cup and the hush and wonder. We all agreed that the pimms cup was the yummiest :) I'll-be-bock !
