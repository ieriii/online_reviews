I dined in and it was excellent! The server was really nice, and very attentive to the two kids I was with (who asked for about a million things :) The food is FAST. We ordered an appetizer, and it was out in minutes. I honestly don't even know how they cooked it that fast. Pasta was the same. The little ones I was with - one of them got the macaroni and cheese... It's good. It has broccoli in it and it's not your typical mac and cheese. The other one got some seafood pasta that was on special for the day. She loved it. I ordered the Gnocchi with the Rosemary Gorgonzola sauce - excellent! Waitress recommended the suace and I am glad she did because I probably wouldn't have chosen it otherwise. It was really good. Everything was good, service was great. Food is very reasonably priced and we were in and out of there pretty quick. It has a nice feel to it too, just a hip little pasta place. I'm a big fan.
