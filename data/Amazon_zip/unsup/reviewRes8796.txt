I rate this place as the best Neapolitan pizza in Chicago. The only drawback is this place is LOUD. It's like they stuck 25 tables inside a steel box. Hang some rugs on the walls, redo the ceiling, SOMETHING. Go here early and try to grab a spot outside in the summer. It's worth the noise though. Not impressed with the other options at this place, but if pizza is what you want, you won't be disappointed.
