This place is AWESOME. I've only been here once but I'm already a huge fan and can't wait to come back. The Bistec steak sandwich was absolutely delicious--the shoestring potatoes were an awesomely unique touch and the chimichurri sauce was amazing. A friend and I split the fried plantain appetizers and I'm not sure what they put on top--some sort of garlic, olive oil concoction--but it was so good. A little redundant though, since the sandwiches come with a side of plantain chips as well. But nevertheless, this place is definitely one worth trying.
