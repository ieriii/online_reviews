We had a fantabulous evening here for my friend's birthday! First, they had given our table away....normally a cause for massive meltdown. BUT, the host treated us to complimentary cocktails/wine while we waited for another. Score one! Then, the ambience. It's a casual but mood-filled place, with shadowy lighting and just enough din to feel festive. For our happy little party, this also got extended to our menus, which featured a "Happy Birthday, [friend's name]!" on it:) The food was the best part. SO FRESH and very plentiful. Really, you should just order a few apps and a couple of pasta dishes to share...the portions here are huge. But everyone loved their meal, and the restaurant also let us bring in a cake from Fox and Obel (instead of having their dessert).
