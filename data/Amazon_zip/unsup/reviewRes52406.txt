Went here for lunch and it was pretty empty, so luckily we got everything we needed pretty fast. Overall, most of the meats were decent. They weren't as flavorful or tender as other churrascarias in the city. Especially the parmesan pork. It was pretty dry and the crust was horrible. But to be fair Fogo is the only one that does it right. The one thing this steakhouse has over Fogo and Texas is the Pineapple. It's honestly worth the trip by itself and despite Brazzaz somewhat disappointing meats, the pineapple allows it to be placed second amongst the churrascaria totem pole. Plus you can't beat $20 for lunch. Check it out.
