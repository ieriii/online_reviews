I've been a regular customer at the Diner since 1992. Since I'm vegan I definitely go there for the food and not the service (slow) and ambience (increasingly noisier as there are more annoying people there now than ever before!). I fully realize the food has always been good but not great. But who cares?!? It's a (vegetarian) diner -- not a three-star restaurant!
