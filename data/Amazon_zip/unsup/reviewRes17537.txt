I've been to Carnivale a few times in the past 3 years, always had a good experience. However, I recently had to go gluten free, and needed to go to Carnivale with a group from work.  I called ahead, and the person who answered was able to confirm that the chips are fried in a dedicated frier, and that the jibarito sandwich dish would be safe for me to eat. I did not ask about the other dishes, but I would imagine that there are other safe items. While the waiters weren't able to help me with questions, they were able to check with the chef if I needed to know if dishes were gluten free. Overall, I had a good experience, and would highly recommend Carnivale.
