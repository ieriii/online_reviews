They do pretty good private parties here. The wine servers are very knowledgeable and helpful, and take care to make sure you enjoy the wine. The food is not bad either, they have amazing cheese! The braised beef and the crabcakes were great too. The space upstairs is not the most glamorous, but it serves it's purpose.
