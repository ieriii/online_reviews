I stayed at the Hyatt McCormick Place and was very impressed. The suite was beautiful, the views were outstanding. We were able to view a fireworks display at the Navy pier form our room on Saturday night - I wondered if Liz, the Guest Experience Manager, ordered that display for our party. Service was excellent, the suite was excellent and very roomy. The view of downtown Chicago and the lake were awesome. The staff was great and helped us out by providing extra trash cans in the room. We had a get together at my suite after the graduation, 30 people and tons of food fit easily. The staff helped us transport the supplies and food in and out of the hotel.It was an excellent location as I was attending an event at UoC. Access to downtown was very easy. I would very much like to stay here again. As a matter of fact, it was very hard to leave the room to head back home. LCD tv, great walk-in closet, nice living room area and very highly recommended!I want to thank Liz and the staff for making my stay a memorable and enjoyable stay.
