never tried a duck + foie gras hotdog before. its different. if you love foie gras you will love it. im not that sophisticated and actually like cpk's peking duck pizza. so for me, it was just good. different and good.  w also had the atomic, a lamb hotdog and chicago style hot dogs.  atomic and lamb hotdog's were okay. not really an $8 hotdog. but the actaul encased meat in the chicago style was realllllyyy good. that red colored one. good. really good.  duck fried french fries tasted like crispy inNout fries BTW.
