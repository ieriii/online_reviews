I have an unhealthy affection for pizza. Of all the deep dish or stuffed pizza I've had in Chicago theirs is definitely my favorite. I think my two favorite spots for a nice dinner in Andersonville are this place and Hop Leaf, and this is one of my favorite places in the city to take out of town guests. The neighborhood is charming, the food is good, the atmosphere is pleasant, and the whole package is accessible for cosmopolitanally challenged. I'm a fan of their bread. I can't remember their salads. I enjoy their garlic bread and love their stuffed pizza. The best thing I've had though was some special called sacchetti or something. It was almost like cheese ravioli, except shaped like little purses, and it had peas and a buttery sauce on it. I thought it was phenomenal. I love living in North Center but it just doesn't have the same charm as Andersonville. And so far, it seems like dining in North Center means Thai, bar food, Victory's Banner, or Turquoise.
