This is a great place for Chinese food. The prices are great for the quality and quantity of each dish. The first time I ordered the fried intestine at Lao Sze Chuan (which I've had many times before from different restaurants), it had a funky smell to it and I sent it back. Intestine is not a good food to be risky with! The oysters with green onions are fantastic, definitely worth a try. The fried tofu is awesome fresh but difficult to reheat with success so eat it all there.
