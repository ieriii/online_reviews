Oh...la la. This place is SEXY! Yes, the cocktails are expensive, but deserving AND you get a sidecar. Went there last night with my girl for some much needed catch up chatting. We are not high brow babes, at all, and our bartender, Andrew thought we were down right annoying when she asked for a vodka soda, and I asked for a hot toddy(which is a seasonal drink, but I am fighting this horrible cold and wanted something warm). He gave her the drink she requested, with muddled berries and some other liquor, after which she proceeded to drink 2 more plain vodka sodas(Thanks man, for being understanding). When I couldn't get my hot toddy, we worked together to make a blood and sand (BTW, Violet Hour, for a cocktail house, this should already be on your menu) but had to have the juicer in the back serve me up some fresh OJ. It was delish. i decided to make my next drink a Harling(I think that's the name) County bourbon drink, which will be my regular when I go back. Besides our annoying drink requests in this establishment that probably calls their bar tenders "mixologists", the decor was great, deep fried peanut butter cup incredible, and the banter with the bar tender, door man, wait staff and guests was a lot of fun. For me, its a better throw back to a San Francisco Bar called Bourbon and Branch. I will be back!
