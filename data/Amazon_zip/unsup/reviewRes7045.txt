Fantastic. Very friendly staff. You can tell whoever created the menu is a fanatic. They know BBQ and want to prove it to you. It's in the Gold Coast so it's a bit higher-end, but not too badly priced. A pork sandwich was $12 and incredibly filling. The dry rub on the potato chips you get when you sit down, just wet the appetite. They have plenty of items on the menu if you have expensive tastes (e.g., Kobe beef ribs).
