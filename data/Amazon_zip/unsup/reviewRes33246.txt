This place is a hidden gem!! The food was excellent - we had the braised short rib goulash - delish and the sausage stuffed chicken - awesome!! The owner was extremely accommodating and friendly.  WE learned when we arrived that they have a limo to pick you up and drop you off - he offered to take us to the theater and back. Would highly recommend this place as either a date place OR a group place!
