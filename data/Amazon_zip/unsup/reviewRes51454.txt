Oh no Garcia's! It really pains me to write this. What is happening?! You're slipping! Second time in a row I've become ill from the food! I avoided chicken hoping to avoid the last bout of food posioning (over Thanksgiving weekend), so went with veggie enchiladas, and still felt sick afterwords. Also, service was really awful. Keep in mind, I've worked in the industry forever, so I'm really forgiving about service, but this was non-existant. After we ordered our entrees we only saw her when she dropped our food, and when we asked for more chips and salsa, as there were 4 of us, and we went through the basket pretty quickly, she only brought salsa (even though we had no chips), and when we asked for some more chips, she said she that would cost us. I've never heard of a Mexican restaurant charging for more chips when everyone has ordered dinners. Food was eh... not her fault, but just saying. We also waited forever to get our check, then she never came back when it was time to pay. We had to grab another server to take our check for us. And it was not busy at all... Oh Garcia's. I don't want to give you a bad review, but you are starting to slip in ranks. Get it together so I can enjoy dining there again.
