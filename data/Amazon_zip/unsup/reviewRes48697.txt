I love the Publican. It is everything a restaurant should be. Focus in on the food, plain and simple. Rustic presentation and flavors. Waiter was attentive, chatty, helpful. The space was cool too. One thing worth noting, you could easily do this place on the cheap...many dishes are in the $10-15 range. This would be a great place for a couple are beers and some tasty snacks. Beer- Three Floyds, enough said. Pickles- Cauliflower, bread and butter slices, fennel, raisins. Great little snack to begin the dining experience. Spicy Pork Rinds- Light and tasty, great with beer. Oysters- I am far from an oyster aficionado, but these were tasty. Not fishy at all.....sweet, salty, crisp, and clean. Ham- Ham selection....3 hams...all quite tasty. Might have enjoy it a bit more if I'd eaten it earlier in the meal. Marrow Bones- Oh my. Globs of bone marrow straight from the bone spread onto rustic bread. I have died and gone to heaven. Waffle- Lightest and crispiest waffle I've ever had. Great way to end the meal (along with some Intelligentsia coffee of course.) I will be back soon (hopefully)
