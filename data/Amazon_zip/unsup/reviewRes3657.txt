Since moving to Chicago i have been on a search for real god Korean food--like the kind my friends mom used to make, I have found it. Although Crisp is fusion style food---it hits the mark! I had the baby Buddha bowl (which is not so baby) which is the equivalent of Korean bim bim bop. I was so busy eating that i do not think i talked at all during the whole meal. My husband got the tangy wings and he was just as happy with his meal as i was. I will be back!
