Oh my, I'm soo soo glad to have found this place and chose the north location! I remembered the shopping on north Milwaukee Ave., so once we get seated & caught up with friends visiting Chicago as well, I noticed the reuben on pumpernickle bread, well as a kid visiting my great aunt in Florida my mom told me how that's how this place she worked at served their reuben sandwiches. Well I scored big time oh man the slaw & thousand island dressing plus the cheese had my taste buds dancing & thinking about that sandwich a few days later!
