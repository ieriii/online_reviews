By far one of the best restaurants in Chicago. Stayed here for a couple of hours just eating and sharing dishes. Waitress was very attentive and helpful with recommendations. The spreads were delicious, especially the eggplant one. The housemade greek sausage was also a hit. For dessert, you must try the sicilian iris-deep fried ricotta that left me speechless. It was refreshing to see Jimmy Bannos Jr. working hard in the kitchen and seeing how hands-on he is at this restaurant. Will definitely be back again!
