Excellent food- very creative dishes and interesting, attractive drinks. While everything we ordered was delicious, the macaroni and cheese was probably among the best I've ever tasted. Excellent service- knowing my group had never been here before, the waiter gave a lot of helpful (but not pushy) suggestions. The place has a really nice atmosphere, and for being packed on a Saturday night, we were seated relatively quickly. Will definitely go back!
