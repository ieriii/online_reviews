Best Thai food and sushi in Rogers Park, for sure. Their sushi is fresh and delicious - my favorite is the mango-avocado-cucumber, which didn't sound that appetizing to me at first but it tastes so good with soy sauce (or by itself). Also, I yearn for their ginger avocado salad just about every day - the ginger dressing is the best! As far as Thai food goes, their basil chicken is my mainstay. Their pad-see-ewe is really good too, especially compared to some of the other surrounding Thai restaurants in Rogers Park. Even though I order delivery half the time, the decor is not so bad. It's super eclectic and kind of disjointed, but I don't dislike it. The presentation of the food is always nice too :)
