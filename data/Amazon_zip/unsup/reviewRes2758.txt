We went to Tru to celebrate our 9th wedding anniversary not too long ago. It was quite nice to dress up and go out for a very nice dinner - we felt so grown up. The selling point of Tru is their service and it came through with flying colors - it was fantastic from the moment we stepped through the door to the time we left. Everyone from the hostess to the wait staff to the valet were attentive, friendly and helpful the entire evening. The food was good. It was not spectacular, unbelievable or mind-blowing. We did not have the 6 or 8 course menu since neither of us liked a couple items from each menu, so instead we ate from the fixed menu. We enjoyed the butternut squash soup (fantastic!) and the bacon wrapped scallops for appetizers. Then we moved to the braised short rib and curry lobster for our main course - both very good, but did not have a WOW factor to them. We finished up with dessert - sorbet served in spoons and chocolate mousse. The little side dishes in between courses were a nice touch, but the gelatinous meat side was forgettable at best. We enjoyed a wonderful bottle of wine with the help of the wine staff at the restaurant that really complimented our meal. Again, the staff was great and friendly the entire evening. When we left we were given pastries for breakfast the next day and our car was waiting for us. It was a great dining experience - if only the food was a touch more imaginative.
