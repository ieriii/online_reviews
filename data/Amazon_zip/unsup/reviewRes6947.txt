We went to q for the first time 2 weekends ago and absolutely loved it. The service was amazing and we especially loved the spicy bbq sauce. We tried 3 of their appetizers and enjoyed the chili and the bbq tasting the most. Our waiter had excellent recommendations. I had the 2 entree combo of ribs and their pork belly sausage (special for the night). They were both really good. The four of us had a great time - we liked the service and the food so much that my fiance and I are considering this place for our rehearsal dinner!
