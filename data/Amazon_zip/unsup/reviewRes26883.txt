Had a really great drinks + nibbles experience at the bar here. Full disclosure:did not have a full meal. Stumbled in off the street on a Thursday and we were able to get three seats in the bar area within a few minutes-score, as the waits for tables were running 1.5 hours. I'd heard the hype and really wanted to experience this spot. My favorite alcohol, aside from champagne, is hands town tequila, so I really enjoyed the composed cocktails here and appreciate that they change by season. The margaritas are generally served up, which I also really liked. Stuck with a very traditional - just tequila, fresh lime, Cointreau - the only way to make a classic margarita. Absolutely perfectly executed up with a salted rim. House guacamole, salsa and extremely crispy fresh chips were excellent and the jicama snack food mixed with cukes and pineapple was delicious. Prices are very reasonable and if you are savvy, you can definitely eat (snacks at least) here as not only a vegetarian but also a vegan. Be sure to ask the very knowledgable waitstaff about details if you are a veg-eater-for example, beans that may appear veg are actually cooked in lard - just be careful. That's one of the reasons I neglected to stay for a full meal-seemed doable with some questions, modifications and perseverance, but perhaps a bit more challenging than my post-margarita (and let's be honest, champagne) self was up for. They're very hard to get, but outdoor tables are the way to go in this spot during warmer months. Inside runs very dark-great for winter cozy nights but a little den-like for the summer.
