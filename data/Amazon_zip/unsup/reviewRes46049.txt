If you want a huge meal, some great views of Michigan Avenue, and don't mind waiting eternity for both, this is the place for you. The food is a couple notches up from The Cheesecake Factory, but the wait is just as long. Particularly great is brunch on Sunday if you can get a table. The lunch/dinner menu is pretty extensive, though they have some weird items, including some kind of flat noodle soup that seems out of place on the menu. Service is adequate, not spectacular.
