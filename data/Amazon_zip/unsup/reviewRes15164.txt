I selected Sabatino's for my birthday dinner. My husband and I saw the place reviewed on Check, Please! and thought it sounded great. We were pleasantly surprised. The complimentary pizza bread is delish. We both enjoyed the soup and salad included with the meals. Minestrone soup was very, very good but salads were just average. Iceberg lettuce, a few veggies, and a generous portion of dressing. The entrees, however, were amazing. I had Lobster Diavolo - huge chunks of sauteed lobster in a slightly spicy red sauce over linguine. Pasta was cooked just right, and the sauce was amazing with slivers of garlic. The lobster was a very generous helping. It seemed like everyone was celebrating a birthday around us and the staff came out with a sparkler in a little dish of ice cream (I think) to sing with the strolling musicians. It was very nice! We had Baked Alaska for dessert, which was fired tableside with a nice presentation by the maitre'd. Our waitress was very friendly, gave good recommendations, and made us feel very welcomed and relaxed. I can see how on a weekend or night later in the week (we went on a Tuesday) the place would be packed and service would slow down. This is a great trip back in time for some old school Italian. All the other patrons seemed to be regulars. We will absolutely be back!
