For a place hidden amidst Northwestern medical buildings and scrub-clad physicians, this place is an unassuming oasis. We walked by it three or so times before entering this dim lit Narnia. I'm not a foodie, but going to Tru will make you one. Upon ordering from the Prix Fixe menu, my palette encountered the most incredible Carpaccio, halibut and cheese with fruit I've ever had in all 27years of existence. I mean, shit. Pardon my french, or don't because what better time for an expletive than after a coup de foudre?  Here are some highlights: The Carpaccio was served with a 25yr. aged balsamic and taste that'll turn an avid vegan into a carnivore. The Halibut, oh Laws knows it was good. I shall from this day forward snub all other attempts at this dish. Finally, their exclusive cheese selection left me in awe and was what finally turned me into a monster. I am no longer content as a freezer box connoisseur. I now bitch down supermarket aisles, disgusted by processed goods. "Excuse me. Yes you Jewel stock boy---What the hell are those? Kraft sliced singles... No, no no. This is not happening. Where are your $300 french imports?"
