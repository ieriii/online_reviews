I really think that the Chicago Diner needs to up their game. It seems like because they are the most well-known vegan place in the city they think they can turn out mediocre food. Vegans should revolt! It is almost like they aren't even trying to be very creative. A lot of the food is average at best--you could do better in your own kitchen and a lot of vegans are forced to know how to cook for themselves so they ARE doing better. Nothing is terrible...it just isn't that good. If I was in the neighborhood I would go in a pinch, otherwise, head elsewhere. Like The Handlebar. Now THAT is some good vegan eats. But I'll save that story for another time. PS: A big plus for the Chicago Diner is the parking lot. It is tight, but you gotta love that at least they have one in this mega-busy neighborhood.
