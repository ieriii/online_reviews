I've tried 5 Korean BBQ places in the city. San Soo Gab San is definitely the best. If you haven't done Korean BBQ, its a fun experience (better in groups), and you get to do some cooking at the table. Make sure you get the seafood pancake as an appetizer. A lot of the reviews here are claiming that you have to 'know what you are doing' or that you need to be Korean to get good service. Absolutely not true. First of all, its not complicated (BBQ meet, put on lettuce, add rice, eat). Second if you ask staff how to 'do it correctly' they will gladly show you (and sometimes even show you if you don't ask). The waitresses here get very busy sometimes, I think that's where the confusion is coming from. The barriers to having a great time here couldn't be lower, and the food is fantastic if you like BBQ (if you don't they have great Bibimbap). Get in here, and give it a try.
