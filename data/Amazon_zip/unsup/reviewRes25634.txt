Really fun and romantic. Only thing I would change is the seating. Would definitely request a booth next time because some of the tables are smashed in there together and not very private. BUT the food was amazing. Loved the live guitar player and the dark atmosphere. I would also like to go back for just cheese, chocolate, and coffee sometime soon. It is a MUST try!!
