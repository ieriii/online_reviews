Went in for the Sunday mystery menu and for the Saturday underground for anniversary. I must say, I never had a mediocre meal here. Every course was absolutely fantastic. I still can't get over the onion consomme I had when I first dined there. Unfortunately, it has never returned since then. This is truly one of the best restaurants in Chicago.
