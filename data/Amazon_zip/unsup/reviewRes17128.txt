"I'm not a vegetarian because I love animals. I'm a vegetarian because I hate vegetables." - A.Whitney Brown (SNL) Well, if you're looking to lay waste to legumes, this is the place to do some mastication in comfortable surroundings. That's right, the veggies have NO IDEA whats in store for them.  Every ounce of flavor is extracted in no-nonsense techniques that would rival medevil warlords. These veggies are chopped, pureed, fried, boiled, or baked, then left to bake under a well tended heat lamp. No comfy chair for these dastardly yellow lentils.  SPICE LEVEL This is flavor for natives, not for occasional diversity tourists. These veggies are bathed in a series of spices that leave a very nice spice on your tongue, but I can't imagine being cooked IN THESE SPICES for a time, while still retaining the structure of the vegetable form. These guys are experts in their craft, and I would never want to mess with them - if I was a vegetable.  The samosas - little flaky prisons for potatoes, peas and a nice curry spice, really show the workmanship. Even the veggie pancakes are well executed - not a pancake in the traditional sense, but more like a dosa.  These guys, by far, are the best vegetable flavor extractors I have been to downtown.  It's a vegetable Guantanamo, that works over every vegetable, and does justice to your palate.
