I have very mixed feelings about Glenn's Diner. A few weeks ago the bf and I took a nice evening stroll to find a place to grab dinner. Bowman's was packed and Lincoln Square had some sort of festival so we headed east on Montrose hoping to find something but having nothing specific in mind.We came upon Glenn's Diner. My only experience with Glenn's prior was that of two of my out-of-town guests had found Glenn's when left to their own devices and without my supervision and came back saying that best food in the world was a complete misnomer and that cereal boxes did not constitute a diner. Therefore, I was skeptical when bf said, let's try it!It was a beautiful summer evening, they have a patio and anything beyond Ravenswood was not tempting me so I said, sure.We sat outside and when I glanced at the menu, I was at once confused and delighted by the incredible variety.Although it was crab leg special night ($35.00 all you can eat) I felt $35 was a little steep for the amount of crab I would be able to consume. Plus, I think crab legs take a special precision to cook I wasn't yet convinced Glenn's could master. So bf ordered the sword fish and I had the sea scallops.The scallops were incredible. Cooked to absolute, seared perfection, accompanied by roasted red potatoes and grilled asparagus. The bacon, mushroom, butter sauce was very tasty but totally unnecessary and almost too abundant. BF loved his fish so we were happy as clams with the food.The service on the other hand, left a little to be desired. I was confused by all of the blackboard specials, how they were different from the items on the menu and what the pricing difference was. Our server was inconsistent in her visits and her information about the specials.I would definitely try Glenn's again -- it's ALWAYS packed on the weekends for brunch. But I felt it was a pricier than the food warranted.
