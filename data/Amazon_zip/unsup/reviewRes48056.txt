Came to dinner at Publican this past week while in town for work. My brother had been before and loved it - so he thought it would be a great place to go to. It's a beautiful restaurant, with lots of space, and a wonderful ambiance. Very busy, and everybody seemed to be having a great time. Made a reservation for 8:30 - even though we showed up early, they seated us immediately. Our waiter was busy, but took the opportunity to introduce himself briefly, and give us a quick rundown of the menu. After some difficult decision making - we decided on half a dozen oysters, the charcuterie plate, snow crab, and blood sausage. The oysters were impeccable. Perfect temperature, not pierced, and they were served with a little piece of paper which detailed where the different types were on the plate - genius idea! The charcuterie plate was phenomenal. The different types of cured meats were so unique - and went well with the pickled cauliflower, grainy mustard, preserves spread, and cornichons. Next was the snow crab, which was tossed in some sort of herb butter/oil sauce. AMAZING. Definitely worth the mess that comes along with cracking open crab legs. I think my least favorite part of the dinner was the blood sausage. Even though it was really good, I just don't think it was really 'my thing'. Personal preference I suppose. Skipped dessert and but each had a glass of honey wine. Although I was a little put off by how sweet the nose was, it was smooth and lighter than expected. Would definitely recommend if you like dessert wines! Overall, I had a great experience. Will definitely try to make it back the next time I'm in town.
