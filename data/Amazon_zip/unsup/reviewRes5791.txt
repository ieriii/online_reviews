The food was WAY over priced. Perhaps if I was just gluten free it would have been a pleasant experience. The chicken that I had was bland, and I was only offered one side. I had to pay $3.95 for a baked potato. I was not told that the baked potato would be extra. I had a split breast of chicken, some plain broccoli and a baked potato for over $20. They made no attempt to season the vegetables or potatoes. They did not inform me of the extra charges. They do have great gluten free options but the service was not great and I was certainly not impressed. I was wheelchair accessible. But there was a lot of stuff on the ramp. Chairs, bags, and other things that the delivery staff need.
