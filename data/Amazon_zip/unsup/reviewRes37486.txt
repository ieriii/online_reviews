Hopleaf taught me a very important lesson about myself. Basically, that I can be plied to overlook many shortcomings when fed delicious beers and fabulous french fries. If you want to bribe me, just take me to dinner there. Well... then I'll be drunk too and maybe sloppy, but I think you understand. I've been to Hopleaf a handful of times, and I will be back again and again. The mussels were mediocre, the CB&J overhyped, BUT THE BEER SELECTION was worth it. I love the ham sandwich, so I've made the executive decision to order it each time I go and try out my adventurous side on the beer menu instead. The atmosphere is great, nice place to go w/ a group. The service is hit or miss. There's usually parking, but last time I went I got a ticket... my registration is 8 months expired. I blame myself. Also, I always go on Mondays or Tuesdays since I've heard wait time horror stories, so I'm not exactly sure how bad it gets.
