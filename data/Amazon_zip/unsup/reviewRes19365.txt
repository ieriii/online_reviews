I brought my mom and sister here to try a new sushi spot and it did not disappoint whatsoever! The miso soup was brought out in big mugs which was really nice on a cold day and there was a spicy miso option which really hit the spot. The pieces of sushi (super white tuna, yellowtail and salmon) were very fresh-- the yellowtail really stood out. The rolls were great too (dragon and crunchy spicy tuna). Finished off with chocolate mint and green tea mochi. I would absolutely come back here. Great area to walk around. Very nice waitress.
