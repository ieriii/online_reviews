$10 cheaper and tastes that way. This is not the place to go if you want that quintessential Chicago steakhouse experience. Sauces and seasonings cover up lower-grade beef, and aren't that great anyway. The trio of filets lacked flavor (yeah, I know - but even for a filet...) and were not as tender as filets should be. Lettuce Entertain You restaurant chain operates this place, and the 'chain restaurant feel' permeates the food, service, and atmosphere. Bottom line: if you're going to go spend $50 on a steak dinner, you might as well drop another $20 and do it right.
