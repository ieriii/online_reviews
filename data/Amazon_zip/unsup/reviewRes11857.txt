This pizza is ok, if you like white pizza's its actually pretty good. But man I love tomatoes. The pizza a little thin and floppy for my tastes, chicago thins usually have some doughiness or crackeriness to prevent the sogginess. Actually the best thing about this place is the beer and the live band karaoke night. Now that is good. This place does get crowded on weekends, and has its share of the Lincoln Park transplants to Wicker Park crowd, but it is bearable if you drink enough or there is karaoke.
