My good friend invited me there for dinner. It was the BESTEST MOSTEST AWESOMEST dinner I've had. Fancy-shmancy atmosphere requires you to dress appropriately. Waiters with heavy Italian accents will serve you well and be extremely helpful. Wine selection is great. I had swan with some vegetables and pizza and something else. Food was GREAT, wine was even better. I wasn't paying, but my friend had to let go of a couple hundred dollars... Definitely an upscale place.
