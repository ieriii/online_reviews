Nice location and can be found right on the corner of the street. The ambiance is pleasant: it's clean, nicely lit, and d-bags are non-existent. Food & drinks are awesome. The beer/drink menu is as extensive as the food menu. Despite having tons of items, the staff impressively knew the menu. Servers & bartenders were helpful and friendly. If you come for the burgers and beer, then you'll be one happy customer. Even if you don't, there is so much to choose from that it's guaranteed you'll find something you like. Prices are fine. Food items are ~$10 while beers range from $4 all the way to $35. Cocktails will set you back ~$7. Quality is pretty high thus everything is delicious. The garlic fries are a must have. Jukebox is always a nice thing to have. Any place that has Daft Punk playing when I walk in is a winner in my book.
