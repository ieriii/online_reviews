It is really not necessary for me to write another review for hot dougs, seeing as there are 700+ reviews. But I wanted to say that everytime I go and he has The Atomic Bomb, I have to get it. 2 of them. Its like an asian curry flavor (not an indian curry but like a Thai curry) and the cheese completes it. Not very subtle but so amazing. GET THE ATOMIC BOMB.
