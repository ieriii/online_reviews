We don't eat a lot of take out, but we happen to live in the same building as the owners and noticed their car with the Fogo2Go logo... then walked past the pizzeria one day... and put two and two together. :-) So we were curious and decided to try it. The pizza was really reasonably priced and very tasty. The ingredients tasted fresh, and the sauce on the margherita was wonderful. A large was more than enough for dinner and lunch the next day for both of us. We'll definitely be back!!
