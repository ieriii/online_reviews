Best tacos I have found anywhere, with the possible exception of some of the Pepe's on the south side--but, those are pretty inconveniently located for me. Pasadita is awesome, simple menu keeps you from making bad choices, since there really aren't any. Always fast, always fresh, and you can taste the individual ingredients. FYI, about half of the reviews listed on this page are for the other La Pasaditas (next door and across the street). As for those who have griped about the price, I don't get it--the ingredients here are way fresher than you will find at most taco/burrito places, and at $7 for a burrito and $2-$2.40 for good-sized tacos, it's pretty difficult to come up with anything close to an expensive meal
