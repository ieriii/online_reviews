In my top five for Chicago restaurants. For dinner, go weekday evenings to avoid the crazy, oftentimes hour-long wait. Or, order at the bar and grab a chair. If you choose the latter option, service is incredibly fast! Must gets: coconut shrimp (appetizer) garlic mashed potatoes (side) candied yams (side) fajita entree for those vegetarian mojitos Desserts look amazing but I can't comment; can never make it that far. Pleasant owners. Easy parking.
