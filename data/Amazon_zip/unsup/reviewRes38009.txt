I should of KNOWN! Any place that says World Famous, SUCKS! I'm pretty freaking sure the majority of people in Thailand, Africa, Australia, or where ever has sooo heard of this place. Plus, places like In'N'Out don't have all over their walls that they're fking good. The food speaks for itself. Sorry, pet peeve of mine. Anyways, I know I'm just being biased because I'm more of a NY pizza gal, so obviously I'm not going to want to have sex with it. I had better Chicago pizza in Riverside, CA then here. What is up with that?
