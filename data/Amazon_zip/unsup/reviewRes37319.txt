Multiple choice question: Self-restraint is one of the following: (a) restraint imposed on one by oneself; self-control; (b) something Amanda doesn't have usually; (c) something Amanda REALLY doesn't have with various luscious beer options at reasonable prices; or (d) all of the above. Um, doi, the answer is (d), as if I had to tell you. One lovely, slightly-brisk early evening whereby we ended up on the other side of the world...ooops, I mean on the other side of town...and we decided to pop into Hopleaf for a drink, a beer, natch. So we did. And guess what? I exercised some self-restraint rather uncharacteristically. I ordered one beer.  One. Gulden Draak. It means Golden Dragon. Sounds awesome already, doesn't it? It is, trust me. Thick, delicious and 10.5% in the alcohol percentage, one beer was enough for this temporarily self-restrained lady. My like-minded self-restrained young man ordered a Hommelbier (I think). We begrudgingly gave our table up after one round, but I imagine we'll be back very soon. Why? (a) We LOVE beer; (b) we wanna try the mussels and frites; (c) self-retraint in our lives is very fleeting; or (d) all of the above. Come on now. You know the answer.
