Went there twice when I was in Chicago this past May, loved it both times, the sandwiches and the milk shakes are great. I had the Dagwood the first time and the Po Boy the second time, their "meat" is pretty close to roast beef IMO which is cool. The prices are alright and the place seemed fairly accessible to me. The sides that I had though left something to be desired, I had the mac and cheese and the mashed potatoes, both were a tad disappointing.
