I'm a native of San Diego but my girlfriend is from Chicago and I've been to Chicago several times. So this review is more for my peeps in San Diego, then people from Chicago. Hands down, best breakfast place I've been to. The breakfast burrito was phenomenal, and I'm from San Diego, we know how to make a burrito. We can't win a Super Bowl or a World Series but we can make burrito. And the one I had was absolutely the best. I went there around Christmas time when the weather was 30 below with the wind. My girlfriend and I walked through the freezing snow, and I can't stand the cold. But I have to say it was worth it. That atmosphere was great, it felt like I was eating breakfast at a friends house. Maybe it was the cold weather outside,and the warmth inside, but the place felt very inviting. I know that when I go back to Chicago, I'm definitely going back. I can't recommend it enough. I'm pretty sure most of Chicago knows about this place but for my peeps in SD, if you're in Chicago, this place is definitely worth the train ride.
