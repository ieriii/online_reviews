i've been coming to wishbone for years now, and it's a great place as your go-to, default breakfast spot. back in the day when i used to wake up super early and workout, i would order the fruit bowl, chicken apple sausage, and a side of toast, all at the bar. their coffee is great and tasty, and brings some sort of comfort.  i love the regular (as opposed to cheesy) grits. not everyone is a grits fan, but i love it. their shrimp and grits is wonderful, too, but sorta heavy, so be prepared. my nieces order the mickey mouse pancakes, and they love them. i did come for lunch for a bridal shower once, and the food wasn't great. i recommend coming for breakfast only. i give wishbone 3 stars because it's nothing more spectacular than the next joint, but there is a very soft spot in my heart for it. it's comforting, inviting, family-friendly.  i will definitely keep coming back.
