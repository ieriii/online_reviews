I know, I know...I should probably give Cafe 28 five stars. The patio is just flipping dreamy in the summer (if and when it decides to come). It's in a very odd, yet interesting and inviting location. They have the best duck I have ever eaten in my entire life. The coconut shrimp is sweet, crunchy and never stringy. And, while it has gotten a bit more popular over the years, it still can maintain its hidden gem status. But I must say something about the mojitos. I had been there a few times and the mojitos have always been delicious. But I went there a little while ago with the family, I had a mojito with dinner and ended up getting one of the worst headaches of my life. Now, it could have been that it was a particularly hot day and I was dehydrated, or that I just drank it too quickly, or a bit of a combo deal. Okay, I won't toally fault the restaurant for that. So I went there again, and I did not get a headache, but the mojito just wasn't as good as I remembered it. I can't really place my finger on what it was, but I have always told people that Cafe 28 has the best mojitos in town and, well, that just wasn't the case the last time I was there. Maybe the economy forced them to downgrade the rum or the mint? I just don't know... But I am so not giving up on this place. You'd have to be so stupid to abandon the place with the best duck evs! Plus, I still haven't been there for brunch... Stay tuned for the thrilling second part of this adventure! And one quick question: does anyone know why their website is a .org?
