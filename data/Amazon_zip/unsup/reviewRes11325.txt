Okay boo ya Bongo Room! Seriously....one of my favorite breakfast places! Went here this morning and the wait was not too bad....and worth every minute! I got the vegetarian croissant sandwich and it was AWESOME. It was fantastic, so good. Really though. A little messy to eat, but all the flavors were there and each bite was like another slice of heaven. Both my friends had what I got last time....the spinach, red pepper and feta Eggs Benedict. Let's just say all three of our plates were almost licked clean. My cappuccino was worth mentioning too- tons of foam and just great. Although the wait can sometimes be a little over board, the staff there is super cool and makes a point to seat you as fast as they can. Awesome!
