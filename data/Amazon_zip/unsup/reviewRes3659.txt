My boyfriend's friends RAVE about this place. They say it's like crack and that you will crave it nightly. We decided to try it on Friday afternoon, and it was pretty good, but I'm not craving it nightly. I got the chicken strips with Seoul Sassy, which was tasty but left something to be desired. My bf got a half chicken with the BBQ sauce, which he wasn't too crazy about. If I came back I think I would order one of their bowls because it seems like a lot of people there were ordering that. I would only be coming back, though, because I live in the area and is convenient. If I lived outside of southern Lakeview/northern Lincoln Park, I probably wouldn't make a special trip.
