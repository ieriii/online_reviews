I took my Ginger there for a long awaited romantic night out & it couldn't have been any better! We each ordered the Deluxe Seafood Dinner & from start to finish the experience was great. We each started out by ordering a bottle of wine from their extensive wine list. It took a few minutes but we each found what we were looking for. First, we were given a lovely salad with a mustard vinaigrette, quickly followed by Geja's famous cheese fondue. This was my first time doing the fondue thing and it was AWESOME! Next, they bring out this tray covered in fresh vegetables & a variety of seafood (shrimp, scallops & lobster). This was the sweetest shrimp that I have ever tasted, the scallops literally melted in your mouth & one can NEVER go wrong with LOBSTER. As if all of that wasn't enough, they bring a pot of flaming chocolate to your table with pound cake, strawberries & marshmallows for dipping. WOW!! With live Spanish guitar, lights so dim one needs a flashlight to read the wine list & a knowledgable/friendy wait staff - romance literally drips from the walls! We'll be back!
