Let me tell you about the best holiday known to...oh, about three people: Meatmas Say it with me, yall: MEATMAS. Let the name waft over you, get excited because you now have a perfect holiday. I'm talking about a holiday where you don't need to see your family, no gifts are needed and Hallmark doesn't need to know. Meatmas Here's what you do. Grab two of your closest non-vegetarian friends, wear a dress in order to eat more/not have pants in the way (don't you just hate pants?), plan your day around eating as much meat as possible, manage your pao de queijo intake because while delicious, it's not meat. Also, pout really hard at the gauchos so that they bring you lamb chops. Order a drank or two if you so dare. Lastly, swipe a handful of chocolate from the hostess stand and let the meat coma walk you over to the brown line so you can go home and not feel hungry for about twelve hours later. MEATMAS.
