LOOOVE Pequod's. The only reason I cannot give this place five stars is because the pizza tastes slightly different each time. Having been here over 10 times, this past experience was the best it prompted me to finally write a review. The sauce was perfectly tart with the right amount of cheese and toppings: half pepp/half sausage being my favorite. The crust is unbelievable and I have no idea where they found the crust caramelizing wizard. They probably lock him in a cage to never see the light of day as this sets it apart from all other pizza places I have been to, and is what keeps me returning for more. The Medium is perfect for 2 as you get a great balance of crust and toppings. My ultimate favorite is the $4.95 lunch deal with pop/beer not only for the outrageous value, but for the balance of crust and the rest. Pequod's doesn't skimp on toppings for the personal size which fosters its loyal following. i dream of Pequod's on a daily basis and am really bummed I can't go here tonight, despite having been this past Saturday. It's that good.
