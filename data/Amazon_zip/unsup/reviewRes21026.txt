While Frontera Grill fell a little short of my high expectations, Xoco was awesome. The food is really fresh and delicious and it's quite a big menu, too. We only were able to go here for breakfast while we were in town but we couldn't have been happier. The open-faced black bean breakfast torta and the chorizo torta were wonderful, and really reasonably priced. The french toast with bacon and pecans on top was ridiculous - my husband snuck the last little piece into my to-go box because he didn't want even a scrap to go to waste. The papaya-lime-mint agua fresca was a perfect complement to our mostly savory meal.  If I lived in Chicago, I'd be here all the time. The list of regular menu tortas looked amazing.
