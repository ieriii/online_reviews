this was the first restaurant I went to my first time visiting Chicago. All my friend ever talked about was how good Chicago-style (deep dish) pizza was, and coming from the NYC area...I HAD to try it. Needless to say, I loved it, the restaurant was great, I only gave it 4 stars just because it took so long (it was busy).
