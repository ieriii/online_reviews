Meh. For the hype and the price this was a let down. I got the scallops for an app. They were raw, not a lot flavor. I got the steak for an entree. It was RAW and chewy. Not good. I don't claim to be a foodie, but this was not my cup of tea. I will not be going back. On the positive, I am a big fan of the Sufjan music on the website (even if the new album blows). And Graham Elliot was at the restaurant when we went. It was cool to see the Top Chef Master in person.
