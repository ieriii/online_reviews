I came across this place while strolling down Michigan Ave. with a friend. We were more curious than hungry when we walked into this place. Boy...were we in for a surprise! LOVE LOVE LOVE!! I always small plate portions because you can try a million different dishes at one time, so that's what got me in the door. The food, however, is what made me go back again! It's so fresh. The staff is friendly. You must make room for dessert, particularly the Iris. 2 drawbacks for me: no reservations and small space. The first time I went here was for a late lunch, and they sat us down right away. Dinner...forget about! 1.5 hour wait!!! Went to a movie and came back for late night dinner. Great tasting food, so would go back again again.
