Rick Bayless knows Mexican food. I love his food so much that I had it two straight days in a row. The first day I had the cochinita pipil which is a suckling pig torta with habanero sauce. This is some super hot sauce but I kept munching away anyways. There is something about spicy pain I enjoy. I had to refill my water 3 times. The wife had Ahogada which was highly recommended by Yelpers. This has to be one of the best sandwiches I ever ate. A carnitas sandwich that is a inch soaked in a savory spicy tomato broth. I can only dream about a sandwich so good now that I am back home in California. for desert, we had the churros dipped in chocolate sauce. This was also good. The second day was our last day in Chicago. We narrowed it down Portillos or Xoco. Best dog I ever ate or best sandwich and mexican food I ever ate. The clear choice was Xoco since it was one of a kind restaurant. This time I ordered the special which was a pork belly torta and the wife had the short rib caldos. Today didn't blow me away like the first day but both dishes were solid. I recommend for the caldos to order a side of bread. It is so good to soak the bread in the soup. It reminds me of a vietnamese beef stew with french bread. For desert, we had the vanilla soft served ice cream with caramel and bacon. Everything complemented each other, sweet and savory. Do not leave Chicago without going to Xoco.
