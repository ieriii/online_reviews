I have a lot of friends that love this place so one night we all made the trip across the expressway. Not bad. The BYOB factor is a huge plus (and yes, you're probably going to spend more than $15 a person so there shouldn't be a fee), but I'm not quite sure if it's worth the cab ride over there. There are a few decent dishes there - the specials are usually the best - but all in all, nothing so out of this world that I'd call it my favorite.
