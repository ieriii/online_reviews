Hooooooooooooooray for Irazu!!! This place is awesome, from the many different flavored shakes to the veggie burrito. For the non vegetarians, go with the steak sandwhich. Absolutely terrfic to the point that I want to steal whatever the secret sauce is they use for that puppy!!! Kind of in a shady neighborhood or something cause they have bars on some of the windows, but don't let this deter you. Irazu is a great place and I will keep coming back :)
