For the price of the place, yeah, I've had better. I went during happy hour to meet friends and I was glad for the experience as this wouldn't normally be a hangout for me anyway. The rooftop patio *was* very cool and the weather was warm but windy so I only half minded gripping my ridiculously overpriced cocktail with fierce abandon. We did have a couple appetizers which were good, but again just seriously too expensive. Of course, they probably rationalize the price of everything by hiring staff to (and I'm not joking) stand by the velvet rope outside and monitor the number of people on the rooftop. I felt like a rockstar when I was leaving but unfortunately I don't make a rockstar's salary which would be what you need to afford any type of satisfying food here. To me the bottom line with this place seems to be "come to experience the place but don't treat it like a restaurant." If you expect something from your food and drinks, you'll leave with an empty wallet and dashed hopes.
