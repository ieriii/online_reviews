You have to wait 45 minutes minimum in rain, snow or shine just to get a hot dog. What else can you say about Hot Dog's than go early and go often. Doug is awesome and funny and his encased meats are amazing! I have never had a dog there that was interesting if not delicious! Also the duck fat fries are maybe one of the best things on the planet.
