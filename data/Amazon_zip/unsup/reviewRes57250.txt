My husband and I visited the bad apple this past Sunday. Half the place was filled at 2:00 in the afternoon. We ordered a round of bloodymarys. Mandy makes a delicious drink. I ordered the el dorado and my husband ordered the bad apple burger. They were both cooked to order and they were great. The salsa really made my burger tasty. The fries were wonderful as well. I would recommend the bad apple to anyone and we look forward to our next dinner there
