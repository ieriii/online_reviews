Gejas has, for the past 30 years that *I* know of, set the gold standard for fondue joints. This was a great date place in the 70s, and it remains so today. They don't mess with success. With the exception of the prices, I think the menu has pretty much stayed the same since then too. So, if you loved the cheese and chocolate fondue in those golden long ago days, you're going to love them now. But it's a lot more crowded nowadays, and, as I say, the prices sure aren't what they used to be.So, go, and have fun!
