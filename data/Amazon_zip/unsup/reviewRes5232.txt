Excellent food, great wine list, awesome staff! Went here with a large group and went crazy on the menu for 3+ hours...incredible food (expect no less from anything with Tony Montuano's name on it), great wine list and a top notch server made it such a great night.  SUPER popular right now (Michelin Bib Gourmand winner) and lines out the door on most nights. No reservations accepted but don't let it deter you, it's crowded for a good reason. (Try the Fried Brussel Sprouts with Thyme, Lemon & Chili Flakes. We kept ordering this, it was just incredible.)
