the food was fresh and tasty... we had some queso panela to start and i got the pollo en mole (usually that's what i'll get my first visit to a mexican restaurant)... it was pretty standard in flavor but i enjoyed it. the chicken was moist and not dry either they also have other regional dishes that looked pretty interesting. the portions were plentiful so we had leftovers for a snack the next day... the service was attentive and i guess it's probably a good sign when there's a lot of people in the restaurant plus when some of chicago's finest come to dine too! fyi. we had to ask for corn tortillas cus they just gave us flour...
