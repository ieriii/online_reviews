Yummy! The pizza was really good, except there was too much crust. They give you lots of whatever ingredient you order. The salad was extremely good- we had the one with pears, goat cheese (or maybe it was blue cheese...) candied walnuts and a vinagrette dressing. The pizzas are enormous, and you are bound to leave full. I like that they have many different options for pizza toppings and types. AND the beer- so many to choose from. They have Kolsch beer that I thought was only available in Koln (Germany), but apparently they have made a close version. They also serve Strongbow, which is my favorite hard cider. I highly recommend. Also, Piece gets four stars because the atmosphere was super loud and super smoky even though people are only supposed to smoke at the bar. Its a large open area and the smoke is going to travel into every nook and cranny. The waitress got a tv channel change for us, which was awesome. For some reason, telemundo came on later in the night...must have been another table's request. We saw a man passed out in the pit as we were leaving. His head was rested down on his belly basically, and he had some pieces of pizza left on his plate with a beer glass to one side. Priceless picture that will always come to mind when I think of Piece.
