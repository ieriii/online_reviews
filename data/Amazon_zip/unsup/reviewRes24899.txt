I've been going for YEARS - before this place became super popular! The cooking is authentic, prices very reasonable and shakes fantastic. I too rave the oatmeal shake. The only reason I didn't rate it a 5-star is because seating can be limited. The outdoor seating helped dramatically but now that it's cooling off, seating will be limited again. If you want casual, authentic, Costa Rican food with very good service, this is the place to go.
