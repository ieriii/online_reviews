A fantastic choice for couples and those looking for a romantic dinner date with an atmosphere for getting close to someone. The food is excellent; unfortunately the proportions are somewhat small. If you're an impatient eater, Gehas it's not for you since it also takes awhile for the meats to cook properly, so eating is slow on the positive side this leaves lots of time for getting to know someone more intimately. You'll also lose your food in the fondue pot repeatedly, although half the fun is digging around the fondue pot with your date looking for lost pieces of meat or veggies. If you are a fan of fondue or want to try something different and romantic, this is the place. My favorite was the cheese fondue, followed by the meat sauces. Overall, my date and I had a wonderful time. On a side note, at the height of the evening it gets little crowded so try to get a corner seat away from everyone. Pros: Good Food, Romantic, Valet Cons: Pricy, Small Portions, Crowed, Poor Parking Cost: $$$ of 5 Overall Rating: 4 of 5 Recommendation: Recommended
