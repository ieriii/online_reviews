My new favorite restaurant in Chicago. The seasonal sangria was fantastic. Ordered roughly 8 tapas for two people and we left sufficiently full. Small portions but best flavor of any restaurant in I have been to in the world. Only complaint was with our veggie dish (mushrooms) came out really really salty. FYI....if you plan on joining their frequent diner program do so well in advance of your visit or else you won't get credit. It takes some time for them to get you into the system.
