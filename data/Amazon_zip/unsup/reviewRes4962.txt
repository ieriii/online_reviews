Bf and I are still talking about our meal here. We were in Chicago for four days and I can't decide if our dinner here or at Girl and the Goat was the favorite. We wandered in around 7 on a Sunday without a reservation and managed to get a table immediately! I love that they have an inexpensive wine menu and you can order half a bottle. One section of the menu is of "shmears" which is stuff you eat with bread. In all honesty, I would be the happiest girl if I could order their bone marrow "shmear" somewhere in California. A steal at $9. The milk-braised pork shoulder is just as good as everyone says. You must order it! I really liked the brussel spouts. I wish the portions were larger! Bf insisted on getting the wagyu beef, which I think was the most expensive thing on the menu (He's much fancier than me.) and it was flavorful and tender. I can't remember how much it was, but I think it was near $20. Still, I would prefer to just eat two more plates of bone marrow. I wanted to try that donut dessert thing people rave about, but they were out. They also didn't have any soft serve ready. We settled on some citrus bread pudding thing, but the server did not tell us that there were golden raisins in it. WE HATE RAISINS! (No really, I feel like all restaurants need to explicitly state when there are raisins or cilantro in a dish. They are such dividing ingredients, don't you think?) We ate around them but it was a hassle, and it wasn't that good anyway.
