Due to Lula Cafe being so damn packed this past Sunday @ 10AM, me and my entourage moved it on over to Longman & Eagle for breakfast/brunch. We called over and they told us a wait for 6 people would be 10 minutes. We made it over and we stood near the bar for about 20 minutes. Once seated, I instantly ordered a mimosa. I knew what i wanted already since I had already heard rave reviews about the Sunny Side Hen Egg Hash with Duck Confit. The duck was very tender and was packed with mad flavor. The black truffle vinaigrette really added to the already flavorful duck. I saw they had a beermosa on the menu and since i am a beer lover, there was no way I could pass that up. The beermosa is hacker-schorr and orange juice. Pretty good and good for if you have a hangover. Just wanna give you a warning: This place is small and if you wear good clothes, they will smell like the kitchen
