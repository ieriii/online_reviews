I know lots of Italians. Real ones. I mean, i know the fake ones too. But i know lots of REAL italians. They always ask me, because well you know, they always askin' me, "Hey, Chaz. Hey, Hey. What's the best Italian restaurant here in Chi-City?" And before a few days ago, I would have to ask them a followup question "How Much do you wanna spend?" Because it used to be a very complicated question. If you want the grand poobah, Spiaggia is your best bet, but if you don't wanna break the bank, go to Topo Gigio. Well... now the answer to that question has got a hell of a lot simpler. 2 words: Davanti Enoteca. In fact, it may be the best casual restaurant in this very city, there I said it. I recommended the Chicken Liver Pate, among everything else. And the only thing i was minorly disappointed with was the polenta and ragu o' the day, but it changes, so I must've had bad luck. But i've been back, and I love this place with all of my heart, the cauliflower puree with scallops is also angel's tears. Overall, Davanti Rocks.
