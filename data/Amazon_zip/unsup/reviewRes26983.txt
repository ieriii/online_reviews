Absolutely exceptional dining experience from making the reservation to the bar tenders to the awesome server (thanks Elizabeth!). My co-worker and I went in totally cold and walked out with one of the most amazing culinary experiences we have had in our travels across the u s of a over the last several years. You have to have the deconstructed caesar salad and the lemon cake desert. Did I mention we were even given a tour of the kitchen? That's right....got to see where the magic happens and met the pastry chef whom had prepared a treat just for us. Can't wait to go back and will be recommending to anyone in Chicago.
