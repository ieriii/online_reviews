Food was good. It was priced on the higher side for the portion side. Loved the atmosphere. Very laid back and the service was phenomenal. One interesting tidbit. My friend consults on various EPA projects and knows the owner. They showed us their green roof. They're one of the few restaurants in Chicago that has a green roof with various plants and such. Loved the band also. Great place to impress a date.
