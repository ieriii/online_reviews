A good vibe and even better food makes Uncommon Ground worth the stop. The fish and chips are worth waiting for, and the meatloaf is a heartwarming meal if that's what you crave. Every Friday in the summer and fall they have a farmer's market; the one time we went they also had a pig roast, which we enjoyed while waiting for a table. They have their own garden on the rooftop along with solar panels to power their water heater. The service was great, and my only wish is that they would have opened up this location earlier.
