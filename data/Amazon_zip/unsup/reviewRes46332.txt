There's a reason this place remind you of The Cheese Cake Factory. It was founded by the same guy. Went there with a group of friends. We had reservations and were seated right on time... unusual for downtown Chicago. I never got the idea, that making me wait, made the food better. Anyway kudos to you guys. We were a fairly large group of six guys. The wait staff is very friendly, the food is good, not great but good. I was surprised they ran out of waffles. How do you run out of waffles when you supposedly have your own bakery? Anyway I didn't order it. Fried Chicken and Waffles seems a little to southern for me. Rich on the other had was devastated, but he eventually got over it. We ordered the appetizer sampler, which was very good. All in all it was a good meal with good friends and good service. I'd definitely go there again.
