I am upgrading my rating to 4 and a half stars!!! I ordered the margherita pizza again and it was to die for. Simple but executed perfectly. Loved it. I could eat that pizza everyday. Perfect amount of sauce and cheese and soft and delicious crust. YUM!! The burrata is sooo good too. It is a huge portion for an appetizer - very rich and decadent. If you are a fan of authentic Neopolitan pizza that tastes like what they serve in Italy, then run don't walk to this place !!
