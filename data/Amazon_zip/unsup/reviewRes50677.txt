I'm still a fan, despite the awkward service we had the last time we visited. We walked in on a weeknight and were immediately told that there were no tables available, despite half the restaurant being empty. Fortunately, we had made a reservation, so we were allowed to sit down, but then our server was nowhere to be found for about ten minutes. All was forgotten, though, when the corn bread biscuits came out. Seriously, y'all - these are worth a little awkwardness.
