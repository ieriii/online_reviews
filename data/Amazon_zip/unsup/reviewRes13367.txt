Holy breakfast, Batman! My new goal is to try every single item written on the chalkboard-walls at Glenn's. This will probably be impossible, since it's the nature of chalkboard specials to change all the time, but at least I've got a lot of options. The breakfast here is served all day (bonus!) and is fabulous. My eggs were perfect, multigrain toast is an option (healthy!), and the corned beef hash is just as amazing here as it is at a greasy little short-order grill, except you're sitting at a table while you eat it. I'll be back to try the seafood. There were no less than 10 tasty-sounding options, but I had my heart set on breakfast, so I missed out.
