Not too far from 5 stars. I have enjoyed many evenings at sushi X. Despite other reviewers, I enjoy how small it is and the unique ambience. I think that all of the rolls I've tried have been great, always tastes fresh and doesn't smell. I think the prices are great and I love that it's BYOB. I would have to agree with another reviewer, that it is odd to encourage customers to go home. One Sunday night, we did not know that a happy hour existed, we were told to go home because we weren't going to make it for happy hour. We just wanted to eat so we had a drink at the tiny Matchbox bar near by and returned after things had died down.
