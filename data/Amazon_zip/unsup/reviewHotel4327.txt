The architecture in this place is amazing. I've stayed here a handful of times in the past few years (as a getaway). My most recent visit brought a few good surprises. 1. The valet/parking people have really upped their game. I have no desire to deal with parking when I'm in the loop and they just dropped their prices by more than $10 (I know right, in this economy?). 2. The food is phenomenal. 3. The staff inside the hotel are friendly Downsides: 1. Don't get a room too low to the ground, the view sucks 2. The front desk is more like a zoo than a service station. Although they do "care" they are very busy and unless you are Ghandi your personalized service is not going to be very personalized. 3. State street is home to some of Chicago's finest homeless community. If you venture more than a couple blocks south after dark you might get shanked.
