Really, really enjoyed Graham Elliott - a friend and I visited after visiting the stand at Lolla this year (great idea)! We shared the white tuna sashimi and the lobster corn dog - 5 stars for the sashimi - really fresh and just delicious - great complimentary flavors on the plate (plantain chips, passion fruit, etc). The lobster corn dog was good but not amazing - almost a bit too much on the 'corn' part of the corn dog - too short on the lobster. Tried the white fish for the entree and while it was great - was incredibly jealous of my friend's scallops - great flavor in that dish. For dessert, we shared the blackberry panna cotta - fresh and delicious - a huge plus that it wasn't a gut buster.  I would absolutely go back; especially since they update the menu items on a frequent basis. Great food with reliable and informed service - can't go wrong.
