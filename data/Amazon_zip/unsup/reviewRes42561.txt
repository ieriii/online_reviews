This is one of those places where the food kicks you in the mouth with flavor. Everything was amazing. I used to live down the street from Fogo2go, saw it on numerous Grub Hub benders, yes still never ordered. Got a Groupon for this place, and decided to try it out. Now to date, I believe I've ordered from them about 4 or 5 times now. The Chicken's amazing, you can taste the garlic flavor in anything garlic (knots, rice, mashed potatoes), and their pizzas are perfect. Back again to the chicken. Falls off the bone and is moist and delicious. You can't go wrong with this place.
