One of the best in Chicago. Downthread there is a one star review. You should ignore it as the reviewer was not at Sun Wah. He claimed he ordered a martini - no drinks served at Sun Wah just beer. I have a feeling he was at Wah Sun which is a completely different restaurant - not related in any way.
