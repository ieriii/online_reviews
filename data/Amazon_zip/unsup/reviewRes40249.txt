Most people will not agree with this but here we go. I really wanted to love this place, i had heard so many great things. Unfortunately, great things were no where to be found. By far the worst thing was the noise level. I know, I know you're thinking is he 99 years old? I cannot ever remember complaining about noise before. I could not hear anything my fiance was saying and when we looked around everyone was leaning into the middle of their table and yelling to attempt conversation. The food was really average at best. We got the pretzel which was 0% different from a movie pretzel. I had a couple of bites of the arugula salad which ok. My better half was disappointed with her choice of ricotta gnudi. As for my wild boar sloppy joe, i was so pumped to experience it and i walked away with my head down. I do want to say our server (Jared?) was extremely attentive and helpful. His service warranted the another star. ADDENDUM: within hours after i posted the original review the owner contacted me inquiring details about my experience. I was very impressed with this and only because of his efforts I am willing to try L&E again
