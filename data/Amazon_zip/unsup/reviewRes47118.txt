I liked the atmosphere until I looked up. Who paints a fan brown. I understand that they wanted the ceiling to recede, however I just have visions of paint flecks flying in to my hair and food out of the freshly painted duct work. The omelet had great ingredients but was a bit dry, the hot chocolate was luke warm, but the service was good and very friendly. The bar and the vodka will bring me back, the brunch will keep me at bay.
