You want great food at a low cost?...done! You want amazing service with a giant smile?...done!! Our server (Chris) was in his first week, that's right his first week and he was all over it. If he wasn't 100% sure, he didn't BS, he simply got the answer. My first experience couldn't have gone any better, from the first person to greet my friend and I (Raul), my server (Chris) , the manager (Diann) and the owner Alberto, these guys just want to do it right...and they have done it. The appi's were good, entrees were great and the BYOB service was awesome...the no cork fee and buckets of ice for the brews was a plus. You want to enjoy a no-fuss lunch or dinner, treat yourself to a great experience at the Logan Square 90 Miles...ask for Chris...he won't disappoint.
