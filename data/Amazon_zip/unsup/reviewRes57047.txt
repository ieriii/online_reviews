This is the BEST thin crust pizza in all of Chicago. My girlfriend and I saw it on Check Please and we thought we would give it a whirl. The service was fantastic and the pizza was so good! We also ordered the goat cheese appetizer. MMMMmmm...everything is so tasty. We were instantly addicted and have ordered pizza for delivery more than I would like to admit.  If you are looking for a great thin pizza in a city famous for deep dish, look no further!
