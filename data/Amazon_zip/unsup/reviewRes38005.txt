It can be aggravating to be indecisive and spend 20 minutes or so flipping through the endless beer lists trying to make a decision. go with something you've never tried-- hop leaf has dozens of beers you can only get in a few places in town, and some you can only get there. The bartenders know what's up, the servers sometimes know what''s up. I love the use of proper glassware and temperatures. I like my beer spontaneously fermented, and so often turn to the large spread they have-- I've been getting my coolship on with Girardin lately. naysayers say it tastes like vinegar. I am inclined to partially agree and I love it that way. prices might seem high, but the markups are not unreasonable-- they are selling amazing product. how much pleasure will you get out of a 20 dollar bottle of beer? lots--most likely. 2 big downsides for me: weak vegetarian selections of food (CB&J is excellent but is a RDA of fat) and nothing vegan, and long waits for tables (easliy an hour on a moderate night, up to hours and hours on weekends). worth it? maybe... but next time I'm going around the corner for a falaffel while I wait for a table at which I can have my beers.
