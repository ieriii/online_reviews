I believe this is the best deep dish I've had in Chicago. It's a tad on the pricey side, but damn this was good. We got a large pizza, half pineapple half pepperoni. Delivery took about 45-60 min, about average. Total was like $23 or something. The pizza was hella good! Wow, the slightly burnt crust and fired cheese? Indeed.
