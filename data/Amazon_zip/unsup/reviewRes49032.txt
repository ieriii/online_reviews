I went here thinking that it may be another overpriced, hyped up restaurant in Chicago and came out loving basically every item I ate. My fiance and I went with another couple, which is definitely the way to go because we were able to try more of the menu while maintaining a relatively inexpensive bill. The menu changes every day I guess so I don't know what will be there when I go again, but the ribs were the best I have ever eaten. In addition, we were placed in a stall so that we could have some privacy although sitting at the long tables would have been delightful! Finally, the beer list was extensive with some great labels.
