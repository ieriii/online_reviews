One of Chicago's worst.Food was mediocre. Worse, I ordered two beers that were both flat and tasted like soap. Reviewer before nailed it -- they try to create a line to make the place look cool. And the doorman is just an a-hole. As we were leaving -- he was screeching like a schoolgirl at the people in what appeared to be a very orderly line to "listen" to him -- or they weren't getting in. Leave this one to the tourists!
