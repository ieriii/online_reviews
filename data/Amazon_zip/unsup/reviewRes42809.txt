Had to try this before leaving Lakeview on Monday. The constant line of cop cars double parking to get their feedbag on made me think it has to be good. To forewarn I am a Napolese pizza fan so I only want Chicago style a few times a year. That being said I had a stuffed and a deep dish slice and a split a side salad & zucchini chips. The price is excellent and the zucchini chips were killer and the side salad was solid especially for the price. The pizza was good but since we got slices it is never as good as straight out of the oven. That being said it was quite good although I prefer the deep over the stuffed crust. I would go back for the taste, value, and the time. I just don't feel like waiting 35 mins to 1 hour for a whole pizza to be made for me. BYOB is great and will remember that if I am in the area for a reason in the future. As for ambiance not really any but clean, friendly, and fast service,
