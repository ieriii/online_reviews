Richest hot chocolate in the city. The food is incredible. The staff professional, there is nothing not to like. They serve food all day. Not open Sunday or Monday. It may be the best exotic breakfast in my neighborhood. I don't think there is any question it's fabulous if a bit out of mainstream for breakfast. The chorizo egg torte was perfect. It's the hot chocolate that I would come in for all the time. That and WiFi? I only wish it weren't so crowded. It would be my workplace! They serve Intelligentsia coffee with a variety of combinations using their chocolate. They grind their own cacao beans, add spices to make it rich, delectable and ever so decadent. Very sweet with cane juice sugar. Just one will satiate anyone's chocolate craving. Just stay away so I can go more frequently please. Thank you!
