Dear Violet Hour, I've lived in LA and have lots of experience going to overly pretentious places and waiting in line; but this is CHICAGO and lines are stupid, especially on a Wednesday. In LA, a group of hot girls would quickly be swept inside, but Violet Hour is so ass backwards that we were left to stand outside and wonder why we were bothering- and once we got inside, we found the place EMPTY. Clearly people already know this place sucks. I did it for my friend on her birthday, because that is where she wanted to go. But NEVER again. Its sad too because it is a nice space that would be fantastic if not pretentious, with odd overly priced bad tasting drinks. Can't I just get something normal that's worthy of my hr long wait and $20?? Yes I can.....somewhere else.
