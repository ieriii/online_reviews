My cousin was in town for work from NY and dragged me here after reading about a review online. That and he is a borderline metro-sexual. Anyway, WOW, this place is pretty damn cool. It's hard to get in on the weekends, however, because everyone in this bar has to be seated at a table or the bar.. no standing. There is long, thick, drapery and the whole place is lit my candlelight. We took a seat at the bar - our bartender was a pretty smooth guy. I can't recall what drinks I had, but I'm certain I had several and they were all magnificent! Needless to say since these drinks run an average of 150 proof, you'd imagine I was pretty lit when I left. Great place! There is no signage outside..just a yellow light.
