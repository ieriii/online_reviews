Boy, did I get a good buzz from that honey wine... But that's not all I tried my first time at an Ethiopian restaurant..ha-ha. That's also the reason I'm giving Demera 4 stars because I truly don't know what the best of the best is when it comes to traditional Ethiopain cusine. It was pretty damn good though... Did I care that I ate with my hands? nope. Was the service great? yes, indeed. Was the food delicious? uh-huh Perfect options for vegetarians, meat lovers, etc.. Mmm..and that honey wine..
