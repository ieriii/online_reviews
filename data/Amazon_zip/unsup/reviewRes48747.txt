Amazing food! I went here with 2 friends and ordered an assortment of food for sharing. I'd recommend doing this b/c it's all too good to go with just 1 entree. Short ribs are great, and chicken is too (I know, you're thinking why order chicken at a place like this...trust me, look around when you're there and see how many people order it. It's that good). Minus 1 star for the seating. It's common tables, so you'll be seated next to strangers. I mean, right next to them. Some people are okay with this, and I know it's the trend nowaday, but I still think it's kind of weird. It wouldn't keep me from going back though.
