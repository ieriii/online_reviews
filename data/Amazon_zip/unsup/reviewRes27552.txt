The first time we had Pequod's was after many hours spent at Webster's Wine Bar up the street. Granted, we were starving, but what came next was just silly good. Pan pizza with black olives, sausage, pepperoni, and fresh garlic. Pitcher of Blue Moon and the four of us were set. That was 2 years ago. I've ordered in advance to pick up to take back home to the W. Suburbs (try driving 50 miles in rush hour with THAT aroma in the car), brought visiting family here during a very crowded Friday or Saturday, dropped in after a Sox game, it's always been good. Make no mistake, I have not yet tried the thin crust, only the pan.  Don't go here expecting the original Pizzeria Uno / Ike Sewell / Rudy Malnati deep dish formula from 1943. You know, the Lou Malnati's formula (my 2nd place).  It's a variation, so I don't know if you can call it "deep dish" in the traditional sense, but "pan pizza" fits. The crust is thicker, there is slightly less cheese, and they don't use a manhole cover of sausage. And, luckily, there is no cornmeal in the crust. The sauce is sweeter, resembling sauce from Aurelio's or Chicago Dough Company from down in Richton Park.  The ingredients are always fresh, and the service is always fantastic. The manager is out there seating people, taking orders, bringing out pizza, checking in on you. If you go to Pequod's with an open mind and not expecting the traditional formula for deep dish, you will not be disappointed. It's simply a fun place.
