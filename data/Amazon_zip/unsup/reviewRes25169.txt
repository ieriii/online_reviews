A couple years ago, I would have rated this my absolute favorite restaurant in Chicago. Yet, it's popularity grew and it has slightly changed to cater to it's growing numbers. Not necessarily a bad thing, but they've taken out some of the best dishes that were offered on the menu. That said, the final product really is spectacular. It's highly inflated, the ingredients are of normal quality, but Chef Garces uses them in the most unique combinations and has developed some of the most outstanding dishes in the Chicago area. Don't skip on the sangria..... it's too good. Overall 4 stars. Fun atmosphere and experience (I love tapas), but very expensive.
