YUM! The GOOD There is outdoor seating Large wine list Lots of small/medium plates that are easy to share Food-we had the tuna prosciutto, fried BLT, pork shoulder, and shrimp and mussels....all of which was AMAZING. Probably my fav was the BLT...weird I know but it was pretty darn good. I thought the food was GREAT! Each dish had amazing flavor. We were not disappointed. The BAD No reservations Not seating until whole party there Very cramped space Communal seating....not really sure if I think this is good or bad.... The UGLY Service is meh... The server recommended two different wines to come back and tell us they were out of both. We also asked for recommendations, she said pork shoulder and beet salad....you see what we ordered above. When the BLT came, she was like....that is my favorite thing on the menu....WTF....why didnt you recommend it??? Waiting 20 mins for dessert....that was bread, marshmallow spread, nutella....not to hard to put together so why the wait???? We ordered espresso martinis for dessert also and they arrived in beer glasses....WTF again....so we were like where is the martini glass....they said they were out, however, we saw several dirty ones at the bar. We made them put it in a fresh glass. Overall, great potential....needs to work out some kinks. Great food! Its a pretty good scene also. It was jammed on a Thursday and a Monday nite
