Meli's is an awesome place for brunch! I discovered it with my mom a few years ago and have been bringing friends and family back ever since (who have also all fallen in love with it!). The food is amazing and the restaurant is clean and bright. The two negatives are the wait (it usually goes pretty quick, though) and the amount of tables in such a small space, but both of these negatives are totally worth it!
