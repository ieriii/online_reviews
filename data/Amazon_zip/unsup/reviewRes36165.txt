If you're looking for a great brunch spot with an expansive menu, Meli Cafe is the perfect choice. With seven different varieties of French toast, nine different servings of eggs Benedict and 14 types of omelets, it's impossible to not find something that will wet your whistle on their menu. Because it's a juice bar, Meli offers a wide selection of juice, coffee and smoothies as well. Craving a wheat grass tonic or beet juice? No problem. The caramel banana pancakes, with the bananas cooked right into the batter, were excellent and could probably feed a family of four. In fact, all of the portions were large, so no chance of leaving the restaurant hungry. The baby red potatoes were very well done, as was the vegetable omelet. Overall, the food was much better quality than what you find at most breakfast places in the city. If you're planning to go to Meli on the weekend, expect a fairly significant wait - thankfully, Meli provides you with a pager that allows you to leave the building and travel a short distance without missing your table, so you can easily fill the time. They may even offer you coffee while you wait.
