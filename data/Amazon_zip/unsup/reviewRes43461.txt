It's not a bad place to eat if you are in the area, but it is nothing special. The pizza isn't hot enough when you order the slices that come out a la carte. Also, 3.50 for a thin slice isn't a very good price. If you're really hungry, I feel that it would be hard to get full with a low budget. The meat in the pizza however, is delicious. Also, although there isn't enough of it, the marinara sauce has the homemade taste that we all look for in a pizza. Personal Recommendation: Art's Special.
