I decided to check 90 Miles out after seeing the reviews on yelp, and it didn't disappoint. -Friendly staff -If you like your food spicy, ask for some hot sauce -I enjoy sipping the lime water while waiting for my to-go order -The Ropa Vieja is flavorful, moist, great. (although I do enjoy it more when i dine in because the bread gets soggy on the drive home) - The Veggie is also surprisingly good.
