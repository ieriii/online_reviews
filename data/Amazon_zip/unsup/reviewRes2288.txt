A friend teased me for weeks, telling me that he would take me to Hot Doug's. We set a lunch date, invited some other people, and make the long journey out there from the loop during a work day. Needless to say, we took a 90 minute lunch, gorged on duck fries. I had the greek lamb dog and a green river. Yeah, it is a really bad combination, but I got excited and couldn't help myself.
