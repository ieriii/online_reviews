Came out here for dinner tonight with a good friend of mine, and I absolutely dig it. First off, let's take a look at the the menu shall we? It's HUGE. There's a TON of stuff, and a lot of stuff out here that will be REALLY impressive to order in front of your whiter-than-thou friends. We started with a couple of Sapporos and some Szechuan rabbit. Now, keep in mind, there's an actual warning ON the menu that the rabbit has bones in it, so I don't wanna hear anyone bitching about bones. RABBIT HAS BONES. If you're not willing to commit to nibbling and gnawing through tiny rabbit bones then you don't deserve the tender marinated goodness of the meat. Man up. On to the next. My friend ordered the triple-spice lamb, which was so good that it "baaaaaah-ed" while you ate it. I ordered the spicy pork intestine (cause I'm that guy!!) and it was incredible. Problem is, I was halfway through the dish when I discovered the delicious bed of cabbage beneath the offallic goodness. The crunch of the cabbage is the PERFECT compliment to the soft buttery goodness of the meat. And good lord, I want to be embalmed with their spicy sauce. I can't wait to come back here and try something new. I'll be hard pressed to try anywhere new until I try at least five new dishes here!
