I have come to adore Wilde. It has filled a need for a casual, yet classy, neighborhood gathering place for all of it's inhabitants. The service is usually spot-on, the food great, and the vibe is consistently positive. If you are lucky enough to snag a table in the front, the doors are usually open in the summer to the outside and the beautiful plants that hang from above. You cannot go wrong with the rosemary chicken or the meatloaf.  I tend to go here a couple times a month and am always quite satisfied. A great staple in lakeview!
