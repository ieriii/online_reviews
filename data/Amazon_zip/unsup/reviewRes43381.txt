THIS IS MAINLY A REVIEW ON MILK & HONEY'S CHOCOLATE CROISSANT! okay. i haven't dined in milk & honey and i've never ordered anything but a croissant. however, being a croissant connoisseure, i have to review the chocolate croissant here. it's definitely the best one i've had in chicago. the dark chocolate is perfectly melted yet chewy (since it's cooled after being melted) and the outside is crunchy and flakey while the inside is buttery soft. yay, milk & honey! however, i have had the almond croissant as well, and while it was very good, alliance (right down the street) makes a better almond croissant (and a decent chocolate croissant as well). i agree that the line out the door on weekends is tres annoying, esp. considering that we always go in just for the croissant... still, all of the brunchy food looks amazing. i eye it when i'm standing in line (in crowd, really) waiting to get to the register. honestly, the staff isn't super nice either. but the chocolate croissant... yes. the croissant gets 4 stars, but the overall experience is only 3.
