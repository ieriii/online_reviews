Dinner at Nana was one of the best dining experiences I've ever had (and I'm not an amateur). Starting with the warm welcome by Nana herself and impeccable service throughout, our entire party was thoroughly impressed with every aspect of the meal. The thoughfulness and creativity combined with the seasonal organic ingredients made for fresh, absolutely spectacular flavor combinations. On top of that, the presentation was impeccable.  Specifically outstanding were the quail entree and the peach/cherry/jabanero dessert with whisky ice cream. I will be telling many people about this place and coming back on a very regular basis.  Side note - although Bridgeport may seem like a trek, even coming from the north side during rush hour, it only took 20 minutes and there was plenty of parking directly in front.
