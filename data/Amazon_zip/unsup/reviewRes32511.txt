I don't get the Chicago Diner. I want to really like it and have returned a few times to give it a fair shake. But truth is, I've never been all that impressed with their food. It's the kind of place that makes vegetarians look bad---as if it's a lifestyle we've chosen just to torture ourselves with flavorless food. I'll keep going back because the restaurant isn't *horrible*, and I'd like to expand my vegetarian choices throughout the city. But I just don't see what the hype is about. Chicago Diner is mediocre at best. 2 stars from now. I'll edit this review later if they surprise me sometime down the line.
