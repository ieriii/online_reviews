I feel like I need to go back to Frontera a few times to really get a sense for the food, but when a full meal with a few margaritas can easily run $70 per person...and there are so many fantastic places to eat in Chicago...I'm not so inclined to make the effort. Everything I got the one time I visited was good, certainly, but hardly the revelatory experience so many people have claimed it to be. I've had much better at the old Ixcapuzalco location (although I've been told the new restaurant is pretty disappointing). If you don't want to deal with the wait, just show up on an off-night by the time the restaurant opens and it really shouldn't be much of a problem getting a table.
