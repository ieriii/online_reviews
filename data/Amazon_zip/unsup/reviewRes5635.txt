Purple Pig was good....I wavered between 3 and 4 stars but settled at 3 b/c while it was good, nothing blew my mind. This is what I had: - Salt Roasted Beets with Whipped Goat Cheese and Pistachio Vinagrette: yum. Good contrast of textures and flavors, and the goat cheese was not too goat cheesy, which I liked. - Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs: full discretion, this was my first time eating bone marrow, so don't have anything to compare it to. I was surprised by how bland it was, but I guess it's supposed to be b/c it was served with a little dish of sea salt on the side. The bread was yummy. Overall, pretty good. - Pork Saltimbocca: really good porky flavor. It was a little salty, but since I'm a salt fiend I didn't mind too much. I also noticed they have Fried Manchego (!) on the menu but I was eating alone (traveling for work) and was a little embarrassed to order a fourth dish. Plus I was stuffed already....but I've made a mental note to try that next time!
