These dawgs got it all! And the burgers and shakes are pretty super, too! Make sure to try your Whoopercheesie on dark rye with grilled and raw onions. Yum now, but later? Well, I'll never tell! This is a drive-in with carhop service and a walk-up order counter. Eat in your car or eat at the outside tables. And check out the Flaurie and Maurie, the winking hot dogs on the roof! What a hoot!
