I lived in the neighborhood until 3 weeks ago, went there on a regular basis until I asked myself, " why do I pay to be mistreated?" These people are truly the rudest I have encountered. They obviously don't like children, they dont like to answer questions about there food or menu. The food however, is good, and changes on a regular basis. There are two people their, that are very nice, one being the latino bus boy, and the other a young lady with long dark hair. But for them, I would be giving 1 star. In my opinion Janiks, down the street is a MUCH, better option.
