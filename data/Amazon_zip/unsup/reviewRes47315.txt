This is a great burger joint with some excellent choices for brew. i had the "warden" and to say it was good may possibly be an understatement, it was the best burger i had in a long time. my choice of beer was three floyds draft and was a great choice to scarf along my burger. the service was the icing on the cake for me, they treated me well and made me feel welcome.
