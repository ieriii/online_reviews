I've been to the Le Colonial in SF and NY but this one is so much better than those. I had this lemongrass Salmon which was one of the best dishes I've had in my life (seriously, I'm really picky - see my other reviews!). The drinks were great, food was awesome and service was friendly and courteous. I'd recommend it highly.
