Love Love Love this place. Went here for the first time with a group of 6 for brunch and we all had a great time! Firstly, our server Otha and others were so helpful. Our drinks were always filled and he checked on us all the time and they were all so friendly and nice. Probably the best service I received in a restaurant in Chicago. I seriously think that service is what separates the good from the greats, and Chicago Q was great. Our food was yummy. I had the kobe hash from their brunch menu and it was good. There was so much food that my hubby had to finish my plate. It was my BFF's bday and we got a surprise cheesecake for her with candle and Otha included some other pastries on the house. It was lovely. I definitely recommend Chicago Q. Great Food and Greatest Service :)
