Oh Sultans,  One of the best days of my life is realizing that you would send a nice guy on a bike to bring me falafel and lentil soup in the dead of winter. You are now my go to take out joint! The delivery is super speedy...you just need to get someone on the phone...which can be a little hard at times...but i dont care. When i come in i usually hit up the salad bar and stuff my face with dolmas...because i f'n LOVE dolmas. The guys behind the counter have given me countless recommendations and sometimes i'll just ask them to make some combo up for me...very nice... if i could change one thing it would be to have them accept credit cards...but that's it...
