I'll have to say this place got even better. In fact I think it might be one of my favorite restaurants in the Logan Square and Bucktown area. I went back and had the frog legs in buffalo wing sauce and they were ridiculously delicious. Then the family farm pork belly steak was unbelievably tender. The most tender I have ever had. I seriously could not tell if there was fat in it or not. Now what really made it better was my confusion on my order of the sweetbreads. I actually had no idea what it was, just assuming it was type of bread. When I got it though, I found out it was actually a part of a cow. It didn't taste bad, it was just bland even with the sauce on it. Anyway, the waiter asked my thoughts towards it, and when I got into my description above, he took it off the bill. I even said no to that, and apologized, hoping I didn't offend the chef. The waiter said that their goal at the restaurant is to make sure the customers are enjoying their food, even if they're not quite sure what they're ordering. I was just so surprised at how nice the guy was and the restaurant's consideration.
