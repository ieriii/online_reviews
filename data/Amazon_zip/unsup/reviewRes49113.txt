We loved this place for a lovely summer brunch! Fast, friendly, and efficient service; delicious food all around; outdoor seating was pleasant and quiet. The eggs benedict (with prosicutto) was wonderful, the omelette superb, and the sides of tremendously flavored bacon and crumble cake were as good as we've gotten in quite a while. We will be back again soon!
