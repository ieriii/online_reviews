I thought this place was alright. There were many ban chan dishes (side dishes). However, they were just okay....I would prefer quality over quantity anyday. I thought their BBQ burner was pretty cheezy. It is this portable concrete cylinder full of charcoals and then they put a grill on top of which the edges of the cylinder misses. By the way, there was not much surface area to grill with. The beef we had to grill with was alright. The marinade was nothing special actually. I am from LA so the Korean BBQ places in LA are just so much better than this place. I am sure that Chicago has better Korean BBQ places, but this one wasn't it. Yes, their parking lot is terrible and small. I had to concentrate on maneuvering a very tight space.
