Great place, rarely a wait, fairly easy to find parking, can be expensive if you order a shake, but do order a shake because they're better than "real" shakes. I love everything about this place except that I can never decide what to get because everything is soooo good. I've heard breakfast is mediocre, but I haven't tried it. The caesar portobella wrap is the bestest thing in the whole world.
