This place is sooo fun to go to on a date. Just know that it's totally possible that you won't feel like making out after eating a ton of fondue. And I wouldn't get crazy dressed up to come here as you will be cooking with hot oil. This place is like a cave with excellent dipping sauces and good tasting meat and seafood. Excellent cheese and chocolate fondue. We sat in a booth and felt closed off from things. I loved that and I will make sure I sit at a booth the next time I come here. I can see how not being in a booth could make Geya's less than wonderful. I think this is a perfect place for first time Fonduers.
