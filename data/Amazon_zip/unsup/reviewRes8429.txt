Take my word, every city I visit I sniff out the best pizza like a blood hound. I eat pizza, its what I do and Spacca has it going on.  Spacca Napoli & Pizzeria Bianco are both must do's. Spacca pizza is so good that it is my only must have pizza when I am in chicago. If you are lucky they might be serving the ever so elusive "black truffle oil" pizza.  Johnathan the owner is great. He takes great pride in his restaurant and you will find him mingling with the customers because he really cares. I always get the pizza my friend loved the seasonal soft shell crabs. Enjoy!!!
