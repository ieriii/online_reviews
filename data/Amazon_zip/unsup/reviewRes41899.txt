Pretty good food. I didn't have the Pho, which is probably their specialty, but my food was pretty great. I had to try it, as the place is always packed. Service was just okay though... I think my expectations were probably a little too high... Probably won't go again, there are other places in Uptown that have just as good food for a little less price.
