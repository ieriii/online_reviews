good hearty chitown pizza with a slightly interesting crust compared to the others. combo it up with some wings, beers, and a bulls game and you end up with a pretty satisfying experience even when the bulls lose. expect to wait at least 45 mins if you order deep dish and the draft selection is limited, but im not complaining. the best part is leftovers the next morning where the tomato sauce kindly soaks with the bread overnight. who doesnt like cold deep dish for breakfast?
