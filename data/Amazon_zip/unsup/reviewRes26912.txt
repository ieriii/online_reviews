Some of the best mexican food I've ever had. I had the guacamole, some of the creamiest, most flavorful ever. Even the chips that came with it were on a different level than most mexican restaurants. I also had the tuna tartar, which was perfectly seasoned; tangy, creamy, meaty, all at once. For my main, I had pork tacos, which were perfectly cooked, smoky, tender, tangy and delicious.
