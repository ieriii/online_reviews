This place does everything well, but nothing to me is memorable, not even the eggs benedict... Anyhow, they have a lot of positives, such as an extensive menu, large portions and nice sized interior, (although you are going to have to WAIT... on the weekends) but I prefer the creativity of bongo room where I can list off the top of my head various items that I crave that keep me going back. All in all, a solid addition to the south loop which is STARVING for places like this.
