I stopped in for lunch with my new employee, it was our first time there - and I didn't have any cash. I did not realize that until we had ordered our food and it was time to pay that no credit cards were accepted! They were so nice - without hesitating the woman behind the counter told me I could come back tomorrow to pay. I just had to bring my receipt. I was blown away. Feeling relieved I enjoyed my delicious lamb shawerma (I'll try the falafel next time) in their outdoor seating area. Tasty & quick, a fantastic alternative to other grab & go options!
