Best FALAFEL SANDWICH I've had in CHICAGO!!!!! I used to live in Hyde Park where there is a VERY LIMITED selection of restaurants to choose from, and now that I moved up north, the food here is WAY BETTER!!! Make sure you try their spicy falafel sandwich here it is the best! The Hubster loves it too!!!! We also had the kefta kabob dinner which my husband had 4 pieces and I only had 3 and more veggies but it was delicious anyways!!! Also they have AWESOME BAKLAVA!!!! One bite and you will melt away into baklava heaven! It was soo buttery, flakey and sweetful bliss!!!
