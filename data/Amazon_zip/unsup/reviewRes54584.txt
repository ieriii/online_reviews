If I could give negitive stars I would give this place -5 stars. Ok so Americans tend to prefer heavy, greasy food. That is what you get here. Im fairly sure that is that is why this place gets good reviews from other people, it fits with with the overall American taste for huge servings of high carb, high saturated fat, blobs of grease. This place is not an accurate representation of middle eastern food AT ALL. On another note the place was dark and not aestetically appealing.In conclusion, if you are into Mcdonalds type immitations of ethnic cuisine, similar to the Chinese greasey spoons, this is your spot. I personally think the food was absoluty terrible, I sampled and ordered several different dishes and was unsatisfied with every on of them.Terrible!
