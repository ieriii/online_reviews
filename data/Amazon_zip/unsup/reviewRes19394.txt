Wow. Bucktown. How you've changed. Wish Coast was there when I lived at McLean & Damen back in the '90's & early Aughts. Not that there was ANYTHING wrong with Nick's Chicken Pit (as we used to affectionately call it)! Awesome place, Coast. All food was fantastic and the sushi extremely fresh. The rolls have a rather playful quality to them...working with contrasts: crunchy-chewy, crisp-slippery, cool-warm, spicy-sweet. Flavors are bright, balanced & perfectly controlled.  The service was spot on. The ambiance is appropriate for a Bucktown sushi house (read sushi house decor with tragically hip, tragically monied clientelle).  We wound up there when a friend requested we take her for her birthday as she was craving the white dragon roll. Now I understand why. It's a must. Also be sure to request the now-off-the-menu popper roll. And if you're Family, pair it with the rainbow roll along side. (No snickers from those of Rainbow Nation. Oh, ok, go ahead. Snicker. The husband and I did. Our straight female company were clueless.) Not only are they visually stunning together, but they taste amazing. Wow...did that sound gay. Oh well, you get my meaning. The standbys such as spicy crunchy tuna hold up as well. Suffice to say, we made pigs of ourselves. Move over Rise!
