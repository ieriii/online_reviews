We met my in-laws here for dinner last night on a whim and it turned out to be a great idea. this is definitely a place for groups to get together and have a good time. If the thought of strolling musicians invading your personal space or a strange man pouring alcohol down your throat makes you uncomfortable, you may not enjoy it. The other reviews pretty much tell you everything, so I'm just going to stamp my 5 stars and get out of the way.
