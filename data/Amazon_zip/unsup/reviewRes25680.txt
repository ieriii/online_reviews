I absolutely love Restaurant Week in Chicago.  I went to Mercat with a few friends on 2/23/10 and was taken by surprise as I walked in because of the cute little lounge/bar area. The hostess was very pleasant and greeted me with a smile.  The coat check is in a very awkward location (out the exit door and in the lobby of the Blackstone Hotel) but I understand since the first level isn't really all that big. We had sooooo much food. I'm not a huge red meat or pork eater but I found myself digging in the tapas plates of my friends because everything looked and smelled so darn good. (And wow did it taste good). There was not one thing at Mercat I did not enjoy.  The waitress was so pleasant and smiled every time she came to the table.  The one thing to be very cautious of are the stairs.....maneuvering them can be a little tricky if you've had one too many pitchers of sangria.
