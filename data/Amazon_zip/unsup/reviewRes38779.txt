Went to the Hopleaf last night with the ever fashionable Terr R. Even at 6pm on a Saturday, this place was already crowded. We were seated quickly in a fairly small back room. Like many other places the tables are close together. The service was good and friendly but seemed a little disorganized. One of the sides came out before the meal. This place is a bar with a restaurant area and has an impressive beer selection including Belgian beers on tap that you will not see at other bars. The food was very good. The brisket sandwich was excellent and the duck Ruben was good. The duck was not overly greasy or gamey tasting. The mountain of french fries were fantastic. The leek latka was great but the German potato salad was just OK. The menu is small but everything looked good and everything we had had first class ingredients.The fact that they call french fries "Frites" and have sweetbreads on the menu is a clue that it's not cheap. There is a reason that his place is always packed.
