I may have met my meat match. I approximate that about 1.35 cows go into every La Pasadita carne asada burrito. That's a lot of cow for one burrito. I'm a girl who can certainly hold her own in any eating competition, but I found that one order of a carne asada burrito lasted for 3 meals. I might have moo'ed after that last bite. Stuffed with nothing but beef, onions, and cilantro, the burrito is a meaty sight to behold. And at $6.50 it's quite the bargain. This is definitely the place to go if you're looking for a cheap, filling meal, especially since one order can easily be split among two (hungry) people. Enjoy, and don't be surprised if you feel a "moo" escape your own lips after conquering this behemoth of a burrito.
