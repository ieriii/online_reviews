Hmm. Some of these recent reviews which are quite critical surprise me. Something that I've learned about Chicago Folk is that you all resent when a place gets a liquor license. They still let you BYOB, y'all? What's the deal? And the service is excellent .Very friendly, very quick, and so attententive. Our steak/chicken dishes were grilled to perfection, exactly as we specified. For $20, we each got a huge chunk of chicken, steak, plantains, yucca, and potatoes. Really, the price for the quality is excellent. On the night we went they also had live Columbian music. We enjoyed the music and were happy that it wasn't loud to the point that we couldn't hold a convo. It was the perfect volume. Anyway, we are going to make this place a regular joint of ours. If you want really cheap drinks you can go to any number of burger/PBR joint on Southpoint Corridor with the remains of your university class. I'd rather pay $2 extra for a correctly made cocktail!
