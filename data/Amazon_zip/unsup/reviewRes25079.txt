Artopolis is the place that I always have to drive my mom to to get Mango Mousse Cake because she is addicted to the stuff. It is however, very good, along with the Berry Mousse Cake. These mousse cakes are so light and fresh and they are a great dessert to have during the summer while sitting by the open doors at Artopolis, watching the traffic on Halsted. That is, I assume. I assume this because I have never actually dined in at Artopolis. Yes for years I have been getting takeout and eating it at work. Therefore, there's not much I can say about the whole dinning experience, but I can speak for the food. My favorite at Artopolis are the artopitas. I am a HUGE fan of the artopitas! Conveniently named after it's mother restaurant, they are scrumptious flaky puffs filled with savory ingredients. For example, my favorite artopita is the manitaropita. It's filled with portobella mushrooms, onion and emmenthal cheese. YUM!! And it comes with a generous side of either potato salad and pasta salad. The potato salad here is outrageous. It's perfectly creamy and simple. It's not jam packed with a bunch of nonsense, if you know what I mean. Definitely one of the best; I'm not sure what it is. I've tried to imitate this many times and it never works. Oh well. I believe Artopolis is a great place to meet friends and enjoy lovely light(er) Greek food. The place is bright and fresh and the bread is delicious. I will make an effort to actually dine in and hence, give a more accurate review. For not, rock on, Artopolis!
