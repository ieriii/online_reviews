Geja's is about the experience. If you read the reviews they are very polarized, so it depends on what the standard you hold it to. I really enjoyed Geja's because it was timeless - it better be because the wait can be long and the meal is to be enjoyed slowly / casually. That tends to either endear or repel people. The food is OK, the sauces are fun, but again, it's less about the food and more about talking and relaxing over a meal. The alcoves and lack of a dining room type area make for a very romantic setting. Start with a cheese fondue with your wine, select an entree meat (beef, chicken or seafood) with many different sauces to dip and sample, and conclude with a flaming chocolate fondue to roast a marshmallow or dip pound cake or strawberries into. Add a coffee or cappucino and you need a wheelbarrow to wheel you back to your car. The entire experience may be three hours so you need to be with someone you enjoy being with and can hold a conversation with. If you plan on looking at your iPhone the entire time, or have somewhere else to be then you need to go elsewhere. This place has that European or Asian feel of timelessness.
