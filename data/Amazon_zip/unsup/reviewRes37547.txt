So we were here on NYE, but left prior to midnight. I have heard great things about the food selection here, but we didn't opt for that. We came here solely to get our drink on. And we were also upstairs the whole time, which although crowded, I never really had to wait to get a drink. Please note the upstairs bar is cash only. Just sayin. Also, for alot of the top shelf liquor, you need to go downstairs (eg. Patron). Anyway, I give the beer list two thumbs up. If I could wiggle my toes awkwardly, it'd be four thumbs up. I was so happy to see hoegaarden on their beer list, as well as founder's dirty bastard. Not only am I terribly partial to belgians, but I'm from grand rapids originally. It was like a two for one of beer excitement. They also have DT if you're looking to get shwasted on someone else's tab. On a side note, I'd suggest they try and add something from Surly to their list (surly furious, maybe?), just to increase the awesome quotient. The upstairs bartender was great too, he was quick, friendly, and witty. And he put up with the big group I was in with no problems. And they let one of our friends nap for thirty minutes without getting booted. He was rallying, ok? Started early. Gosh. Anyway, we were able to snag a corner bench and table, which was great for us, but I did feel terribly sorry for the folks that got the tiny table located in the doorway to the womens bathroom. Yeah, theres no sort of awkward quite like that.
