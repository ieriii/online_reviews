My friend and I were hungry on a Monday night. We just finished work and decided to eat at a place where I have never been before. Considering we have visited many LEYE restaurants... why not try the very first? So we parked on Stockton and walked less than a block west. I'm use to the nice looking restaurants. Since this is the first... it looks very vintage and it's not bad at all. Table cloths with glazed wooden chairs and benches; it's a very homey environment. Portraits all over the walls of the Grunt Chicks? Greeted by a pleasant hostess and server. Menus with comic strips and humor. I unfortunately ate two whoppers before I came.... what a drag.. So i ordered their chili and hot buffalo wings. Chili is pretty good, but I'm use to more beef chunks as oppose to equal distribution of meat in each spoon. The chili tasted pretty good. The wings were pretty standard; just fried wings with dipping sauce. Chocolate milk shake was very good. My friend ordered a burger.. and I thought of stealing it because he said the burger was real good and I was salivating how good the burger looked. I also salivated how good the salad bar looked. It looks small, but there are a lot of pretty good options. Typical salad bars will have unripe cantaloupe, honeydew, and watermelon; this is the total opposite. Everything looked fresh and good. But I only "Seen." I want to go back to get a salad, get a burger, and drink soup when it's below 0 degrees!!
