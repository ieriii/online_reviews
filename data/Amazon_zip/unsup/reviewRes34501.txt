went here for the first time last night with co-workers. grabbed a 12-pack of beer and grabbed a seat. had some hummus and meat pies for apps. the warm meat pies were excellent. had the lamb shwarma dinner which i thought was very good. i liked the meat pie so much that i ordered one with my dinner. forgot to have it warmed up--- ick -- note to self: cold meat pie = suck. the fact that they don't take credit cards is really annoying. so much so that i had to knock them down a star for that Update= me and a co-worker got sick off the chicken shwarma. bumped down to 1 star
