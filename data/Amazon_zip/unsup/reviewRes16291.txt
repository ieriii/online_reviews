Every ounce of my being wanted to LOVE Violet Hour. I wanted to fall in love with it, become a regular, and boast to all of my friends about how I was always frequenting this exclusive Chicago night spot. Sadly, however, I think I'm with all of the people who find this place to be overrated. After a 2 hour wait (we gave our name to door guy and went to Big Star and Blue Line before being called on one of our cell phones) our group of 7 was seated at our table by the hostess. Our waitress was attentive, knowledgeable, and friendly. She brought a large bottle of water and left it on the table for us to fill at our leisure, which I loved. Drinks came quickly and I was pleased to see that whatever didn't fit in the glasses was given to use in our own little personal carafes. I was disappointed, however, at the lack of vodka drinks on their specialty menu. I pretty much only drink vodka, and I feel like it is the easiest liquor to mix with, and yet they only had 3-4 choices. They had nearly twice that when it came to tequila and whiskey. I went with a rum drink (Hush and Wonder), and had I been a rum drinker I would have loved it. It was good, but I could have lived without it - especially at the $12 price tag. So, in summary - great atmosphere (though I expected something much different), love the house rules, hate the long wait, and probably won't pay for a $12 cocktail again...unless the aforementioned asshole from my Webster Wine Bar review decides to take me out for a second date. In that case, I'll order two. One to drink and one to toss in his face.
