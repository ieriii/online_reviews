Great food, the best bratwurst I have ever had. Its a very popular place though so don't be suprised to find a line. On saturdays the line is literally around the block. The owner makes the place what it is, he takes the orders and being super friendly talks up every customer. Makes you feel v welcome. There is nothing special about the restaurant, simple decor, tables and chairs. But the food (all kinds of sausages u can eat!) is worth every bite
