Having wanted to see this place for a while, I was super excited when we came here a few nights ago for my friend's birthday dinner. The decor inside is super festive, totally living up to the name Carnivale. However, that is pretty much where the festivities end.  FYI they will not seat your party until the whole party is there, which is understandable. There is a huge bar and lounge in the waiting area which makes for a good time while waiting for stragglers. I ordered a raspberry mojito, which was not too bad. Once our party arrived we were seated at a huge table towards the back of the main dining room. It was nice not to be crammed into a tight spot, but the boardroom-like table was so huge and the room was a bit loud that it made for difficulty holding conversation across the table. The service was not the greatest - our server stood at one end of the table while she seemingly whispered the specials, and didn't seem to care if the other end didn't hear her. They have 5 kinds of ceviche, 3 of which I tasted and found pretty good. For my entree I had the ahi tuna - the server recommended to me to have it seared rare, which I agreed to, but the tuna came back almost cooked through. In general the food was decent, but the flavors and presentation were not as spectacular as one would expect, especially for the prices you are paying. Overall it was a fun night, complete with pictures of us with cool, colorful backgrounds to post on Facebook and remember the night by.
