I've been here countless times - for various reasons. One was even a last minute V Day date location. Their late hours make it convenient as do their varied menu and low prices. Portions are sizable and can easily by shared with a dinner companion. they are child friendly. Their pancakes are, for the most part, so delicious. Twice, however, one pancake in the stack was NOT thoroughly cooked. Please let them know as they welcome feedback! Their bread is amazing. Oh, don't let me forget the BEST chicken appetizer roles with hot sauce. They are wonderful! ok, enough about this place - just go eat there already!
