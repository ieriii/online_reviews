Had to see what all the hoopla was about. I was very pleased with the lechon sandwich (though I wasn't a big fan of the plantain served inside, but just took it out and ate separately) and the medianoche (which I split with my dining companion). Also had the chorizo empanada which was very good. Went there for lunch during the week and there was really not much of a wait. It was a nice day and we got to sit outside. Still trying to figure out where people sit when it is cold. There is almost no room inside, so I am a little hesitant to go there for a dinner. I will definitely go back and give it another shot. It will be a grat spot for lunch once the weather finally turns.
