I drive by Art of Pizza often, and vaguely remembered a recommendation from a friend, so I decided to stop in. Parking was a bit of a hassle (the tiny lot was packed), but I found street parking on the adjacent block.  I prefer my pizzas without toppings (plain cheese, or maybe cheese and spinach) and I appreciate the fact that there are always a stuffed or deep-dish cheese slices available.  This is a perfect place to stop in for lunch - the prices are very low for the pizza-by-the-slice.  The pizza is fabulous - the sauce is rich and flavorful and the crust is perfection. Their salads are always fresh, with crisp, delicious veggies.  The service is fast and the staff are pleasant.  Needless to say (I think...) deep dish/stuffed pizzas take a long time to cook. You can certainly call ahead, but there is no way around the wait (unless you want to eat the prepared slices).
