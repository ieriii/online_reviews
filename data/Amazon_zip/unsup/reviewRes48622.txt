Very enjoyable restaurant. The seafood is fresh and the pork is impeccable. The staff is very attentive and pleasant. The atmosphere is great with good music and a steady crowd. I've gone with my girlfriend as well as with a group of guys from work. It fits any occasion and any time. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys seafood, pork, a great drinks list and a great evening.
