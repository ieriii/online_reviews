I'm not the first to write a review on Hot Dougs and I definitely will not be the last but this place makes a mean dog. I went with a friend to check it out and he thought it would be a good idea to share food. I am not normally into sharing even with my girlfriend but I am glad we decided to share.  We got the duck fat french fries along with four hot dogs. My favorite dog we tried was the buffalo dog. The meat was fantastic and every bite was delicious. Next, we moved to the Foie Gras dog. I enjoyed it but would actually prefer it for desert. The next two dogs were not worth discussing becasue the first two were so spectacular.  The bottom line is that Hot Dougs changed the way I look at hot dogs. This man Doug is truly a meat visionary. It is worth the wait.
