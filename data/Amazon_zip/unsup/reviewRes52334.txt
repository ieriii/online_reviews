This was my 2nd experience with chicago deep dish pizza. (read my lou malnati's review for my 1st experience). I actually got my first taste of this pizza at a wedding! The bride and groom served it at the end of the reception (thanks guys). This pizza was totally the opposite of the lou malnati's pizza that I tasted. The toppings were pepperoni and sausage. The texture of the pizza and crust was softer and easier to cut/bite into than the Lou Malnati's pizza. My reviewed might be a little skewed since I was eating this after a night of open bar wedding drinks. The sauce was OK. Overall I enjoyed this pizza. Would I go out of my way to get it? Nope!
