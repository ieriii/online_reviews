Went to Carnivale tonight for the second time, and it was just as good as the first. Whenever I go here I feel like I should be way cooler than I am, because the decor kind of transports you to a strange other world (yes,in the reception area hangs a picture of Gisele Bundchen posing as the Virgin Mary). The food is incredible. I've tried 3 ceviches and never had a bad one - their tuna is perfection, especially when topped with jalapeno and avocado. Such a clean flavor. The arepa appetizer is also really good if you're okay with something a bit heavier - love that polenta cake wrapper. For the entree, the churrascuro really can't be beat. We were also lucky enough to visit on a night when braised pork shoulder was the special, and it was seriously melt-in-your-mouth delicious (although, the homemade savory sausage on the side was not my favorite). For dessert, you can't go wrong with churros, especially dipped in rich, warm chocolate sauce and dulce de leche. Drinks: go for the caipirinha(s), and you will feel right at home.  Final note: $5 valet. You can't beat it.
