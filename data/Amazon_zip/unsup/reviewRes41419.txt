This is a another go to restaurant for me. I usually order the Pho Tai with extra beansprouts or the Bun. It depends on my mood and the weather outside.  The one time I ordered a chicken noodle soup dish (can't remember the name), it was too bland and by the time I reached the halfway point I found a hair in my soup. I was disturbed for a short period of time and it took me about 4 months to come back. I just had to come back for the 2 dishes that I order. This place is always busy. Service is not their forte, however they are fast if you have someone who speaks english fluently. The decor is minimal and not exactly a date place.
