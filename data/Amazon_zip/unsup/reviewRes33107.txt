My husband has been yearning to take me here because he is Romanian. He says his mom's cooking is better but its still darn good :) Anyways we found out they were taking part in Yelp Eats (50% selected items) so it was perfect timing. Unfortunately, we got there and the servers didn't know about Yelp Eats (maybe it was a language barrier). Finally, the owner, Branko, came to the rescue and took our orders and it went perfect from them. I got the sangria made with Romanian wine...ahhh it was soooo good. I wanted to take a jug home. For appetizers, I got the mititie and he got the polenta which we both loved. For entree, we both got the pork schnitzel with spaetzle (best part of the entree). We were too full to order dessert but I'm sure it should be good too. Definitely recommended :)
