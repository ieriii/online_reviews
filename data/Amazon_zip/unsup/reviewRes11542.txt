Delicious food! The BLT eggs Benedict was "the best in Chicago," according to my sister and husband. I ordered a veggie skillet (not on the menu), and they were very accommodating. After reading the reviews, we ordered one of each: red velvet pancake, pretzel crusted pancake, and brioche French toast. Each of us had a favorite. My favorite was the pretzel crusted! The others were too sweet. And... The bloody Mary and blackberry mimosas were perfect. We can't wait to go back!
