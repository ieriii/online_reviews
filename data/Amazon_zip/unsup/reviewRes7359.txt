Just writing a review of Sapori Trattoria makes my mouth water! I'm a sucker for their gnocchi. It's nearly impossible not to finish it all while there for dinner... it's just THAT good! I remember several years ago while I was visiting Chicago, I asked the hotel concierge where I could find the best Italian food in Chicago. He told the cabbie to take me here. Now that I live around the corner and we've taken so many of our out of town guests there, we get coupons from the restaurant all the time! It's great!  The only knock I have against this place is the wine. I haven't had any wine there that I've been a huge fan of, but for the most part the wines do what they need to do - get you feeling good and laughing amongst a group of friends. Stay away from the organic wine they have though if you don't like lite red wines. I thought it tasted like watered-down red wine. Ick!
