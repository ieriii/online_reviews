I'm suprised by the harsh reviews. It's certainly not a fancy hotel, but it's relatively cheap and centrally located. If you're visiting Chicago for the first time and on a tight budget, I think it's a great place to stay. It's close to mass transit, walking distance from a variety of musems and bars, and pretty safe. For blues lovers, Buddy Guy's bar is a block away.
