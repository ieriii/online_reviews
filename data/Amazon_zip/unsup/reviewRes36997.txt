Never again. - We were told, on a night where the bar area was not packed, that it would be a 30 minute wait for a table indoors. After 45 minutes we checked in with the hostess and she said "I couldn't find you so I gave your table away. We can seat you on the patio." - Super windy on the patio, so there was no light because the candle kept getting blown out. - Usually after you get your food, someone comes by to ask how things are or if you want another drink. If someone had done that, maybe I could have told you my meal was awful before my dinner companion finished his entire entree. It was, without a doubt, the WORST steak I had ever eaten. Maybe I could have seen it was all fat when it was placed before me if I could have seen anything on my table. - After the plates were cleared, the waitress FINALLy came over and had the nerve to say "so I bet you have room for dessert now." It's really a shame. They have lots of good beer. They are a short walk from my house. But I will NEVER go here again and will tell how awful we were treated and how terrible the service and meal was to anyone and everyone who will listen.
