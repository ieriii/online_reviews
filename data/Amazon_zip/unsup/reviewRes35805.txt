I went to Shaw's as a fellow coworker who is a server there. I have to admit, I am recently revisiting all seafood I hated as a kid. You know the stuff that makes you never want to eat a piece of fish ever again because it was so slimy and had the rotting smell to it. Anyways, this was actually my second time at Shaw's and it was just as superb as the first. We all ordered a whole bunch of things that we split. So of them items we ordered was the calamari, the 1/2 dozen oyster sampler with one of each oyster they had that evening, clams casino, The Grilled Yellow fin Tuna (we asked for seared), Nantucket Cape Scallops, and King Crab Legs. For dessert, We had the Key Lime Pie, Chocolate Cake, Creme Brulee and the Carrot Cake.As a novice seafood expert, I have to say everything was excellent. The scallops were a seasonal item but were small and sweet and very fresh, very different from the small scallops I have had at other restaurant that were slimy. The Crab legs were superb as well as the Tuna. The tuna comes on a bed of these crunchy Asian noodles that are to die for. The desserts were superb, very classic and no frills. I liked the Key Lime Pie the best but I am a huge sucker for it. The other three were excellent as well. I would definitely come back and further my adventurous side and continue to try more items on their menu.
