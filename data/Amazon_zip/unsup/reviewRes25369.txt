incredibly delicious and unique tapas-style menu. had a nice dinner here when i was in town for business, and every plate that was ordered was DEVOURED. unfortunately, i do not recall the name of each dish i ordered. started with an incredible cheese plate, had a super unique salad, a fish dish, and some potatoes/sausage. definitely save room for dessert if you can - the homemade ice cream was out of this world good.  as some other reviewers mentioned, the food actually comes out VERY quickly. we ordered a few rounds of tapas after our cheese plate, and most of them came out nearly immediately. i suppose, better the food come out fast, then very slow. the presentation of each dish was nothing short of beautiful. come to mercat just to see how beautifully the dishes come out. and trust me, everything will taste good too.
