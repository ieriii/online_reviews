This restaurant is a vegetarian's nightmare and a carnivore's dream. One thing to note when coming here is that you need to be prepared. Mentally and physically. Be prepared to be teased with a vast amount of roasted meats (pork, beef, chicken, sausage, etc) and salad bar items. Their offerings will play mind games on you as you immediately start feasting with your eyes.  Physically, you'll need to pace yourself so that you can savor each delectable bite and enjoy all the things they offer. If you gorge yourself and surrender to your hunger pangs right away, you'll be sorry. Besides, part of the experience in eating at Fogo is taking in the pomp and circumstance of the gaucho chefs who walk with their swords of meat. Enjoy this restaurant if you visit and the best value is going during lunch!
