I have been a big fan of this restaurants for about 15 years. They have the best appetizers. The tiger cry is by far my all time favorite. I have not had anything like it at any other thai reataurant. Also the crab ragoons and fresh spring rolls are great! The basil chicken and shrimp fried rice is "delicous" .Go for the food and not the service. In the years I have been going there the service has not improved. So be patient. It's worth the wait! I give it fours stars only because of the service.
