I adore this place! A great place to meet a friend for a drink, have a romantic date or to start an evening out. From the super-sexy decor to the creative drinks the entire experience is top notch. I love the prohibition-era feel to everything, especially the outside having no sign - only a yellow light. The first time I went there I literally walked by it a few times before realizing that it was right in front of me! The staff is extremely knowledgeable and fun to talk to. The only negative thing is that the drink prices are a bit steep, and often you have to wait in line to get in these days. Overall, it's one of my favorite places to get a cocktail in the city!
