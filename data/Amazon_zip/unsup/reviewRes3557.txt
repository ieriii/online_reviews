Americanized Korean food.... I totally should have thought of this... I've been here twice thus far, and i can't really give it more than 3 stars honestly. It's great that there is a place where I can get some decent Korean food just a few blocks away from home, but it just didn't live up to the hype.  First time I went, I got the funke chicken meal (Crisp BBQ flavor and the other flavor ... forget what its called). Crisp BBQ is a must try if you're here, it's what this place is known for.  Second time I went, I got the Big Boy Buddha bowl (aka: Bibimbap). It was pretty good, nothing special, but hey it fulfilled my korean craving... As with anything Korean, you gotta have some occasional Korean in your life.  I must say it's nice to have Korean BBQ outside of the karoake (norebang) setting. And I have yet to go to a karoake place since I've moved up here to Chicago last year - I must say I am rather proud of myself. I personally got so sick of Karoake in Austin/Dallas, but unfortunately there was no other alcohol distribution center past 2am so often I found it no choice but to stumble into a Karoake bar and drink bottles of overpriced Soju and Miller light buckets while singing/rapping to great 90s hits such as: Wonderwall by Oasis, Life Goes on by Tupac, Drive by Incubus, Backstreet Boys, N Sync, Britney Spears, Mariah Carey, Barbie Girl by Aqua (I was totally kidding ... about the Tupac/Incubus/Oasis ;) ).  Anyways I digress. Back to Contemporary Korean. Interesting concept - They pulled it off okay. If you ever crave something delicious and Korean, Crisp will likely satisfy your urges.
