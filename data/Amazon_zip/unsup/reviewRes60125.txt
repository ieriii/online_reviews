I have visited this restaurant twice now. This is not counting the bajillion times I drove past and it was very crowded. But to me, this is a good sign. I just have to stick it out. Here's what I have tried: Banh Mai: the BBQ pork kind. More robust than Ba Lei across the street. A great lunch sandwich.Chicken Pho: My sis and I also split this, the one with the wontons and mushrooms. The wontons were surprisingly spicy and it was a bit hard to eat. BUT: it was delicious. Lots of fresh mint and cilantro and whatnot on the side.The 177 (Self-made beef rolls): Shared with a friend. A comfortable lunch for two. My favorite so far.Overall, here's what I thinkPROSGreat portionsLots of choicesFRESH!Reasonable wait time on foodCONSVERY busy - avoid on weekends. Expect a line most nights.Service is mediocreLots of choices (not exactly clear to the Americans...not that this is bad, but just a warning...)
