Creative and delicious, consistently, over 9 (or so) courses, Schwa is one of a kind. I'd have expected "no frills" as far as service goes, but from filtering/decanting one of our wines to making sure our glasses were always full through the 3 bottles the 2 of us consumed during the evening (yikes), checking in on us constantly, and generally just being cool and jovial, service is stellar and enjoyable. This is no Tru, there will not be half a dozen staff making sure you are enjoying your time in the bathroom, or wiping your face with a towel made of gold bars, but you get constant attention, and they seem to be interested in your input (ours was "um that was great." over and over again, but whatever.) The food is SOLID. The portions are perfect (usually 1-3 bites, and sometimes you will be given stern instructions), and while there seems to be a theme as you progress, they are all totally unique, nothing duplicated or recycled, even with the "all fish, no meat" request. Even through the wine haze, I'm recalling courses, and wondering if they'll accept a standing reservation?
