I went there with my wife on Friday night. First off, the service was great. Very nice and attentive. The food was good, but not great. The menu is a lot smaller than the one online, but I think that is because they are obviously new. My burger was great--huge portions. My wife had a salad, which was just OK. Good beer list though. My issue with the place was that the music was deafening. I like loud music and go to a lot of concerts (at the Bottle!), but this was a bit too loud. There was no way to have a conversation. I heard that the sound system is state of the art, which is great, but that might be cranked up after 9pm or so. We went at 7pm and it was loud. I am not sure what is up with the rainbow lights, it was a bit cheesy. Overall, I will try it again particularly because it is very close to my house. I hope to see this place evolve because it is sorely needed on Western Ave.
