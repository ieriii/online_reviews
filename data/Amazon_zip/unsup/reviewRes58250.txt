SO this review was removed but here it is again . THIS IS A TRUE STORY!!!BAD MANAGEMENT! read onOk So I tried out the purple pig due to recommendations from friends . I had read mixed reviews on yelp but we thought we'd give it a shot . I never made it to a table ! I went in with a group of friends . We were told the wait was going to be about 45 minutes which is understandable in a place that doesn't take reservations . I'Ve waited two hours to eat at Frontera and it was amazing , so needless to say the wait doesn't bother me if the food is good. The problem here is that I never was able to try the food because I would not support this place after the conversation I had with the manger . First off he was rude . He just came off as curt and seemed disinterested in helping a group of young women. He instead kept ushering in big guys in suits . He told me that whose people were VIPs and they get first seating . I asked why all customers weren't considered VIP's and he laughed with this little chuckle and actually said to me Lady , we can all only hope to have the money these guys have someday , so until you do these gentlemen are VIPs and they go first , if you don't like that you can leave.WHAT!?! I immediately asked his name and he said he was busy . We stormed out of the place but on the way out I asked a server what his name was and I was told his name was John . Well John you can have your VIPs and all their money . I will never be back .
