Went here because a friend received a gift certificate and we thought we would try it. Very expensive for what it is, but thought it would be good. Their ceviches were not really ceviches and were not very good. Their guacamole was average and the entree we got was pretty much an appetizer portion for almost $30. Between the average sangria and the less than average food, it was a joke the bill was so high. We would never return and we would never recommend this place. What a waste of $125! I hardly ever take the time to review any place and tonight was so disappointing I felt compelled to write a review.
