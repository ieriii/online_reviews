Not much to say about Irazu that hasn't already been said. Their food and shakes are awesome. The atmosphere is totally urban. And the dudes running it are really cool. If you have never been here before and are trying it for the first time be sure to get an oatmeal shake. It might sound weird at first - but it tastes great!Make sure to have cash - they do not take cards.
