Great place for a casual brunch/lunch. I only had lunch there once so I can't comment on the dinner vibe at Grand Lux. I had the Grand Lux Omelette and it was delicious. Big portion so make sure you come hungry. Service was good and seating was comfy. Definitely a good choice for small gatherings or family meals.
