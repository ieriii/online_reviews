the granola is amazing, even out of the restaurant. the granola in the place, served with fruit and yogurt, is quite solid too. sure, the place is packed for breakfast but what do you want? it's delicious and a small restaurant so they handle it the best they can. if you don't want a wait, get up early! otherwise just wait your 10 minutes and enjoy a little friendly conversation, or get on the list and check out renegade handmade next door.
