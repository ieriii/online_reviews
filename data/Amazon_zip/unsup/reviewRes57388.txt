This was my first time coming to Coast and I was really excited to try it! I am not a big sushi fanatic but I definitely enjoy the specialty rolls.My friend and I didn't bring any wine but we definitely would for our next trip to Coast.We both started off with the Spicy Miso soup- it was delicious! Served in heavy mug and topped off with slices of jalapenos! For sushi we order the King Crab and White Dragon.I really like the White Dragon as it was extremely flavorful. I would go with the White Dragon again and maybe try something else next time instead of the King Crab-another it was very good as well.For dessert my friend got the lychee sorbet and I got two little mochis- the white chocolate raspberry one was awesome!! Over all Coast is very intimate and a great date place an very well priced. In light of the recent blizzard we took advantage of the $10 valet.
