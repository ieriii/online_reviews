As soon as we arrived in Chicago we headed here for lunch...and thankfully beat the rush! Little did we know (being from out of town) how popular and busy this place is! The food was OUTSTANDING! Interesting, super fresh, small plate style dishes make this place great for a date or group. Don't miss the Sicilian Iris for dessert which is simply delicious!
