I liked it enough, and it's located in sort of a food-oasis, which I'm sure helps them a lot. I took two sandwiches, to-go (brother I and I split everything): the cubano (delicious), the pollo (eh...not much you can do with a grilled chicken sandwich, but this was uber-bland) and two empanadas (one veggie, one beef, both were bland and kinda soggy). I'd like to try the Medianoche and Bistec sandwiches, then I'll get back to ya. Do NOT come here expecting sit-down, or even real tables (except outside, but with this being Chicago, usable about 30% of the time--inside they only barstool seats along a wall with tiny countertops). It's in a cutely refurbished (unrecognizable from the dump it was previoiusly) hot dog stand. On the other hand, don't expect fast-food prices ($20-ish for two average-sized sandwiches and the two empanadas, no drinks), speed (I probably waited 15 minutes for my to-go order), or (Cuban sandwiches being what they are--thin bread, not a ton of meat and pressed like a panini) to leave stuffed. I'd go again, I guess, but it wasn't love, I don't quite get the hype. I will try other menu items, and possibly their Logan/Humboldt location (Armitage a little west of Milwaukee), which is a bit more spacious, has tables and is way closer to home.
