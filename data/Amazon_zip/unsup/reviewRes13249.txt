The decor was nice, slightly sparse, slightly industrial and rough inside. The layout was really nice though, still allowing you some privacy when it gets crowded.  The staff are super knowledgeable and helpful when it comes to both the beer and food menus, and both the beer and the food were awesome! I had the Corned Beef Ruben with a Coup d'etat farmhouse saison. Amazing. Also tried the pretzle with mustard/cheese sauce. Definitely keep the mustard/cheese sauce to dip your fries in later....
