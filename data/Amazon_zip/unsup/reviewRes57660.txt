I like this place a lot. It tastes better than most places I tried. However, i do not like the fact that they cook everything in pig fat. You can especially taste this in the beans and other oily items. My recommendation to the owners is PLEASE STOP DOING THIS as people like myself who do not eat pork, do not want the fat in my food!
