If I lived anywhere near this place you better bet it would be on my regular rotation - cheap, delicious and plentiful - that's my kind of meal! What I had was a half portion of what's normally served for under $4... a falafel sandwich stuffed to the brim with goodies! I'm always impressed when I get decent middle-eastern food for a reasonable price, it seems like it's trendy here at home, giving most places free license to charge an arm and a leg. I loved hearing our guide's story of the history of the market - a classic story of supply and demand... The proprieter made some slammin hummus one day and the people who lived in the area just couldn't get enough, fast forward a bunch of years and it's a fast, full-service restaurant serving all of your favorite Middle eastern food quickly and cheaply... Ok, i'm sure I left out a bunch of details and perhaps remembered the whole story wrong but the fairy-tale ending here is - ya got four bucks and you're hungry? Head here and you'll be satisfied for at least two meals!
