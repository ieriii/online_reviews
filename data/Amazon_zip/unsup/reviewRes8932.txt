So I heard Spacca has the best pizza in town?!?! Also heard its pizza like in Italy!?!?! Ok so here I am w/ belly full of pizza writing this and i would say its one of the better pizza's in the chi. I literally just got back walked in the door and onto yelp! Pretty hard core, I know! :) Well the best way to describe Spacca's way of pizza is exactly how I remember it in Italy a few years back. To the T in the word italy...haha. Anyways had the funghi. Mighty delic (Pronounced Delish!) Anyways pizza came out in literally under 10 min. And thats normal for this place so dont be alarmed....Fresh ingredients, good overally taste, service was exceptionaly great. Then for desert had the special crepe nutella. Ok please note its not an actual crepe but its kinda like a thinner version of pizza dough w/ nutella in the middle. Please dont let my bad description fool you. It was really good!  Well overall this place was good and probably the first pizza that I can remember that actually reminded me of the pizza in Italy. And in most cases I hate writing for places that have hundreds of reviews bc in most cases someone cant enjoy or learn from your review but on the other hand I felt a good place like this still needs to get the support from their customers. I would really liked to have given a 5 star but BUT my fav pizza place deserves a 5(I wont mention the name bc this review is only about this rest but if you are interested in my opinion check out my profile). If only yelp implemented half points! Good stuff Spacca!!!
