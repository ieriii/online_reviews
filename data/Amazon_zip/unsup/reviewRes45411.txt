I met a friend at Wilde earlier this week for a weekday lunch. It has so much character! NOT like a Bennigan's AT ALL!  It's a huge space, with a good mix of tables and booths. Very welcoming atmosphere.  Food was upscale bar food, a little creative and presented very well. I had the mac & cheese and my friend had the portabello sandwich. The mac & cheese was delicious! I think that it would have been better as a side though... The portabello was just OK...a little soggy for me, and I've had better. Service could have been better, but there were a bunch of other items that I want to try, so I'll definitely be back!
