One of the best meals I have had in a long time, maybe because I was giddy-happy from getting married the day before. I wish I could remember the name of our server, but he was so friendly and made our dining experience so enjoyable, so thanks for that. My new husband and I split a bottle of champagne, and had steak tartare as an app. He had the special - a 28 day aged steak that was SO GOOD. Tasted like a super fancy steakhouse steak but in a much cooler atmosphere. Blackened cauliflower was great, pork belly too. It might not be the first place you would think of for a super special occasion, but it was perfect for us because we didn't want to do the $100 per person, jacket required kind of place. Gilt Bar was trendy, dark, and sexy without making you feel uncool, and the food was special without being a meager portion of something with "foam" on top. You know what I am saying. Very highly recommended by yours truly.
