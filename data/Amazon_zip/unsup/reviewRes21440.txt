I waffled. I am not sure if this is quite a 5-star joint. It may be 4.5 stars. Consider me still waffling. Still, I am glad to cross Superdawg off our Places to Visit list. We took a friend who was in town for the weekend so he could have his first-ever Chicago hot dog. A few things you should know just in case you're visiting for the first time: it's cash only (there's an ATM), you can park and either go up to the window or order from your car, and if you go to the window, you should be paying attention. So yes, it's a bit kitschy, and not the cheapest hot dog stand around, but it IS mighty tasty. The dogs are big, meaty and flavorful, with nice soft squishy buns; I liked the pickled green tomato and the pickle spear was nice and hearty too. The fries are a little overdone, but in a tasty sort of way. And we shared a Pineapple SuperSoda, which was fizzyness, pineapple juice and ice cream. Sugar heaven, but quite tasty. This is probably the sort of place we would take out-of-towners, as it's not super-convenient to home, but it was fun, a very good dog, and good to scratch off our list. :)
