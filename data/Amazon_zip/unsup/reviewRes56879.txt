I ordered a pizza the other night. I wasn't in the mood for deep dish, so I decided to try Piece instead. It wasn't terrible, but I'd have to say I've had much better. They seem to use pretty cheap cheese and are very stingy with it too. I would've went for Pete's on Western,but I am out of their delivery zone. In retrospect, I wish I had just driven to Pete's.
