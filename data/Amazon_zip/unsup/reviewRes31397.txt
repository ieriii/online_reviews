Awesome atmosphere and interesting menu. Yet, the food was not that impressive and the variety of options was not varied enough from what I was expecting. Service is top notch! And the cocktails are quite yummy - I think one of the most popular fruity drinks is the "Go-Go Strawberry." And honestly, it tastes pretty good... As for the food, there is nothing spectacular or unique. We tried about 5 different appetizers. None of which are worth going into detail. For main course, we tried some sushi and the "Toast and Jam" - a crispy fried shrimp (toast) with a layer of spicy tuna puree (jam). Sounds cool! Tastes kinda yukky. :-( For MUCH less money, I'd rather head to Uptown and have authentic asian cuisine at a place with outrageously innovative food... at a noise level that I can have conversations.  Note: this is NOT a good date place. It is very noisy, much commotion with people standing and moving all about. For drinks, it is great. Just not a nice fancy dinner with a loved one.
