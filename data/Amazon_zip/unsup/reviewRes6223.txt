We had to work one Saturday so work paid for our dinner from Wildfire delivered to our office. I had the tuna terriyaki steak and mashed potatoes. That steak was absolutely delicious! I mean I have never had a tuna steak that good before. It was cooked medium with sesame seeds around the edge with a little cup full of terriyaki sauce to dip in. And then the mashed potatoes! I don't know how they did it but as I was eating I couldn't help but think what they put in it to make it taste so good. My sister says the bbq rubbed sweet potatoes will get you addicted and she's probably right. Also their to-go containers are nicer than some of the tupperware I have.
