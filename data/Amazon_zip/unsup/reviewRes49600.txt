I like the idea that they have lunch specials here. Food is very good for the price....however this place is not designed for office workers as the service is a bit slow.  Even though the wait staff is nice I don't feel as though they are motivated to provide the best/top quality experience for their guests.  Also, the hostess who was at the front was less than enthusiastic. Finally...I know that there is a cost to it, but there comes a point when it is time to replace the very worm small plates that are on the table when people arrive....especially for this type of ambiance.
