The buffet was perfect for my first experience with Indian food. Got a good sampling of tastes. Loved the samosas of course. The butter chicken was my favorite, the chicken is melt in your mouth good. Also, enjoyed the spinach and corn mixture, not sure what it was called. The Palak Paneer was also a great standout. The buffet offers a HUGE variety, can't not wait to go back and enjoy some new options.
