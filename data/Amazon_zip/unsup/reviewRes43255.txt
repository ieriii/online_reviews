Great BLT, a roast beef sandwich that was somewhat lacking, and what is likely the best croissant I'll ever have the privilege of eating.  BLT was full of salty goodness, and not lacking mayo, which is clutch.  Croissant was nutello filled. Dark, but not burnt on the edges, and crispy all the way around. Top Notch. Docked one star 'cause the hipster staff couldn't give less of a shiz that I was there.
