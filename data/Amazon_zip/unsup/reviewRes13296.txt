My second visit to Glenn's was for breakfast; previously I was there for lunch, but after looking at the bountiful seafood selections on their dinner menu, I will definitely be going back. My 100 star mother and I had breakfast here yesterday and were lucky to grab the last available two top. Unfortunately, it was located right near the door, so every time it opened, a blustery wind blew in. Next time I think I'd just wait for a different table. We started with fresh orange juice which was nice and pulpy; just the way I like it. For our breakfast entrees I ordered the parmesan and chive scrambled eggs with bacon, and substituted a short stack for the toast. Mom ordered the tomato and spinach benedict. Both came with a potato pancake. The food came out really quickly and looked fantastic. Mom asked the server for a side of sour cream for her potato pancake, but when he mentioned that the potato pancake had sour cream mixed in it already, she grew positively giddy. My eggs were scrambled perfectly, which is not an easy thing to accomplish, imho. The chives added a mild onion flavor and the parmesan provided a nice nutty and somewhat salty component. On the side was bacon, and 4 slices was certainly a generous amount. We both thought the potato pancake was rich, but it could have been crispier. The sour cream in the pancake rendered it a little soggy. I sampled mom's benedict and it was scrumptious and exactly what she wanted. The eggs, again, were cooked perfectly. I never make poached eggs at home because I always screw them up; Glenn's nailed them. My mom devoured all of her benedict. She never finishes all of her food as she eats like a bird, so that is truly a testament to how good it was. Service was extremely personable on all fronts: hostess, server, busser, owner. There was nothing not to like about Glenn's Diner and I can't wait to return.
