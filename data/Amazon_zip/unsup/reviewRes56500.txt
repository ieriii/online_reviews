Having been coming here for over 10 years, while glad RB is cashing in on the business, I have found the increasing crowds oppressive. With the no/minimal reservations policy still in effect, the wait I was told over the weekend was 2-3 hours. I mean give me a break. It is basically all gawkers and tourists now who go and will wait b/c they will not be back in town. The food is good, authentic, and delicious...but certainly not worth more than an hour wait. I think they may even be trying to scare people off with overblown estimated wait times, just to move the tourists through faster. If you are a Chicago area resident, only go during the week if you want to get in a reasonable time. Otherwise, the new Xoco is a fine alternative...even if the wait there is 30+ min as well for a sandwich.
