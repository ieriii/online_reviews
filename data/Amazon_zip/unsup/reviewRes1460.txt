Walked a good mile and a half from the Guinness Oyster Fest...only to stand in line for an hour an a half. And it only took us 20-25 minutes to order, be served, and finish our meal. Go figure. Anyhow, onto the food. The atomic dog was ok. Spicy but I think it could have been spruced up with something extra. The Thai Chicken was alright. I liked the seaweed and sriracha on top...but not so much the dog itself. The foie gras was the best dog we tried! Creamy, buttery, melt-in-your-mouth duck liver. Yum! I was unimpressed by the duck fat fries and it surely didn't live up to the hype. It pretty much tasted like regular fries. The service is awesome. Doug takes your order and he is patient and has a smile on his face with each order he takes, even when he knows that there is a line of 100 people outside. If Doug had his own bobble head I would for sure stick it on my car dashboard. I love the cartoon-ish feel of the place. The colors remind me of hot dog on a stick...but Hot Doug's is cooler by 100x's. Tips: Cash Only Duck Fat fries only served on Fridays and Saturdays p.s. people, it should be a crime to make your 3 year old child stand in line with you for an hour and a half out in the cold for hot dogs! that's just mean!
