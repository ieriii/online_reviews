Valet parking, consistently good food and a unique restaurant ambiance make this a great choice for dining in Greektown. I'm a fan of their lunch combo platter (its in the menu with the children's menu options) - you can pick three items and it comes with a vegetable (a potato). I've been trying different items in the combo platter each time I visit but am consistently drawn to the moussaka. The waiters can be a harsh sometimes. On one visit I did my best at pronouncing the item and instead of being friendly and helping me the waiter stated "If I can speak English than you can speak Greek". Seriously?
