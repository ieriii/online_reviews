I had been driving by this place every time i went to ethiopian diamond and ras dashen. Finally, i decided to experiment and stop here instead of going further. The result: so-so ethiopian food albeit at a good price. We tried a variety of vegetarian dishes and nothing stood out as great. Lentils were better than other vegetables but overall not even close to ethiopian diamond or ras dashen. It is a little cheaper than the other two places.
