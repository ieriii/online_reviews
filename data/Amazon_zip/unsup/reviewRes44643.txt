If you want to have Chicago's famous deep dish pizza - this is where to have it. I'm personally not much into pizza but this was not so bad. It's very filling - one slice will have you stuffed. The only thing though is I wish they had alfredo sause pizza instead of the usual tomatoe sauce. All in all, if you're a pizza fan, try it out.
