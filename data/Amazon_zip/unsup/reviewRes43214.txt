Gilt Bar and Restaurant is such a cute hotspot, I love the atmosphere and service. We went the first time back in November for dinner and I ordered the bone in chicken and my sister ordered the Mushroom Truffle Pasta, Both DELISH! Such a rich savory taste, they even make the cauliflower delicious with their seasoning! The Bread with spreads are great as well along with the steaks.....We have gone back a couple times after that and had the same great experience too! The last time we went a couple weeks ago, I noticed they made some changes to their menu, the chicken was no longer bone in, it was boneless and it was served pretty much black and burned. I don't know what happened but this was the only time we had a bad experience, and I plan to go back again, it happens right?!? The Lounge downstairs is super cute and great to hangout and talk, Chicago definitely needed a restaurant and lounge like this and we love it!
