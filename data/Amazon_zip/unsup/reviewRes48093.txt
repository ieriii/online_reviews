I'm a little late to the Publican party, but I'm so glad I tried out their Sunday brunch when my mom came up to the city. We were seated promptly for our ten o'clock reservation, and a bus boy poured the coffee as soon as we sat down. The coffee was so flavorful and deep that the libations that are normally so tempting (on mama's tab! woohoo!) were a lost thought. We started out with the beer bread, which came on a bed of house-made ricotta and topped with honey, walnuts, and a bit of apple. It was a perfectly thought out and simple plate of food. And the bread was just gently sweetened, which my not-so-sweet tooth really enjoyed. My mom had the maple-glazed pork shoulder... and while it was fork-tender and delicious, I preferred my red wine poached eggs. It's pretty difficult for me to eat eggs without simultaneously noshing on some salty bacon, but these eggs didn't need a thing. Except for maybe the bearnaise sauce served on top (so good!) and the sourdough they were sitting on. What did I just say about not needing bacon? Oh yeah, we ordered the maple bacon. It wasn't a far cry from my mom's pork shoulder and it was totally delicious. The hash browns were fried to an uber-crisp, which was a party in a mouth but an explosion on the plate. They were just too crispy to cut into without having them fly everywhere! That's truly my only complaint about The Publican, but I was in such food euphoria at 10 AM that I didn't care. Hash browns flew. Everywhere. While this wasn't a light meal, none of the dishes felt heavy, muddled, or too rich. They were actually rather elegant and home-y. I will certainly be back.
