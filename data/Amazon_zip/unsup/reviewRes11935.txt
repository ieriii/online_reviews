an hour wait on saturday morning at 11:30 for a group of 6. i guess for the bongo room that's normal and expected? but to me that seems ridiculous. their food is good, but i've never been able to fully understand others love for brunch. to me it seems to be the wimpiest, fake meal of the week. why would anyone actually want to eat dessert to fuel the start of their weekends?  I was mildly to slightly more than expected satisfied with my smoked salmon, avocado, sour cream and chives omelet. there was too much egg and not enough salmon, they overcompensated this with too much sour cream. the potatoes were really delicious, i loved the super crusty, slightly burnt parts.  I tried my friends sweet options. the red velvet pancake, zucchini cake and some brioche cake were all pretty good but mostly because of the super sweet cream sauce poured on top. my 2nd taste of the zucchini cake was much more disappointing without the cream sauce to camouflage the blandness of the cake. the eggs Benedict were totally forgettable. the ham was the only pretty good part. the hollandaise was an in-your-face-loud yellow, yet bland and over creamy.  this is definitely not the restaurant for me. never going back.
