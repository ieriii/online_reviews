Yes, I have the palate of a 9 year old. Yes, i eat hot dogs at least once a week. That said, I know my hot dogs, and Superdawg is one of the best. Seriously, where else in the Chicago metro area can you eat at a 50s style drive-in? You pull into a spot, flip the switch, place your order and within ten minutes your hotdogs are brought to you in cute little boxes. An awesome place for a casual date or to take out-of-towners. Be sure to try a milkshake...they are pretty amazing.
