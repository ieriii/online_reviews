Buyer BEWARE: I practically got SCAMMED and you probably did too. This used to be one of my late night spots to hit up. I mean, who can turn down grilled Kalbi/Bulgogi along with all those little side dishes that come with it? ME...THAT'S WHO...READ ON... You can opt out and have them cook it for you in the kitchen, but there is something cool about grilling it right at the table. But when you really think about it, it's kinda bogus that I'm paying so much when I'm cooking my own food and not even getting quality service. But here's the real kicker... My Last Experience at San Soo Gab San: I was having a late night 4th meal for two around 2am one night. Food was good, service was bleh, and then we get the check. I'm already halfway into my food coma as I'm about to pay when I notice something weird...the bill seems unusually high. It was somewhat difficult to decipher why, considering the itemized bill was not in English. So, I call my waitress over and point to part of the bill asking for a translation. She tells me it's "the TIP." WOW. WTF?! Really? How can you automatically charge me with a mandatory gratuity when: 1. It's only two of us eating(it's not like a party of 6 or more?)...and 2nd...even if it was a party of six...shouldn't they have been obligated to maybe oh I dunno...POST IT SOMEWHERE? A warning would have been nice...one that I can read. It's really made me angry considering the fact that I was ALREADY going to tip generously on TOP of the hidden mandatory tip already in place. Some people I've shared this story with tell me it's because it's late at night and they don't get much service. Wake up people, there's no excuse for this. The only reason I didn't give it one star was because the food was good...but why wouldn't it be? Afterall, I'M the one who cooked it....lol. Well, at least they cooked the rice for me.
