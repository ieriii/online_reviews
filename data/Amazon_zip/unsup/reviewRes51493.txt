For a different spin on the typical restaurants in lincoln square, try Garcia's. I liked this place for drinks and apps. Really big clean place with a large selection of food and drink. My wife had the margarita and I had a michelada w/Tecate (loved it). Both so good. We also shared the ceviche with mixed fish. A must try.
