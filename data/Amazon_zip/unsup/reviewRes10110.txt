After two Thanksgiving dinners we decided to move on to pizza. It was rainy and chilly but we made the trek from Naperville in to Piece and even had to wait a while to get a table.  We had a great pizza and a fun time. The only mis-steps were that they were out of three different beers that Ms T selected and while we ordered the pizza "well-done" to try to get a crisper crust, it was not really although it probably helped. We loved the tomato sauce for its freshness and good flavor balance. It was not sweet like we often get in St Louis. It had bright tomato flavor and was not a thick over-cooked version. The crust is thin, but not like a cracker. We had our standard Italian sausage, green olive and mushroom and it was great. It is worth taking the time to find this place for handmade pizza with great sauce in a good setting. I will have to make a pitch to return here when we are back in Chicago.
