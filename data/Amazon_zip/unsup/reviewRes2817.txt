This was certainly one of the best meals I've ever eaten. We went on a Monday night, so can't speak for weekends there, but when we arrived the host and doorman both met us at the entrance, and we were immediately seated. I was very happy with the ambiance. I tend to feel a little ripped off when I go to a "fancy" restaurant and face a dining area packed like a can of sardines. The dining area was roomy, just elegant enough, contemporary, and understated. I would venture to say that there was about 10' between us and the next closest table. I only know ever so vaguely what I like in a wine, and was a bit overwhelmed by their extensive wine list, but the wine steward was immensely helpful in finding wines that we both loved. I believe that we ordered an 8-course meal. Each of the courses was inventive (hedgehog mousse? pop rocks in Champagne?), and used obviously fresh and top-quality ingredients. Without question, the scallops that I had were the best of my life. In addition to the courses listed on the menu, our waiters brought out at least an additional half dozen dishes in between (all in all, I believe we managed 4 or 5 dessert courses alone). I would certainly go back very regularly if I could afford it. The bill for two came out to be about $375 after a few glasses of wine each. All in all, the meal was well worth the price, and if you can find the occasion to splurge on a meal, I highly recommend Tru.
