I tend to come here for Saturday and Sunday brunch. As to be expected from a hip place, finding a spot to sit can be a bit of a challenge, but when you finally have a seat, it quickly turns out to be fun. Their menu is well-established and enjoyable. I always order Chocolate chip pancakes - I asked if they could make it chocolate chunk pancakes - with a smile the waitress said she will try her best. Yup, they nailed it. Their coffee is pretty good, too. I would return time and time again - even if it involves me getting the not-so-often elbow in the face from pushing myself into a corner. :)
