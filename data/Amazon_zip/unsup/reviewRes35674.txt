Real solid. Shaw's gets the benefit of the doubt just for being one of the very few true seafood restaurants in this beef-and-potatoes town. We had the blue crab artichoke dip for an appetizer and I accomplished my usual goal of eating two animals in every meal by ordering the blue crab-stuffed Maine lobster for my entree. Everything down to the bread was top-notch, and we got hooked up with a free dessert sampler platter because it was my mom's birthday. They didn't even card her, so I'm thinking I should just always say it's someone's birthday. Although at such a nice establishment, they probably trust the clientele to not be scheming. But that's where they go wrong.
