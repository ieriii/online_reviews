Had a fantastic birthday dinner here with a group of 20 close family & friends. Everyone was new to the restaurant with the exception of myself and one other person. Our waitress, Margarita was incredibly helpful in recommending dishes and explaining the menu in Spanish to my parents. Setting was great, weather was perfect - and everyone was extremely happy with the food and service, which makes me a happy camper. Safe to say we will all return for seconds! Good thing their patio is open year-round :)
