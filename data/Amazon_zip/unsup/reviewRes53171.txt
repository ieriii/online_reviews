I love this neighborhood spot for tasty food and drinks. Most recently, my mom and I went for an early dinner around 6:30 on a Saturday. It was busy but we were quickly seated in the enclosed back patio area. The atmosphere back there was great. Everyone around us was having a great time and enjoying their food/drink. After seeing/smelling them go by for another diner, my mom desperately wanted the fried plantain chips (Mariquitas), which were amazingly garlicky. We love garlic, so we were happy ladies. She got the bistec dinner plate, I got the avocado salad and we shared. Both meals were so huge I had to take a giant takeout box home with leftovers! Everything was so yummy: the steak was pounded very thin, marinated in heavenly cuban-ness, topped with chimichurri and served with piles of rice, beans, plantains; the salad had at least 2 entire perfectly rice avocados on it and at least 2 tomatoes. I was worried that it would be measly for $8 but it was well worth the price. No matter what recipes I try, I cannot replicate their meat at home. It's a great lunch/dinner spot with giant portions.
