I normally stay at W hotels during my vacations, so I selected this one in Chicago. I was expecting the normal wherever, whenever service and trendy decorated chic rooms, lobbies and bars. What I didn't expect was personalized service. Before my arrival, I was greeted by Laurelin via email inquiring if I needed anything during my stay. I let her know it was my birthday. She responded immediately that she would like to offer some complimentary gifts on behalf of the W since I am a platinum member and also asked if I needed help with reservations at restaurants for my birthday night. Laurelin went above and beyond the "wherever whenever" slogan during my entire stay. Even though we already had reservations, she called hostesses to reconfirm our reservations for both the restaurant and nightclub to ensure a hassle-free evening. Additionally, she came to personally greet me after check-in. Because of her efforts, me and my girlfriends had an amazing time. It was not just Laurelin that provided outstanding service. We were asking where we could find a 7-11 and the doorman offered to go for us since it was freezing outside! Another time, we were in a hurry to get food so they helped us get into the Acura car and called ahead to the restaurant to let them know we were coming and needed to be served quickly! At the W you are not paying for a nice hotel, you are paying for the outstanding service. Laurelin really provided this and ensured that we had a memorable weekend.
