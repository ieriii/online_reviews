this place is pricy but not too pricy compared to other fancy italian restaurants, but is definitely worth the price. carpaccio is my favorite dish, i always order this for my appetizer. i also like cream based pasta dish, as it gives very delicate and complexed taste. the atmosphere is nice, it is kinda noisy, which reminds me of local restaurants in italian cities. if i want to eat good italian food that is worth for its price, i always pick here!
