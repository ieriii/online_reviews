Seriously? Four stars? The one thing I have to say positive about this place is they take down your number so that you can walk across the street and get a drink or a coffee. If a table is ready before you come back, they will call you. Beyond that, the service was incredibly slow. The waitstaff was definitely not seasoned. The Oysters Rockefeller weren't that memorable. The scallops were decent alongside asparagus and their homemade coleslaw. The seafood salad had fresh chunks of seafood in it. That was OK as well. This is one of those places that "sounded like a good idea at the time."
