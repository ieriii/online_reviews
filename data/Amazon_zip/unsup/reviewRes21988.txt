Went here for dinner with our extended family while visiting Chicago. We were not really intending to go here, but found ourselves in the neighborhood. The restaurant is very family friendly with those with little kids. Price is right for the huge portion they serve. I had the leg of lamb; it was not too tender just perfect. Juicy but not too juicy. there was no way I could do justice to the lamb without finishing it. So I did. The food is good, but the best is the people here are very nice as well. Great atmosphere. We will definitely come here whenever we happen to be in Chicago again.
