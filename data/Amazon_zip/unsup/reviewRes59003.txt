Arrive on time for our reservation & told by hostess "your table's not ready, just go wait in the bar." She actually uses her hand to wave us away. Ok....so we spend the next 15 minutes trying to get a bartender's attention, but they all seem to be huddled in a corner discussing something very important. Finally convince a cocktail waitress to get us drinks, and when I say "convince" I mean that she seems very reluctant to serve us for some reason....strange approach to customer service. Finally get drinks a good 10 minutes later and then spend the next half hour amusing ourselves by watching the endless parade of fashion victims, dudes with too much product in their hair, and sugar daddies entertaining their bored "dates." After noticing that plenty of parties have been sat while we languish in the bar begging for service for almost an hour past our reservation time, I politely ask the hostess how much longer it will be until we can sit down for dinner. She tells me, "We are the new hotspot, so you should expect to wait." As soon as we are done laughing at this ridiculous statement, we hop in a cab and head west on Grand to Butterfly, where we are politely quoted a short but accurate wait time and finally we sit down to a delicious and attitude-free dinner. Thanks Butterfly & screw you Sunda!
