This place has great food! I usually don't like apple martinis, but theirs is made with beer and tastes like apple juice. Unlike the apple martini at every other bar that I've been to, this was not sickeningly sweet nor fake green. I liked. The salmon was delish too! I also have to give props to their service. For a restaurant that just opened, it is rare to be mistake-free but that's exactly what the evening was. Everyone got their food and drinks quickly and got just what they ordered.  I'm glad they're in the neighborhood and I'm definitely going back.
