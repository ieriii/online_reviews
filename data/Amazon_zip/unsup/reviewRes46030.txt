I know this is a chain, but it's a pretty amazing one. And always worth the brunch wait! On a recent Saturday, my friend and I wanted brunch and needed to get some tickets. She went to wait for brunch, but found there to be no wait. The hostess was nice enough to take her name, and when we both arrived later, gave us the first available table. There's usually a wait on Saturdays, but it's well worth it. Just make sure you get there before 1 pm to ensure you can get your brunch! The Grand Lux Omlet is just awesome. From the fresh asparagus and other veggies to the holandaise sauce, this is definitely one omelet that will keep me coming back! I also have a fond liking for their beignets. The white chocolate and raspberry dipping sauce are delicious.  Then there's the coffee and the alcohol. Mostly I just need to note that they do serve alcohol, because there are some places that don't serve it. The coffee is delicious even black. They also offer numerous delicious espresso drinks. Grand Lux is always busy on a Saturday. It's always worth the wait.
