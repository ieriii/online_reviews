Oh my gosh, the portion sizes here are HUGE!! I ordered an omelet and it came with potatoes and an entree sized portion of pancakes. The food was good - the pancakes one of our parties ordered were cold (we think b/c they were put out before our eggs were ready), but they took them back and delivered new warm ones right away. The pancakes were a little dry, but we still really enjoyed our meal. And did I mention the portions are HUGE? I finished only half of what was on my plate.
