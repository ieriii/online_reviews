Oh Wildfire how do I love thee? Let me count the ways: 1. Steaks are delicious,one of the few places I'll order red meat. Get a crust- horseradish and parmesan are favorites. 2. I wish they had a potato flight because- the double stuffed, au gratin, and mashed are all crazy good. 3. Stormy Night martini taste literally like a giant sweet tart- yummy to me. 4. Love that they have small portions of dessert- Snickers icecream sandwhiches are a treat, if they have the banana coconut cream pie get it. 5. Service is generally pretty great. Our server last night was really good. 6. I almost forgot the Chopped Salad- it's so freaking good, the dressing is the icing on the cake so to speak 7. I could keep going on and on but you should really make a reservation and find out for yourself!
