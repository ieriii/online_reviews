I enjoyed dinner here on a recent Friday night. I made reservations through OpenTable but it didn't seem necessary. As soon as we walked in, I noticed (and loved) the ambience. The wooden bar, hardwood floors, and the red lamps near the kitchen all exude warmth and comfort. The menu is fantastic. We started with two cocktails - the Old Fashioned and the Lemonade, both were great. We shared the apple salad and the chick pea fries to begin. Both were spot-on: we could tell that the ingredients were really fresh and prepared with care. For dinner I had the veggie torta and my girlfriend had the veggie pot pie - we shared both. I loved the brussels sprouts in the pot pie, and the soy chorizo in the torta stood out. The torta was served with a jalapeno cole slaw which was fun. Lastly for dessert we shared the fried dough with prosecco - a major indulgence. Just because it's organic doesn't mean that it's good for you! Service was in line with the rest of the experience - casual and laid back given the restaurant's family-owned-and-operated vibe, but efficient: if we ever needed anything it was easy to flag down our server. For two, we spent $95 including tax and tip. Not especially cheap, but it was fun to try a bunch of dishes and support a local business in a neighborhood that could use more of them! We'll be back for breakfast.
