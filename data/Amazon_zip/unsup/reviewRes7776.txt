As a recovering vegetarian, I was sort of concerned with going to a restaurant which is so heavily meat-focused. Although I do love meat I'm definitely not used to eating huge amounts of it at once. There was a wait, but it was a Friday night, and they told us it'd be an hour for a party of two. We were fine with that, and hit the bar for a (surprisingly decent) martini. I had barely had two sips of it when we were seated. It took about twenty-five minutes at most. The service was fantastic, the waiter explained everything to us (we were Fogo de Chao virgins) and showed us the wine list. We didn't order wine with our meal as we still had cocktails, and opted for a bottle of San Pellegrino instead. The salad bar was good- but there were fewer choices than I would have expected. What was out was very good, though, with the exception of the prosciutto which was very dried out as if it'd been sitting there too long. The meat was, as others have said, to die for. The lamb and the filet mignon were my favorites. I don't eat pork, but my date thought it was really great, as well as the bacon-wrapped steak thing. I didn't try any chicken, either. I'm all about rare meat, and they consistently gave me really good, perfectly cooked rare pieces. The only complaint I had wasn't with the restaurant itself, but the clientele. There were people in there wearing tee shirts and flip flops. If you're going to a reasonably nice establishment to eat dinner, please wear something slightly nicer. This isn't Applebees. I managed to leave without feeling disgusting, but still feeling like I'd gotten my money's (well, my date's money) worth. We'll probably be back in the next couple of months as a treat.
