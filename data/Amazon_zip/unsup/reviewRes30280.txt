Braised Pork Belly. I don't know if it really gets any better than that. I would say that my favorite thing about Sunda is that you can get dishes that simply aren't found anywhere else. Places like Gibsons and Joe's Stone Crab are wonderful. Most all of these places (including Sunda) have outstanding service. But the unique cuisine separates this from others. For some, that is not a good thing. We have in Chicago the good fortune to be able to say that amazing steakhouses are a dime a dozen (again, Gibson's, Joe's Stone Crab, Mastro's, Keefer's, Chicago Chop House . . .) Places like Sunda (and Girl and the Goat and Japonais, to name a couple) are what really push the envelope. There are many favorite items that are always on the menu (beef lolipops, though I think they're over rated) they also feature fresh ideas. Sushi is top notch, too.
