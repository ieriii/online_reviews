Wishbone touts itself as a southern cooking joint. It's in a nice hood, and I decided to take my parents there as a send off before the went back home. Thing is, Wishbone is very hit or miss. My dish was pretty ok, albeit VERY rich. I got shrimp and grits. The grits are cheddar grits (which were amazing), swimming in a bath of cream, shrimp and scallions. Told you it was rich. It was really good, but obviously I couldn't eat it all. Crazy huge portions + tons of rich food = "DOES ANYONE WANT TO TRY SOME OF MY FOOD?!" Everyone else felt "eh" about their meals, unfortunately. We probably won't be going down to Roscoe Village again anytime soon for Wishbone, it just wasn't worth the trip.
