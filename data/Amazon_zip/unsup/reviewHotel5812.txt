I would give it -100 stars if Yelp would let us, but this hotel is absolutely filthy and in need of MAJOR repairs. We had significant water damage to the bathroom ceiling, gum stuck inside the air conditioner, a front door that wouldn't close all the way, spiders, bugs, and cobwebs inside and out, and brown dirt coming out of the sink and bathtub faucets. But here's the best part - we made a reservation two months before staying here for a non-smoking room, but we instead were given a room that REEKED of cigarette smoke, with THREE ashtrays in it, in a hallway that REEKED of cigarette smoke. To our sheer amusement, there was a sign on the room's front door that said, "non-smoking room." What a joke. Oh, and the maids even rearranged our ashtrays for us upon our first day's maid service. How thoughtful. When we complained to the front desk less than 15 minutes after checking in, we were told that the hotel was sold out and there was no possibility of being moved to a REAL non-smoking room. WTF was the point of making a reservation?!?!? And then, upon checkout two days later, a different woman at the front desk said, "oh yeah, that entire hallway is all smoking rooms." Gee thanks, might want to change your signage! Needless to say, we'll be initiating a complaint and a request for full refund with both http://priceline.com and http://ramada.com. DO NOT STAY HERE!!!!
