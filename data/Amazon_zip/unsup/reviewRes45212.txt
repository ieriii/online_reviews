Food that isn't good leaves bad memories, but food that tries to be avant garde and just ends up confusing the palate is just plain wrong. Though they encouraged sharing, with a group of six there was rarely more than two bites of any dish if we were to split them evenly. Perhaps they were having an off-day, but I was far from impressed. I wish I could provide more details, but even their failure wasn't that memorable. Reading other reviews it seems like Anteprima does have off nights and I could have experienced one of them. My opinion? Save yourself the trouble of hoping you don't get an off-night and go elsewhere.
