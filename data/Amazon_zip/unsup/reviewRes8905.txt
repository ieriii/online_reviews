3 stars this time around. Our server was M.I.A. the entire evening and when he finally did show up, forgot half of our order. Lamb and beef koobideh were a little overdone and while the gormeh sabzi was tasty, contained a mere two pieces of meat and was swimming in oil. The baghali polo (dill rice), which is my all time favorite, lacked the strong dill flavor and aromatic basmati quality it is meant to have. In fairness, our first experience here was much better than the last. I know that Noon-O is one out of only three or so good Persian restaurants in town and as such consistently receives high reviews - but it just doesn't compare when weighed against the broader spectrum of Persian restaurants. Namely, most of the places in L.A.  That said, it's not as if I will be hopping a plane to LAX to get my chengeh on anytime soon, so we will probably return to Noon-O...but only after giving the other two places a fair shake first.
