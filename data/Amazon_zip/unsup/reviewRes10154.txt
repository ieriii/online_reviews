I rarely give places 5 stars on here. Everything was perfect here, from the service, to the food, to the wine selection. Our reservation was for 9pm--we got seated at about 9:20, which was fine-as we were able to get a seat up at the bar and have a glass of wine. The bar area was pretty cool--it reminded me of an old school Chicago bar from the 40's. We ordered the margherita pizza and the insalata di pere salad as appetizers. The pizza wasn't as crispy as I would have liked-but that's probably my only complaint. For our entrees I ordered the stracci di farro  Farro (flat pieces of pasta, asparagus, leeks, garlic, truffle oil)---the truffle oil REALLY made the dish. My bf ordered the tortelli alla bolognese  (potato and fennel stuffed saffron pasta tossed with a meat and tomato ragu). Since I'm a vegetarian, I unfortunately couldn't try his dish, but he said that the saffron really made it unique. The waitstaff was super friendly, helpful and professional. We celebrated my birthday there and they brought out a scoop of pistaccio sorbet with a candle. :) We'll definitely be back!
