They can call it gourmet, they call it Vietnamese, they call it French... It's just an over-priced Thai place. That's not BYOB. That is super stuffy. Hmmm. Don't get me wrong, most of the stuff we had was very good, but they were dishes that your average hole-in-the wall Thai place can turn out for 8 bucks. The soft salad rolls (Bo Bia) were actually super bland and we didn't even finish them. The fried spring rolls (Cha Gio) were really good, but that was mostly because they were super deep fried. For entrees we had the barbeque pork over angel hair, which was the best dish we tried. Pork was crispy and flavorful, and the angel hair was super light and picked up the sauce nicely. The rice noodles in garlic-chili sauce dish was absolutely identical to something you'd see at a mom and pop Thai place, only double the price. While I had a nice meal, I definitely wouldn't go back or recommend it.
