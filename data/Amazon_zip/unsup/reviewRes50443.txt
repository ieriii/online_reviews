I booked a table for two at Big Jones for the Sunday night before Valentine's Day. Based on Yelp reviews, I expected to like it, but as it turns out, I loved it. I had the Ranch Burger, which comes with Rice Tots (like Tater Tots, only made from Rice!) and Chipotle Ketchup. My date had the Sweet Tea-Infused Pork Chop, which was also scrumptious. The restaurant was surprisingly dead and the staff were very friendly and efficient. Our waiter was very sweet but seemed a bit nervous. We thought maybe he was new. All the same, we enjoyed the entire experience and will definitely be back, as well as recommending to friends.
