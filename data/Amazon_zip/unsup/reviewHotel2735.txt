Even though I wasn't too crazy about the bathroom (no fan and very shallow sink), I LOVE this hotel. It's no wonder it has a five-star rating: incomparable customer service; friendly, professional staff; great gym; beautiful, well appointed rooms; Kiehl's products; and David Burke's Primehouse (their asiago popovers are to die for). The location is fantastic as well. We were upgraded to a suite at check-in (thanks, Marco, you're the best!), which was the perfect start to our six-day vacation in Chicago. There was no view to speak of (when we looked out our windows we saw the back of the hotel), but it didn't really matter since we didn't stay in much. It was great having an extra sitting area (with TV) to unwind in after a long day of walking around and taking in this awesome city. I would love to stay here again.
