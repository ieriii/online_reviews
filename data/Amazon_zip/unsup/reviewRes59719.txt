Excellent service!! I took my mother here for her 64th birthday and she loved it as well. I originally ordered a NY strip and asked for medium, but the steak was cooked well. I notified the waiter and I was brought a large filet cooked to perfection in its place. I would certainly go back and recommend Ruth's Chris to anyone!
