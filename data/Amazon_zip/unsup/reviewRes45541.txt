Wilde is a great neighborhood spot for dinner. The food is consistently good and the atmosphere can't be beat, especially if you're lucky enough to be seated in the library section. I've been here with big groups before during busy times and the staff has always been very accommodating. The portion sizes are humongous, so come hungry, but save room for a delicious beer from their wide selection.
