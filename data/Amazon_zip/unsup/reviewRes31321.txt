I'm still trying to figure out why this place is so popular. I ate here last night with two friends that were in from out of town. It was entirely my idea to go here and I was thrilled to have gotten a last minute reservation at 8:30pm.  We arrived on time and waited for a half-hour for our table. During that time we wandered over to the bar and ordered a few drinks. We stood there for about 10 minutes waiting, when eventually the bartender who took our order made uncomfortable eye contact with us and suddenly remembered that he had forgotten to pour our $12 drinks! The worst thing about this was that the bar wasn't even busy. So first impressions are important and this was NOT a good one. We were finally seated...in a horrible location I might add. It was a tiny table meant for two but we had three. One of my friends was seated on the side of the table with his back up against a pole. He was uncomfortable the entire time and we could all tell.  The service at the table was good. Every time we dropped a crumb or finished a plate, someone was there to pick it up.  The food was ok. Nothing special. It certainly didn't make up for the other areas I mentioned in this review.  Overall, 2 stars is generous in my mind. This place is not worth the hype!
