A group of 5 friends met at Simply It last night for dinner, and we'll be coming back soon! The owner/host here is fantastic, and the food was delicious! We had and liked: Avocado Wontons, Pho Bo, Simply It Beef, Beef and Asparagus, Curry Chicken, and the Vegetarian Delight. The only reason we didn't give it 5 stars was because it took us 45 minutes to be seated, and there really isn't a great place to stand and wait. The owner was handed out free spring rolls to anyone waiting, which was a really nice touch!
