I already loved this place but then i had my birthday dinner there a few weeks ago. I made a reservation for 13 people and over the course of two hours, 28 people showed up. I work in the service industry and that is extremely annoying but literally everyone that worked there was amazingly nice and accommodating. all my friends were able to eat and loved their food. i had a special with some sort of shrimp & fried goodness and it was delicious. This place is BYO but they make their own mojito and sangria mixers and they are phenomenal...sos the flan that they brought out to me with candles and 'you say its your birthday' by the beatles playin' in the background. I'm a huge fan.
