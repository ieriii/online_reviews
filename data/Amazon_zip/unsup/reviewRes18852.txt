I really don't think its fair to compare this place to Kuma's. Ok...that's off my chest. Now that I have a kid, places where I can A) eat good food, B) drink good beer and C) bring said kid are important to me. Like..all three at the same time. Bad Apple on a Saturday for lunch satisfied all three requirements. I LOVE the beer list. The goat cheese fondue was super tasty. My burger wasn't perfect but not because it wasn't good. It did taste good. I ordered the Slow Burn medium and it was slightly more done than medium. The menu described milk stout marinated chilies and onions....upon inspection, the peppers were nothing more than red, green and yellow bells. Not bad, mind you, but not what the menu had described and certainly didn't create that "slow burn" as the name invokes. Garlic fries were *delishus*. Husband had The Hangover. He loved it but would have opted without the ham, as the ham made it kinda salty. I'm a fan, would go back again, for sure for the beer and apps and to try another burger.
