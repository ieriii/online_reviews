Just had a great meal at this great littie BYOB on Wilson near the El tracks. I am a sucker for great home made pasta and Caro Mio does not dissapoint. The special lasagna was tasty and the portion size was just right for an Italian place (big but not massive and scary). The zuppe di pesci had some enourmous mussels and tasted great. Some people might not like the no-nonsense service but I prefer that to your overly attentive and cheesy Dennys waitress. The place in not huge and it gets slammed on a nice weekend evening but on the night I was there there were a few couples and a large B-Day group of about 20 people. Eat, BYOB, and be Happy.
