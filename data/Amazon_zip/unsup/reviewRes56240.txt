Within a few days of going to Simply It, I just had to go back. This is one of my favorite restaurants in the Lincoln Park area. The food is authentic and DELICIOUS! There are so many different choice and all of them for a good price. The service is also WONDERFUL. The staff is very friendly, and you feel like you're at home. I strongly support this business and go back as often as I can. I highly recommend going to Simply it if you are in teh Lincoln Park neighborhood!
