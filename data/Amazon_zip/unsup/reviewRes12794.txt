I'm a fucking vegetarian and I liked this place.  I can't tell you anything about the meat but I can say that the salad bar is tasty and the sangria was strong. Best salad bar ever? Nah. Worth the money? No fucking way. Shitty, pre-packaged obvious chain decor? You Betcha. Why did I say I liked this place? Probably because I was fucking lit off the sangria.
