ooooh is this place classy. i got a last-minute deal for new years night and i am thrilled that i took the plunge and stayed at the fairmont. the room was enormous, the rain shower was decadent, and the in-room technology was mind-blowing. oh yeah, and the price was incredible. this would be the perfect hotel to stay at for Lolla or for the Taste of Chicago. i docked a star for my only two grips: the bed was too hard for my taste and the lobby needs way more comfortable places to lounge. their weird mid-lobby bar is awkward and the seating is just a bunch of bar stools and a few small chairs.
