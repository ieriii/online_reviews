SuperDawg gets 5 stars from me. Here's why: 1. Just driving up to the place will make you smile, especially when you see the Tarzan Hot Dog on the roof winking at you. 2. Car Hop Service. Just like places like "Dog-N-Suds" used to do. 3. Everything about it is fun. The little box that your hot dog comes in, the funny names for all of the different menu choices. 4. The dog is a jumbo dog. Not like you get everywhere else. Crinkle cut fries. A strange pickled green tomato atop your SuperDawg. 5. Great milkshakes. They know how to make them here. Get Strawberry. 6. I loved going there as a kid, and now my 5 year old son loves it too. You can't get that just anywhere.
