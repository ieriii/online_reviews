I had a bad experience with delivery here a few weekends ago and got a cold, soggy pizza. This was after several orders of hot delicious pizza, so we blamed it on being a football Sunday and decided not to order it again.They saw my negative review on Yelp and offered a full refund on the pizza, no questions asked. My faith was restored. This is definitely the kind of personal service you won't get from a big chain.We'll definitely be ordering again, but maybe not during such a hectic time because we do know their pizzas are delish, but the place is small.
