Loved it! I was a little worried because I had really high expectations but I have to say, it really lived up to them all! We went there for brunch - I got the huevos and my sister got the breakfast bowl. Both were extremely delicious and filling! I got mine with scrambled tofu and yes, they really know how to scramble tofu! I would love to try lunch / dinner there sometime. The people, the atmosphere - all very cool! A must for any veg person going through Chicago!!!!
