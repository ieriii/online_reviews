My wife & I went on a kick of tasting priced fixed menus. After trying several in the city over a few weeks (such as Gram Elliot), Sprout was the clear winner. The price was right, the portions were the right size, and the taste was so good we could vividly remember each flavor for weeks. It is by far our favorite restaurant in the city of Chicago.
