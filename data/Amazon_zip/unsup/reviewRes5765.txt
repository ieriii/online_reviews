Mostly a review on the service: The food here is super good but you know what makes food taste even better...good service! I find Wildfire to be as true as possible with regards to reservation times. We have to keep in mind that when one makes reservations at 7pm, your table will not be waiting empty at 7pm. I have never worked in the restaurant industry but I image the table timing is based on how long patrons stay and dine for, which can be unpredictable. Despite the unpredictability, Wildfire seems to get it within a 15 min window and keeps me coming back.  The servers here are polite, fast and courteous. I don't ever feel rushed and am given a five star dining experience each and every time I go. The wait staff always gives great recommendations. I am from out of town but every time I come in I try to plan at least one gathering around a meal at Wildfire...because it's just that good. I have to say though that I almost docked a star because I came in town recently and tried to see a favorite manager, Hafiz (sp?), at Wildfire but I was told he is at a different location now :(  Oh so sad because he was seriously the most fun manager I have ever encountered! He has a way of interacting with people that makes you feel like a well welcomed guest and he remember special details that make the meal more enjoyable. I think he is at a suburb location and I wish they would bring him back because it's too far to go! Anyway, I still appreciate the restaurant and will keep coming back because the food and service are TOP RATED!
