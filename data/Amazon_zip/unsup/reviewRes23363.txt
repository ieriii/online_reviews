LOVED IT. This place is off the chain. It makes me want to live off plantains and move to a tropical island. The burrito is delish, massive, and $5. $5??!! Awesome. Small quaint joint-- hot. Good music. Friendly staff makes me want to be a regular....and I will. Go here in the midst of winter to lift your spirits and warm your soul. Excellence!
