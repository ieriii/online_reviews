This is one of my favorite spots in Chicago. Once you walk in it feels like you have gone back in time. The Jazz music is one of the best I have heard. The drink prices are reasonable. It does get crowded a bit and hard to find seating but its worth it. The patrons are really friendly and don't mind sharing booths. A must date course!!!
