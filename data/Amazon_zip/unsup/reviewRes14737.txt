Pretty good sandwich and fries, but not out of this world. I also had a mango smoothie and an empanada... again, they were pretty good. I especially liked the relaxed atmosphere & friendly, attentive service. The manager(?) told us to grab a seat & order when we wanted, even though there was a line out the door... He also emphasized that he wanted us to feel at home, so we were able to grab drinks out of the fridge & grab water and salsa from the front if we wanted.... It was a nice experience, and would go back for sure.
