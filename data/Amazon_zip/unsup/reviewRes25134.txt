I'd heard tell that Geja's is the most romantic restaurant in Chicago. I've now been there twice and can only agree. My first visit was early January on my wedding night, and second was to celebrate Valentine's day with my wife, who demanded that we eat there. The atmosphere is fantastic with the low lights, exposed brickwork, and short ceilings. Also there is usually a flamenco guitarist playing. He was directly behind our table on our wedding night, and it was perfect. The staff is incredibly friendly from the valets, to the coat check, the host/hostess to the wait staff. I'd never understood the concept of describing food as orgasmic previous to trying the cheese fondue appetizer. Everything was delicious. A few things to keep in mind- they do take reservations either via phone or internet (MAKE RESERVATIONS!), the booths are much more comfortable than the tables, which can be a little small and close together, and they feature curtains which may be closed for greater privacy. Unfortunately you can only request a booth they won't guarantee one. We ended up at a table by the window overlooking the foutain outside which is pretty much equivalent to a booth. Valet parking is pretty cheap at $7, and coat check is complimentary. I found the prices rather reasonable for a romantic night out when you get the full dinners- ~$25-$50 per person includes salad, cheese fondue appetizer, main course, and dessert chocolate fondue w/ coffee. You won't be able to eat everything they bring out to you. You'll be absolutely full when you leave for hours to come. Geja's is absolutely decadent, and someplace that everyone should try at least once if not several times a year.
