My first trip to China town included dinner at Lao Sze Chuan. Wow. I had no idea Chinese (Szechuan) could be this amazing. Before you order anything they bring cabbage (I believe) in a oil with red pepper flakes... what a great way to introduce the fire that is about to be consumed. We had 2 entrees and a vegetable dish which was way too much food for two people, but provided sufficient and tasty leftovers later. You absolutely MUST try the Boiled Beef! It is definitely spicy but oh so delicious. Also very good is Tony's Chicken which has a very interesting texture because it's breaded but cooked in the wok. I honestly don't think I can eat 'regular' Chinese food ever again without thinking about Lao Sze Chaun
