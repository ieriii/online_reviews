Great location...just down the street from Congress Theater. There was plenty of parking available along the streets.  There was 10 of us in our group and we were told there was a 2-hour wait on a Saturday night. It was pretty accurate. We broke our group into two tables to get seated even sooner. Hanging out in the bar area made the time pass quickly.  I enjoyed the appetizers: mussels (delicious) and bacon fat popcorn was yummy. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich which was very tasty. Everyone else got the burgers which were just as good.  Nice portions!!! Beer of choice for me: Workingman Mild...excellent! Definitely a nice place for casual eats and good beer. It was very crowded...in turn it was quite noisy, but the overall atmosphere was fun and laid-back. I would go back again.
