Farmers and scientists should put their noggins together and find a way to genetically mutate all pigs into the color purple. Surely that is the reason why so many things at the Purple Pig tastes so fuggin delicious. To my disappointment, two items on my to-try list (pig's ear and bone marrow) were sold out. I am told this happens regularly, so hopefully you will have more luck than me. A question that has always been asked in a guy's life: are you a boobs or ass man? As it pertains to the anatomy of a pig, my answer is definitely "ass." I'm not promoting bestiality, but the pig's tail here is one of the best things I have ever experienced. The rump (not an actual spiral tail) is the perfect blend of fats, juices, and flavors that would have Sir-Mix-A-Lot raving and rapping. It is topped off with scrambled eggs and bathed in drippings. Other items that were done well were the milk braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes and the turkey leg. The meats were all succulent and taste bud pleasing. The charred cauliflower was a nice surprise since it normally is not on my list of favorite vegetables. The Lardo Costini smear was a compliment to start off the meal.  The bacon fat pork belly confit with peas and carrots could've used more pork belly because you can never go wrong with more pork belly. The homemade sausage was just average, so I would stay away from that. The prosciutto bread balls weren't very memorable. After you had meat that just melts in your mouth, you don't ever want to spend another second of your life masticating. This unfortunately was the case for the Wagyu Sirloin Tip.  The energetic atmosphere is a reflection of the food. People from one table were conversing with other tables. When you have good food and good wine, good things will follow. Come to Purple Pig and chase some tail.
