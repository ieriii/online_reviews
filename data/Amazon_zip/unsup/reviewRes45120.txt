Before going to Anteprima, I was saying for weeks that there weren't really any Italian places that I really, really liked. There are quite a few spots that I like but nowhere that I feel the need to frequent again and again. Anteprima just became that place. I was there with my fiance and future in-laws last weekend. We had a 5-star experience. They had eaten at Milk and Honey for breakfast, Gibson's for lunch, and Anteprima was far and away their favorite. First, we were ordering a bottle of wine. I had selected the Sangiovese but inquired with the waiter first before ordering. He actually down-sold me to a great bottle that we all loved. We had the veal meatballs to start which were amazing. Everyone loved their pasta also. Everything felt fresh and expertly prepared. I hadn't had pasta this good in a long while. I preferred it to even Terra Gusto which has amazing fresh pasta. I had the spaghetti which seems like a boring order. The simple things and how they are prepared though really get you to the heart of the place. I liked what I found when I got there. From there, we were excited to get at the dessert. I am a huge panna cotta fan and the lemon panna cotta was certainly calling me. Apparently our waiter thought we had waited a little too long when we sat down and they did some sort of waiter switching. This was at most a four minute wait. We made no complaints though and we were grinning ear to ear by the end of the meal. Before we could order, they brought out a panna cotta and slice of the orange cake on the house for our trouble (there was none). The panna cotta was incredible. I can't say enough good things about this experience.
