As the ratings go, this is as good as it gets. I have yet to find a better thin crust and beer combo anywhere else in Chicago as good as Piece. Large seating area and bar with multiple big screens with your favorite sports available. We had the small pizza, which could possibly serve 3-4 people with 6 thin crust slices, consisting of BBQ, Chicken, and Italian Sausage. My gf had the golden arm and I had the Top Heavy, both award winning beers. What brings people to Piece would be the award winning beer, but you definitely come back for the pizza and atmosphere.
