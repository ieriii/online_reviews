For the most part, I was pretty happy with Sapori. The restaurant is cute, and it obviously does a decent amount of business considering it was packed on a Tuesday evening. The food was great. My only major complaint is that the tables are stuffed into the restaurant very tightly, so moving around to go to the bathroom, etc. is complicated and often involves tripping. Otherwise, I liked it.
