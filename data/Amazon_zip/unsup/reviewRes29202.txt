Not a huge fan of Deep Dish in general, but of the Chicago Deep Dish joints this is probably my favorite. I went there with a group of people on Sunday night and we were able to get a table pretty quickly. Also, if you're not a big Deep Dish eater, they have thin crust (it's actually more like regular crust) pizza and it's really, really good.
