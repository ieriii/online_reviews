After all the hype I have to say I expected more. Gastropubs are my favorite type of restaurant. I look for these kind of places. Big complements on the finish-out of the restaurant. Beautiful, open, airy contemporary brewpub look. What a great room and open kitchen. Nice crowd as well, only a 20 minute wait for a table. The menu was OK. Honestly, I searched for awhile before I found something I was interested in. And then it was just settling for the Ahi tuna, which arrived pretty cold. Great salad though. The beer needs work. On the brewpub scale, Revolution rates more on the lower end, like a Rock Bottom Brewery. What I mean here is that the beer is pretty middle of the road: not too strong, not too weak, not too dark, not to hoppy, etc. Pretty bland. Contrast this with the pizza-pub "Piece" on North Avenue - where the beers tend to be more on-style and are unafraid to hop up a beer to a level that might evoke a reaction. I liked Revolution, its great to see a restaurant of this level come to the Logan Square area.
