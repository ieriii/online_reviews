We tried to eat at Anteprima on the Sunday night of Memorial Day weekend but they were so disorganized that, after waiting 40 minutes past our reservation time, we just gave up and ate somewhere else. What was particularly annoying was that when we showed up they told us that it would be a 15-20 minute wait. I specifically asked: "when you say 15-20 minutes do you really mean 40-50 minutes or is it really 15-20?". The host assured us that it would be no more than 20 because the party at our table was in the process of paying their bill. What is also annoying is that one member of our party ate there a few weeks ago and had the same problem - i.e. having to wait for an extended time past their reservation time. (By the way Anteprima doesn't even have a bar where customers can wait for their table. Instead they send you to their sister restaurant down the street.) Restaurants that can't get it organized enough to know how long it takes them to turn over tables and who then lie about the true wait time don't deserve my business. There are too many good restaurants out there that also provide good service and have respect for their patrons' time.
