Boy, I sure don't get it. I think all these ravers need to get out more. The space is attractive enough, but the food - ack. Ack ack. I had inedible fish (glad I only ate a few bites, & glad it didn't make me sick) topped with steamed bell peppers sprinkled with some sort of supermarket seasoning salt, with a huge mound of rice & a little bowl of beans. A steal at 17 bucks. The beans were OK. Companion #1 got a chicken breast deep-fried to maximum rubberyness & coated with cheese. At least, unlike the fish, it didn't taste of spoilage. #2 got a pork dish that he said was pretty good, but by then my urge to experiment had been quenched, & I was dreaming of that Pepto-Bismol bottle back home. The ropa vieja empanadas were not bad, so maybe if you order ropa vieja it'd be OK. Anyway, there are several other Cuban places in town, and from my experience all of them have much better food than this place. So chalk up another one to vapid hipsterism: everyone says this place is great, & it sure looks great, so it must be great. Right? Not right. I'd give it another try for lunch - I'm guessing they might be able to pull of a decent coffee & sandwich.
