Excellent service, server gave four great suggestions, I'll absolutely return. Appetizer-Bruschette, very good, tons of cheese on it, I've never had mozzarella that was so light and flavorful. Entre 1-Pollo Arrosto, good, juicy and flavorful whole chicken, more than enough food, took home leftovers and had them last night, which prompted me to write this review. Entre2-Penne with Italian sausage, absolutely excellent, served in what I can only describe as a giant bucket, easily two whole meals out of this dish, great as a leftover as well. Plenty of creamy sauce, lots of sausage, and more than enough cheese. Dessert-Tiramisu, the photo is completely accurate, it looked just like the photo and tasted excellent. I'm not a dessert person, but this was very good and I would order it again.  Cons-Too crowded, I was getting bumped all night, they tried to put 50 tables in a space for 30. Table was too small for two people, a bottle of wine, appetizer, and dinner plates. A little pricey but not terrible, good for a "one nice night out a week" type of couple. Overall a good experience, I'll go back. Great for kids, the little girl at the table beside us had a sweet mural going on the paper table cloth.
