GROUPON USERS: WAIT UNTIL AFTER YOU ORDER TO PRESENT YOUR GROUPON. YOU WILL BE TREATED LIKE AN ASSHOLE (at least if you get the waitress that looks like she belongs on that old show Rosanne) IF YOU TELL HER YOU HAVE ONE WHEN YOU ARE SEATED!!!  This is the second time I had been here. First time was without a groupon years ago and I remember it only as being a pleasant experience. The second time was a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!  First of all, let me just say that I have a Cuban abuela so I am spoiled when it comes to the good Cuban food department. The food here is good. I will totally give them that. They REALLY need to hire a couple more people to act as servers. We were waiting way too long to put our drinks/dinner/ then dessert in. I almost felt embarrassed when our dinner come out almost immediately.. Good indicator that the kitchen staff and runners are functioning well, but it speaks volumes about the wait staff. I just really hate that when I go to a restaurant I get the feeling like if the server stays too long at our table they might get the weird disease that gives you the awesome hair and tattoos that my husband and I have. We were at the place for 1 hour and 45 mins and I felt like our drinks, dessert, and check were thrown at our table in passing!  OK, I got a groupon for this meal but we still had a bill that was around $45 with the $20 already off. We aren't cheap. I felt bad when I tipped 15%- but I really felt that the service sucked.  Food- don't get the tostones. 4 flavorless plantain slices for $4.  - avocado/grapefruit salad - small for $6 and the avocados and grapefruit were left plain, but the dressing on the lettuce was good. - Baked goat cheese- nothing to write home about, but you can't really mess up goat cheese. - Husband liked his Mexican steak dish. -Best Cafe con Leche in the city. Better than Cafe Bolero and that place, Cafe con Leche- by far! - Baked chocolate dessert was OK. Tasted good, but it was really undercooked in the middle.
