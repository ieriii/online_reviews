We recently stayed at your hotel for the Travel Goods Show 2011, in Chicago. I was extremely impressed of your entire hotel staff from the Bell Service to the Front Desk, and Security. Bell Service personnel,Jacob, he was amazing at how quickly he can load up my full size vehicle and unload my many boxes and luggages onto the cart was impressive. Your Front Desk Staff was extremely smart and understanding of our many complicated request. We have many packages deliver to the hotel prior to our arrivals, and they were all there with 1 phone call from the Front Desk, with no missing packages at all. The morning drinks for us as selected guest was more than enough.
