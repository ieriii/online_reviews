Drinks took forever! The four dishes we ordered arrived before our drinks did! Food was good. Peas with bacon was great. Buratta with peas, celery and radicchio was amazing!!! Whipped feta want my thing, the people I were with liked it but I didn't care for it. Coppa was good! Come early....a long wait time is bound to increase as the night goes on. service sucked.
