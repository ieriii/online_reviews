I came here on a Sunday afternoon with two other first-timers. It was a little warm, but we were glad to have the option to sit casually outside at one of their umbrella tables. After hearing the hype of this place, I was surprised to see that you order and pay for your meal before finding a place to sit down. The coffee was delicious and served in huge cups. My iced coffee was rich and delicious and the look on my two peeps face was of satisfaction over their huge cups of hot coffee. Two of us ordered the egg panini and one ordered the bagles and lox with a side of scrambled eggs. I was bummed that both the special of the day and the huevos rancheros were out by the time I arrived, but I was very happy after my first bite of the breakfast panini. Everyone was satisfied and I plan to go back soon! So much more to try and my first experience was successful enough to go back!
