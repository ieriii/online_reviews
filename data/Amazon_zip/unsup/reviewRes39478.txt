I guess it's love or hate with this place for most people. Personally, I enjoy myself whenever I'm here. The concept is fun. If you have more than two people in your party, they bring grills out to your table and you cook your own meats right there. You may think this is kind of a cop out, but I like the idea. You finish it exactly the way you like. The selection of various meats is nice too. Various kinds of beef, pork, chicken and seafoods. And the many side dishes are really cool. Depending on which meats you get, you may get a couple different bowls of sides. A friend of mine loves the krill and always asks them for it. You get lettuce leaves, cook your meat, put a piece of meat and a bit of a side on the leaf, and eat it kind of like a wrap. They have a very nice selection of Asian beers. OB Lager is a very nice Korean brew that complements the food well. They also have Korean liquors and some wines that I've never tried. I'd really like to try the liquor sometime. The primary complaint about this place is that the service is rude. From experience I can say the wait staff can sometimes be brusque but I haven't ever seen them be outright rude (granted I've only eaten here 4 or 5 times). On at least one occasion they were very friendly. The last time I went, they had expanded into the shop next door and moved the entrance over there, too, which added much-needed space. It was quite small and cramped before. The worst thing is the useless parking lot, although that's not really the restaurant's fault. The lot holds a total of about 8 cars, so your best bet is to either take the bus or park on a side street (which I always do without too much trouble).
