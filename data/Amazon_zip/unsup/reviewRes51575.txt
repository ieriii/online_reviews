I ordered the avocado burrito. This was by far the worst burrito I have ever had. It had no flavor to it at all. They literally stuffed a bunch of avocado in a tortilla with sour cream and cheese (which I had to pay extra for.) It was so bland. My fiance had a chicken burrito, which was a little better than mine but not much. The chips and salsa were good, but we will not be going back.
