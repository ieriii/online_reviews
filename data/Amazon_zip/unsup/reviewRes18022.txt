Our fancy pants supper club came here a week or so ago based on a recommendation from one of our friends. The front is not much of a looker but inside the walls are plastered with bright, colorful art and paintings and it's a welcoming space. The tables are super close together but when we were there at 6:30pm on a Monday night it was comfortably crowded and luckily no one was sitting at the almost adjacent table. The best part is that it's BYOB with no corkage fee...woot. We downed two bottles of red like it was no thang and devoured some serious plates of carbs. I read here on Yelp that the Spinach Gnocchi was pretty fabulous so that's what I ordered and yay for cream sauce. That is why I work out. Husband wanted to be a copier but he chose the gnocchi special, stuffed with asiago cheese in a creamy tomato sauce. I tried mine and thought it was heavenly. Then I tried his and thought mine sucked, that's how good his was. I stole three more pieces before he gave me a look that told me he was going to stab me in the wrist with his fork if I took any more. And then I proceeded to eat all but four pieces of my gnocchi so it definitely wasn't bad but I was staring longingly at his plate for awhile. Overall, definite thumbs up. The homemade pasta dishes hover right around $18-$23 a plate, but if you're not a hoss like me, you can eat half and be comfortably full and eat the other half for lunch the next day. That was the plan that flew out the window after a few bites. Skip the side salad though, nothing fancy for $8.
