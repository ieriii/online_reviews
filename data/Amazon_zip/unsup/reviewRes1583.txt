Hot Doug's is amazing. It has just enough kitsch on the walls coupled with absolutely great weiners. Gourmet weiners. On my first visit it was probably 102 degrees heat index and Hot Doug's was not cool inside. It was freaking warm, i was definitely really sweaty. My duck and jalapeno sausage was great but it was just too hot outside to enjoy a heavy weiner. On my way home I felt nauseated and disgusted. I'm not a quitter though. I knew the deliciousness of Hot Doug's and vowed to return and I must say, when the weather dips below 70, that is the time to go for a crazy sausage. I had the pork sausage last weekend with blue cheese and it was amazing. The duck fat fries were a bit of a letdown as they imparted little duck taste, but were still delicious. I don't think they serve beer there but I wonder if I could bring one. A brat and a beer sounds pretty great right now.
