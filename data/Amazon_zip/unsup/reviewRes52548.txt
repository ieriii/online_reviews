If you are big meat eater you should go Brazzaz, all you can eat one price brazilian steak and seafood will serve you. I like their beef and lamb a lot it's so tasty. The way they serve the meat is kinda cool, Master cutters walk around the restaurant with different selections of meat on a stick. If you are interested you flip your colored coin on your table and they stop. Fun! I love their bread a lot I bet I can eat 10 of them one time.  Open salad bar and seafood were clean, friendly server all around you and I never get disappointed from them. Nice decor and good selection of wine list, really, grade A+ overall rating
