I love India House! Its absolutely the best Indian food in Chicago.....and yes I love Devon St, too. The great food, nice atmosphere and outstanding service combo at I.H. make it the best. I love the masala sauce they serve when you sit down - I could seriously drink it....its orange, delicious and served with naan. The samosas are awesome, the entrees are great, they have a wonderful, vast vegetarian section of the menu and a decent wine list. Channa Masala is highly recommended! The service is wonderful - complete with hot towel treatment! Parking sucks, but totally worth the trip. And a little pricey but nice for a quiet dinner with a friend or a date.
