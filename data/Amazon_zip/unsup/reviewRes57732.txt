Admittedly, I'm a fan. I've been coming here for years and decided I should chip in my two cents. I would call the menu true cafe-style: not especially expansive or adventurous but uniformly high-quality, the curried chicken salad and lox plate being standouts. But the reason I'm a regular here has to do with what makes this place unique: it is the rare place where you can go to chill, read, get a great cup of coffee as well as a drink (they have a fully stocked bar) in a great atmosphere. Come for dinner or an afternoon with a book.
