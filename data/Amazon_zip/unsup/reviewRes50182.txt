Came here for some Birthday lunch with my BF and I have to say my Turkey Burger was amaz..the sweet potatoe fries delish! And I had a couple tasty drinks. Our waitress was sweet and helpful, which is always a plus. It was lunch time and not too much was going on but it was nice to be able to just sit and enjoy good food and drinks without the crowd. I do plan to return one of these nights just to see how I feel about the night crowd... Hopefully they don't disappoint... I recommend.
