Really? Everyone really loves their pizza that much? Is it maybe because they are OD'ed on cheesy gooey deep dish pizza in Chicago? To be honest, I haven't been to Napoli recently, but let me say that I had better Italian wood-fired pizza in Kathmandu (really, I did. Oh, how I wish that I could review restaurants in Nepal on yelp...). My funghi pizza was so soggy that I didn't want to finish my pizza. And that's just unheard of. The service wasn't so great either. Yes, they were nice enough to seat us before our party was complete (granted, the restaurant was empty at 5pm) but our server didn't know his pizzas very well. You see, I *hate* sliced California olives that come out of a can and he was not able to assure me that they were not of that type. So, 2 stars for the pizza but one extra star for the hostess.
