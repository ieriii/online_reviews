My wife and I went to the Mayan Palace 2 years ago for the first time because they had great Yelp reviews on Margaritas! Since then, we've been on a first name basis with a good portion of the staff. Which either means we're psycho or they're exceptional at their job! Well, we're only a little psycho! But I digress. The margaritas are worth their accolades on Yelp, no doubt. But what kept us coming back on a weekly basis is the service and the food.    The service is unbelievably friendly and quick. It is a family run place and the owner Rudy is frequently there. Sometimes he's even in the kitchen cooking it up! The wait staff is wonderful. Our personal favorite is Augustine. Ask for him and you'll experience a humble professional who seems to truly enjoy the service industry.    I judge a Mexican restaurant on their rice, beans, and mole sauce. This is the best I've had so far in Chicago in all 3 categories! In fact, they have two different types of mole sauces, a red and a green. I suggest ordering them with your chips and salsa at the beginning of your meal. They're wonderful. The green is sweet and interesting. The red is bitter with a hint of chocolate, just as it should be. I hate it when mole sauce tastes like a melted Hershey's bar! Some Mexican restaurants serve rice that tastes like it came right out of an instant box. It's not soft, too big, and tastes like it was seasoned by a 1st grader. Mayan P's rice is perfect. It's exactly like what I remember eating, growing up as a kid. My aunt would make the most delicious rice. She ran a Mexican restaurant and had rice making down to a science. So it is of the highest compliment I could give to say that Mayan P's rice reminds me of my aunts!    I absolutely recommend this place and think that if you know true authentic Mexican food, you will love and appreciate this place. Also, hit it up early on a Tuesday or Thursday. Those are the 1/2 price Margarita nights! 4 bucks!
