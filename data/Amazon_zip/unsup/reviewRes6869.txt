This was a great place. I was there on a 2nd date and it was perfect. Great service, food, and atmosphere. I had a reservation at 7:30pm on a Friday and arrived a little before that time. My date and I were seated in less then 5 minutes and had our drinks just as quick. Our waiter was a perfect mix of attention and allowing us space and time to eat, drink and socialize. The food was great and the cost was about correct too. Great time. I'll be back.
