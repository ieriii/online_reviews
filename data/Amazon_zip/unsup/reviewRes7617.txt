Best Churrascaria in Chicago in my opinion. I have been here several times and never been disappointed. The salad bar is huge, everything is fresh and of high quality and the side dishes like crispy polenta, savory mashed potatoes and fried bananas are great. But the star is naturally the all-you-can-eat meat, over a dozen different kinds brought to you on swords and sliced by gauchos right at your table. The atmosphere is sophisticated yet comfortable with white tablecloths and exposed wood beams. This is a perfect place to bring a date (that loves meat of course. I would definitely recommend you get reservation.
