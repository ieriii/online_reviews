This is the best pan pizza I've found in the city. The crust is excellent on this very filling deep dish pizza. They could give a little more when it comes to toppings, but other than that it's perfect. The place is more of a diner than a restaurant, having no servers. Also they close kind of early, which is probably the only reason I don't go there for pizza every time.
