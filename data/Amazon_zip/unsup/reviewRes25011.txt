I don't have a lot to say that hasn't already been said. We started out with the guacamole... I'm glad we got it "spicy," which meant there was a pile of seeded, minced jalapenos on the side. Without the jalapenos, the guac may have been a little on the bland side (although very fresh), but with the jalapenos, it was pretty good. Even my husband, who can't handle much spice, was adding the jalapenos. I had an oatmeal shake, and hubby had an oatmeal-banana. I was very uncertain about getting an oatmeal shake, but I'm really glad that I listened to everyone's advice and tried it.... it was PHENOMENAL! I enjoyed it so much and can't wait to have another! The oatmeal-banana was excellent as well. For dinner, I had the veggie burrito (w/ sauteed mushrooms) and my husband had the chicken burrito. We were both very pleased with our meals and left w/ half our food as leftovers. Menu prices are SO reasonable... you get such a bang for your buck at Irazu! We also each had a side order of sweet plaintains-- yum. I love me some plaintains! Our server was excellent-- the best service I've had lately, for sure. No complaints, and we'll absolutely be back!
