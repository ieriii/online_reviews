this is also one of my favorite italian restaurants in chicago!! the food, the wine, the ambiance....all great! its quite noisy in there tho, so be prepared to flex ur voice box. =) great for friends, family and lovers. it can be a bit pricey depending on what you order. expect (with bottle of wine and appetizers) to pay $60-100+ for dinner for 2. make sure u call ahead for reservations!!
