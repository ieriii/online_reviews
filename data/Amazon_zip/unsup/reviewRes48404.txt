Going in with high expectations, this was a real bummer. In theory, I like the communal table, specialty beer, and meaty menu, but there was a lot that was just not executed in the way that I would have expected. Firstly, echoing some of the sentiments already here, the beer list is not all that impressive compared to some of the other gastropubs and specialty shops already in the city, and it is definitely a bit overpriced. I'm all for paying the extra when the joint has gone above and beyond to attract some unique offerings, but this is just not the case. As some have said, the Hopleaf stands as a much better option on both selection and price. The communal seating is awkward. We had done it at Avec and Urban Belly recently and enjoyed both experiences much more. The tables here are both too big (too high and too long) and too cramped. We didn't have people seated next to us but the empty chairs still seemed to box us in. Perhaps adjacent diners would have made it seem less unnecessary. The place was conspicuously empty at 7p on our Friday night visit. The food was the best part, but it was overpriced for the size of the portions. The oysters were excellent - fresh, cold, delicious. Smoked trout was very nice, and the country ribs were the highlight of the meal. Yet, we had no desire to order dessert as we were quite happy to leave as soon as we could.
