Would it be weird to admit that I would willingly take a bath in a vat of their rice pudding? Because I totally would. Repeatedly. And it would be DELICIOUS. (Tasty cheap Greek food, lively atmosphere, minus one star for lame service but not service so lame that I won't be back for more rice pudding!)
