Was seriously underwhelmed, by both the pizza and the service. On Saturday at 6pm, we counted at least nine staff members, four of whom were just standing around the hostess station looking surly while we sat dying for refills. Pizza was eh; not really thin crust, more like a hand-tossed, and pretty bland. Breaded zucchini was good (little chips vs. the standard fries). Will not go back unless Potbelly's and Thai Wild Ginger next door are both closed.
