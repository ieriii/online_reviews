I've been to Schwa before and feel it's a top top restaurant, but what makes it great also had me more than miffed. I get that it's busy, small and very popular = hard to get a table. I was very disappointed when my reso which had to be made 4 weeks in advance was cancelled less than two hours by the restaurant because "the chef can't make it in tonight." The next available table for a similar night/time was another 3 weeks out. I get that things pop up, but this isn't the first complaint I've heard about him being "a bit flakey" I'll be back for sure, but c'mon guys, a bit of professionalism. I'm sure it takes more than 2 hours to prep, don't cancel at last last minute.
