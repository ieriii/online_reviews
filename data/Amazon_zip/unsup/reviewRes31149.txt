They get one star because there is not an option for zero.  My visit was awful from start to finish. A group of 7 had a reservation for 7:30 on a Saturday night. We were not seated until 8:45. Since the waiting area is all of 100 square feet, the bar had to suffice. This would have been fine had the bar not taken the waiting-area overflow for 100 other people leaving it shoulder to shoulder packed - further exacerbated by the fact that each patron had to move when a server needed to get through. I understand the unpredictability of a restaurant in Chicago on Saturday night but I also realize that there are numerous other steakhouses in the city that have figured out how to forecast for these types of things.  Upon being seated, I made the utterly incomprehensible presumption that we would get our drink order taken and filled in a timely fashion. When our drinks arrived 30 minutes later I was more than ready to leave. Being in a group, I did not have said choice, and had to wait until 9:45 to be served.  I got a ribeye and it was cooked properly, but I would have preferred leather. It was the most gristle-laden piece of meat I have consumed in quite some time. This was interesting to me seeing as how the steak cost around $50. The sides were unremarkable and the dessert even less so.  Don't do this to yourself, dont waste 3 hours and 100's of dollars on a frustrating mediocre meal. Go to Chicago Cut.
