Love at first bite! Or maybe first sip. The tamarind margarita with chipotle salt rim was the first taste which caused the "Oh, MY! This is AMAZING!" reaction. I am currently restricted to no gluten and no dairy, yet I dined like a queen at Frontera Grill. Tthere was the fresh salsas for the chips. If you can tolerate heat, taste the smoky smooth habanero salsa. Yum! Onward to the shrimp dish with fiddlehead ferns with full, and yet nuanced, flavors. The duck breast had an ancho chili sauce which perfectly balanced spicy hot with a little sweet and a little salty. Frontera knows how to expertly caramelize the onions and vegetables. And then the side order of beans which was almost like a soup... take some chips and break them up to add a nice crunch. We brought our 7-year old and they actually had a "kids menu." My son ordered the tortilla soup. with the house-made sour cream on the side. Although he believed he didn't like sour cream, he exclaimed, "This is the best sour cream I've ever tasted in my life." As a final sweet treat, Chocolate Ice where all the rich, vibrate taste fills ones mouth, heart, and mind with love and devotion to the cocoa bean. Rick Bayless and all the staff at Frontera, THANKS!
