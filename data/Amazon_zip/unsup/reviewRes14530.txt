Good, yes. Amazing?... Look if you give everything you try five stars, it's really hard to sort out what's actually great. Maybe people in Chicago just want to be nice all the time. The Cafe is quite good. The people who work there are very nice. We've been twice and tried a variety of items. It was filling, tasty, but not what I would call a five star experience. Five star means I drool over it, I think about going there all the time, I plan it. 90 Miles feels like it wants to be that kind of spot, but didn't quite make it for me. It was ok, worth trying, but not mind blowing. You go, you decide. I'm sure I'll go there again sometime but thusfar I've heard a lot of hype about Chicago food and haven't found one place to put on a list of reliable weekly or bi-weekly visits.
