Saturday night, I had the pleasure of dining at Gilt Bar. I shouldn't even use the word 'pleasure' because honestly, I don't know how I'll ever eat the peasant crap I cook every day again after eating this meal.  The ambiance was great and the cocktails were to die for. But, that's nothing compared to the food. Oh the FOOD. We started off with ham and cheese fondue. I know, you're thinking that sounds amazing. And you're right! The only thing that could've made this better was putting an egg on top so the gooey yolk could add richness...oh, wait - there WAS an egg on top! My friend literally had to stop me from licking the bowl. I then gave myself a little pep talk: "that was only the appetizer...try to keep it classy, girl!" What? Doesn't everyone give themselves pep talks? No? Hmm, awkward. Luckily I managed to pull myself together for the ricotta gnocchi with pancetta, corn and tarragon. There are truly no words for this dish. I wanted to lay my head on the fluffy pillows of gnocchi, but the desire to consume the trifecta of flavors created by the pancetta, corn and tarragon stopped me. The simple, delicate flavors were just incredible.  OK, just writing this is making me drool.... And if you're still reading this, you're an idiot for sitting in front of your computer instead of RUNNING to Gilt Bar for dinner!
