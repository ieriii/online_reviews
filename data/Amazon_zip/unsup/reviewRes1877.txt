Best Hot dog place I found in Chicago so far. Very proud and Artsy place. You can even et memorabila. Always be prepared for a 45 minute line outside of the place if there isnt one thats not normal. They have hotdoges I never heard of in my life. They are so good. I got the Foie Gra one and a grilled Chicago Style one. Both were Marvelous. Prepare to adjust the belt buckle of one of these dogs. They seve Duck fat fries unfortunatly just on the weekends
