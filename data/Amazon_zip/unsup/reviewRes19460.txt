Really? Reeeeally? I've really never written a review of coast. Yikes. Been coming here for over five years for any special occasion I can dream up. Mostly because Coast takes sushi beyond the level you expect out of any casual-style sushi joint on the block... or the entire city. I'm not going to take any time talking about what makes sushi good. Let's put it this way, if it's not fresh, clean and tasty, we're probably not Yelping about it. So let's get straight to what makes Coast different. First, the quality is superb--that's not really a difference maker, it's just something to know. Second, don't mess around with the menu. Ask about the specials and just say 'yes, please... yes, all of them. Yes, yes, all of them, thanks.' If you want the standard spicy tuna and spider rolls, come on in. If you want innovative specials and cool rolls that will blow your mind and your taste buds, welcome home. Add BYOB and a tight atmosphere (even in far-over-uber-hyped Buck/Wick), and I hope you wash up on this coast.
