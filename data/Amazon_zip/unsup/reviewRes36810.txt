This place is heavenly. My mom and I went here on Saturday and waited for about 15 minutes, which was fine, because we had coffee at the place they sent us- I think it was called the 9 Muses? Anyway, I ordered one of the specials, Granola Cakes-which came with fresh berries and whipped honey butter and syrup. I also got the grapefruit orange juice, and a side of baby red potatoes. Need I say more? Everybody needs to go here to experience the magic. I can't wait to try their chocolate morsel pancakes.
