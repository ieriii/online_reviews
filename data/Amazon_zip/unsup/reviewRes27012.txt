First, let's cover the basics: Cash Only. Parking in private lot on the corner of 18th and Laflin. Validate at the cashier. BYOB. Now, onto the food! This was my second visit to Nuevo Leon and the service and food has proven consistent. The server quickly lined up three different kinds of salsas, a bowl of peppers, and some tortilla chips. She then brought us some limes for our Pacifico (BYOB!), quickly followed by free taquitos. For appetizers, we had mini quesadillas and nachos. both were quite good! For our entrees, I and a friend both ordered enchiladas, the hubby had tacos, and another friend had this yummy-looking shish-ka-bob type thing. It looked so good that I had to actually sit on my hands to keep from accidentally stealing food off his plate! While my enchiladas were good, I'll definitely order this shish-ka-bob thing next time.
