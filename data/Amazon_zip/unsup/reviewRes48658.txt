You will sweat pork and beer after you eat here. Went with a good mate also from NYC who happened to be in Chicago for a work trip. Great looking space, an airy, open, and well-lit beer hall vibe with some communal seating, some great booths and a few regular tables at the front. Food was solid, beer selection is excellent (many trappistes and belgian ales). Amongst other things, we had the suckling pig, pork rinds, brussels sprouts and an excellent salad of beets and delicious burrata. We ended with some kind of house digestif which tasted like abinthe or chartreuse. Bad-ass man dinner. Also, the waitress was gorgeous and very friendly. We chatted about her Vietnamese roots and travels to South East Asia. It was a great experience and I'd go back again.
