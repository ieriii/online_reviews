Finally made it to the Chicago Diner this weekend...as a new vegetarian I was really psyched to get to this spot that came highly recommended from my meat-eating friends...the vibe was really fun and not as edgey as I had expected and the food was incredible! The "chorizo" burrito was one of the best ever and the titanic BLT was pretty awesome for a veggie burger. But that burrito was simply the absolute best ever, hands down! For dessert we got a vanilla shake and officially found the best shakes in the city! I will be back - regularly! If you've lived in Chicago for a while and haven't been - get there!!! I'm already planning my next trip so I can try out more of their menu! :)
