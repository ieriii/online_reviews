Went on superbowl evening. Like many Chicago eateries you walk in and they try to seat you in the worst seat in the restaurant i.e. right outside the bathroom door. We ask the the greeters if we can move to another table and he says no because he wants to take care of the waiter! In addition they sat us next to a large group of loud potato factory workers. A very unpleasant evening made worse by the waiter standing over us while we calculated the tip. This place is a bomb - do not go! Pete.
