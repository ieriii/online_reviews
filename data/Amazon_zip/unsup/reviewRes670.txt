I'll make this quick...this was the best birthday dinner I've ever had. From the moment we walked in I was incredibly impressed by the service and ambiance of Alinea. Dinner was served over the course of 4 hours (which may seem long but we were enjoying ourselves, were in no rush, and probably extended the process) and each course was more inspired than the next (and there are quite a few courses). All I have to say is the food was AMAZING. You'd have to go yourself because anything I type won't do it justice. The chef even mailed a sign copy of the menu to me (at my request).
