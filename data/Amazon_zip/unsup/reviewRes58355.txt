I found this little place from the Chicago Scene magazine so I thought that I would give it a try. I must say that when you go you will feel as if you are in the hood, but the place is very nice. It is kind of small but the whole thing opens up to the side walk and if it is nice out there is a huge patio to enjoy. The food is excellent. It was a little busy when I was there so i did experience a little wait, but definitely worth it. On their website they have a virtual walk-Through you can walk through the whole establishment. The link for that is:http://showcase.neustep.Check it out!
