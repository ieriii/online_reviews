Note to myself: do not go to a restaurant the day a groupon is expiring. it was madness! 2 hour wait for walk ins. Thankfully, we had a reservation and considering the bar was jammed with people shoulder to shoulder, I am really impressed that we were seated within 15 minutes of our reservation time.  We expected poor service due to the crowds. But again we were pleasantly surprised. The service was really good and the food was fantastic! And the wine was cheap. What more can I say.
