My wife and I travel to Chicago several times per year. About two months ago, we were walking through downtown. Around 10:00, we wanted a late dinner. We saw Ruth Chris and decided to give it a try. Even at this late hour, the place was packed. We were greeted by a very friendly young lady who seated us at the bar promptly. It is hard not to be impressed by the interior design and architecture of this place. It is truly stunning.Our Bartender was an extremely pleasant young man in his upper 30's with curly hair. We ordered a couple of drinks, a seafood appetizer and our entrees. I ate the seafood; and was excellent. The bartender and I talked about how it was prepared - similar to his family recipe... (Joe is his name) Joe kept us on our toes with funny stories and nice compliments- I almost forgot to try the seafood special I had ordered! It did not disappoint; nor did my wife's meal, but Joe was the highlight of our dining experience. Needless to say, this was an excellent experience. In a crowded, somewhat loud, steakhouse in the the heart of Chicago; I felt like I was having dinner at friend's home. My only regret is that I don't remember Joe's (I think his name was Joe) last name so I could publicly acknowledge his incredible service. Unfortunately, we didn't have time to speak to the manager before we left, and rave about this rare experience. My wife and I live in Cincinnati and we are both pretty high on the food chain where we work. If half of my or my Wife's employees/co-workers were as friendly, experience, or knowledgeable as Joe is our company would be better off! My wife and I will now always go to Ruth Chris to see Joe, he gives great information and puts a big smile on our face! Now we have a favorite place to go in Chicago no matter the occation...Thanks Joe! We will see you real soon!!!
