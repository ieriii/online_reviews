Finally I made it to Uncommon Ground in Edgewater last Friday... partly for the band ODE but also for the food and Tree-Tinis I tried at the Yelp Holiday Party. Not only are Tree-Tinis delicious and pretty much guarantee a hangover-free day post-imbibing (you can thank the VeeV for that), but Uncommon Ground will plant a tree for each Tree-Tini ordered. Now that's what I call feel-good drinking! We had a 9 pm reservation and were led to the best table in the room-- right in front, close to the stage. A sheer coincidence, but a very nice one considering we're friends of the band. We settled in all comfy and admired our beautiful surroundings-- per Colleen C's review, this space really does feel like a sanctuary. All zen but without the granola: just serene, classy and smart. I dig it! So I was planning on ordering a Tree-Tini, but then I eyed their beer menu. Bell's Oberon, Goose Island Matilda, and Great Lakes Holy Moses? And on tap? Easy and delicious decision. We ordered the Mediterranean Trio as an app (hummus, roast eggplant salad, mint tzatziki, citrus marinated olives, herbed pita) and we devoured it. Even my cousin, a professed non-lover of hummus (the blasphemy!), had her way with it. Yes, it is that good. Next up: Black Angus burger, Prairie Pure mac n' cheese, the pesto, 3 cheese and tomato pizza, and the Helen's grilled chicken sandwich. Talk about a coup-- all four of us were happy little campers, which is a rare feat! But if I had to settle on one dish, I'd wholeheartedly recommend the mac n' cheese: prairie pure butterkase, aged white cheddar, Gruyere, with tart apple slaw. WIN. After dinner we enjoyed another beer at the bar. Our experience was top-notch and I can't wait to return... okay, so the mac n' cheese might have a *little* something to do with it!
