I got the veggie burrito, and it was alright. It was huge so I had to use a knife and fork to cut it up. Either way, i ended up just digging everything out and eating with the fork. Needless to say, it was a mess. The hot peppers tasted like cleaning solution.....it was weird. and my friend ordered the pepito sandwich which came without the sauce it said it comes with on the menu. She wouldn't ask the waiter for the sauce but ate it anyways. She thought it was a bit dry and didnt like it too much - even though she was the one who was dying to try this restaurant. The oatmeal shake was interestingly good though.
