I went here while I was on my vegetarian kick with my best friend who is vegan. It was crowded but we got a table almost instantly. It took a while to get a server but he was really nice and helpful. We started off with the BBQ ribs which were kinda cold. I wasn't impressed since I found better vegetarian ones in the freezer section of the local Jewel. I had a fakin cheeseburger with the jimica fries. My friend, the gyros with the jimica fries. Let me start this by saying I had been living the vegetarian life style for about a year at this point and had a hankering for red medium rare beef and a crispy slice of bacon for months that wouldn't let up....My burger just was ok. It just lacked the juicyness of real beef and the texture was just off for me. I will give the Chicago Diner credit, it was tasty and satisfying (I at it all) but I wanted the real thing. My friends vegan gyros were much more tasty than my burger....Maybe it's because the gyro "meat" had a similar texture to real gyros. The jimica fries were odd. When I hear fries I think crispy hot fried vegetables...Wrong, these were raw jimica sticks tossed in a sauce. They were different and tasty but again, they didn't satisfy my craving for a bacon cheese burger and fries (aka heart attack on a plate). I wish we would have saved room for dessert because those looked amazing.... Well a week after my visit to the Chicago Diner, I bowed out of vegetarianism and ate my real bacon cheese burger with french fries fo ....needless to say, I felt much better after eating the vegetarian version than I did the real version. Will I go back to the Chicago Diner? Yes...my vegan friend is dying to return. Will I eat the fakin cheeseburger? I will pass but maybe I will try the eggplant parmesan or someother vegetable based dish that I can fairly compare with it's non veggie counterpart.
