2 Disclaimers: 1. I don't drink. Really I don't. 2. And I don't eat pork, so don't know anything about the famous bacon popcorn. And yet, I've been here twice and will return. This place is beautifully decorated. They've done a great job with the space, and I love the atmosphere. The thai salad is delicious and so are the fries. And they kept my Diet Coke flowing, thank you very much. The service is always good - fast and friendly. We've been for lunch once and dinner once. Parking can be a challenge but that's not surprising.
