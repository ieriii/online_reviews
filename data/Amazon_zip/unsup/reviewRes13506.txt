Every time we come here we stumble across yet another deliciously unhealthy entree that becomes an instant favorite. There's literally nothing on the menu that either I or one of my friends hasn't tried and loved. Since we're a share-and-share alike bunch, tastes get passed around and our compliments get sent to the hard-working chefs of the Revolutionary. The mini beers are trouble though. It's way too easy to drink 15 of those and think you aren't really wrecking your train by doing so. My only complaint is that they've become too popular and both the wait and service demeanor is starting to rival other overblown gastropubs. Don't become that kind of place, Revolution! Stay strong, fight for the people!
