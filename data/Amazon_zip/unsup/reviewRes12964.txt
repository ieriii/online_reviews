I've been here twice before for brunch for friends, and I was eager to take my husband here, since he loves Latin food. Unfortunately, dinner did not live up to my brunch experiences. The bacon-wrapped date appetizer was delicious. But both our entrees were bland and forgettable. I had the almond-crusted halibut; the fish was nicely cooked, but I couldn't tell you what was in the sauce that accompanied it. Virtually tasteless. My husband's chicken was unremarkable - and if you're going to charge $21 for a chicken entree, it oughta sing! I would go here again for brunch, but nothing else. Too bad.
