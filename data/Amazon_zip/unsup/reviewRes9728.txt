This place is one of my favorite restaurants of all time. The first time i ate here was on a business trip in San Francisco. The client had recommended it and for very good reason, it was a great dining experience. I recently moved to Chicago and found out there they have a second location here. the Chicago location is just as good as the SF one. One of my all time favorite restaurants, period.
