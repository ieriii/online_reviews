We went here upon recommendation from everyone and well, honestly, it was not the most awesome experience. Granted, the sandwiches are good, they are not extremely good enough that would require one to go through the ordeal of waiting 1 hour to get a table or 20 mins to get a sandwich. It is a glorified sandwich shop, that is a fast food chipotle type place. The churros and hot chocolate were nothing special and I do not plan to visit this place again.
