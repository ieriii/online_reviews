Love this place! We have had large birthday parties here, date nights, dinner with kids, families...everyone we bring to Simply It just loves this place! Avocado chicken is excellent (the sauce is TDF). Pho is superb and salmon in clay pot is delicious. Very reasonably priced and BYO - what's not to love?
