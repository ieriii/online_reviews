How can you dine at a restaurant with an open mind after it has canceled the day of your reservation THREE consecutive times? I can't and will not. My friends and I have had a table for four at Schwa three different times all to be canceled on the day-of. The first two cancelations were both within two hours of the reservation and the third cancelation was four hours before we were due there. Thank goodness I wasn't entertaining business associates or guests from out of town. This behavior is unacceptable, disrespectful, and untolerable.  Instead of taking our wallets to Schwa we will continue exploring Chicago's culinary scene elsewhere.
