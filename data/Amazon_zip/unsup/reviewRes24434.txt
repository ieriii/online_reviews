I bought a groupon for Geja's (25 for 50) and took my girlfriend here for Valentines day weekend. We had heard really good reviews and I would give a 4 star for sure but for some rude comments by our waiter. When we sat down, our server went through the menu with us and only showed us the special, expensive, meal options. This irks me A LOT because I don't want to be 'sold' when I go out to eat. When we ordered the less expensive, cheese & chocolate fondue (total came out to about $47) which is all we wanted (this is more than enough too; you'll be stuffed), the waiter made a comment about us not taking advantage of the groupon, clearly disappointed that we didn't order any of his expensive suggestions. Not only did his comment make no sense, but it also felt like we were a waste of his time at that point. Anyway, the service was quick thereafter so I was pleased with that...I just couldn't get over how obnoxious he was at first. As for the food: I'm Swiss, so I am quite picky when it comes to cheese fondue. I thought it was a little on the creamy side and it didn't have quite the kick my homemade fondues have. Don't get me wrong, it was still very good. The chocolate fondue was AMAZING. We got a huge assortment of various goodies to dip in the chocolate, including marshmallows, fruit, and rice krispie treats. Delicious...definitely have this be part of your order!
