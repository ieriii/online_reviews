Went back for a second visit last night for a celebratory dinner. I haven't been in several years, but its always held a special place in my memory. And, it lived up to it again! Food - absolutely delicious. All, delicately spiced with wonderful flavors. We shared the shrimp on sugarcane appetizer, had the tofu/lotus root salad, and shared the sea bass dinner. everything was fantastic. The tofu& lotus root salad is one NOT TO BE MISSED. We noticed that every table around us had ordered it as well - the chili garlic sauce on the salad, was out of this world. If I could, I would sip it from a straw all day long. We were too full to order a dessert - the portion sizes were perfect to split between two people. Ambiance - My husband and I traveled to Vietnam a few years back, and this place really had that French Indochine atmosphere. It is so lovely and really lets you leave the city environment and pretend you're somewhere else. Most restaurants these day seem to just do the "trendy" decor thing. Its nice to see a restaurant, with beautiful, authentic ambiance. Service - While we felt our server was a bit awkward at times, there is no arguing that he wasn't there at any moment when you needed something. Could have been better at recommendations on the menu, etc. But, all in all, the experience was so great, I can't complain. If you can, try to score one of the cute tables on the upstairs balcony. I dream about sitting up there one day, overlooking the hustle & bustle of Rush street - it looks like so much fun. If you haven't been here yet, definitely give it a try. Its absolutely wonderful and won't disappoint. But, it isn't cheap either, so get your credit card ready!
