This place has a superb collection of wine and cheese. My girlfriends and I went out here a few weeks ago and we ordered the champagne flight. It was about $15 and you get 4 generous pours of champagne. Plus, if you check in on Foursquare, there is a great deal! I ordered some of the burrata (spelling?) cheese and some Humboldt Fog goat cheese because, really, is there any other kind? The staff behind the bar were very friendly and generous with us 4 ladies. I would so go back, especially on a date! Great spot for that, I imagine.
