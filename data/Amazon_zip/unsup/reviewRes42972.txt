Only order to deliver! Do not go there to eat, it will just be awkward, a really small place, sort of a shanty. But their pizza is amazing!!!!! The toppings, the prices, just everything!!!! Try their chicken, their sausage, their 6 cheese pizza, their amazing appetizers, try it all [the coke is not better then normal sadly]. This is a great delivery night in for a date or whatever you desire thats not dominoes.
