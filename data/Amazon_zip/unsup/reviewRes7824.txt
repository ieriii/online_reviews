To start basic, the whole idea of Fogo is to put yourself in a meat induced coma. After you gander at a hearty salad, you are presented with a "coaster" with Red One Side, Green on the other. If you flip with to green you have guys in really happening pants walking around with large spits of meat, who will slice you of a bit. You can chose from an array of 13 (methinks?) different selections. Once you have had enough, you flip it to red. Its like "Traffic Light" as a kids, except with delightful cuisine, and everybodies wins (unlike that public humiliation as kids) Little do people write about is that Fogo has there infamous "lunch special" (11AM-2PM) where all the haggard and underpaid college student venture to.  For 29.99 you get the full spread, and let me relate, full you will be indeed.
