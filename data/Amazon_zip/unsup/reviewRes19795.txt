Coast is my neighborhood sushi spot, so I'm there often (2 nights in a row this week)! Obviously they must be doing something right to keep me coming back. Food: The sashimi at Coast is excellent, always serving up the freshest fish. The hamachi (yellowtail) carpaccio appetizer is out of this world delicious, along with the fatty salmon sashimi and the lobster sashimi. The maki rolls are very inventive, however I have found that when the roll contains tempura fried pieces, it often times comes out cold. This is a bit of a turn off, as the temperature of these rolls makes a huge difference in the flavor. Nonetheless, the white dragon roll is still my favorite. Atmos: Extremely dark, the atmosphere inside of the restaurant has a swanky, romantic feel. Guaranteed wait on the weekends and often times during the late week. Bring a bottle of your favorite wine and they will open it for you to drink as you wait. There is a liquor store less than a block away at Armitage and Damen that has a decent wine selection. Service: The service is average to good here. No huge complaints or praises. Price: The fact that the restaurant is BYOB helps a lot, but the prices are still rather high. But that usually holds true for sushi in general.
