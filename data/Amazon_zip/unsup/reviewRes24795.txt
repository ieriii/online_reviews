A very casual, cutesy Greek cafe/bakery where seating is up to the patrons, and the menus are easily inviting for anyone looking for good, quality food at a reasonable, everyday price.  The stuffed puff pastries (pie-looking things --- artopilos?) are quite delicious and come with fruits. Their salads are OK - perhaps a bit drenched in dressing. I'm a fan of their foamy lattes and desserts (the Valroha chocolate mousse!!).  A great place to sit by the windows and people-watch in the warm months. Definitely a solid option in Chicago's Greektown.
