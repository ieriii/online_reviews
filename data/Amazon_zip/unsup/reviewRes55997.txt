This isn't your typical gastropub! While I expected more contemporary food than fish and chips, this was a much more adventurous dining experience than I even anticipated. In fact, we were a little overwhelmed by the menu and followed our waiter's advice: duck rillettes, a venison tartare with an egg yolk on top, dumplings with shitakes and sun dried tomatoes, and a lobster dish. They were all so different than anything we'd eaten at an Irish restaurant; some were more delicious than others, but all great. I'd definitely recommend this memorable meal! They have your typical variety of draft beer (nothing out of the ordinary) and the cocktails were interesting but not fantastic. Service and atmosphere were warm and friendly. Check it out!
