I've had a couple different experiences now with Alliance and overall thought it balanced itself out to be pretty good. Delicious pastries, suitable coffee and a pretty tasty quiche, but it loses points on me for atmosphere at the lounge next door. I'm quite picky with the atmosphere of coffee shops and I think the space is a bit gloomier than I would like to relax at. Its not so much the fault of Alliance, because they try to mix it up with a little loungy couch area in addition to an area reserved for tables, but they just fall short. It's great that they have free WIFI and plenty of outlets. But, that doesn't change the fact that the space itself is a big clunky rectangle shape with furniture that does the job, but isnt necessarily aesthetically pleasing. As others have mentioned, its also super silent in there. Its like library-quiet in there, and even the music is barely there, so I felt like a rude pants when I forgot to put my phone on vibrate and it rang out loud.. If you like the silence, power to you and lounge it up, but otherwise you might prefer to take your tasty pastry and coffee to go.
