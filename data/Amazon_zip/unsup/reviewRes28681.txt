That had to be the worst delivery meal I've ever had! Maybe we choose the wrong dishes. We ordered pot stickers, wonton soup, Tom Ka Kai soup and Kuay Tiew Neau Sub. My dining companion had the Tom Ka Kai soup and pot stickers that he said tasted great but brought a whole new meaning to the term "ethnic cleansing" when it went right through him and had him racing to the bathroom. I had the Wonton soup that's filled with chicken but it tasted oddly fishy. It was revolting! The only good thing is that it beat the expected delivery time. I had such high hopes based on the great reviews.
