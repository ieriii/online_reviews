The place was packed when I went in, I guess check please has helped them out. But I think this will be my first and last time here. I ordered a chicken burrito and a chicken tostada. The burrito was just a tortilla filled with chicken, no fixing... maybe I saw a few onions. The chicken was dry which made it just plain hard to eat. Even the salsa didn't help. Even at 3 am this isn't good eats. I say go to Taco Burrito Express #3 at North & Ashland they can make better food quicker.
