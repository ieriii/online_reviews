After 6 years I finally decided to give this place another shot. The food is always good but the wait is just annoying. We were crammed into the front window seat which I guess gave us a little privacy vs being on top of each other like other diners. We had the white chocolate-caramel pretzel pancakes and some fancy french toast. Both were outstanding and huge. And the chocolate tower french toast is always a winner. Minus one star for no kids menu and the wait.
