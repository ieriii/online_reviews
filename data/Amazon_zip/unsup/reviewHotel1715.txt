If you are youngish and want to have a little fun, DO NOT STAY HERE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES!! I knew it was trendy and seemed like a cool place, so I didn't eat for weeks to be able to afford one of their stupid $400 suites so I could throw a small after-party on new years eve. But when we checked in, they gave us a little list of absurd rules, the two most absurd being (1) no outside food or drink, and (2) only registered guests after midnight would be allowed - ID would be checked at the door! We managed to sneak in food alcohol and people anyway, but that involved quite a bit of effort and additional debauchery, and it wouldn't necessarily work again. They kept blaming the ridiculous rules on "security" and "fire hazard" but no other hotel in the city was so strangely paternalistic.  Also, I ate $9 worth of food from the minibar, but they charged me $20! When I called about it, they just asked what I ate and said, OK, we'll change it. It sounds like they just try that and see how often they can get away with it. Another con is the location - it's not really close to anything but the theaters - for the price, you'd be better off staying in a much more central location.  One more con - our suite was supposed to have a "two-person jacuzzi" - it was just a bathtub with some extra spray-jet things. Bogus! Only two very small children could fit in there comfortably. I will say though that the suites are pretty awesome - they have this crazy rock'n'roll'coke vibe with a big portrait of a guitar and 80s patterned wallpaper. And two nice flat-screen TVs. And these trippy animal-print robes.
