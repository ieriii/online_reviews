I split an order of 10 wings + rice with Anh, which cost $10 + $2 for the rice. You can ask any asian person, there is not many things much more annoying than having to pay extra for rice, especially at an asian restaurant. But, I have to say, that $12 was enough to fill both of us, which is a relatively cheap meal.  I ordered half sassy and half BBQ, and preferred the BBQ.  This is completely off the wall, but for a place that's been open less than a year, I thought the bathroom was quite run down. The grout between the tiles were already dark and grimy. The caulking around the sinks were poorly done. I just hope the cooks don't take shortcuts like what happened with the bathroom.  Anyway, I think the chicken is pretty good and fair for the price, but I think they can do better. Employees were friendly. As far as flavor goes, drumsticks from Great Sea are still my fave.
