The best part about this place is if you are starving, you can sit down and start eating lots of meat right away. The service was good - there was always someone at the table to offer us more meat. Salad bar sucked. I've only been here once, and for the price, I don't think I'll be going back again. Out of the 15 meats served, about 5 of them were very good. And for the amount of money you spend on dinner, you feel like you should eat until you feel like you are going to die.
