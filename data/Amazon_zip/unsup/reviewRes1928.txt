I thought I had the whole hot dog thing down with Al's Beef and Portillos which are virtually the same dog. Then I went to Hot Dougs. Nobody can even touch this place. I dont know how but the dogs are just better than the other two. The duck fat fries send this place over the edge. #1 in Chicago for hot dogs hands down!!!! Another great dog is Gold Coast Dogs, especially with their cheese fries. They use the real Wisconsin Cheddar!
