The Publican to me is like Chicago's version of DBGB. Which is basically, awesome!  Cavernous space. Loud and bustling. Pork! Craft beer! Just radical stuff! A great place where you are going "out" and can eat good food. Decided to meet up with some of my Chicago friends while I was visiting. The perfect place. Yeah, you have to yell. But hey, ain't no thing. We dined on a recent Friday and the place was quite chaotic, to say the least. Service was slow, so we got some freebies like the spicy pork rinds and an order of fries. Look, I'm not fan of pork rinds. No offense, but when I think of them, I think of truckers. I am not a trucker. But these are warm and damn good. The fries as well were fried to perfection! Ordered some serrano ham to start.  Good stuff, for real. As I had consumed bountiful amounts of beer, and I do mean bountiful, my memory is a bit fuzzy. But I'm pretty sure we had some potee and lamb's neck. That's really all I remember. But the food was just what I expected. This is a place for the adventurous. The Victor of 5 years ago wouldn't eat pretty much anything on the menu. But these days, yeah. Even lamb's neck. Will definitely return the next time I'm in the Chi.
