I was so excited to meet a girlfriend for lunch here as RJ Grunts is known for their salad bar, and we're attempting clean eating (on a weekend, natch!). It was a busy Sat. and we were told that it would be a 30 minute wait. Meanwhile, my expectations are elevating and the growls of my stomach are growing louder. We're sat at the smallest table I've ever seen in the back. Maneuvering to the salad bar proves difficult even for my rail-thin friend. The salad bar isn't quite what I expected-- yes, it's fresh but all the fixins' are very basic. Only one type of cheese, for example. And only one low-fat dressing. And reaching the stuff in the back? Practically an obstacle course if your arms aren't 6 feet long. Extra points for the chocolate-chip cream cheese spread though I really wasn't sure of its purpose-- maybe to top the fruit? I also ordered grilled chicken (which was not only a meager portion but overdone) for my salad which set me back an extra $2 in addition to the already pricey salad bar cost of $10.95. Way too much for way too basic. As I was eating my plain Jane salad I enviously scoured other better-looking choices as the server squeezed past our table. Hmm... I'm thinking that if I'm ever to return I'll give the regular menu a try.
