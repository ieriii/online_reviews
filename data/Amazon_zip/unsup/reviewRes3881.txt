this one gets five stars. the guy at the register was awesome--friendly and funny. we got a half chicken with seoul sassy and the big bibimbap with a side of cabbage kimchee. though we're both southern babies, my husband has a problem with fried chicken. i love it. and we both absolutely loved the chicken at crisp. it was good because it wasn't heavily breaded.  the skin was left on and was super crispy. so delicious. the sauce was a little too sweet for my liking, but still really, really tasty. we skipped on a hotter sauce because he doesn't dig that. the bibimbap wasn't what i expected, but still very good. it was basically a salad on top of rice. my favorite part was the radish kimchee.  the cabbage kimchee was the best i've had in chicago. i have pretty high standards for kimchee. this stuff tasted fresh (i like it to be really fresh or really, really fermented-- in between just isn't good enough.) and it wasn't overly spicy.  we went in there with growling stomachs and we were grumpy from hunger. we left with a to go container because the portions are big. we will be returning.
