Tried the Teuben - Reuben sandwich in hot dog form (of course) It was delicious. The duck fat fries had been hyped up for me too much. I was expecting a flavor revolution but discovered they were just french fries, although very delicious french fries. Also , I had to wait 45 min to get in on a Saturday, but it was well worth the wait.
