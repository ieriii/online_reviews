Best Chinese in Chinatown. Price point is a little higher than hole-in-the-wall so its not the go-to for cheap night out, but its still affordable, and the food is definitely a step up. Three words: tea smoked duck. One of the few places I go for one special dish, but never had a dish here that wasn't above average. if you need reliable traditional Szechuan, you won't go wrong.
