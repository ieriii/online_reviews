I adore any place that serves white burgundy by the glass, bordering on manic devotee. And when they offer it by the carafe, as well... what can I say? Count me in!  Other pluses included one of the most attentive and educated servers I have had in a long time. She knew a lot about the menu, was super friendly and I don't think I ever refilled my own wine glass. I also really liked the ambiance and crowd. On the downside, the small plates were indeed, small. The pasta dish had just three large noodles on it that consisted of just two bites for myself and two for my dining companion.  All in all, we shared two desserts, two small plates and one entree. And I've got to tell you, nothing about the food really stands out... except the white burgundy.
