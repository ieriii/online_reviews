The atmosphere and service are excellent, and the food outstanding! I expect a restaurant rated so highly by Bon Appetit to be good, but the people behind Purple Pig are not resting on their laurels. We went on a Sunday evening and the place was PACKED! Even though we were seated on the corner of a table with a baby stroller, we were still comfortable. Our server, Elvis was charming, accommodating, and food and drink timing was perfect. Run, don't walk to Purple Pig!
