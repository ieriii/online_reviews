I have been going here since I was little (it being one of my dads favorite restaurants) It is great for birthdays or other group gatherings as the menu is extensive and the place is huge! They dont take reservations but we went at 8pm on saturday night and had one drink at the bar before our name was called. The food is good the ambiance is nice and it is very affordable. Great Greek restaurant in Chicago!
