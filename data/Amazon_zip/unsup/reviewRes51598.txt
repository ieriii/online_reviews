First of all, Garcia's has THE BEST horchata I have ever tasted in my life...they're so thick and sweet. Sadness overcomes me as I take the last sip of my horchata. Whenever I'm here, I always order the Enchiladas Verdes with chicken. The enchiladas are delicious and their portions are huge. I love coming here!
