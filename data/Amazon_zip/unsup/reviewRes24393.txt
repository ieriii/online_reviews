I was really excited to eat here. Meat, cheese, bread, chocolate, it's a slam dunk, right? Unfortunately, the food and quality of service was poor. The restaurant itself is very cute and intimate, and we ordered drinks at the bar while we waited for our table. Once seated we ordered a bottle of wine, and my friend and I decided to share a portion (it's about $50 per portion, measured by weight). We tried the cheese, broth/oil, and chocolate combinations. The cheese and chocolate fondue's did not have a very good flavor, and the bread cubes that we were provided for dipping were stale. The dipping selections for the chocolate were not very creative and again, the graham crackers were stale. At the end of the meal our waitress announced a $10 charge for sharing a portion. While we did not mind paying this, I wish this had been mentioned sooner when we ordered. I expect better quality for this price point. And to top it off, my friend spilled a glass of red wine (and a glass of water, oops) all over himself, it was a bit of a disaster. So bad that a tide pen couldn't touch.
