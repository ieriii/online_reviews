Fabulous brunch, especially if you live on the north side of town (read: for us Evanston-ites, make the trip!) Great little cozy spot, not very wide but deep into the block (like a NYC-style place). The menu is full of your southern favorites with a flair of New Orleans / TRUE SOUTHERN amidst all of the viddles. I had the Eggs New Orleans (Ponchartrain blue crab cakes with poached eggs, popovers, and bearnaise sauce, served with Potatoes O'Brien). In a word: delectable. This will be a great look for groups, birthdays, brunch, dinner, etc.
