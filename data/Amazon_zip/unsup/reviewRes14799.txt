I cannot believe I have lived right down the street from this place and just went for the first time a few weeks ago. My first impression was that this was a clean place with character and the owner was very hospital. It makes all the difference when people show they care about their customer. The food was awesome and I couldn't believe how cheap it was. The dinner portions are enormous. It's great to have a nice place to get some quality food in the neighborhood. Congrats to the people at 90 Mile for running a great business.
