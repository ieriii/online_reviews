A steakhouse should be able to serve PERFECT steak and potatoes. Ruth's delivered on the meat--beautifully cooked to order, well-seasoned and succulent. This was preceded by a perfect salad--cool, crisp with its rich blanket of blue cheese dressing. The seasoning in the potatoes was not to my liking, but not the fault of the restaurant. I guess I just don't like seasoned potatoes.I, unlike the unscrupulous reviewers on YELP - that should not be allowed to post reviews - would never lower the star rating for a business because I don't care for a particular item they sell, when the item is was prepared perfectly, and when others obviously do like it.I think people who do this, like Steve S. (http://www.yelp.com/user), should be banned from YELP.HEY STEVE S., DON'T PUNISH THE RESTAURANT JUST BECAUSE YOU DON'T CARE FOR A WELL MADE MENU ITEM, OR JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE A J*E*R*K*.I first felt a hint of dismay when the appetizers arrived. my shrimp was overcooked and tough, its seasoned crust overpowering any hint of flavor the actual shellfish was producing. This is why I gave Ruth's 4 stars instead of 5. The dessert really lifted my spirits. The key lime pie was light as air, a perfect balance of sweet and tart cradled in a crumbly, buttery crust. I couldn't get enough.Of course, service was impeccable.
