I saw the Hungry Hound on channel 7 review this restauran back in January and have been dying to go ever since. We started out with the hummus and baba ganoush appetizers. So fresh and wonderful, I especially loved the decorative kalamata olives in the middle of the appetizers. It makes me wonder why I buy the hummus from Target. My main meal was the chicken kebab w/ dill rice, grilled tomato and a lemon wedge. I don't know what they did to that chicken, but I dreamt of it last night. Here is how to eat it, take a forkful of the chicken w/ lemon squirted on it then a small amount of feta and a little piece of raw onion. Shove it in your mouth and be prepared for greatness. On our way out yesterday we saw someone eating chicken wings in I think a pomegrante sauce. Can't wait to return.
