This place is actually worth more than three stars, but not quite four. The interior is really homey and nice. I went with a larger party that took forever to arrive, but the few of us who were there weren't bothered at all or harassed for our party not arriving on time. As for food, it is very good, but nothing out of this world. I got a martini, don't remember which one, which was solid. For dinner I had the fish sandwich which was quite tasty, but nothing I would come running back for. My friend had a special of the day, the seafood pot pie which was amazing! However it was a special and could be gone forever... Definitely a good place to try, but not super special.
