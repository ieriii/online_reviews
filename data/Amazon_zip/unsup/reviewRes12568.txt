This is my favorite "fancy" restaurant to go to. I come here for birthdays and anniversaries. I love the salad bar. You can get anything from fresh veggies to sushi (even think cut bacon)! Once you get settled, you can devour all sorts of delicious meats like bacon-wrapped filet mignon. Also tried their sangria and it was great. This place is friendly and always clean.
