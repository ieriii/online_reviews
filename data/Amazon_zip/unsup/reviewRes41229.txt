Tank just updated their menu and prices went up. The prices were too good to be true for awhile there. Looks like the food prices at the market have caught up to the restaurant. Still on the inexpensive end, but about $1 more. They also had fancier square plates for their rice dishes. Looks like some modernization was going on. Don't hold your breath on the service though. That's just how it is. Luan: You're not weird. I wipe down chopsticks too! Growing up in Southern California, every Vietnamese person did it. When I went to Vietnam I finally figured out why. It's really dusty and the tables are often really close to the street, so the chopsticks on the table needed to be wiped off. I figure it's a habit that stemmed from Vietnam and isn't considered offensive. BTW: You're lucky your family makes Pho at home. It's too labor intensive for my family, so I grew up eating Pho at restaurants.
