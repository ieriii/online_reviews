I am going to keep this simple. If you love pizza you will love Piece. Their pizza is amazingly delicious; never had a bad piece, no matter the toppings. Its not your typical Chicago style pizza, its different and amazing. Be prepared to wait on the weekends but its a pleasurable wait with cocktails. If you are not into large crowds and a wait list, hit this spot up early on a Saturday or during the early part of the week. ENJOY!
