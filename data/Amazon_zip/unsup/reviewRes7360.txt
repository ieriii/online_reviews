My girlfriend and I stopped in for a snack and a drink, and left not needing to eat dinner. The portions were very generous and delicious, and our server, Ayana, provided a great drink recommendation for my girlfriend. Be sure to try the chocolate mousse pie w/salted caramel and chocolate pretzels. That stuff was phenomenal.
