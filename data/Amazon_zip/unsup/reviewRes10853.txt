I LOVE The Bongo Room!!!! It is my all time favorite place for brunch in Chicago! When I loved in Chicago I would go here at least once a month! I never like to wait for a table, but this place is ALWAYS worth the wait! I love the breakfast burrito, all of the fancy pancakes & I've never been disappointed with anything I've ever ordered! I also LOVE that you can order one pancake of your choice with any other meal! I've always had great service too! This is one of those places that makes me miss living in Chicago!
