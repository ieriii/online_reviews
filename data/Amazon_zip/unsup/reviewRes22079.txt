Greek Islands is surely a great place for good food and drinks with your friends and family. My family came here after attending a play nearby and I was immediately pleased to find there is free, YES FREE valet service. The Greektown area is known for sparse parking, so this is an added plus! Everything we ordered from orange roughy to lamb chops was excellent. Each person was more than satisfied with their choices. The pricing ranges from low priced appetizers and mid ranged entrees. The customer service from beginning to end was really great, attentive, friendly and fast. I will definitely return here for dinner another time.
