Chicago Q is an upscale white tablecloth BBQ joint, sounds paradoxical but it works. The interior is modern and upscale and they serve the whole range of BBQ favorites from chicken to brisket to ribs & pulled meats. I tried the St. Louis ribs with a side of the kobe beef baked beans. The ribs were served without having been sauced which I prefer so that you can really taste how good a job of smoking they did. And they did a good job giving the meat a good smoke ring. They did serve the ribs with a sample of four sauces that you could use including a tomato based mild BBQ, tomato based hot BBQ, vinager based Carolina style BBQ jus and a mustard based BBQ that was yellow. The ribs were tender and reasonably juicy with a good level of smoke and pulled apart easily so you could dip in the many sauces. All the fat was fully rendered off the meat so they were not fatty or greasy. The baked beans were good but could have used a little more punch from some vinager or a little more heat from pepper sauce or somthing somthing. All in all Chicago Q is a great addition to the area, has a nice atmosphere and the full range of BBQ classics. I will be back to to try the rest of the choices including the babyback ribs, the Kobe ribs, the competition ribs, the chicken, the pulled xyz and on and on.... Yum.
