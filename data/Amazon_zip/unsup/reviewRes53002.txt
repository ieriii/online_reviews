I finally made it in here for a quick dinner. I had the steak with rice, black beans (which are vegetarian, btw), and sweet plantains. I pared it with the yucca with garlic appetizer - WOW - a case where the the sum is greater than the parts! Cafe con leche packed in a to go cup is wonderful and their flan, while very good, was just a tad heavy for my taste.  Service was quick and friendly. Also, its a BYOB (no corkage fee, I believe, but I'd double check...) and there was a small parking area out front.
