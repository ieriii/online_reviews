Geja's advertises itself as a perfect romantic restaurant. I will agree that it's dark and that probably contributes to the romanticism. But the food is really really subpar for the price and the atmosphere simply doesn't make up for it. When I went, we ordered the cheese fondue. The cheese itself was bland, the grapes were mushy, the bread was stale and tasteless, and the apples were mealy. Maybe they were having a bad night, but for $25+ a person, I expect some good, flavorful dipping items, not what we got. The same went for the chocolate fondue. It was also annoying because I felt that the waitress kept trying to upsell us on wine. I just don't believe this place is worth the price.
