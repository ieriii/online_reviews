I took my girlfriend out on a date to this place and it was fantastic. First, let me just say that the ambiance, feel and atmosphere of ZED451 was incredible. It was a very classy establishment and the service from the hostess to waitress and even the chefs was incredible. The food was spectacular and never ending. We had the harvest table and the variety of meats and everything tasted great. I would definitely come back here again.
