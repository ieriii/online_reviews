I've got a tall drink of water to impress and we're downtown... where to go? One familiar Polish bartender (see previous review), one bottle of crisp Slovakian Pinot Grigio, some of the best 'date' conversation I've ever had, and two small plates later, I was only hungry for more. The one caveat that almost derailed a textbook-perfect rendezvous? The bacon lard on crostini smear. No, the name on the menu isn't 'bacon lard', but that's what it was. The greasy appearance and slick texture was not only off-putting but rather unappetizing. It was almost pizza-like in the sense of when you bit the crostini, the entire layer of fat slid off. Not an aesthetically-pleasing dish! However, I really enjoyed the Jamon Serrano, oyster mushrooms, and fried egg atop grilled bread. It was like an upscale take on a classic breakfast sandwich, and the oyster mushrooms are essentially potent flavor morsels. Delicious! Well, almost as delicious as my date. The bar is still the place to be, and a place to be seen (as evidenced by a full bar on a chilly Monday night). And the wine list (served in three different size denominations) is globally deep and simply fantastic. Yes... I'm still crushing.
