Halfway through the meal, my cheeks started to ache from smiling. We were well into the next morning before the smile finally wore off. The entire evening was a joy. It took a few minutes to get comfortable in the dining room, as the wait staff grossly outnumbered diners and the diamonds from our neighbor's bracelet nearly blinded me. But by course 2 or 3, we had settled in, relaxed and had one of the greatest dining experiences available. Our waiters were all wonderful, each letting themselves be actual people instead of the fine dining waiter-bots you see at some other restaurants. My (many) fears about my relative lack of fanciness were quickly relieved. The food was, of course, spectacular without being overwhelming or needlessly gimmicky. The wine pairing was (drool) so, so good. The dessert was a bit on the tart side for me, but the table was full of fun spring colors so I wasn't complaining... mostly because complaining would have slowed down the shoveling of food into my mouth. Oh, and the after dinner coffee was really good. I think they said it was Intelligensia. Excellent choice. All in, if you have the means, and a solid 4 hours to spare at dinner, put Alinea on the list.
