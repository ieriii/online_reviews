Get the Vietnamese Coffee. It comes with a cute contraption that you remove once the coffee's done filtering. The coffee drips onto a layer (1 cm thick) of condensed milk... it's a pretty fun experience (yeah, I'm pretty lame)- setting aside the contraption, stirring the thick solution. It almost felt like I was in chem lab. Well, kinda. =) I ordered the ginger marinated roast duck.. and that's pretty much all that was on my plate (well, that and sauce). It's a tasty dish, but make sure you're sitting next to someone you can mooch off of. Be on the safe side and make reservations.
