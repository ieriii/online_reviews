I think I just keeled over and died. This is MY definition of a perfect restaurant. It doesn't have to be yours, but this is my review so get over it. The decor is adorable right down to the pig pen tables. The wine and beer selection is extensive and so is the list of food. Yes things will sell out, but in my mind I know that at least the restaurant is wasting anything. Everything is so delicious and well presented. I could just eat the whole restaurant. For a poor graduate student, it does dent the wallet a bit, but I can live off PB&J for a week to splurge here on the weekend.
