We went to Bonsoiree on April 11th for my husband's birthday. We went for the no menu Sunday and got the 7 course meal. All I have to say is WOW. The place is absolutely amazing. The ambiance was awesome, service was spectacular. We started off with a salad course with the most unique dressings, followed by this melt in your mouth lobster served in a seashell. Next was a roasted garlic and parmesan soup with a puff pastry filled with duck confit and orange demiglace. Next, the fish course - amazing Japanese sea bass, the most delicious wasabi mustard over cous cous and mushrooms, then, the star of the show - the meat course. Venison, lamb sausage and goose foie gras. To die for. Literally the best foie gras I've ever had. The cheese course was a goat cheese with garlic with a fig jam, and it was finished with a banana bread pudding with caramel sauce and blood orange sorbet. Seriously, one of the best meals we've ever eaten. We loved the idea of no menu because we didn't know what we were going to eat until it arrived. it made it that much more fun and special. And the price was unbeatable for what you got - $75 a person, no corking fee. I would recommend this place to anyone that loves great service and even better food.
