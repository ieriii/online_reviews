I am in love with this place! After reading reviews on Yelp I couldn't help by drag my boyfriend along to try it out. I'm from South Florida, so I know good Cuban food when I taste it. I had my doubts about great Cuban food in Chicago but this place completely changed my mind. Of course I wanted to try everything so here is my take on this true neighborhood gem. My boyfriend and I started with beef empanadas. Can you say amazing? It was the best empanada I've ever had. It also comes with this delectable green dipping sauce. I order the Bistec meal which comes with rice, beans, and fried plantains. The skirt steak was wonderful and the grilled onions only added to the flavor. The beans were magnificent and the rice was cooked just right. The fried plantains were out of this world! I love plantains and I thought for sure that no one could do them as well as my beautiful Miami. I have never been happier to be proved wrong. My boyfriend ordered the Pollo sandwich which came with plantains chips. He also order papas fritas which were out of this world as well. The chicken was juicy and full of flavor. I couldn't believe how amazing this little hole in the wall was! I will be back for sure, to try the Pan Cubano. I cannot wait to return!
