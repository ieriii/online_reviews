I'd give them 5 stars (the selection and quality in this place is fantastic and I prefer it to Whole Foods), but I had a less than satisfactory experience there recently that brings into question (for me) the vaunted F&O customer service. After the new year, they put most of their Christmas candy and holiday goods on 50% off sales racks. There was a rack near the meat counter and another next to the baker counter. The one near the baker counter had several boxes of a Spanish brand of torrone (normally listed at $12.99). The normal price is too much for torrone but at 50% off it seemed a good bargain, so I grabbed a box. Upon checking out, the box rang up full price. When I attempted to explain the box of torrone was supposed to be 50% off, the cashier first asked me what torrone was (certainly understandable and forgivable) and set off to confirm the sale price. Upon returning, apparently unable to find the sale rack that contained several boxes of the same torrone, she asked her manager who apparently said the torrone was not on sale. Cashier than repeated to me "The torrone is not on sale." My problem wasn't that the item was not, in fact, on sale. It's understandable that someone would be asked to move all the Christmas candy to the sale rack and assume this item was included in that. My problem was that F&O, in fact, placed an item on a sale rack and then, in spite of their own error, not only failed to honor the in-store advertised sale price and/or recognize their own mistake, but seemed to imply I was just making the whole thing up. Kind of uncool but I'll be back to give them another try.
