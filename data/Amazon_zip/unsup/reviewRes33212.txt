On the way to a concert at the Abbey Pub we decided to have dinner here. The place looked a little deserted, which got me worried a bit, but the owner came out right away and mentioned that he'd just opened the place a little while ago. He was very friendly, warm and welcoming, and told us his policy was "you don't like it, you don't pay." The food was wonderful. I had a veal paprikash served with mashed potatoes. It was creamy and subtly flavoured, and the veal was perfectly tender. I had a light slaw on the side, which was lightly dressed and had the perfect amount of vinegar sourness to balance the richness of the paprikash. My wife had the pork schnitzel -- tender on the inside, and crispy on the outside, and not greasy at all. At the end of the meal, the owner came out with a thin clear hose filled with some strong Romanian hooch. We passed it around the table, like frat boys with a beer bong. I'd highly recommend this place.
