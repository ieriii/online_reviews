Oh My Gosh! I've Found The Best............The best French Toast on earth. Brioche bread soaked in egg custard and cooked perfectly. Golden brown and crispy on the outside, creamy and custardy on the inside. No fancy complicated overly sweetened sauce, only maple syrup and butter. Old fashion French toast but every single bite is HEAVEN!!P/S: 5 stars rating based on the French Toast only.
