Absolutely nothing to complain about here: stuffed squash blossoms with fontina cheese and some delightful tomato sauce - wow; past special filled with mascarpone and thyme with spring mushrooms and porcini and butter broth - decadent mouth pleaser; fish of the day - branzino (enough for two) was so light and sumptuous with the added acidity of the capers, was absolutely perfect after the rich pasta; finally, the chocolate hazelnut "torte" with the yummy gooey center and hazelnut gelato was tremendous. I was so super stuffed but had such delightful flavors left on my palate after this meal that I didn't mind!
