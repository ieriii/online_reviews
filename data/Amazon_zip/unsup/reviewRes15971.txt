After stubling onto this place by accident, I found out it is soo good, and for the past two years I have started a birthday tradition for myself, eating here with my best friends! The dishes are a little on the pricey side but DEFINITELY worth it! The service has always been excellent, perfectly timed and very patient with me and my drunk ass crazy friends..... we make the tip make up for it though :) They have an EXCELLENT drink list and some wonderful seafood dishes, I dont even like seafood! The Live music adds the perfect touch to any dinning experience. If Calo doesn't go changing to much, it will always be my favorite restaurant in the city of Chicago!
