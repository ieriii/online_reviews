Great restaurant! The best hamburgers I've had. I would have never thought of grilled macaroni and cheese as a side dish. What a great idea. The draft beer selection is great. We lived in Kankakee six year ago. Now in the Washington DC area. What a nice treat during a quick visit back to the area. We will return. One caution..be respectful of their hot sauce selections. This advice is from someone who loves hot stuff.
