I don't usually like to go back to the same restaurant more than once or twice in a year - there's so much to explore and taste! My husband and I moved to Lakeview in January 2006, and I think we've probably gone to Las Tablas about 8 or 9 times already....it's that good. Good value, good food, good atmosphere (think authentic, not touristy). If you're coming here for a Morton's or Smith and Wollensky kind of steak house, don't. Prepare for a boisterous atmosphere, painted benches, and Botticelli-esque paintings.  Highly recommend the yuca app - deliciously smeared with cheese. The steak and octopus combo, house special, and catfish are all mouth-watering. Tender, yet flavorful. The empanadas are the best in the city! Wash it all down with the beverage of your choice (it's BYOB) and enjoy some flan for dessert. A wonderful night out for a date (if you're really fun-loving, it's great for your first!) or out with a group.
