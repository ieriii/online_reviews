I dont understand how a restaurant like this can garner anything less than 5 stars, aside from hmmmm, ....maybe the fact that getting a reservation here is so onerous it's almost not worth it, almost. actually it's worth everything. worth every penny spent, including the ridiculously expensive but so worth it reserve-wine pairing. It's been months since i ate here and only now catching up on my yelping but i am a huge fan and would fly out again just to eat here and fly right back to nyc. Now that Grant Achatz has succeeded w/ his second effort Next, i am hoping that he gets bored and looks for a new challenge here in NYC, where eaters are much more skeptical and harder to please.
