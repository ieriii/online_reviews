This is a GREAT restaurant! Went there last night with 3 other couples. The concept is an Italian restaurant serving small plates (tapas style), and the wine is sold at retail price plus a $7 corkage fee .... can highly recommend the $18 Chianti - excellent wine. The only thing i wish they would change is their "no reservations" policy .... it did take us 1 hour to get a table - but then again we were also 8 people on a Saturday night. For my wife and i this seems like the perfect date spot and we will definitely be back very soon!!!!
