Hopleaf is dark and crowded, you usually have to wait for a bit for a table amongst a sea of hipsters and beer snobs, the waitstaff look like lumberjacks, and oh yeah this place is so totally awesome! Hopleaf is a date night fave, not only because it's dimly lit and warm and intimate inside, but the food is bomb, the alcohol is good and plentiful, it's reasonably priced, and did I mention the food is bomb? My boyfriend and I waited about 20 minutes for a table for 2, which was not at all unpleasant due to the bar up front with a nice selection of craft and Belgian beers. It was chilly that night and I had not yet hit critical levels of seasonal depression. At this point, I was still like WOW SNOW!, all about my winter "accessories," and hadn't even thought about burning my big, black down coat in the second biggest fire in Chicago's history. So I ordered a hot beer, the Quelque Chose. I know, hot beer sounds exactly like hot barf, right? But it's not - it's really pleasant and the perfect thing on one of those early winter nights before you completely bury yourself in a deep dark hole until June. Ordering the mussels at Hopleaf is like dipping your French fries in your milkshake. You just gotta do it. We got the mussels for two, and at first I was worried that it wasn't going to be enough for me and my boyfriend, who has a bottomless stomach (no. seriously.), but it turned out to be a really good amount and we both enjoyed a deep food coma that night. The fries came out hot and crispy, and really, can you ever go wrong with a side of aoli? Didn't think so. Yeah, there's a lot of hype, and yeah everyone in the joint looks like they ride fixed gear bikes and listen to bands way before they're mainstream, but that shouldn't keep you away. Hopleaf is worth joining the hipstas for a night.
