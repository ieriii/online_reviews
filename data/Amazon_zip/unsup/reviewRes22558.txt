Since a bunch of us are rotating through a hospital nearby, we decided to check out Lao Sze Chuan for lunch. What a good call. They offer an encyclopedic variety of cheap ($7 for entree, soup, tea, and rice) lunch specials, most of which are delicious. Kung Pao squid is fork-tender, and served with just the right amount of mildly spicy sauce, veggies, and peanuts. The garlic eggplant comes with perfectly fried Chinese eggplant and a richly flavored garlic sauce. The clear standout among the dishes we sampled, however, is the dry chili chicken; perfectly fried, not remotely greasy chicken served simply with chili oil, chili flakes, and scallions. Blew me out of the water. There was one dud at our table: steamed shrimp and vegetables were bland, even for an un-sauced dish. Hot and sour soup was delicious, and crispy spring rolls were sufficiently flavorful to not require sauce. All in all, deliciously authentic Chinese dining experience. I will be back very frequently.
