Just when I think I've eaten enough weird stuff in Chicago I think I'm some sort of culinary smartass and this happens: the PBR & PMO. What are those acronyms? (I love acronyms, btw.) They stand for the Bad Apple's Pabst Blue Ribbon and pickle, mayo, and onion sandwich. I know, sounds awful to begin with, right? It didn't seem so. Apparently the pickle was house cured, and it was believable that they could put together a decent bar novelty at $1.75 for the sandwich. It was a steal, I couldn't say no. Unfortunately it nearly stole my hunger. After it was ordered my cohorts instantly began to question my choice, as did I. It literally tasted old. I asked for extra pickles yet they weren't on the sandwich, there was barely any mayo (dead space on a sandwich is a culinary crime), and the bread. . .well it was crusty. What followed was one of the most troubling 10 minutes of mind over sandwich as finally I discovered that the pickles were amazing by their lonesome and that if I had to eat this freak of nature, ketchup (yes, ketchup!) had to be added to the equation. In the end this place still deserves four stars for service and overall value. Our server Jessica was attentive enough to honestly ask how it was, and after receiving the same explanation gave me a free order of some really great fries. I might also add that had I gone with any of their well-priced ($8-10) sandwiches or burgers I would've been much happier, as they looked and apparently tasted incredible. And hey, this is the longest explanation for a single dish ever, so I guess it wasn't a total disaster. Plus, the beer list? Lovely, although they lost a star for not including my home state of NC, arguably one of the best craft brewing states in the country.
