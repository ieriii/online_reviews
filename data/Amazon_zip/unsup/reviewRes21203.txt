Wow look at this, there is no line I ordered my food around 5:35 Liked the salad with carnitas on top But on the go and couldn't stop I will be back, yes I will I liked it much, but hunger still Next time I will plan to dine in For their artsy plates are a win Avacado, pickled onions and more I am sorry I had to rush out the door ok - that was just for fun. Seriously, ordered in, but then didn't know how long it would take. I had to get to class just around the block in about 20 minutes... I thought salad was a safe bet for a quick turnout, and I could eat half of it and take the rest with. But you can't rush gourmet art! 5 minutes til class start, I realized I needed it to go. I went to the counter to find this magnificent balance act that was my salad just completed. The staff were bummed that asked for it to go instead, truly wrecking this piece of art - sorry! Not only did they accommodate, but they gave me an entirely new salad to go, so the dressing would be on the side! NICE touch, especially since I was a pain in the arse. And to top it off, she gave me a real fork to go (not plastic, the real deal). I think as she put it "we don't have plastic forks, but we have something better and you can recycle it". Thanks for the killer service, and tasty salad - I will be back! (and I am getting that sammich in the broth I see in all the pics).
