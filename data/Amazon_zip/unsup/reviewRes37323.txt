I would really like to experience this place some day. But, I have this unfortunate affliction where I like to be able to move around a little bit while I drink at a bar. I have never been able to do that at Hopleaf. It is really unfortunate because they do seem to have a really great beer selection. I hope to be able to try them someday. I guess I cannot really fault a place for being popular but seriously.... Okay, as an adendum, I finally got to hang out at the Hopleaf when it was not excessively packed. It is an enjoyable experience if you are a beer lover. As far as I know, it is the only Andersonville bar that serves more than one of the Three Floyds beers. I will bump the Hopleaf up a star from my original score simple because you could go there once a week for years and still have beers left to try. As a further adendum, when the Leaf is not packed to capacity, it is my favorite bar in the city.
