Hmmm... I was thrilled to hear about the expansion, so we actually went back for dinner! Usually the wait was way too long, so we'd only do drinks on weeknights. Lo and behold, there were lots of open tables last night. The host, however, led us over to a 2-person table in the cramped rear area of the addition right next to the kitchen and service station. When we asked if we could sit somewhere else, he tried to seat us at the counter by the glass window overlooking the prep area and kitchen! Now when a whole bunch of tables are open, that's pretty annoying. We said we'd rather wait and get a decent table, so he finally led us over to a 2-top in the original area. He seemed pretty exasperated with us, which was annoying. I think they're still acting like they have such cramped quarters that they'll never seat 2 people at a 4-top. It was super annoying. The service was OK after that, the beer was terrific, and the food was ho-hum. Very few options for those who aren't into meat or cheese. Our experience really left a bad taste in my mouth. We're low-key people and don't usually complain or ask to be moved, but to be shoved in a corner by the noisy kitchen when the place wasn't busy at all was obnoxious.
