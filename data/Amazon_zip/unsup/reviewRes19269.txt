Hello most amazing brunch I've had in awhile. LOVE. LOVE. LOVE. In town for Lollapalooza, the strategy for meals was "stock up like a chipmunk in winter before the day starts and see what happens." This place was a great start for day 2 of the festival. Located right across from Grant Park, the 3 of us were ready to eat and booze before the day. And, as they say "when on vacation", or I guess that's what I say, we went all out. Starter for the table: the House Putine. I never had it before, but I will for sure order it any time I see it on a menu or within 30 feet of me. Eggs Benedict for me as my main, with goat cheese grits (YES, you read that right) on the side. Oh yea plus the bread, and 3 bellinis. Then we were sent over an Irish breakfast which we all devoured. Oh, and do you want dessert?, the waitress asked knowing very well we'd be convinced---sure! BRING ON THE BEIGNETS! Delicious. Heaven. Heaven in a bowl. All of the above. Come here for brunch if you are in the area. Order all that we did or anything else, the food is great. Try and snag a booth if you can too. Great for groups, or at least for more space for you to move after your pants start to feel tight.
