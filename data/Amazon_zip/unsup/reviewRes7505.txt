This cozy LP eatery is a great value offering huge portions of well-executed Italian cuisine in a quaint setting. The service is good, and they have nice al fresco dining in the warmer months. The wine service is what you'd expect at a neighborhood italian place (ie basic) but they offer some approachable selections at reasonable prices. The calamari, spaghetti with veal meatballs, and butternut squash ravioli are highly recommended.
