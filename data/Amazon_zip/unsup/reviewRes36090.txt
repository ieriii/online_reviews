I came with my friend for lunch and the food was really good! I had the wonton noodle soup with duck and it was delicious. I will be coming back again to try that awesome looking duck dinner! I also had to have a laugh-Does anyone know what 'Octopus Whiskers' are? It was listed on the menu-will have to ask the server next time :)
