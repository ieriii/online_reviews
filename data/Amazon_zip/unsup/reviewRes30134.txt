dinner last night here was sooo good. cucumber gin gimlet + a selection of the rolls (lobster + kobe beef, salmon in jicama tacos, 2 types of tuna)... definitely fusion but soo good. also i loved that when i told them i was allergic to white tuna (escolar) they were able to easily substitute it with a second type of tuna.
