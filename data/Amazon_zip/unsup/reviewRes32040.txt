This update is long over due. Still one of the best games in town. However, I'm very disappointed with a number of menu changes over the years including but not limited to removal of raw food menu, removal of juice bar, change of biscuit recipe, long waiting periods for service, inconsistency of food preparation, etc. It seems like most of these changes have been driven by the bottom dollar, so to speak. Unfortunately, it has become the place of choice for the vegan-junk-food-addicted hipster.
