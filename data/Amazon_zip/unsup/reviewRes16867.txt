About 6 weeks ago, I got home from a business trip and just wanted a good meal. So I grabbed the man and headed to Carnivale. We sat right down and took part in the Mojito special. We couldn't even decide what to order because so many things looked good. So, we just started ordering a little of this and a little of that. Our waitress was so patient with our indecision and was the perfect combo of checking in on us and letting us be. Everything I had was good. My steak was out of this world, even when I warmed it up the next day! We got a cheese sampler, a duck appetizer, and some other things- I wish I could remember better, but overall Carnivale left a good taste in my mouth :)
