Great atmosphere...you feel transported in time to another era. The talented musicians who play here are truly like no others. Your senses will delight in the sights and sweet sounds filling the air. You won't only hear the music, but you will feel it. If you're a jazz club novice like me, you'll wonder why you've been missing out on this experience for so long. The Green Mill is magical. Hence, a great date place. Drinks are stiff, just to my liking. Seating is hard to find but you'll probably be too caught up in the music to even notice that you're standing. If you ask politely, a couple may let you share a booth with them.
