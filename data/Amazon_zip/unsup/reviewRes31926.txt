Not good authentic Ethiopian food at all! I must say the first disappointment was that their website and yelp say they are open at 11:30 am during the week but they really don't let anyone come in and sit down for lunch until after noon. I ordered their vegetarian lunch special which was 4 tastings of different dishes and injera. My first complaint is that their injera has almost no sour flavor too it like really injera should. I was very disappointed in this because that taste is what I crave about Ethiopian food... and is the only thing I can not replicate at home. The second issue with my food was that every mini dish I tried was full of oil. So much oil that is broke down the injera so that I couldn't use the bread underneath it as a utensil like you are supposed to. It is also not a good feeling to have to eat really oily food with your hands. Lastly, I was extremely disappointed in the service. I was the only person in the entire restaurant and no one checked on me even once throughout my meal. My water glass what empty about half-way through my lunch and never got re-filled. This is how NOT to run a mom and pop food business. Don't go here... check out Lalibela. They are a bit more expensive but better in every other way and they are BYOB.
