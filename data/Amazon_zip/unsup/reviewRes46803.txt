I stopped here for an early dinner on Saturday. Since I was a party of one, I sat in the lounge area. The bar staff were busy preparing for the evening rush, but they still served me pretty promptly. I ordered the mushroom flan as an appetizer. It was tiny, but quite tasty. The herbs worked well with the mushrooms and cannelloni beans. I wasn't hungry enough for a full entree, so I skipped to dessert. I ordered the pear brown butter cake and was glad that I did. It was about the size and shape of a cupcake, topped with a generous scoop of brown butter gelato. The sweet, buttery flavors of the cake and ice cream paired very well with the poached pear slices. For drinks, I had a nice Virtue Redstreak cider and an outstanding beer from Greenbush called "Red Bud Ale". I'd recommend them both.
