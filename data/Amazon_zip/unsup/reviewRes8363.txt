This pizza is awesome- thats all you really need to know. The hours and days open can be random. I'm pretty sure they shut down for a week or two in July or August. We order pick-up from these guys often and they are always real nice about it (you do need to do it in person, and it normally only takes about 5-10 minutes once you get the order in) The apps and bread are very tasty... they do it right! All the dough is made up fresh everyday... mmmmmmmm
