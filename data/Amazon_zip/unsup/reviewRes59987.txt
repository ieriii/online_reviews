The first time I went to Big Jones, it was during lunch and we were the only table there. I don't remember what I ate but remembered thinking that it was really good food. Even though the bf had a piece of plastic in his food. (That should've been a huge clue!) The second time, I went with my sister. There was a 45 minute wait-- so we waited. The service was spotty from the start. The waiter forgot sis' drink, forgot the cornbread till we reminded him, then the manager (i think?) proceeded to spill the gumbo all over the table. After some debate, we sent the gumbo back because it was too spicy. It was replaced by the worst sandwich I've ever had. The pull pork sandwich did not come with a fried egg, like the menu promised, was completely rubbery and dry and drenched in a nauseatingly sweet sauce. Though I had planned to get dessert, I couldn't wait to get out of there. We ended up getting cupcakes and cream puffs at a nearby bakery.----2/28/2012Ahh yes-- the Big Jones menu says the pork sandwich is served on an EGG bun, not with fried egg. My bad! This does not discount the fact that the pulled pork was rubbery and sickeningly sweet.
