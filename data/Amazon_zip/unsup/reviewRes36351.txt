Everything I've tried and everything my friends have tried here is fantastic. The staff is very friendly, the menu is diverse, and the decor is surprisingly charming for such a small place. Not a bad date place unless you're looking to wow someone with how much money you're spending. Addendum: Holy cow! If I could add another star after trying the Indie Signature Curry with beef, I would. Essentially a massaman curry, the beef was so tender I almost needed a straw and the sauce was incredible! Even the delightfully presented acorn squash was delicious and I hate squash.
