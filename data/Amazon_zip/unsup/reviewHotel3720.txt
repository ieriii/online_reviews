Probably my favorite hotel in Chicago. I have stayed here several times for leisure and absolutely love everything about it. Unlike some of the other Chicago hotels, it has retained its classic, elegant decor despite the push to become ultra modern. It has all of the amenities of a first-class hotel and very friendly and kind staff. I just feel great staying at the Drake. This is a great place to come for those looking to spend a fun weekend in the city. Never pretentious and always timeless, the Drake is the best place in Chicago to hide out from the and bustle of city life while still having access to all of the great things this city offers. I especially like the interior decoration and the suites with a lake-view. In comparison with similar European luxury hotels, the Drake really is not too expensive. So I really do hope you treat yourself and someone special to this fine Chicago institution.
