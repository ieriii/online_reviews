I am sure this place has been reviewed and revisited more than the Civil War, However, I feel compelled, almost honor bound to throw in my two cents here. Every bite is like an orgasm for your mouth. I am qualifying this with the statement that I am a pretty picky person, I don't like new fangled things on my dog/sausage, Mustard is the only condiment I condone, that being said do not modify what ever he puts on the sausage, let it go, try it, be adventurous and you will be rewarded ten fold. Doug does not screw up, ever. weather it is sauerkraut and Gouda on an spicy sausage or elk, antelope, venison with blackberry butter, you will not be disappointed, he is simply a wizard with encased meats.  One more thing to mention, I would suggest that you get a corn dog, I am pretty sure they are laced with something, it is the only explanation for how unbelievable they are, also on Friday and Saturday the fries are cooked in duck fat... just unbelievable, simply mind blowing, take the trip, bundle up (you are gonna have to wait in a line that extends outside) and enjoy the best dog or sausage in Chicago.
