I stayed at The James for 4 nights - 2 nights work and 2 nights play! This was the perfect place to stay. The first night I went to the bar for a bite and a drink. The bartender was very friendly and even made me a concotion based on my likings. I got the Kobe Corndogs which were very good. You can tell that they use quality ingredients. The next morning I realized that I needed to make colored copies on my way since I had to make some changes to my presentation. Of course I am running late too, so the manager helped me out and printed out everything I needed. He went the extra mile and was really nice and quick. During our stay, we also happened to wander into J Bar on Friday and Saturday night. This lounge was small, but a perfect size for the amount of people they accomodate on a normal day. The drinks were a bit pricey but stout - so well worth it. And the music was ideal for a lounge - all the latest hits. We also ordered in breakfast one morning. The entree was huge, filling, and tasty - quality ingredients once again. Room service usually lets me down, but not at The James! The rooms were always clean. My boyfriend and I were a mess and the maid always seemed to be able to put things away where they belonged. My sister, who was staying next door thinks she cleaned up too much and that it was weird. But being there for 4 days... I appreciated it! The beds were comfortable, mini bar well stocked, and Kiehl's products!!! Turn down service every night with little mini cookies. The only downfall about this place is the street noise, but the hotel isn't to blame. I give them 5 stars for a perfect hotel experience 4 days in a row.
