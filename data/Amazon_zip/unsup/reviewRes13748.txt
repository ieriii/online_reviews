I had to give it a few visits before I felt comfortable writing a review--just to be sure I was reacting to Revolution and not all the psyching myself up that has gone down the past month waiting for this place to open. Christoph's assessment with the architecture is right on, so I won't bore you with my version. I just want to add that the blown glass bottles light fixture is really, really cool. Careful attention to detail ties the decor in with the theme of brewing. It is classy enough to bring the parents, or a hot date, but casual enough for late night drinks with friends. The beer: their selection is very good, not surprisingly. I look forward to the rotation on the taps. By the time I finally got in (I turned down a three hour wait my first visit), there were only three beers left, but one of them was the Bottom Up Wit--which I am madly in love with. This hazy wheaty beer has me thinking about going to Revolution most nights. The food: I had a forest burger and bacon fat popcorn. The popcorn is bacon, cheese, and fried sage (I think). Thumbs up. The forest burger was very foresty, with Gorgonzola, mushrooms, and... get ready for this... fried shallots. So I eat several times a month at Kuma's, and no burger can compete. However, when I don't feel like any of the Kuma's options it will be nice to have to forest burger to melt over.... and the mussels look pretty darned amazing. The service--I've only sat at the bar. But Charlie was a delight on a very busy Saturday night, and everyone else seemed generally happy to please. If you are worried about the quirks of a new restaurant/brew pub and don't live near-by, give it a few months, I guess. Otherwise, I'll see you in line.
