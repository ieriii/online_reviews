It's hard to find good food let alone great food in this part of town, found it! Nana Organic has something for everyone. I go there at least twice a week breakfast or lunch mostly. I when for dinner a few nights ago with my good friend Brent, he really liked the whole organic, locally grown ideas that they had. The sweet potato chips are hand cut and made to order.. With truffle oil... And everything on the breakfast menu is just, try it all. ALL!
