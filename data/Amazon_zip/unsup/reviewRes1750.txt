It was good, but I wouldn't say the best hot dogs ever! Not worth the 45 minute wait that I did wait for. That's coming from a girl who doesn't eat a lot of hot dogs though, but I do have to say I loved their corn dog and I had the tequila, black bean chicken sausage that was really good! Their regular french fries are not that great, and my boyfriend got a steamed dog and a grilled dog which were okay. The owner who takes your order is extremely nice though and takes time with you and helps you with your order no matter how long the line! ^_^ I loved all the hot dog paraphernalia around, gives you tons to look at, and the colors of the place are simply marvelous! :D I had a great time here as well, but I wouldn't call it the best hot dog - or maybe I'm just not a hot dog lover :P
