Minus one star for the horrible line. I mean I know it's not their fault they are so popular, but ambiance and everything else factors in to ratings, so yeah. You can't rate a place "as good as it gets" when you have to wait 2+ hours just to get a hot dog. I will say the food is pretty tasty. Duck fat fries are awesome and the various sausages are great. Not 2+ hour wait, great, though.
