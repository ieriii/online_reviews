I had an amazing experience at Q recently. Heard great things and made reservations for an early Father's day dinner there. I think it'd be a really long wait to eat there without a reservation. Like everyone said, they served free pickles and chips when you're seated. Best.Pickles.Evar. We shared the BBQ flight, and the Kobe brisket was to die for. I think I'm going to order the entree the next time I'm there. The mac and cheese is also something to get as a side. It was light and fluffy, but the cheese was rich and creamy. Most of us had the St. Louis ribs, which was good. I liked that they gave you BBQ on the side. We had the best server. He was polite, knew his stuff, and wasn't obnoxious. In fact, the entire staff was great. The ambience was great too. I liked the southern style home-y feeling the restaurant had. Apparently they serve brunch, which our server told us about. Definitely checking that out sooner rather than later.
