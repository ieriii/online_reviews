It's hard to tell what kind of place Xoco is when you get in. Is it a nice sit-down restaurant? Upscale fast food? Do you serve yourself? What's happening? Don't worry and just let them guide you through the line. Order & grab your water & sit down and prepare to enjoy food. The ahogada torta is Mexican Heaven. Seriously, it's a meaty, tomatoey wonder of the near north side, and the bread played this neat trick where it soaked in the broth and absorbed all the flavor without getting soggy. I need to learn how to do that to impress my friends. My fiancee's chipotle chicken torta also knocked it afuera de la parque, and I was even impressed by the two salsas that come with the chips. In other words, it's relatively cheap, relatively fast and amazing Mexican food in the heart of the city and it's literally a sin to not eat here.
