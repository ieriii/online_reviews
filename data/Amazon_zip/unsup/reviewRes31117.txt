I went in with 11 other people for my graduation dinner and had an outstanding experience. Brian and MJ took care of our table and they were just excellent. We started with two seafood towers- which were awesome. Everything seemed very fresh and we were excited for the rest of the meal after that. We went onto the salad/soup course.. but once those steaks hit the table, our concersations ceased. From the passing of the lobster mashed potatoes, creamed spinach, sweet potato fries, mac & cheese, truffle gnocci... we were all a little busy. The grand finale was the dessert course.... SAVE ROOM FOR THE SUGAR CAKE! My best friend and I claimed we would only have one bite, but we were fighting over the last piece. This was a steakhouse experience I won't forget and will definitely appreciate. Great attention to detail with the quality of food and service for each table. The wine suggestions were spot on for the whole meal. Now I can't wait for more family or friends to visit so we can go back!! In a word: outstanding.
