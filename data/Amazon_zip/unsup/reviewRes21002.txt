I am so lucky to live around the corner from Coast! I have been going here or getting carry-out at least once a week for over a year and a half and I have converted every friend I have brought here into a Coast loving advocate of great sushi. My favorite menu items are the hamachi carpaccio (to die for!), the volcano roll, and the edamame. You may be thinking "they are just boiled soybeans, how great could they be?" but they are served piping hot and super fresh every single time. I have literally had everything on the menu besides the california roll (what's the point?) and anything with salmon (not a fan, sorry) and it was fresh, tasty, and satisfying. There is a 711 across the street and a liquor store at the corner of Armitage and Damen to satisfy your BYOB needs (no corkage fee!) I recommend making a reservation on the weekends or if you have more than 4, this place is always hoppin'. Groupon can send me all the half-off sushi deals in the city but I refuse to cheat on my Coast. Ok, one exception: Fresh Sushi and Noodles on Wellington, but only for the Picante maki with cilantro. Go to Coast, you will not be disappointed!
