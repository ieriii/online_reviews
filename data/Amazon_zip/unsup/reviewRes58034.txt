Another must see in Chi-town! The food is so good and if you are there in the summer, they have the cutest outdoor patio.If the wait is long - just hang in there - so worth it! Also, being from CA I am spoiled when it comes to fresh fish...Mia has got it covered! I had the skatewing and it was PHA - NOMINAL.What are you waiting for - Go Go Go!
