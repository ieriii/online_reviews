Delicious local, Metropolis coffee (try a mocha!), fresh (often organic and local) ingredients, gorgeous presentation, friendly staff, locally and family owned... I just can't say enough good things about Nana! I love almost all the food items here. Chef Meikle is a genius. If the Fried Oyster Chowder is on the menu (it's seasonal/rotating), get it. It's amazing!
