If I were I duck and had the foreknowledge of my mortal fate, I'd make my way to Sun Wah, because I know that they'll do me right. Traditional-style. Yes, all the incredible hype you've heard about the duck at Sun Wah is true. If you're a newbie to duck-dom, you're in for a treat. Try out the Peking Dinner. If you've been to Sun Wah and haven' t had the duck, well, shame on you. Have some of the 1000 ducks sold weekly from Sun Wah. But Sun Wah is not a one pony show. It's not only the ducks. Crispy Pork is another item worth mention. (oh.) The sea weed soup is a party on your tounge (ah.) The salt baked chicken with the sauce from the culinary god is another simple dish you should try.
