I'm told Calo has been around for a VERY long time (an old woman I was chatting with on the Clark bus actually told me this), and I can certainly see why. The weekend dinner crowd is decidedly...older (you could almost mistake yourself for being in the suburbs from the looks of the clientele), but for good, simple Italian food at a reasonable price and a great dirty martini, you can't find a better place in Andersonville (or I'd venture to say the Northside). The atmosphere is fine, nothing too special; and the service can be a little slow, but they had a singer crooning some good tunes (think Frank Sinatra and Cole Porter) that livened things up a bit. The food is heartily portioned, and all entrees come with soup or salad, a perk that seems to be dying out in most good restaurants. I had the ziti alla vodka -- the sauce was fantastic and packed with sun dried tomatoes and chicken and basil. And enough food for three meals. My fiance had the carbonara, which wouldn't be my pick, but it was rich and creamy goodness with crispy bacon. Our friend had the gnocchi with gorgonzola sauce which he seemed to love -- he was the only one to clean his plate! Calo is a fantastic place to take visiting parents, and I imagine it would be great for large groups as well -- I've often seen large parties there. Parking lot across the street makes for extra convenience, though parking in Andersonville never seems to be a huge problem (and I should know, I park there every day). For us, it was a nice meal on a Friday evening before hitting the bar scene. OH and I almost forgot about the amazing pizza bread in the bread basket. Good lord that could be a meal in itself.
