One of my favorite restaurants in Chicago, right across from Grant Park on Michigan. Awesome gastro pub. Classy, old Chicago speakeasy style. Great service. Awesome food and food choices. Great beer and cocktail selection. Try the house "Gage" drink, it's sweet, but delicious and strong. The pork shoulder sandwich is aaaaaawesome!
