I consider myself a breakfast aficionado--my favorite meal of the day--and Milk and Honey beat my probably crappy home-made hashbrowns, waffles, eggs, and pancakes to a pulp. Serving some curious breakfasts I hadn't tried before, I ordered the smoked salmon and bagel with some coffee. The food was great, and the coffee was Intelligentsia (enough said). People were rummaging around for seats like bats out of hell, but once you get in line you get seated quickly enough. Nothing to whine and moan about, Yelpers.
