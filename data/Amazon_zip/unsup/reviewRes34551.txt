I took my family here when they were visiting from MI and staying at the Hilton a few weeks ago. Everyone wanted to give five stars! The restaurant is bright & airy, and there were plenty of tables for our family of five, which can cause a bit of a wait sometimes. We came around 8:30 on a Saturday morning with no wait, even though there were plenty of hungry patrons already eating. Yolk's menu is fantastic - so many things looked good! Being the corned beef hash connoisseur that I am, I knew I could not pick otherwise, though ;)  I loved that we could have pancakes with our entree - creating that perfect balance of sweet and savory. The pancakes were delicious too - sort of a multi-grain texture - I would definitely get them all on their own. The hash was oh-so-yummy - crisp & savory, and the potatoes and eggs just added to the perfection. My mom got the bacon waffles and, oh my, they were amazing - bits of bacon baked into the waffle!! They gave my corned beef hash a run for its money - I would order them in the off chance I didn't have a corned beef hash craving ;) To top everything off, we had a wonderful server - very friendly and attentive. This will be our go-to spot for breakfast from now on - the prices were reasonable and the food so very comforting.
