We've stayed here before with a less than stellar stay but gave it another chance this past weekend and was much more pleased.. This Crowne Plaza is in Greektown so if you love Greek food.. you will LOVE walking down the street and having your pick of a number of Greek restaurants.. I also like how there's a 24-hour supermarket (Dominick's) a block away and a Walgreen's the opposite way, a block away. The rooms are cozy. The sliding door to the bathroom is a bit bothersome. There's a number of amenities of which borrowing an umbrella is one, is available. Room service till 11pm. I also like how you need a room card to use the elevators.. it adds a safety factor. During our last stay, we had problems with other guests harassing us with no help from the staff. The shower didn't drain and maintenance said they fixed it but for the entire weekend we showered in standing water.. This stay was much better.. the only thing that we can say anything about is housekeeping. After having our room cleaned, they never replaced the glasses or sundries and the towels were folded and messily placed on the shelf. Other than that, everything was fine. And! lastly, valet was great in getting us cabs and even a limo for us one night.. (crucial for us with none of our own transportation)
