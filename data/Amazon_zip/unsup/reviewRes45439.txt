So I heard this was supposed to be a gay bar and while it definitely is a mixed crowd - the soundtrack is totally gay. After I got past the Cyndi Lauper megamix I really liked this place. You win some, you lose some. This area of Lakeview needed something just like this. The food is top-notch. I couldn't decide between the Shepard's Pie and the Meatloaf, so going off the waiter's recommendation, I went with the meatloaf. I was not disappointed. I hadn't had any meatloaf this good - well, ever. And the onion rings were melt in your mouth deliciousness, as well. All in all, this place is comfy, cozy and HUGE. The service was on point, it was moderately priced ($12-15 entree range) and it was a great place to spend an evening with friends.
