Oh man, just as good as I hoped. I had a Portuguese sausage with Saffron Rouille and Manchego Cheese. It was phenomenal. I didn't want to take the last bite because I was so sad to see it go. My friend got the vegetarian hotdog, which was amazing as well - she said it tasted so much like meat to her that she was worried it WAS meat. I, as a carnivore, could tell it wasn't, but it was easily the best vegetarian dog I've ever had. We also got cheese fries which were amazing, if ridiculously rich. I think we did Hot Dougs the "right" way - we went at an odd time (11:30 AM on a Thursday) and only had to wait for about 30 minutes, most of it inside. Your first time going, I'd recommend doing it that way - the wait really isn't that bad, and we were able to snag a table. The service was really really friendly. It was very pleasant. I wish I had been there on the weekend to try the duck fat fries, and now that I know Hot Dougs is as good as its hype, I'll be willing to wait the insane times for weekend lunch. Just. Go. This is one of those places you really can't miss.
