Went there on Labor Day around 4 pm and there was 1/2 hour wait. I was determined to try the salad bar since many were raving about it. It was just A-OK. Grunts do not typically have extra clean plates at the salad bar so you have to ask your server each time for a clean plate. (I guess they need to earn their tip somehow) I think the salad bar at Ruby Tuesday's in Lincolnwood Town Center Mall is a better value and cheaper too.
