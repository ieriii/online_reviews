3.5 stars. Parking and the wait times can be slightly aggravating. I'm not a beer person so I didn't try any of their brews but my friends seemed to have enjoyed them greatly. The pizzas while good were more visually appealing than tasty. We ordered 2 large pizzas for the 6 of us and they came on huge industrial size trays. Mass amounts of anything cheese is glorious looking! The pizzas are good but I'm not sure if I agree with all the hoopla about it. I guess for thin crust this is one of the better places in the midwest.
