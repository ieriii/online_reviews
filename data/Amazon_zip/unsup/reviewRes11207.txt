Had a friend in town and we both noticed the rather obscene line in front of Bongo Room on our way to Earwax. I've seen this event happen more than a couple of Sundays in a row, and thought that I would have to go and try it at some point. The friend who was visiting agreed, and thankfully I do have Tuesdays off work. Therefore, he and I trekked the entire ten minutes to the place and sat down while enjoying the decor. The fans were rather space-age looking and delighted us for a while. Wide open spaces are also quite a comfort when not quite fully awake, but trying to do so. Was quite delighted in perusing the menu I enjoyed debating over what to get. Settled on the lemon pancakes with cream, and thoroughly enjoyed myself. My friend, a fan of turkey bacon, settled on two eggs over easy with the Thai chicken sausage--which he said was rather delectable. The prices had me raise an eyebrow at first, but the meal was well worth the price paid. Both of us left quite satisfied in our palates and stomachs, the friend having to take home in a box his potatoes. The waitress was a little off-putting and perfunctory, though never really less than civil.
