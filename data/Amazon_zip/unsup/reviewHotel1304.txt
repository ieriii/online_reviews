My fianc and I stayed 3 luxurious nights in the Anniversary Suite for New Years. We had arrived early so, we had the concierge hold our luggage until the room was ready. During our wait, we ate at the cafe for lunch. We waited 15-20 minutes for our meal. Since it was a minor inconvenience, the manager offered us 2 complimentary glasses of the Cabernet Sauvignon we were drinking. I thought that was pretty nice... I had the "Four Storey Hill Farm Young Chicken, Yukon Gold Potato Pure, Baby Turnips, Crimini Mushrooms, Roasted Garlic Jus". That was probably the most memorable restaurant chicken meal I've ever had. The meat was so tender and had excellent flavor. Not too overpowering... The vegetables were perfect.  As we got to our room, our luggage was already set up for us. I'm not going to blabber about the details in the room. The pictures speak for themselves... That night, we attended a black tie event in the greenhouse area. There was a live band, our own private ice sculpture at our table! And a gourmet buffet adorned with fresh sushi, rack of lamb, caviar, French breads and cheeses, oysters, and so much more. It was a feast! The last night we were there, I also had tried the "Butternut Squash Lasagna, Butternut Squash Pure, Ricotta Cheese, Walnuts, Spinach" -absolutely amazing... If you don't mind spending some coin for a luxurious hotel stay, this is the place to go. Excellent service, convenient, great location, right at the center of the Magnificent Mile. And I almost forget to mention I'm one of those gals that like 'free' stuff. -ha... I collected about $200 worth of L'Occitane soaps and conditioners. Hey! It's good stuff can you blame me!? We had a fabulous time here...
