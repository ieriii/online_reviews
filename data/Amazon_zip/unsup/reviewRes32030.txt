Our family finds Sunda to be one of our favorite places. The atmosphere is wonderful, the sushi is great and the cocktails are fantastic. Even the Moschi ice cream was good and I had my doubts. The mimosa kits are a definite. Homemade juice purees make you feel like you're drinking something heatlhty!!! On our most recent visit our server was great - friendly, smart and helpful. She made several great recommendations and took great care of us without spending too much time at our table. We really love this place.
