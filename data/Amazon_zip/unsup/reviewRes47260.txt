I haven't been here in a while but last time I showed up, I believe it was a Monday. I was with some friends, and it was 25 cent wing night. We ordered 40 wings, and there was 5 of us. Had a couple beers, watched some concert they had on tv (realized it was a dvd after it ended), but overall it was a fun time. Don't pay much mind to Vlad K's review, as he must be think he's a beer connoisseur, but this place is great for drinks and food. I enjoy the whole "locked up" theme, and it's not really in your face compared to several other bars. Empty Bottle is across the street, but it's typically filled with too many hipsters and ending up there you usually smell like an ashtray...not so much with Lockdown. They literally...have it on Lockdown.
