Had a luke warm experience here about two months ago. I had cheese and drinks here years ago in the front area. That was a fine time. Then two months ago I came for dinner and it was a different experience. Decided to have dinner here on a Saturday night using the WTTW Member Card. It is good for two for one entrees. Great deal. I made a reservation on Open Table and we were seated at a two top that was very close to tables on either side. I know this is the name of the game in many restaurants but unfortunately for us, the two girls seats to my left were loud and commenting on my table the entire night. Very annoying. The place is loud in general. We were seating in the area furthest away from the entrance. The sound just travels everywhere. There was a loud group seated not far from us, and we heard them all night. We started with a cheese plate and a wine flight. The wine and cheese were great. I think we had the Cow, Sheep and Buffalo Walk Into a Bar plate. I ordered a burger for my entree and it came out charred. I could actually smell it while eating. Huge turnoff. I can't say that I'll return if I have a choice based on the burger and the ambiance. Not for dinner anyway. Maybe for wine and cheese if someone else suggested it.
