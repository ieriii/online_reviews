Stayed here on my anniversary. Got a room with a king sized bed on the 17th??? floor. Love the close proximity to the Mag-Mile. Love the free wi-fi as opposed to the Hilton, which charges you on a timer.  Super clean... control your own A.C. Modern and with flat screen tv's. Pull out couch was clean. Spacious.  This place didn't have a personalized kiosk like other hotels, but it didn't matter because sometimes those kiosks aren't all that helpful anyway.  The only downside was something kind of funny. The bathrooms don't have a fan. Haha.  Tell the wifey, to wait it out if you drop a deuce...
