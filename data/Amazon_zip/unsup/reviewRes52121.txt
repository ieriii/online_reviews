UUGGHHH!!..im full!...the pizza at Gino's is absolutely great!... that is if you're fond of Chicago Style Pizza! The crust is thick. We ordered the sausage and pepperoni, the sausage was not just sprinkled over the top, but it was in a whole patti that covered the entire pizza. The ambiance is graffiti writing on everything, everywhere you look in the restaurant has writing on it, from people who have visited from all over the country. The Pizza is a meal in itself and absolutely great- I gave it 5-stars!. Although on my personal scale of 1-10 with 10 being absolutely great I gave it a 8.
