When my authentic Mexican friend came to visit he demanded that we go for authentic Mexican food. Apparently good Mexican food is very scarce where he lives, because he told me to cancel the reservations at Gilt Bar, he would rather go to this place. I was paying, so it would have been a much better deal for him to go to Gilt Bar, but he likes his Mexican food and he wanted Mexican food. Immediately. So we feasted here. He ordered lengua and some other meat I don't eat. I got some shrimp and we split a chile relleno. The shrimp was great, I was even impressed with the bed of rice upon which it was served. Seriously awesome rice. How many places do you go where you walk away thinking, "wow, that rice sure was good!"? Not many. The chile relleno was not my favorite, but I have high standards. My authentic Mexican friend was very pleased with the lengua and the other meat he ordered that I can't remember. He even had heartburn half the night and claims it was worth it. When we got there at about 7:30 on a Saturday night the line was out the door, but we were convinced by some regulars to stay, and the line moved fairly quickly. The people behind us opened beer in the line, so that is one option to make the time go faster. As soon as you are seated you are served chips and salsa and pickled vegetables and we were given a chicken soup appetizer. The pickled vegetables were my favorite and I want to learn how to make them myself. The atmosphere is very casual and fun, but not a lot of options for vegetarians. Staff is very friendly, efficient, and patient in a chaotic atmosphere. BYOB, as you probably already know.
