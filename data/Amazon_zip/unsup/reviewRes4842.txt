The Purple Pig suffers from being in a tourist pocket, but it still keeps it's tiny euro bistro/american Indy vibe despite this. It's a small plate menu - and you'll want at least 2 to yourself. We shared the neck gravy in red sauce with ricotta and I scarfed down the braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes. Both dishes were excellent. My friends had the calamari and the olives stuffed with chorizo. I ordered the fried sardines with fennel salad sort of as dessert. It was bomb.  $6 glasses of wine and damn good tapas. Good lookin' staff - most with tattoos.
