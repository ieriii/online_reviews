I love the Chicago Diner!!! It was one of the first places I went to when I first moved to Chicago and have continued to love it since. As a vegan, it has tons and tons of options that are all absolutely delicious. I've taken many of my carnivorous friends here- including my meat-loving boyfriend- and they have all found something on the menu that they love. And the milkshakes... oh my god... don't even get me started! Check this place out for sure!
