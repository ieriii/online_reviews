I picked this place for me and the boy for our 13th anniversary. This was one of the closest hotels to Navy Pier which made me go for it. The hotel was very nice and clean. I loved the way the halls are decorated. They had this modern, but classic look to it. The rooms are cool as well. The room kind of reminded me of something I saw on that tv show trading spaces. There are a couple of drawbacks to this hotel- The Internet- its like a massive deadzone when you enter this place. I have 5 bars, but yet my Internet isn't moving. I feel as if they are blocking Internet signals here to make you purchase their Internet ( Which is awful. I'm used to Comcast Internet hunty. The Allerton charges 10 bucks a day for dial up speed Internet. # GurlBye There is also a mini bar, but you'd be crazier than hell to use it. You should just reach into your wallet, pull out money and light it on fire. That's how much of a waste of money it is. A bottle of water is 4 dollars, oh and the mini bar has an electronic sensor so if you move something just to look at it you will be charged. Tip- one block over you can park for 30 dollars less than this hotel charges to park! (50 bucks)
