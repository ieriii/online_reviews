Just ate here this morning with the GF. We both ordered egg sandwiches and they were quite delicious! I could do with out the hashbrowns that came with the sandwich, but overall I was very impressed. My GF ordered and ICE-TEA which had a very unique taste. I will definitely be heading back to Glenn's Diner for brunch.
