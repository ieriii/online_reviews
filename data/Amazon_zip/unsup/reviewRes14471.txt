My companion and I were all ready to go on a power shopping spree at the Menards on Clybourn. The only problem in site, hunger, ravenous hunger. I've learned my lesson, shopping with my companion when he's on an empty stomach is no good. And if you have ever shopped in this area you know that good food choices are rather minimal. So this was the perfect opportunity to suggest going to 90 miles. "Oh sweetie, we could finally try that 90 miles cafe everybody on yelp has been going gaga for." "Well is it going to be a long meal, I don't want to spend all night eating, I have a lot of things I want to buy at Menards. Ack, so hungry, help, hungry, need food help, food now." "Hurry drive down Clybourn, stat!" We arrive before the chance of any dinner rush and were very warmly greeted. The lady taking our order could tell that it was our first time so she stepped out from behind the counter and handed us menus so we wouldn't have to crane our necks at the chalkboard.  I was born with a Cuban sandwich in my mouth so I had to go with the staple and a cafe con leche. My companion went with the Media Noche (sweet version of the Cuban sandwich) and some sweet plantains and a chorizo empanada to share. The food came out very fast and was eaten very fast. From start to finish the meal was excellent. All the flavors were fresh and went well together. I ended up eating all of the empanada because once I took a bite, I could not put it down. This made my companion sad. But his Media Noche sandwich made him happy. I can understand why, he let me take a bite and the bread tasted like dessert. It was sweet and crispy like a candy shell, it was a great spin on the classic Cuban sandwich.  We were very satisfied when we left. I think knowing this is here will garner a lot more trips to the hardware store in the future. I'm ok with with that. Also the owners are opening up a second location on Armitage, where Calvin's used to be. Yay for coming closer to me!
