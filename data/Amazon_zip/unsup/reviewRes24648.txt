Friendly greeting + service that acknowledged our open table reservation request. Appreciate the flexible wine options (both variety and serving size) Food ranged from really good to great Great Coca costillas de ternera Datiles con almendras Almost great Patatas bravas Wagyu "zabuton" Really good Truita de patata A special squash blossom with goat cheese The one quibble I'd note is @ $42 the wagyu's impact on the tab is much greater than its impact on the meal. It was the most expensive item by far, and it was good, but it was probably our third or fourth favorite item of the night.  Nonetheless, Mercat has secured a spot on in our rotation of nice places to have dinner and places to take visitors from out of town.
