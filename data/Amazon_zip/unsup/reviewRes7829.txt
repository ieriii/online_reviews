This pizza is as good as you'll find without going to Naples. In fact, I think it would be considered great pizza even in the old country. Fresh, simple ingredients and a perfectly cooked pie--what more could you ask for. If you want to veer away from the pizza selection, the burrata cheese appetizer is the bomb. Otherwise, I haven't felt the need to sample any of the non-pizza portion of the menu. I live on the other side of the city, but Spacca is always worth a trip.
