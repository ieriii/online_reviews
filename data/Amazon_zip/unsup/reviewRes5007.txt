I love this place. The food, the wine, the atmosphere. It's a great place. The wait can be long, but you can go shop at Nordstrom while you wait. The bone marrow and fried brussel sprouts were really good. They have a good beer selection to. I particularly like sitting at the bar because the guys will recommend food and wine pairings.
