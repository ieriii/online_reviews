The Purple Pig is my go-to spot when I'm in Chicago. The menu is great and very pork-centric (obviously). I wont go into detail about all the things I've eaten, but only the ones that have definitely stood out. 1. Bone Marrow - Decadent and delicious. Smear some marrow on the toast, sprinkle a little sea salt, the salad and you are in heaven. 2. Pork Cheek with a fried egg. Let the yolk run over the pork. Enjoy fatty porky delictiousness.The staff is also very helpful and accommodating. When I arrived, the place was packed to the gills, but the hostess was very quick to find me a comfortable place at the bar. Any of my questions about the wine, food, or beer was also answered with apparent knowledge.This place is great for a meal of small plates, or just a couple of casual drinks and some cheese.Go to the Purple Pig.
