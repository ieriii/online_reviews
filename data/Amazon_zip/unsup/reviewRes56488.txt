Jeff C. I definitely remember the Dominator and this restaurant is not it.I have watched Rick on TV for years and always thought the food looked awesome and authentic. So when I happen to be in the city and came across it during luchtime I jumped at the chance to eat there. What a dissapointment.I had the steak tacos and started laughing for they arrived. For 15 dollars I got 3 tortillas(which were not handmade) and the smallest portion of meat I have ever seen. The salsas were nothing special and I left hungry and definitely unsatisfied. Don't get sucked into this place for the name...just will be dissapointed.
