Ugh, I know this is a hard place to get into, celebrity chef and all. We came here as a celebration dinner when friends of ours got engaged. They really wanted to go here (traveling from DC) made reservations 2 months in advance for a group of 6..... and we waited and hour and a half after our reservation time. Ugh, I just kinda think it's crappy - they didn't offer us anything, and it was a special night.  The food was okay - we ordered an appetizer sampler for the group which was okay - but we were all starving and I think we just shoveled the food down and didn't really enjoy it as we should. I ordered shrimp - and I really did like it. The service was very good - other then out initial wait. I'm not dying to go back.
