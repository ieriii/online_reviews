I love beer, a lot. Generally, people have a hard time mentioning a beer that I haven't tried. It seems that the stars would be aligned for Hopleaf and I to have a beautiful relationship. Call it chemistry, call it what you will, but something about 'us' just doesn't work. It's not you, it's me. I'm sure other beer snobs have a great time in your cozy seats, but for me there's always been something amiss. I've had bad service, bad beer, and not so good food. I've had these three things on the other side of the spectrum as well, but it's bad more than it's good. I think my opinion of Hopleaf can be likened to a movie that you expect to be amazing. It's not terrible by any means, but by not living up to the hyped up expectations, it falls falls falls way short.
