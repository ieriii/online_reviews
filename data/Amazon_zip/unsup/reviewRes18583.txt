Great beer list. Decent burgers. What I find most striking about this place is the proximity of their urinals. They're unusually close to each other. Conjoined twins can simultaneously empty their bladders at The Bad Apple with comfort and ease. The rest of us will have to keep staring at the wall until our business is done. That or risk a punch to the throat.
