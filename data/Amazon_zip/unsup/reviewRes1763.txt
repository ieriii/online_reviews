Finally know what all the hype is about. Friday's Duck Fat Fries! The flavors of the Foie Gras sausage were much more subtle than I expected. I could taste the duck sausage but it was nothing like a pork or beef sausage. The subtleness was obviously intended because the flavors of the foie gras mousse is also on the lighter side. A gourmet hot dog indeed for $9...what a deal. Coolness, they also have your less expensive typical "Chicago Style Hot Dog" for $1.75 with all the fixings.
