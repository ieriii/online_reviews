This place was incredible! The food was amazing. And when i say amazing... I mean freakin amazing. I love Korean food and have had a bunch of it and of all places how does Chicago have the best Korean place ever!?! What?!? Awesome people work there. Awesome Bim-Bim-Bap. And amazing Korean Spiced chicken wings. So awesome in fact that is made my good buddy who has been a vegetarian for over 10 years fall off the wagon and eat some! Go now if you want awesome stuff. If you are a hater of awesome, delicious food, go eat at 7-11.
