So, my friends decided that this would be a great place for my surprise birthday party and well not to take away from the awesomeness of my girlfriend or my friends I wanna be honest about Carnivale.... The ambiance was amazing and the folks that were eating here were some of Chicago's Finest! Kudos to the HOT FOLKS of Chi-Town!  Now when you make a reservation for 10 and have to wait for an additional 45 minutes? Really? We all arrived a little late due to the Chicago Mag Mile Lighting...so being a typical establishment with "Rules" we could not be seated till the entire party was present...ah...rules...more like excuses! So the entire party is there waiting for my arrival and rather than walking up to a table and being surprised my friends had to stage themselves in a dimly lit bar and with the amount of folks in the bar well....lets just say it was not what they had planned. Dinner was just ok and the steak I ordered was just that nothing special...the Empenadas and Plantain dishes were awesome and the mojitos were full of sugar and spice but no rum...very weak! I am not going to return to this place but not because of the food just the really poor service and lack of concern for their patrons!
