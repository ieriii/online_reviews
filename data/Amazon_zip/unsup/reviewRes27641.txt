Let me preface this review by saying I do not like deep dish pizza. I know, I know. I LOVE Chicago hot dogs, the Cubs, Bears, and Bulls, so don't take away my residency just yet. I even like the Sox, except when they play the Cubs. But, I digress... Even though I've previously professed my dislike for deep dish pizza, I really truly like it from Pequod's. I'm not sure what it is about this particular kind. The crust is charred on the outside, and isn't too buttery. There's a great flavor that I haven't been able to get from any other places. For my buck, this is the best deep dish pie in Chicago hands down (and I've tried many)! As someone else mentioned, they have a $4.95 lunch deal for a 7" personal pizza and a drink. That right there has caused many many a guilt-inspired trip to Bally's across the street. But, it tastes so good at the moment! Check it out. The price is good, and you won't be disappointed.
