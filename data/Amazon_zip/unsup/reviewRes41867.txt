On a cold Chicago night or day...hell on any day in Chicago a big bowl of real authentic Vietnamese pho is good in my book. I was surprised to find on in this city, thinking they wouldn't be on par with any of the LA Pho restaurants that I'm use to. Not as good as my mothers still, but the broth was light, the portions large, and the ingredients refreshing.
