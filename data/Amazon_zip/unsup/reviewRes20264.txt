After reading the reviews that came before me I don't see how I could offer a unique praise that hasn't already been shouted from the rooftops so I will keep it simple. The line will be long so don't go too hungry but it is worth it every time. Most amazing sandwiches include but are not limited to the Cubano (your standard cubano, Bayless style), the Gunthorp Chicken (chili chicken and avacado) and the Pibil (suckling pig, need I say more?). You will find the cinnamon homemade ice cream and churros are not an option.
