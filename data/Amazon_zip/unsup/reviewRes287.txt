I went during the first month or so of the opening, getting extremely lucky to get in on a Sunday night with just a phone call. I don't know how to review this place. This was hands down the best meal of my life, if I can even call it a meal. It was more like a religious experience. Some of the more memorable dishes...granola rolled inside a very thin tube of fruit leather that has been hardened to the point where it can crack. This is served over a creamy nut-based "yogurt". You crack the granola tube into the yogurt to produce wonderfully crunchy glasslike shards. The textures were very interesting. Another one that I really loved was a 'spongecake' which involved a piece of very light spongecake on the end of a vanilla bean used as a spoon to eat some sort of fruit foam and dehydrated fruit bits. Again excellent combinations of unusual textures really added to the experience.  Grant Achatz is a true artist. I hope to visit again one day, when my wallet recovers :)
