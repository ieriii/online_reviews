Mmmm! The food here makes up for the crowded space, annoying wait, and sorta pricey eats. BF and I decided to do takeout after seeing the dine-in line, and it was still about 30-35 minutes until we left with our food. Believe me, not devouring the entire meal on our cab ride home was no small feat. The churros were deliciously cinnamony. The authentic hot chocolate: heavenly. The chicken tinga torta? Mouthwateringly scrumptious. And the carnitas caldos and cubana torta were also yum-city. Xoco is a win! Rick Bayless makes my mouth happy!
