Wow. I don't think I've so much in years. I came here last Sunday for the brunch buffet, and was totally overwhelmed by all the food. My favorites, ironically, were not the seafood dishes. The crab legs, shrimp, and lobster bisque were delicious, mind you, but in my opinion, the bacon, squash salad, and banana foster crepes were out of this world. The bacon -- I've only had bacon on this level from Telepan's brunch -- perfectly crisp and chewy and a little sweet. Also really liked the chicken artichoke strata and the chocolate cake. As you can see, incredible variety -- the dessert ROOM was like a child's fantasy come true, with jars of candies, chocolate strawberries, cookies, creme brulee, etc. etc. Wish this place were in NYC.
