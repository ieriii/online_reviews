Being from California, our definition of Pizza is Pizza Hut, Round Table, etc etc. After going to Chicago and going to Giordano's, I have a whole new appreciation for Pizza, especially Deep Dish Pizza. It was by far the best pizza I've ever had. Expect the place to be PACKED whenever you go, so there is going to be a wait, but it def. is worth the wait. The aroma of the place is enough to keep you around. Service was outstanding. All around good experience...def go if you're in the Chicago area
