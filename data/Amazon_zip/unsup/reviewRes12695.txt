Cafe 28 delivers fine dining and great service with spicy mustard butter and exquisite mood lighting! It is these things that make the place so much fun. Have you had as satisfactory a cuban cuisine? I don't think so. Another thing is that they should fix the dripping water. Cafe 28, you dripped water on my companion! I am vegetarian often and was sort of dispointed with not so many options but the Comal had certain zest and mojitos made me forget about the dripping water already. My companion was also not reminded about the dripping water very quickly. I have had brunch here before as well as dinner last night and the brunch I would give maybe 8 stars and the dinner 4 which is an average of 5 stars don't you think?
