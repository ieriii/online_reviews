Just saw the Swing Gitane here tonight (Wed nights) ---- SOLID!!!  They played 3 sets of amazing swing jazz with excellent stage mannerism. My friend and I really enjoyed the music and the atmosphere. I hear they have great swing, big-band nights on Thursdays -- so I'll def be back for that! Nice, friendly staff efficient at squeezing people into the venue. I was quite surprised at how many people had packed that place on a Wednesday night.  Drinks are nothing fancy and reasonably priced (mostly under $10). No food besides chips and pretzels.
