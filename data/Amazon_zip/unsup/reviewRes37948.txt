Come here for the mussels and beer. You can get the mussels prepared in two different ways. The sauce changes but last time I was there it was either a beer sauce or a white wine sauce. The white wine sauce was delicious. They have a huge selection of beers. So huge it is almost overwhelming. Especially in the Belgium variety. Yum. I usually just give the server and genre and they bring me back something unique and tasty.  I was here last on a Wednesday and it was completely packed. The bar was filled with people and we had to wait about fifteen minutes for a table of three. The service was somewhat slow but the food and beer is so good we didn't really care. We supplemented our mussels with a sweet potato lentil soup and a red cabbage salad. Both of which were delicious. Another one of my favorite places to visit when I am in Chicago!
