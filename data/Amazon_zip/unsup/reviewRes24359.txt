Great location on Michigan Aveneu, and beautiful decor. We were a medium sized group (6 people) and they were very accommodating. Service was very good, providing interesting suggestions. The food was very good, much of it excellent. There was a type of after dinner port that was incredible, with a silky texture and tased of figs.
