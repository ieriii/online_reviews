Though Garcia's is in a prime restaurant location (Lincoln Square), it's easy to just discard it as yet another weird cheap mexican place (it's oddly narrow with GIGANTIC thrones for chairs). Cheap? Yes. Typical? Not in my experience, at least! I have three things to say about it: First Thing: DO NOT get a pitcher of margarita with ice here. GET THAT SHIT FROZEN. The pitcher of frozen that we got lasted me and my friend well on until we couldn't eat anymore, and let me tell you: WE WERE TRASHED. A pitcher of margarita has never gotten me so completely plastered. From the first sip to the last sip I could taste a strong presence of tequila. And again: it lasted ALL DINNER! We watched another couple get a margarita with ice and they had drained it in half the time it took us. And the ice made it all watery and we, being drunk, talked loudly about what a bad choice they had made. So yeah: FROZEN. Second Thing: Neither of us could eat our burritos in one sitting. I wanted to SO BAD, but I knew I would truly explode. They're GIGANTIC! And if you get suizo ranchero, you are doing yourself a favor. I ate mine 2 whole days later for lunch, and it was still just as awesome. Third Thing: Service was lovely. The lady we had was adorable, and even when we were obviously not able to speak in clear sentences, she was sweet and helpful. It was the first time in a while that I wanted to tip someone well at a restaurant. So the next time you're up in Lincoln Square, bypass the overpriced whatevers and have some quality mexican at Garcia's...and again: get your margarita frozen.
