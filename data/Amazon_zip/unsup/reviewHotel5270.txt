HELL NO!!! WHATEVER YOU DO - DO NOT - DO NOT STAY HERE!!!!We just needed an economical one night hotel stay during a layover in Chicago. OMG - this hotel is the WORST I have ever stayed in. I don't normally take out the time to comment on the internet but this time I felt compelled to so no one else gets misinformed and ripped off like we did! The Shuttle took 1 hour to arrive, the hotel is dingy, rundown and disgusting, the bathroom is horrid (no words to describe) and the only breakfast they had (if you can believe this) was CHOCOLATE COVERED TWINKIES and absolutely nothing else!!!!
