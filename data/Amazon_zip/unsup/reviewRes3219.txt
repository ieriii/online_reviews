My love affair with Korean food began back in Roger's Park during the 1980's. The Pusan House had some of the best Bi Bim Bap on the Chicago scene and they have been the standard by which I judge all other Bi Bim Bap. Speaking as someone who has even gone so far as to eat the real deal in Korea, Crisp is as fair an approximation at a fair price as I've found in Chicago. No pretentious illusions, no corners cut, just veggies, sauce, a little meat and an egg on rice. Dolsot bowls are nowhere to be seen, which is probably for the best because most folks shouldn't be trusted to handle heavy superheated stone bowls. The restaurant is casual, with butcher wood bench seating and a love-thy-neighbor attitude about sharing tables. Tuck your elbows, spread some sriracha or gochujang and dig in via fork or chopsticks. Good food, great price.
