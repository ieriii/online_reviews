I've now concluded that for solo business travel, this is as good as spot as any to dine downtown. The piped in music is vibrant and festive, the bar lively, and the staff's recommendations are just dead-on. I'm upgrading to 5 stars.  I recommend just letting the bartender suggest highlights from each category, as well as your per-course wine pairings. They are simply money! Fried chorizo stuffed olives started me off and next course was beets with goat cheese whip and pistachios-- delicious! But what totally took the cake was the WAGYU SIRLOIN TIP with fingerling potatoes, caramelized red onions and olive and bone marrow vinaigrette. This dish was highly recommended by the bartender. I very seldom eat red meat but I decided to take the plunge because of her enthusiasm. It was thankfully a lighter portion than it sounded and was, in a word, stupendous. Every bite had a delicious combination of acidity, marshmellowy and charred beef, briney-ness buttery-ness and sweetness. I believe it ranks up there as one of the single best combinations I have ever enjoyed on one plate. Kudos to the chef, who recommended a medium temperature, which I went with. I can see why she did and was so, so pleased with the result.  Definitely recommended!
