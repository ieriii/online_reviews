as far as beet salad goes...theirs rocks! I know it is silly to rate a burger joint and start off by talking about something other than the burgers, but it was an unexpected treat. (I knew the burgers would be good, and they were) While I'm at it, I might as well talk about the beer selection: fabulous!!! and the wait staff's friendliness and ability to talk about the beers or recommend them makes you feel like trying whatever they say. Bad Apple proved itself to be a good choice when having a week long burger craving.
