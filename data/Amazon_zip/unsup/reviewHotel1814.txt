Hmmm...Thoughts: 1) I have never seen smaller hotel room. I have always wondered what my closet would look like with a kingsize bed in it! 2) They asked if I wanted to take part in the magical program (or something like that). That means that you let them NOT clean you room while yo are there and they give you 500 SPG points. Uhm...No! this is a good deal for me how? Clean my room! 3) I kid you not, The bathroom is so small that when you sit down to do your business, you have to lean back all the way so the toilet paper holder can go in front of you. This is the Cirque du Soleil version of going to the bathroom! 4) There is...wait for it...a kaleidoscope in my room on a stand that says "wish" umm...I don't get it. 5) On the foot of the bed is a faux fur runner. I cannot even imagine what people have done on that!! ewwww!!
