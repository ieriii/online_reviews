OMG! This is def. a place I would be adventure out and try the unusual on the menu. I had their tacos, and always love and will always get the lengua as one of the tacos. So when i saw this lengua, mexicana style, on the menu tonight, I was like, why not? It's the best beef tongues! The sauce was so flavourful, the beef tongues were sooooo tender. Mixing some of the rice up with the sauce, perfect!!! And all these are just barely $8!! How can you beat that? :)
