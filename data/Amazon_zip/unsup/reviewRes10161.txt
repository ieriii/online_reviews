There have been a trail of Italian restaurants in this same location. I wonder what the deal is with that, but hope that Piccolo Sogno will "make it". It was the last of the dining al fresco nights and unusually warm in October, so we opted for the patio. It had the feel of being in the back yard of someone's Italian villa. Plenty of vines climbing the walls and giant torches for a bit of warmth. First mention should be of their wonderful customer service. Each person we came in contact with was very welcoming and personable even though the place was packed for a Wednesday night. I appreciated the fact that the entrees weren't large portions. For instance, the pasta I chose was just enough with adequate flavor. I didn't walk out feeling bloated and lethargic.
