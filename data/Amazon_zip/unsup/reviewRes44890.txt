Best known food about Chicago is their deep dish Pizza. Oh, did I mention this was the best pizza I have ever tasted? I must admit I am a big sucker for Cheese but this pizza was cheese heaven. when you slice into the pizza and pick it up the strings of cheese are endless and you must saw it off into order to finally claim it on your dish. I had pepperoni with jalapeno and it was all very wonderful! It's definitely a good experience with a long 2 hour wait. But this pizza was literally deep in cheese.
