My first meal at Alinea was the most amazing meal I've had in my life (and I don't exaggerate). I did the tasting menu two years ago, the massive tour menu last year, and last month with the single 20-course option they have on the menu. I was not quite as impressed with my last dining experience as the first two - I got the impression that the restaurant is now focusing more on efficiency, and trying to increase its throughput of customers per night to generate more revenue (just my opinion). Regardless, the food is still awesome, as well as the service and presentation. It is definitely a must-do if you have the disposable income and the time, and I look forward to coming back again in the future!
