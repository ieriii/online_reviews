Let me preface this, since moving to Chicago from LA back in Oct 09, I have not had pho...so I've been very much deprived. I got the combo pho (all sort of good meaty stuff including tripe and tendon) and my husband got one of the bun combos. Both were great. My pho had a good amount of meat, and plenty of tendon which I love. The soup was good and I'm not much a noodle eater so can't say much about that (I know seems like an oxymoron being a pho lover). My husband really liked his cold noodle dish which came with the sweet/sour/fish sauce and he was happy to find more fish sauce right at our table. We also had the spring rolls which were good, but I missed having mint in them. For drinks we had the iced coffee and young coconut drink (which to my surprise was fresh). My husband gave the young coconut an A+ which is impressive since he had a coconut tree at his grandparents house in the Philippines and this brought him back to those memories... Overall, great food, great price. Just don't be expecting any fancy service or atmosphere. Com'on, it's pho...where on autopilot I wipe down all the utensils prior to using (as futile as that may be, it still makes me feel like I'm making a difference). I wouldn't know what to do at a pho place not like that. (Actually, I probably wouldn't go).
