Coming from someone who has been here several times before, I was very upset to notice such a terrible difference in quality. I was being nice when I gave it one star. The service was good and thats about it!.. It's called Shaw's CRAB HOUSE! So why was it when I went their for brunch the Crab was the WORST thing I had. Great bloody Mary, Good beef, and turkey, Bacon was way above average. However this is not why i went to Shaw's CRAB HOUSE I went for the crab! Highly Disappointed and will never go back!
