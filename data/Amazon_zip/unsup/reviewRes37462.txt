I really enjoy grocery stores that give you an experience. Sounds kinda dumb, but so is reading a review of a grocery store ;) Anyway, this place stood out to me because it's not often that you can leisurely browse aisles of food as if you were at a bookstore. For example, the two shelves of salt captured my attention for a few minutes (so many colors... so many ways to dry ocean water). The beer selection, though small, was well-curated (Belgians included Affligem and St. Bernardus). And so it went with all the other items Fox & Obel carries. You get the idea. Of course, places like this are always expensive. What a surprise. That's a given, so it's not reflected in my 5-star rating. That is, I doubt I'd ever come here to buy beef for $40/lb., but the fact that they stock it suggests someone else might, so to each his own! For the high prices of meat, the vegetables were actually on par with WFM, and I bought a small carton of Medjool dates and kumquats for my friend Isaac, who lives across the street. This is the place for the person who wants to stay in and make their own food, but with top-notch ingredients.
