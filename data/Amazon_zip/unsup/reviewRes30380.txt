Yummy food, reasonable prices for wine - what more could you as for? So this place is a hidden jewel. Having walked by it several times, it was not even on my radar until recently. The food is very simple but yummy. My friend and I each had an entree and split a bottle of wine and were left with a bill that was under 20 dollars each. It is a smaller venue but it has a very cool and relaxed vibe.
