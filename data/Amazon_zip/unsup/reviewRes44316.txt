I've been a fan of this place for awhile now and really enjoy eating there. As a BYOB you can't do much better, it's right up there with Tango Sur and Las Tablas as BYOB's. Overall their sushi is very fresh, tasty, and not too overdone. I personally enjoy the godzilla roll and many of the classic maki rolls. Their nigiri and sashimi isn't as good as Coast or Mirai, but it's definitely more than serviceable. The atmosphere is always bustling with people and makes it feel like it's a place to be seen but without the pretension. It's got a nice decor with a variety of seating.  Usually I find it pretty easy to get a table if you time it right, but it can be a bit crazy at times. Thank goodness for the bar next door to sip on a cocktail while waiting. The only reason I don't give it a 5 star rating is that sometimes the service leaves a bit to be desired, but the food keeps me from complaining.
