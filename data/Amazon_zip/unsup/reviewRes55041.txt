totally 'meh.' went with a friend that was in town, and we were underwhelmed. the menu itself leaves a lot to be desired. they claim to be 'farm friendly cuisine.' but there was maybe 5 vegetables on the menu, and besides pasta, none of them present in the main dishes.nothing really original.. while the meatballs had good flavor, they were completely burnt. i would suggest going there just for drinks and skipping food. seems like its trying very hard to be trendy and a 'hot spot' but totally misses the mark.
