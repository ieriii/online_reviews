I love the skirt steak!!! It's the best so far I had in Chicago. I also tried the drink Raspberry Mojito, it's good but not the best, I don't understand tho why it says $9 on the menu but was charge $10 on the bill....I like the cozy atmosphere, very cool art design, they have a small private room on the way to restroom, it's interesting. The service is just okay.
