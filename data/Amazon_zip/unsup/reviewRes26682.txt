We expected to enjoy our evening with good food but we were surprised to find much more than that. We were treated to a tasting menu where each dish not only looked fantastic but tasted fabulous. Furthermore, each serving was delivered by a different server and they both, described it as well as answered our questions in detail. Remarkable. Couldn't have been a better experience.
