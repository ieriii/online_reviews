WORST SERVICE IN THE HISTORY OF RESTAURANTS. Maybe if i was Korean, i'd have better service. Four of us ventured to this place, and none of us had been there before. No one greeted us, we were just sat. it took 15 minutes(at least) for someone to come and take our drink orders. and longer for us to get her to come back to the table. Then a lady (who looked way too busy to help us, and had the attention span of a 3 year old) asked us what we wanted. As started with the ...."we've never been here before....yadda yadda", she didn't say a word and left our table and came back again. What? Really? So, by then, we knew we wouldn't get good service, so we ventured on our own...and ordered.Everything tasted like it was swimming in vinegar. The steak was good, but so is the steak I buy at Jewel for $6. We won't be back, unless i recruit a bunch of Koreans as friends that can speak the language.
