Excellent Food! Ok...this place is impossible to get a table at night (regardless of weekdays or weekends)...Attempted three times on a weekday. Finally decided to go there for lunch and was able to get a table right away. Go there for lunch if you can! Here is what I would reocmmend: The pig ear is amazing! The pig tail is amazing! The Chicken K-bob thing is amazing! Here is what I think you should try (just because I did no enjoy it doesnt mean that you will not as well): Bone Marrow and Pork Shoulder. Overall, a great restaurant that serves great food at a great price! Must go if you can get a table. They do not take reservation and their place is small....either go early or be prepare to wait for a while.
