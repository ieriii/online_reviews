It is no coincidence that Hopleaf is my 100th Review. Hopleaf is everything that is amazing about Chicago. All the nooks and crannies, unsuspected, are filled with little treasures like Hopleaf. They have an amazing selection of Flemish sour ales (or Lambics) that I'm currently obsessed with. We tried several, as well as their mussels in coconut-curry broth, frites, and their strawberry endive salad with goat cheese and walnuts. It was all really good, even though I'm not a huge fan of mussels. My only qualm with the meal is though I asked for more bread for the coconut-curry broth, they only brought out two little pieces. It's a shame all that yumminess went to waste and not in my mouth. Then came the most amazing dining experience I've had all month. We ordered a wild strawberry Flemish sour ale and the chocolate framboise lava cake. The sour of the ale and the decadence of the chocolate was something that we could only describe as "rivaling orgasm." I'd go back for that anytime.
