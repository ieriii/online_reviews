I have yet to find anything sexier than Geja's. And, Oh, how I've looked. Cozy basement dining. Good wine list. Fondue complete with cook your own meat and buttery, luscious sauces. Small bites perfect for feeding your significant other. Cozy little nooks that make you forget anyone else is around. All this, culminating in a pot filled with chocolate. Good for groups and a girls' night too... But in the back of your mind you'll wish you brought someone more apt to provide you with sexy time. Trust me.
