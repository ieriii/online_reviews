I don't understand why so much hype about this place. Lots of people rave about this place, and finally one afternoon I was taking my friend to Irazu but they were closed on Sunday so we came here instead. We had the chicken and ropa vieja. They were both very good. But why so pricey? Maybe I'm spoiled with home cooked cuban and puerto rican food, I don't get it... its not just good, but nothing out of this world. Another thing, our server was so absent the entire evening. We tried to flag him down for water and more sauce. He just seemed *so busy* not sure doing what.. Again, why so pricey?
