6 stars EXCELLENT beer selection. Wonderful menu - quail, brisket (oh the "inconvenience" of the night was that the brisket sandwich was only served on rye bread - totally fine by us), onion rings to die for. And the atmosphere was incredible, we were sat out on the patio. Just gorgeous. Next time I'm in Chicago I'm bringing everyone. PERFECT gastropub.
