I'm definitely not some crazy Rick Bayless fangirl... in fact, I don't even like Frontera all that much (see that review for clarification). After seeing the menu at XOCO, I had a feeling that this would be a little more up my alley than Frontera, and I was blown away. I had the Milanesa Torta (sans the jalepeno's, spicy things & I are mortal enemies)... and it was SO delicious! Also had to have the chips/guacamole as that's the one thing I love about all of Bayless' restaurants. We finished off the meal with a kickass Churro and now I'm stuffed.The smallness of the space didn't bother me at all, and the wait wasn't bad either. I'll definitely be back!
