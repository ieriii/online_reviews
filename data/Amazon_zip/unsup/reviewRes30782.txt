i wanted to try this restaurant for a while but never remembered to.. so few days ago i was hungry and i remembered, so i came here after work to grab some dinner home.. it was easy to find parking around the area(meter parking) .. the interior of the place is simple yet classy, feels very welcoming too.. the service was friendly.. i asked to see a menu because i want to see what other selection of food they have besides the laughing bird shrimp and fried oyster Po' Boy that i hear about alot.. then this guy (not sure if he is the manager or owner) handed me the menu and told me that the menu is seasonal so it always changes, depending on the farmers market... oh and they use organic ingredients! i ended up ordering just the laughing bird shrimp and fried oyster po' boy.. one word says it all... delicious! the shrimp was cooked just right.. the oyster had a nice light breading, fresh veggies, and the bread is soft covered in mayo... everything tasted very fresh and full of flavors! best po' boy I've tried so far! $16 for a po'boy is a little pricey, but i don't mind having it once in a while as a treat to myself since it so dam good hahaha... cant wait to come back and try their other food on the menu!
