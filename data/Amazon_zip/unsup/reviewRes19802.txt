I went here last night knowing that this was the latest restaurant by Rick Bayless - built around a gigantic brick oven, with moderately priced, street vendor food you could get "to go" if you wanted. I heard it was good for breakfast or late night. What I did not know was that there is no table service. My friend and I stood in line for 45 minutes before we were able to order and be seated at a cramped table with four other people. That was kind of a bummer.  But the food - "Yum-O" as Rachel Ray would say. I had the pepito torta which was delicious. My friend had the mushroom one. We also had guacamole and chips which were perfection and the side salad which was just okay. About mid way through our meal, I realized I had forgotten to order the churro and chocolate dip that I really really REALLY had wanted to get. That no table service thing started to bug me again. And there was a long line and my girlfriend was over the seating arrangements and wanted to get out of there.  But we agreed that we definitely wanted to go back. Next time, for lunch.  Our bill came to just over $40 bucks, which seemed a bit pricey for a cafeteria style restaurant. Also, are we supposed to tip? This is confusing. Despite no table service, there were people that came around to clean up and provided to go containers. Later on that evening, we bumped into one of the Managers across the street at a different bar. He recognized our take out bag, and asked us about our experience. He was very friendly, and gave us some insight into the operations.
