Amazed that a restaurant in this economy would turn away 6 parties of 6 as a reservation on a Saturday afternoon. Literally, the worst business decision an owner can make. The Bad Apple lives up to its name...it is disgraceful. We are happy to take our business elsewhere. It won't be long before The Bad Apple closes its door as I will be sure to tell everyone in the neighborhood to boycott the restaurant. #Appalled
