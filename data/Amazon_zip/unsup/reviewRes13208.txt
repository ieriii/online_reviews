We went to Glenn's for brunch on Mother's Day. We arrived about 12:30 and were seated immediately. My wife had the eggs benedict, I had the biscuits and gravy. The kids had pancakes. It was all delicious. Unlike many diners, Glenn's doesn't drench the biscuits in the gravy, so you could actually taste the nice, flaky, homemade quality. The seafood lineup also looked excellent. We will have to return for that. My only complaint would be that, while our waitress was very attentive and friendly up to the time we ordered, she kind of disappeared after that. But overall, an excellent new breakfast spot.
