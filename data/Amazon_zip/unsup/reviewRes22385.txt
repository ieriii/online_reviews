Five stars for the weiner people on the top of the building! :P Dogs are good, must have them Chicago-style, and the drive-thru is fun to bring people from out-of-town to see. We always just order a crap load of dogs and bring them back to the house, but when the weather is nice, it's fun to drive-thru. :)
