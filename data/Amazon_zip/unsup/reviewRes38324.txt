Not a big fan of deep dish pizza. But let me confess this was good.  Sauce is flavorful, crust is good. I'm still not a deep dish pizza guys, love NY style pizza, but this was delicious. One large was just right for the 5 of us. Highly recommend this if you want to try a "Chicago" style deep dish pizza.
