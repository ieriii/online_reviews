Not sure I can add anything new that 500+ yelpers haven't already said, other than I dream about the vegetarian croissant sandwich. A friend of mine introduced me to this wonderful creation, and I have not ordered anything else ever since. Get it with the egg over easy, and expect a perfectly flaky croissant, crisp veggies...delicious messiness.
