Le Colonial has been a part of the Rush Street dining scene for at least 12 years. I have eaten here at least 10 times and have never had a bad meal. The consistency of the food, service, and ambiance of this very pretty restaurant continues to amaze me. The setting is gorgeous - in a renovated Gold Coast townhouse that evokes the feeling of Europe/Asia. High ceilings, dark woodwork, ferns and lazily moving ceiling fans add to the romantic and calm ambiance of the place. They have a very "sexy" bar & lounge upstairs, great place to have a quiet cocktail before dinner or for a date. They are also one of the few Chicago restaurants that actually honors their reservations within 5-10 minutes of your arrival; which I believe is the hallmark of a well-run restaurant. The food is more Asian than French and arrives on large plates, making it perfect for sharing - and they have a well-balanced wine list with some reasonable buys.  This is a great place for a birthday, anniversary, or special occasion. (PS Leave the kids at HOME!)
