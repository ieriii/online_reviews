This is my first yelp review ever, and I knew I had to pick a Chicago business that was worthy of my inagural review. Hands-down, it is Art of Pizza. My first year living in Chicago I lived 1/2 a block west of Art on Nelson. After my roommates' Dad and my Dad graciously moved us in they got Art of Pizza slices for a hearty thank you lunch. All 4 of us have been obsessed with it ever since. I'm talking the deep dish here. The crust is buttery and crispy, but not so hard that it will scrape your mouth. The sauce is exquisite with ripe tomatoes and wonderful seasoning and spices. The toppings, whether spinach and mushroom or sausage are always plentiful and in perfect compliment to the cheese that tops the pie. It's hard to explain how good this stuff actually is. If you order for delivery, be prepared for an hour wait, and more on the weekends. Just sit still, or go take a walk, and enjoy the anticipation because it is SO worth it. I've never had a pizza from Art delivered anything but piping hot. On the other hand, if you need a quick, nourishing, delicious lunch or dinner stop in in for one of the many slices they keep ready. So good, so cheap, a slice and a pop costs around $4. And you won't be hungry for hours after. The guys who works at the front counter is always there, and he's so cheerful and awesome and I swear he remembers me when I come in. Giordano's etc .all have their place (primarily as tourist restaurants or a convenient place to bring a larger group), but if you want Real. Chicago. Deep Dish. don't look any further.
