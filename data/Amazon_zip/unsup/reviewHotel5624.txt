I stayed here while on a business trip and I can say it's exceeded my expectations as always. Starwood always does.  Thumbs Up: 1) Staff is courteous. 2) Rooms are clean and large : heavenly bed = orgasm. 3) Gym was clean and well equipped. 4) Great location. Thumbs Down: 1) Parking here is terribly expensive. 2) Pedro at the restaurant was temperamental at first but warmed up to me. 3) They ran out of Arugula and took some time to explain how I wanted the same salad but with spring greens.
