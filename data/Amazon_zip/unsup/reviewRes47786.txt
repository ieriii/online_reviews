Zed451 is one of my favorite places in the city! I love everything about this place that I don't even know where to begin. The harvest table/salad bar can be very satisfying and filling, but be sure to save room for all the incredible meat! There is so much flavor in everything they serve here that I promise I have a new favorite food every time I take a bite. I'd skip the venison though. It's a little too tough and dry for my liking. If you opt to skip out on the main dining room, the bar area has great food too! Every time I stop in with my friends we order ZED margaritas and the fondue. The fondue comes with tons of bread, meat, and veggies. The cheese is very creamy and savory. By far my favorite thing on the menu. Oh and if you do order the ZED margarita, get it smoked. The smoke flavor compliments the meat and fondue nicely. And if margaritas aren't your thing, definitely try the strawberry basil martini. It's slightly sweet and very refreshing. Also in the summer, the rooftop bar is one of my favorites! It's definitely a chill place with good vibes. The music isn't too loud that you're yelling to have a conversation with the person next to you, but it can get loud depending on how crowded it gets. I've never had a complaint about this place and have never got tired or bored of coming here!
