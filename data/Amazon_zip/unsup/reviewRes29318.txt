Pasta Bowl is such a great place to eat any time of the day! I had Farfalle Pollo pasta which was very i mean VERY good! It had an excellent taste one that can't be replaced! It was soo good i order 2 more orders to Carry Out and when i got home i put them in the refrigerator for later. They give you more than what you can eat, and the cost was nothing! It was a good price range and everything was good
