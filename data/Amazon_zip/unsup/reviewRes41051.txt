I really dont understand why everyone RAVES about this place on yelp so much. The food was tasty, nothing bad, some of it came out luke warm, and all in all i paid like $250 (for two people) and left HUNGRY. I am not a "big man", my girlfriend weights 110 and she left hungry. The menu was a bit pretentious, and there is not a "good" seat in the house (its all one little drab brick room). I might have just came on an off night. Since they change their menu so much i will probably give it another shot in a few months. Maybe. Not to mention, this place is not exactly in a nice neighborhood and they don't seem to have any dress code.  For dropping that kind of coin, i would have higher expectations.
