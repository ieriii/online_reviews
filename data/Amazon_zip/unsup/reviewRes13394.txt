its hard for the beer to be outdone at this place but the service was impeccable. my wife is 7 months pregnant and they went above and beyond to make her comfortable. further, they gave an educated recommendation for beer/food pairings and even provided some comped samples so i made the right choice. kudos to the GM, Brian, on having a good team. we will definitely be going back.
