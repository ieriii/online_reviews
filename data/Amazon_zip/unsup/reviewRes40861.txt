Luis F you are right this place is awesome! Thanks to you guys I crave a good relleno taco or steak burrito very often, now that I live in Dallas. I have been going to La Pasadita for about 10 years. I like to go to the two that are on the west side of Ashland. My favorite thing to get is one relleno taco and two steak tacos, I know it's a lot but I can't help it. Your horchata is also very good and definitely you won't need a refill when you order the large. I read an article where Nicholas Cage visited and he was just raving about the food, great work guys. Next time I go to Chicago I will try to stop by either La Pasadita or Las Asadas.
