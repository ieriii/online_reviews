I visited Chicago the weekend of May 20-23, 2011 and stayed at the Congress Plaza Hotel. The hotel is being picketed by union workers and has been for the past 8 years. While the hotel is historic, it's run down. My room was neat & clean, but the carpet was ratty, featured old paint and the bathroom painfully tiny. My room faced Grant Park and I heard all the traffic on Michigan Avenue. There was a protest happening across the street which made it tough to nap Saturday afternoon. Saturday night, The Congress Plaza Hotel hosted a local prom and as you can imagine, the place was humming with giggling teenagers. Lastly, I paid with a debit card. They overcharged my debit card to cover any incidentals, which there weren't. They rang up an additional $110 which wasn't credited back to my card for 72 hours. There must be better, cleaner, and quieter places to stay in Chicago.
