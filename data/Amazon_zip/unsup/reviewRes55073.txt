I've walked past GILT BAR and read so many great things about this place I just had to make reservations to eat here. I had some friends moving from Chicago and thought, this would be a great time and place to take them. Hmm.. BAD DECISION.. They had me down for the wrong day and weren't very helpful in getting my a table. My sister had to talk to the manager and he attempted to accommodate us. I was so turned off we just left. I've spoken to other about this place and seem to have received the same treatment. Not sure why people won't write a bad review. Well.. I guess I will start.
