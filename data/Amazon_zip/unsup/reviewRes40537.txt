Yum! Table of 4. Shared the beef fat potato chips and some sort of duck pate on crostini. Very good. I had the plate of sunchokes and scallops and a salad with roasted beets, goat cheese, walnuts and a bacon vinegrette. Wanted to like the plate good. Another ordered the roasted veggies and lentils and liked it very much and another ordered the Duck Egg w/ beef hash. Another ordered the marrow (not my thing) and liked it but felt there was very little to it. These were all off the plate menu and not the entrees and the only complaint I heard, "wish I had more" Creative, different and tasty. And not over priced. Including wine and tip 115$ for 4 people. small plates and small place. No bigger tables.
