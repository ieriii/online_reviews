Simply It is absolutely my favorite restaurant in Chicago. You cannot beat the price, the respectful staff, and especially the great meals you receive here. My favorite thing about this place is the lunch special. For such a small price you get so much great, gourmet food! It is also great for dinner. In the evening it is a great atmosphere with soft music and candle-lit tables. The owner, Tuan Nguyen, is always around making sure everything is perfect. You can definitely tell that this restaurant is his passion by the way he takes care of it and takes care of his customers! Once you give this restaurant a try, you will want to go again and again.
