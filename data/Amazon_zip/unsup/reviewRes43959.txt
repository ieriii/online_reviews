I debated on this one a bit. The ambiance of Kinzie is great, I really loved the inside decor and everything. And the bathroom is awesome! At first I was pretty impressed by the staff and the service. Everything was all good until my entree was placed in front of me. Chicken Parmesan. When I think of Chicken Parm, I think chicken, with marinara sauce, and cheese melted on top, next to a serving of angel hair pasta with more marinara sauce. But that is not what got placed in front of me...instead I got some sauce with a hefty piece of chicken on top of an awkwardly colored marinara sauce, next to bland spaghetti. Not a speck of cheese anywhere. At all. When the waiter came by I told him that this isn't right and he asked what was wrong...um...ok....There is no cheese on my cheese heavy dish. He said they usually give you some parmesan cheese on the side...I didn't even get that...he asked what he could do to make me happy, I told him put some cheese on it...melt some mozzarella cheese and add more sauce. After I got my dish back made correctly it was awesome...but really...I know you are a steakhouse, but it doesn't take a genius to know that you melt some mozzarella over the chicken. As for my dining companions, they all really enjoyed their food. The calamari was great, though Dan and I couldn't figure out what kind of sauce the orange sauce was. The bruschetta was also good, but too much garlic. Dessert seemed good, I didn't get any though, nothing stood out at me, but I did get to share some of Dan's and that was good...I'd only order it again for the ice cream though. Overall, I am not sure if I'll go back. If I do, I'll order the chicken parmesan again, to see if that is really how they make it or if it was just a fluke.
