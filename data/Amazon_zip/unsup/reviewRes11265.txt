I love breakfast and I love dessert so there's really not much room for me to complain. I could go on and on about how amazing each item on the brunch menu is, but I also think that the lunch menu deserves some recognition. As difficult as it is not to order dessert for breakfast every time, I've loved all of the sandwiches I've tried for lunch during the week. My current favorite brunch is the brioche french toast special, which is usually covered with a vanilla coulis and strawberries or raspberries. I just can't get enough! The croissant sandwich is always a good bet if you're not looking for an extra dose of sugar. You can order your potatoes topped with one of their long list of cheeses too. The service is usually really quick, but you may have to wait a while to get a table, especially on the weekends. Stop by ahead of time to put your name on the list and look around at some of the nearby shops to pass the time more comfortably.
