Real authentic Italian. Not the American verison of Italian...but Italian food like they eat in northern Italy! The setting is quite beautiful too...especially in the warmer months, sitting outside is just spectacular. You dont even realize that you are sitting right off Halsted. Just a lovely setting, outstanding service, and some of the best food this side of the Atlantic. Now go Mangi!
