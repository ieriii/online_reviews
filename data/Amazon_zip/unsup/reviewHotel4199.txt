We were just here the weekend of Dec 10. Check in was fast and simple, take advantage of the check in kiosk if you can. My husband gets a corp discount so the price was perfect for us. The bed was incredibly comfortable, the bathroom was large and over all the room was VERY clean. Check out was easy, just a few simple buttons on the TV. It's a great location and we'll be staying there again in Feb.
