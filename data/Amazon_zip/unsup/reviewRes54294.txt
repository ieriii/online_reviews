Dear Irazu, I have been loyal to you for years and I love you're food. BUT I ordered the Chicken Tico last night (my favorite and also what I always order) and I was very disappointed when I saw the chicken. You changed it to a chewy flat piece of salty meat?? Why would you do that? The old way was so much better. The chicken used to be like butter... now it's just pathetic. :( I hate to be this harsh but I really want my favorite meal in the city back to normal. I would normally rate you with 5 stars, but after my dinner last night, I can't. Thank you.
