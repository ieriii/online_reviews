Meat lovers, this is paradise. And it is the real brazilian "churrasco" deal - brazilian speaking here, so I understand about this one. Start picking a good beer and don't run to the salad bar, first enjoy the starters they will give you, fried polenta and po de queijo (cheese bread). After you have an interesting share of fried polenta go to the salad bar and don't go too nuts because you still need to leave room for the main part, the meat. With your salad in place go back to your table and turn your card green side up and start enjoying all the incredible meats they will bring - over 15 different cuts. Tips: don't eat at all before coming here cause you need to enjoy the whole experience. Also, this is not a place for people on a diet.
