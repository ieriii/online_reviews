Made reservations for 3 on a Thursday evening - the scene was vibrant and busy - we were 30 minutes late being seated, but received a complimentary round of drinks from the GM - the Leychee Petals cocktail was absolutely divine - just the perfect mix of suit & tart! My sister had the Go Go Berry cocktail which was perfectly delicious as well. Once we were seated, the service was attentive...maybe a little too attentive. Between the bus boys and the waiter, you are never left with a half filled cup of water or moment alone! We ordered the beef lollipops appetizer which came out as the Kobe beef crispy rice (which, by the way was delicious) - the waiter comped the incorrect app but let us eat our hearts out so we weren't too disappointed. The table ordered the sea bass, Wa Machi Rolls, Firecracker, Spicy Tail of Two Tunas, and Yellowtail roll - everything was perfect and delicious. The Sea Bass preparation was very unique! Because of the mistake of our appetizer course, the waiter kindly comped another round of drinks and desert - "the Ridiculous" which was, as the name suggestions, "Ridiculous" - delicious creamy vanilla ice cream surrounded by carrot cake shell with carmel glaze. Simply just WRONG and fantastic at the same time. To conclude while the restaurant has growing pains, I truly think this will be a staple trendy spot for all to enjoy - perfect for girls or guys nights out with the communal seating at some of the tables.
