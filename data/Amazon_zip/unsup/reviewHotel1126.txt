i may be getting a bit elitist but this fairmont wasn't all i expected. i originally booked here for one thing: the hd tv that was in every room in the newport beach fairmont. but alas, no LCD in this place. a nice overpriced minibar though. my room was pretty sweet - view of navy pier, king bed, decent sized bathroom with the porn star shower (the clear glass door, classy yet shady), and overall the room was a/a- (a great room). this is all probably because they thought i was my dad who is a fairmont god (thanks pops). so absolutely no complaints there. the lobby is very lacking, and the food is even more lacking, so i have to drop this to 3 stars (the tv hurt my feelings, what can i say).
