This is a must for any foodie in Chicago. You must get one of the specials-- they are like nothing you've ever tasted before. An order of duck fat fries is also required if available. Only a fool would drive to this out-of-the-way location and wait in line for 35+ minutes (at 3:30 on a Saturday!) and then order a regular dog or polish. Try Doug's once and you'll be hooked.
