Yum! You better be hungry if you eat here--remember it's Chicago, people. I'm from Chicago but have lived in NYC for 7 years and forgot about the monstrous portions. I ordered a *side* of broccoli and was given 2 entire heads--whoa. You'll certainly get your money's worth--a very delicious, rich, overly-portioned meal that will make you wish they had a complimentary napping area. I recommend the filet (the petit is not petit btw) with no crusty crust nonsense. We saw people actually eating dessert after appetizers and main courses and we were so very full that it made us feel sick. This place is a treat!
