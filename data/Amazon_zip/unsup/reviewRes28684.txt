I stumbled upon this place after deciding against the 2 hour wait for Toro, and holy macaroni, I am excited about my discovery. This place is delicious! And better yet, I walked right in and was seated on a Friday evening! Solid menu, fast service, reasonable prices, and delicious food. I recommend the Farfelle Pollo. Mmm. PSSS: The Other Side Bar on the other side (get it?) is pretty awesome as well. It's rather small and narrow, so getting a table can be a tough. But if you succeed, they have a great selection of board games you can play with your amigos. I am personal fan of the dirty jenga created by previous game players. To whomever came up with those jenga dares, you are a dirty bastard.
