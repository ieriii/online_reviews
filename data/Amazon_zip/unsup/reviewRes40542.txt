In the world of pho, Tank Noodle is very good. I still don't get the fascination with pho. It is clear broth with noodles and a bit of other stuff in it. Am I ordering the wrong thing? Is there some secret society of pho lovers who have the inside line on what one is supposed to order in their broth? Would someone please explain?  We went on a Saturday night and had a great time. The hors d'oeuvres were good, the food fresh and tasty. My friend ordered simmered marinated pork served over rice and it was sublime. Really impressive. I had pho with beef and it was tasty. Maybe a bit too much cinnamon for my liking (when it comes to soup). Another friend had a vegetable dish which was nice and the last friend had pho as well. He loved it.  Fun restaurant, wacky staff and wackier clientele provide great people watching. Bring your own liquor and be patient when looking for street parking!
