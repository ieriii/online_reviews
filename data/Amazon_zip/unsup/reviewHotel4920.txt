A landmark hotel, the Drake is just an iconic place in Chicago. Having amazing views of Michigan Avenue and the Lake, this is THE place to stay if spending a weekend on the Mag Mile or to recommend to out of town guests. While it is a little more pricey, it is mostly competitive with anything in the area and provides classic quality and service.
