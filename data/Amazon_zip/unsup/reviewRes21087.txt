Best margarita special in the city! On tuesdays and thursdays all house margaritas are 1/2 price. This is great if you like a traditional lime and salt margarita like my husband or if you prefer a frozen tamarindo margarita like me. I've tried most of the flavors and I'm never disappointed. The food is great, too. They have the best fish tacos I've had in Chicago. I've lived in Florida and So Cal so my standards for fish tacos are pretty high. The portions are huge, too. Everyone leaves with a nice buzz and a full belly. If you love margaritas and good Mexican food then check this place out. My only issue is that the dining room is kind of small. I wish they'd expand and open up a bigger bar area for people who just want drinks or a snack.
