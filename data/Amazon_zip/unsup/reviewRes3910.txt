Went to Crisp yesterday for lunch. I loved the atmosphere, long communal tables, with great choices of beverages from the cooler (both Asian inspired and American classics). I chose the Green Tea with Black Tea, Barley, and White Tea. It was un-sweetened and full of antioxidants, nice and refreshing. For lunch, I took the Korean beef burrito with brown rice substitute to go. The burrito itself was huge, think Chipotle huge, and full of freshly prepared ingredients and tons of beef pilled high. The only downside was that the burrito itself was extremely sweet, and while I know most Korean beef is prepared this way, it was almost sickly sweet like a dessert. I was expecting it to be just a little bit more savory. The sauce placed on the side gave it a bit more kick and balanced things out a bit, according to my bf. My only other critique of Crisp is that there menu is a bit small with only about 3-4 choices underneath each category, but they do have a store front location on Broadway, and it's not really a sit down place. Wished there were just a couple more items that sounded mouth watering enough to jump off the menu at me! Overall, I love the concept and the dcor, and I'll be back to try something else.
