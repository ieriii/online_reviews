The prices are reasonable, good coffee, and alot of menu options for vegetarians. I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the location is nice. The food came out really fast and I got the biggest fruit plate ever for 3.49, which was delicious. I got the cheesy egg sandwich and it was very tastey. All around recommended and I will go back for sure the next time I'm in the area.
