Great place for a group. The upstairs Bartenders were great, friendly and informative as we waited for our group to assemble. You've got to try the bacon wrapped dates (we had seconds). I had the the avocado margarita and loved it. Many different tapas to chose. I say have at it and have fun discovering different tastes. It is pricey though. Upstairs is where to eat.
