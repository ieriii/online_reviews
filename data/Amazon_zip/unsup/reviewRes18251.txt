Fuimos a XOCO para el desayuno. XOCO is a step above what I usually eat for Mexican breakfast -- usually the grittier (but tastier) burritos, huevos, etc that the various joints in the bay area serve.  Food: The churro was high quality and toasted to a very nice chewy golden brown and sprinkled lighty with sugar. Probably the best churros I have eaten to date. Wood-Oven Chilaquiles: The food was good -- eggs were tasty and food looked very presentable. However, I felt like the order was a bit on the dry side. Perhaps this not custom with what I usually eat when it comes to Mexican food, but I just wanted to note my thoughts. Overall, the food was good and it is in-line with the pricing.
