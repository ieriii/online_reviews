This is a gorgeous and romantic restaurant. It would clearly be a great place for a date - I felt beautiful just being in that room! Their colonized South Pacific decorating scheme worked perfectly. The riesling wine was excellent, and extremely sweet - I wish I could remember the name of it so I could seek it out another time! I began my Restaurant Week prix-fixe meal with the Pho, which of course is oxtail soup with rice noodles and beef tenderloin. The portion was very large for an appetizer, and I loved the hot aromatic broth that was loaded with noodles and tender beef. The chili sauce that came with it was extremely hot, so I had to be very conservative with it! My main course was shrimp with asparagus. The sauce for this dish was spicy as well! The shrimp were big and juicy, with a good 4 bites per shrimp. I liked the texture of the dish, and I mostly enjoyed the spice although by the end of the dish my lips were burning! They also had large slices of green onion throughout - biting directly into one was not a pleasant experience. Overall it was tasty, and certainly more than elevated take-out, but I wouldn't call it representative of fine cuisine. The dessert options for RW were disappointing, only ice cream or sorbet. The sorbet was excellent, particularly the mango, but I think they could've stood to add a little more excitement to the choices. Very good food, but really great atmosphere.
