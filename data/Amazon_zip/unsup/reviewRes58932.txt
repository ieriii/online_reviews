Disappointing experience: WARNING....do not let them seat you in the "back room". The area of the restaurant in the far back, behind a half wall, is small and much louder than the already very loud restaurant. Our party of three was seated there between two large group parties---even though there were available tables in the large room. (And, yes, we were dressed very nicely and arrived on time for our reservation.) The two large parties in the back with us were talking over each other, shrieking, and laughing at high decibels all evening. We were stuck between them and found we could not even have a conversation at all with the terrible acoustics of that small area. As we exited the back room, the sound in the main restaurant seemed almost quiet in comparison. We politely told the manager on the way out and he simply gave us his card and said to ask for him next time we came in. Yes, the food was good and the menu intriguing, but the experience was awful. Really, just refuse if they try to seat you in the back. Or leave. It's not worth it.
