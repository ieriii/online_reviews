Noise levels in US restaurants are often challenging for non-US diners and are usually unsuitable for those wanting a quiet & romantic dinner for two. In tonight's case, none of the smaller tables in Bonsoiree's intimate space could compete with the table of 7 corporate queens/come entertainers that managed to increase cackle & screech volume with each of the 7 courses. We both left with headaches and ringing eardrums. Nevertheless, we enjoyed the menu and were pleased with our server's competence, friendliness and efficiency.The baked scallop and crab in the shell was lovely, as was the caramelized banana bread and butter pudding.The coffee in the veal & coffee consomme was a little too over-powering (with the chocolate as well!) and some more seasoning would also have helped the pork chop.Would like to visit again but the noise level was really inappropriate for a small restaurant.
