I had a magnificent meal here a few weeks ago with family and some out of town work colleagues of my father. Everyone LOVED the food, and trust me, there was a lot of it! Everything was just perfect. We were there on a week night and it was pretty crowded and loud, but the atmosphere was perfect for what we needed. Friendly, prompt service. Prices are moderate to high, but well worth it. And, considering the area, the prices are quite reasonable. Extra points for having craft beer selections on the menu. :)
