Ehhh.......I've had better, and from The Publican circa last year no less. My second trip to The Publican came a little over a year after my first and came in a little less enjoyable than the first. I don't know if it was the loud crowd, the fact that they were out of the two items we wanted or just my less enthused self. Either way, I would say that this time around I was just so-so on my experience. So naturally when I think of pork heaven, I think of The Publican. What better place in Chicago is their for juicy pork anyway? So on this trip, in order to have the full pork experience, my BF and I decided on eating suckling pig and pork rinds(after all our motto is go big or go home!) Either way, apparently the crowd that night all the same thought, because when we sat down we were informed that neither was available. We ended up going ahead and ordering the ham sampler (too salty) and the fried oysters (which were great, but not the pig product we were looking for). Either way I definitely feel that I need to go back to The Publican and have a do over. Since I have heard they have great meal and beer pairing nights, I am especially going to make an effort to make it then.
