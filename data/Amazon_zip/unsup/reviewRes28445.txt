fast food pasta, pretty good stuff. great prices, fast service. i always get the gnocchi aurora and its always good, my bf has had the spaghetti, the rigatoni, the ravioli and we always get the calamari, and it's surprisingly good for a fast food pasta place, never greasy or fishy or chewy. pasta bowl is tops for our cheap Italian fix!!! i wish they delivered to us because driving over by clark/fullerton kind of sucks sometimes, but it's always worth it!
