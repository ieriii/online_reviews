I can't say this is the worst dining experience of my life because once a friend made me clam linguini, and I got violently ill from the canned clams she used. However, we have a contender for second or third place. After trying for about 10 months to get through by phone and leaving messages when I was able, I got a call back for a reservation, although they later cancelled due to maintenance problems at the restaurant. Months later, I got another reservation. I heard great things about the place, and I was exceedingly patient. Schwa reminded me of the restaurant in the Steve Martin movie, "L.A. Story" called L'Idiot (a reference to an earlier film of his). He tried to get a reservation and the staff gave him a time and date that was inconvenient, and then asked what he and his date might want to eat. The maitre D' at L'Idiot told him, "You think with a financial statement like this you can have the duck? You can have the chicken." Once we FINALLY got there, I had high hopes for tastes that were promised to amaze me and evoke emotion. The only thing I could taste was my own bile from constantly being annoyed by the dining experience. We weren't sure if our waiter was stoned, hated his job, or was rehearsing for a live theatre role. Dismissing the condescending and surly attitude of staff, we attempted to enjoy a meal, although the music was noisy and distracting. We brought a few bottles of wine to try to pair with menu choices, which only seemed to enrage the waiter even more. After nearly finishing the first bottle, and wondering if the wait staff took the evening off, we promptly left and found a much more accommodating restaurant. If you crave an atmosphere pretentious and churlish, this is the place for you.
