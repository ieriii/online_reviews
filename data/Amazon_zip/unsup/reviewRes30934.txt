A delightful place with a good selection of vegan dishes. I come from NYC and usually lower my expectations when I travel, but this place was a really pleasant surprise. Good food, nice staff and friendly atmosphere. I'll definitely be back every time I visit Chicago. The sweet potato fries were really good, the lentil cake appetizers were flavorful and zesty, and the mixed vegetables side dish was anything but ordinary. We tried the meatloaf and black bean burger; they were both hearty and tasty. I was slightly disappointed to find that they didn't offer almond milk as an alternative to soy milk for my coffee. I know that would be totally unreasonable in most places, but in a serious vegan joint, it should be considered. The menu is a great collection of simple comfort food, but it could be a little more creative. Nonetheless, this restaurant deserves 4.5 stars for being an excellent vegan oasis. I just couldn't go all the way to 5 stars without a little more flair in the selection. I wish this place could be duplicated and could be found in every major city around the country. It would provide a safe, delicious haven for vegans who too often have to search for a decent meal when they leave their home turf.
