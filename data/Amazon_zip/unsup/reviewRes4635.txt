Okay, so I really wanted to fall in love with this place because i'm a big fan of piggies :) And I went to the sister restaurant, girl and the goat and really liked it. Well, I left thinking it was pretty a-okay. the start of it, is they don't take reservations. fine. We called at 6:30 knowing there would be a wait on Sat night and asked if we could put our name down on the list, the hostess said absolutely no, you have to come in person. Why, I don't get it, since we would have come in anyway and been sat in about an hour. Well we finally came in at 7:30pm and there was a 2 hour wait, so my friends and I were not happy about that. Finally, we were sat at 9:30, outside on a communal table in between two sets of groups, which was kinda inconvenient. Now onto food and service. Service was great, she was very nice and full of recommendations. The food was just a-okay, we tried a bunch of things from the pigs ear, to the bone marrow, to the mushroom and pistachio schmear, to the chicken thighs with tiziki (sp?) sauce and finally this doughy dessert with ricotta cheese and chocolate chip filled center, which was prolly my favorite part. So the food was tasty but not amazing in my opinion. Def. worth trying once :)
