I'm kind of teetering on the edges of 3.5 and 4 stars for this place, but I'll bump it up to 4 for the ambiance. The place is charming with an early 20th century feel. Dark wood and vintage decor exudes a musky yet welcoming atmosphere. The restaurant wasn't open yet, but we wanted to check out the oyster bar anyway. What can be more decadent than indulging in an oyster sampler, wine flight, and bloody marys for breakfast?! We ordered the dozen chef's choice oyster sampler ($24.99). It came with 2 of each: Fishers Island, Deer Creek, Moonstone, Flying Point, Wianno, and Courtin Island (the first 6 on the oyster menu). I think it was the Deer Creek that I tried first and was taken aback for a few seconds. I don't know if this particular variety is supposed to taste like that but it had a dash of funk. The rest were better, from oceany to creamy to citrusy, but unfortunately that first one left a bad taste in my mouth. As soon as I saw the bloody mary, I had to order it. It was colossal; stuffed with a giant shrimp, huge celery stalk, pickle spear, 2 olives, and lime... it left me stuffed. The BM was mild, not too spicy or strong. Some friends also enjoyed the oyster wine flight and a bowl of clam chowder. The place is a little on the pricey side, but the portions are sizable and of good quality. Our server was cool, not very talkative but helpful. Maybe next time I'll come and try the restaurant section.
