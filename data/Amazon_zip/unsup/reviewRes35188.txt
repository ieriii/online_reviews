After murdering those pesky ducks in duck hunt, a dog would round them up for you. Guess what?! I found out where he takes them, SUN WAH BBQ! Came here for my birthday this year, had a blast. Party of 15 was handled as best as they could. We dined family style with a collection of rare beers that would have any beer nerd envious (love the BYOB factor). We sampled standard items like their Kung Pao Chicken, Mongolian Beef, Seafood Soup, Crab Rangoon. All decent, but nothing worth repeating on a revisit. The stars of the show were their Hong Kong Style Pork, Walnut Shrimp, Chinese Broccoli, Eggplant, and who could forget their simply stunning Peiking Style Duck. The skin on the Pork snapped like glass, the broccoli was slightly salty and very tender, and spicy eggplant and garlic (whoooooooh it's good!!!). The Peking Style Duck is simply a must. It's hard to find, you have to order it ahead, the presentation is awesome, and everything works incredibly well together. The crunchy vegetables, tender duck with it's slightly crispy skin, topped with rich hoisin, all sandwiched between their fluffy steamed buns. Don't forget about the great soup they hook you up with after your finished with the Duck. Sun Wah has a lot to offer on their menu. The restaurant is huge so it can facilitate a party of any size. Just about everything on their menu is worth ordering, I recommend going with the items everyone raves about. I wonder, with Nintendo being such an old system, where do they get their ducks now?
