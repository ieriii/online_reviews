You know that large and incredibly loud table at the restaurant, the one so loud you think they were auditioning for an Olive Garden commercial? That was probably our table on Wednesday, aka Lobster Night aka D's Bday.  The place is huge and packed, but our waitress made us feel like we were the center of the universe. She was especially spry about bringing the cocktails to our table. I swear by the time the words left my lips for what I wanted she was holding the damn drink in her hand already.  The wonderful thing about a meal here is that you get a full 9 yards of food. You gotta your pizza and baked bread. Then you gotta salad and your soup. Now if you don't know this about me, let me make this clear, I hate having to choose between soup or salad. I get both here and nobodies gonna stop me. By the way, if they are serving the spinach soup as an option, get it, get it, get it, it is sooo good. Our table was going nuts, we even ordered appetizers which included the escargot, oysters Rockefeller, and caprese salad. Each portion was huge and enjoyable. Then with your main course you get a starch and they even rolled out some fruit plate and profiteroles for desert. Needless to say I gained 5 lbs by the end of the meal.  This was one of the longest meals I've had, but it was highly enjoyable. All the booze must of helped with that, since typically I get a bit antsy if I'm not shoveling food into my mouth at a quick pace. The wandering musicians are a great old school touch.  The food quality is probably not super fancy or refined, you're not going to get something that you would find at Spiaggia. But then again does Spiaggia offer soup and salad with your meal? I think not. This is family style cuisine and you will getta a lot of food and you will like it!
