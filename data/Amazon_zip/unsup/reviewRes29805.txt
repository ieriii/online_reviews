They make the BEST Vegan Ruben in town! Hands down! The atmosphere is like a typical 50's diner which includes the music, the bench booths and circular bar stools! I can't wait to bring someone who is not vegan or vegetarian because the atmosphere and food are better than any other meat-serving diner in the city! This place could make nonbelievers... vegan... easily! On top of the stupendous food and atmosphere the service is kind, informative, and timely! I plan on ordering whatever my server recommends for the day from here on out! On your way out grab a vegan cookie or muffin! I recommend the chocolate chip cookie... soft of course!
