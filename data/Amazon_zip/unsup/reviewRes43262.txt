Best deep dish you'll find. Buttery crust, loads of cheese, and a tasty sauce, if I'm going deep dish, this is where I'm going. I'm not much of a sausage fan, to my mother's chagrin, but if I were I'd be deeply disappointed in what they offer here, which is barely Tombstone level. Get the spinach instead. Thin crust ain't bad, but stuffed is the real show. Only eat in if you're out of delivery range, as the strip mall location is characterless.
