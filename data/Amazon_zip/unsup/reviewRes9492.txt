Was a little worried to go after reading all the reviews in yelp; some reviews were fantastic, some were disappointing. It certainly was intriguing. Made reservations, arrived in the nick of time, was presented with a choice of tables, and unwisely choose the one by the pillar. But beside that "sticky point, everything was marvelous. The appetizers, the soups, the salad, the side dish, which they mistakenly brought instead of the originally asked for, it was seasoned and cooked to perfection. After dessert we headed upstairs for drinks. Oh! what a fantastic atmosphere there is! I think, next time i will just fly to the up restaurant!
