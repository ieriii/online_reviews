The biggest "MEH" this side of the Mehssissippi. To sum it all up: Diner food, but not at diner prices. $50.00 for two people for breakfast. Ugh. Ok, to be fair, we each got a bevvie, and an app. But, the portions were infinitesimal, and the flavors were lackluster. The Southwestern eggs benedict was, by far, the highlight of the meal. The problem? Paying $14.00 for one english muffin, two eggs, some pan-fried potatoes and chorizo (think: sausage). The ricotta-lemon pancakes should have been called... pancakes. With a ramekin of lemon glaze sauce. Not nearly worth $10.00.  The bloody mary I had was almost $8.00 and a bellini for another $8.00.  We left this place afterward, still hungry, and went and got a couple of $5.00 bloodies from O'Donovan's. Better Cuban food in the local vicinity? Yes. Borinquen Lounge and 90 Miles to Cuba.  Plus, half the price.  To sum it up: Diner food, but not at diner prices. -Cheeers.
