I went to Glenn's for dinner, and had the yellowfin tuna, seared. It was delicious! I think it was better than what I've had at J. Alexander's. The fish was very fresh, and there were barely any "white lines" in it. I recommend making a reservation to this place--it is small and gets crowded quickly. Try it! It's yummy!
