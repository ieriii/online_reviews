Dined on a Saturday night with my friend and her boyfriend. I was unfortunately running late so we lost our table, but were given seats around the sushi bar. It was fine by me. I know people say this is a great place to people watch, but I could only food watch! Ordered the beef lollipops for an app and was not disappointed. We ordered another app and we each ordered an entre and we split a sushi roll. I don't necessarily always enjoy Asian cuisine, but this was good. Really good. I had a bone in rib-eye special for my entre. It was huge. Like bigger than my head huge. (my head is normal in size). we also ordered the braised green beans which were a light and refreshing side that paired well with the heavy beef. We had great service all around. From having plates cleared to water filled to a great server. Bonus: no one made fun of me because I have no idea how to use chopsticks.
