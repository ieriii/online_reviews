We LOVE Rick Bayless' show, and have wanted to go for a while. We went to Frontera Grill for my 50th Birthday celebration. Let's start with, couldn't make reservation way in advance, stood waiting for 2 and 3/4 hours in a crowded bar area without ever getting to sit. $12 glass of wine ridiculous. Reasonable margaritas that were very good. Wait staff was nice. Coat check girl GREAT. Bar staff nice. The food for (including drinks through the night and tips) 4,at over $300, terrible. The food was not good enough that we would ever return there. The chicken portion tiny, the chicken enchiladas gamey, the shrimp enchiladas had tough shrimp in them. The guac was great but small serving size. The front staff was rude. If it were not for the great company that I was with, I would have walked out. I will give them credit for delicious black beans and wonderful homemade tortilla's. If you think $23.00 for a small entree is worth it for a couple of good tortilla's and black beans, go for for it!!! Oh, Valet parking is great! Happy 50th to me! Wonder why The Frontera grill official websites don't give an option to review. Hmmmmm.....
