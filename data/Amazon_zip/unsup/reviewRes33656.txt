This place is delicious. I would pin it against pita inn any day and given that it is sooo much closer, Sutlan's wins. I had the chicken shwarma plate and it was so tasty! The chicken was all very fresh and perfectly cooked. There was never a moment (and I have had this at Baba Pita) where I bit into a piece of chicken I didn't recognize. All white meat and flavorfully cooked. The spices are perfect and the hummus is really good. The pita is fresh. They also have an amazing salad bar, which is a hard thing to come by outside of the overpriced one at whole foods.  The ambiance at this place is cool and they have a great outdoor patio, but it is a little grungy (especially the bathroom, yuck) But all of that does not matter because they are so fast that if you don't want to be inside for too long you certainly do not have to be. Definitely one of my favorite spots for good fast cheap food.
