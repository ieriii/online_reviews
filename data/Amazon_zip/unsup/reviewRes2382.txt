I was in Chicago for a short time, and was tired of the regular restaurant fare. I wanted something different, so I thought of my idol Mr. Bourdain and viola! I'm not a hot dog fanatic, but I do know what a good hot dog should taste like. Its a cheap, pleasant, and charming place. I went at 3pm so the line wasn't as long. I loved Costco's hot dog & drink ($1.50) because its cheap, so for double the price and the experience of Doug's casing, it was worth it. Next time I'm in town, I'm gonna try the faux gras dog because it just seems utterly ridiculous, but why not?
