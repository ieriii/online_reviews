!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! A-M-A-Z-I-N-G !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Live in Chicago? Planning a trip to Chi-town? Head to Mercat ASAP!!!! Some of the best food i've ever had. We did the chef's menu at the special lunch price of $35, and you get 6 small courses with some awesome tasting Catalonian/Spanish food! The restaurant is not pretentious, you can stop in for a casual lunch in the big open dining space and watch the chefs prepare the food in their open kitchen. Service was excellent, and it was the first time i was ever asked if i had any food allergies (how thoughtful & attentive). Mercat a la Plaxa (pronounced Plancha) is owned by Iron Chef Jose Garces, and lemme tell you the food (taste, originality, plating) made me feel like i was one of the judges on Iron Chef being presented with these masterpieces! First Course: Flash Fried Padrn Peppers with a delicous red pepper/pine-nut dip Second Course: Spinach salad with serrano ham, chorizo and fig Third Course: Arroz a la Cazuela - Shrimp Chicken soup with a paprika aioli sauce on toasted bread Fourth Course: Truita de Patata con Espinacas - potato & parsley with a saffron sauce Grilled Chorizo on skewers Ham Croqueta Fifth Course: Scallops with lime, mint, and parsley Hanger Steak on top of a potato croquet Sixth Course: Warm spinach salad with shredded apple and pine-nuts No complaints, each dish was excellent!!! Be sure to check out the pics! : )
