My husband saw thier review on Diners Drive-ins and Dives and we went there Wednesday 8/1/12 for dinner. He wanted the Beef Brisket which on the show looked awesum. Your photos on the web site and what we saw on the show are nothing what we were served. The Mussels were average but a nice size serving. The Fries were good. The Brisket was dry and tough I ordered the only Steak on the Menu which was a Ribye and it was severed on a bed of fries. The Ribye was not cooked the way I wanted and was so greasey and fatty I had a hard time cutting it and had to keep wiping my knife and fork with the napkin to get the grease off. Would not go back.
