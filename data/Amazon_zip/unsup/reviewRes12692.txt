I've been here for dinner, but recently went for brunch on a Saturday right before Christmas. They had a great Bloody Mary with a nice smokey spice to it (good enough that I had 2). Eggs and brunch fair all were better than average (and moderately priced) with a cuban/mexican twist. The service was slightly less than attentive and not all of our meal came out at once (without an explanation or "it will be a minute") otherwise I would have given it one more star. I'll be going back.
