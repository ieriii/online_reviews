I'm not sure I even need to review this place since it has so many glowing reviews, but hot damn...the food is an epiphany. Seriously, if you're into gustatory hedonism, this place is heaven. This is the kind of restuarant that has helped establish Chicago as one of the most important culinary cities in the world. And I mean WORLD!
