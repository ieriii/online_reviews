I hate the Meli Cafe. I just read another reviewer say 9 Muses has the same owners. Figures. I've been 4 times (3 with friends who asked for it), and the service just seems to get worse. Actually, I think its the same, but I'm just so amazed by it every time it seems worse. Both 9 Muses and Meli hire 20 year-old bleach blond Jersey Shore wannabes as hostesses, and they are way too busy gossiping and preening to bother with you. Waitresses seem to be working hard, and mean well, but clearly the environment/management is killing their souls. The prices are RIDICULOUS. $15 for eggs and toast, $6 for their "famous fresh juices" (sugar added, from a jar). I've only been for brunch, when they seem to make a killing. The wait can be two hours on a weekend! Are you kidding me? The food is ok at best; often it's downright crap (listen to Anthony Bourdain - never eat Hollandaise out at brunch. Especially on Meli's raw eggs. Salmonella is not your friend.) Walk two more blocks to Dominicks, spend the same amount of money to buy a week of groceries, and go home and make your own French Toast and omelets, and do it right. I hate the Meli Cafe. Never again. (read and believe the bad reviews. between the lines of the 4-5 star reviews: "We wanna be on Jersey Shore too! Fist pump!")
