Went here last night and got a few small plates. The bone marrow was fantastic, as were the sea scallops with corn and fava succotash. The grilled octopus was good if you put a tiny piece of all ingredients on your fork at once, otherwise it doesn't really work. The ricotta gnuddi (deconstructed ravioli, basically) was good -- cheese balls with tapenade, can't go wrong. Finally, the meatballs were fantastic... I think it was the cheese. Those four small plates didn't satisfy four people, though, so we got the wild boar sloppy joe to share as well. Fries were good, sloppy joe was great I think due to the crispy fried sage. So why 3 stars? Because overall the food was just A-OK. In the 'hood, Lula and Revolution are my top spots. This place is on par with Dunlay's for me. I know the media has fawned over this joint, but I honestly don't get it. It's good, but not as good as it's trying to, or could be. Here's hoping it evolves into what it's shooting for. (Lastly, our waitress was great! But her service seems to be a bit of anomaly, as previously it's ranged from decent to meh.)
