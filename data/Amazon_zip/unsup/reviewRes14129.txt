Finally got to Glenn's Diner tonite and the electricity was out. Why did I give them 5 stars? Well, we decided to sit down to have a drink and some soup and wait to see if the lights came back on. Jules, our server was great. I ordered a glass of malbec...great choice...and my daughter ordered a beer and we had two bowls of chowder. We waited about an hour and decided to leave. They wouldn't let us pay the check! Most places would have been squeezing every dime to make up for their losses. Thats why I gave them 5 stars! And we'll certainly go back, probably next week.
