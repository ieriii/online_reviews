Great spot! I came here with my bestie on Saturday around 8:30, we had to wait about 45 minutes. There is no sign on the door and we actually walked past it and had to ask someone for assistance. Once it's your turn to go inside, as mentioned in other reviews, everyone gets a table or a seat at the bar.  The drinks and food were delicious. Drink-wise, we tried the romeo/juliet, the emerald, blue mai tai, and my favorite of the night, something made with gin and mashed blackberries. It's not on the menu but was recommended by our waitress and it was fantastic. Food-wise we sampled the deviled eggs, shrimp, flatbread, mini philly cheesesteaks, and fried reeces pb cups. Everything tasted good, although the eggs could've used a little more seasoning. It's all small plates here, which makes it easy to try a lot of different items. Probably my favorite food items were the shrimp, flatbread, and cheesesteaks. Mmmm! We spent the whole night here, and between the two of us had 7 drinks and 5 dishes, the total was $110 + tip. Because of the wait, this wouldn't be my regular spot. However, definitely a nice place for a date or to come with close friends.
