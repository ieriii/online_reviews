I only eat at the small red building on the east side of the street. Was coming since 1982. I used to passsionaleyly recommend this resaurant to everone I could tell.but not now. People who are giving good reviews must not have been able to compare the burritos and tacos to the earlier years. I've been there 6 times in the last two years and the quality of the meat is a shadow of what it was. Previously the steak used in the burritos and tacos was jucy and alway a bit chewy. It was the best. Now I don't find any of that, I could hardly chew the meat on the last 6 visits and not juicy at all. I can't be the only reviewer who feels this way. The food quality has definetly cheapened which is why I won't revisit or recommend.
