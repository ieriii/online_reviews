Piccolo Sogno...."a little dream" when translated into English and this is the perfect illustration of our evening. I have seen all the wonderful Yelp reviews...and it is within walking distance of my place...so after a particularly stressful Monday at work...my girlfriend and I decided to decompress with some hand crafted pasta. First of all...even late on a Monday night...the place was alive (we could have waited for outside seating...but we preferred an indoor spot right away and our view looked out to the decadent patio...).  Within the first five minutes...I knew the meal would be special. Everything...from the upscale but comfy decor...to the ridiculously attentive service (they refilled my water glass 3 times by the time our wine arrived)...just seemed to go above and beyond without trying too hard. We had the peach salad to start ....and I am at a loss for why in all the upscale places that I have eaten, noone has thought to make a summer salad from this delectable fruit treasure. It was truly memorable. I ordered the Frutti di Mare with black ink pasta...and I have never tasted noodles with such a pleasing texture...and this set the stage for a most satisfying main course. My girlfriend raved about her Salmon pasta, as well. Finish it off with a world class capuccino...and I am a happy man fresh off a little dream.  Ciao
