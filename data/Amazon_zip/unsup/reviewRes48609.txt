We had the fortune of living 4 blocks from Incanto in SF. After a personal recommendation from its head chef and Food TV host Chris Cosentino, we quickly added The Publican to our list of Chicago must-sees. First, the decor of this place reminds me of a mix between old church pews, a cattle yard and a beer garden. Very minimal, a perfect setting for indulging in meat. Sweet, delicious meat. We enjoyed a platter of high-end cured hams, a salmon salad and a sausage, smoked turkey and pork stew. The beer selection was as amazing as the menu; if you can't find a beer you like here, you obviously don't like beer. Thanks Chris for the heads up. Publican rocks! I love when chefs do wonderful and unexpected things with meats. PS - Our friends were hesitant to come here due to the price and the rumors of a pork-dominated menu. Both are untrue. You can easily eat here for $40-50 for two people, and the seafood side of the menu is just as impressive.
