Heard that this place is way better than Indian Garden, so even though we live a block from Indian Garden our group of 8 made the trek down to India House for their lunch buffet. I will say that the selection is wider and somewhat tastier. Nothing really stood out as AMAZING, but there was enough variety to please everyone. No shrimp to be found in the shrimp curry, though :( They were really quick to refill our water glasses which I was first very impressed by but was then reminded that it's probably a trick to get us full off of the water.. hahaha. All in all a fair deal for $15--$20/person with tax and gratuity included.
