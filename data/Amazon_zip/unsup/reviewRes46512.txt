Delicious! Delightful! Delovely! We had a bit of a wait, so sat at the bar and enjoyed a $5 bloody mary, which was perfectly spicy. I even asked the bartender what brand of mix they use (I've since forgotten. Sad face.) The seating is tight, my guest and I were jammed at a very small 2 top next to a support beam. Between our waters and bloody's, we barely had space for anything else on the table... a little too far to be considered "cozy." We both ordered a wrap and the salad bar. I am usually wary of salad bars, but my guest insisted. It was very good. The balsamic marinated mushrooms and fresh beets were the best part for me. The soup also looked good, but I didn't want to fill up. By the time we returned from our trip to the salad bar, our wraps had arrived. The waitress offered to "take them back" until we had finished salads, but this way, we could bounce back and forth. The Buffalo chicken wrap was outstanding. Perfect sauce to bleu cheese ratio, big chunks of meat, not overly breaded. The cottage chips are TO DIE FOR. The portion was huge. I ended up taking half of my wrap home. Seems this place is very popular, and I can see why. We went at 2:30 on a rainy Saturday, had a wait, and the place was packed.
