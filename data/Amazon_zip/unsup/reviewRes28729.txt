I went to Frontera not long after Rick Bayless won on Top Chef Masters, so we anticipated waiting quite a while. Which we did - Frontera does not take reservations. HOWEVER, that is my only complaint; this was the best meal I have had in a long time. We started out with the summer margarita - delicious. We also got the trio ceviche and guacamole as appetizers. It was all nothing short of amazing. As an entree, I got a salmon dish - I can't even describe the joy it brought me. My friend got the Milanesa de Puerco and really enjoyed it. I can't say enough about the meal we had at Frontera. The next time in Chicago, I am b-lining it there.
