It's one of my regular stops every time I head back to chicago... Plan on a long wait or call ahead but either way it's worth it. The menu is constantly changing and always good. This time was the Brioche French toast and the BLT Benedict, I've had the croissant sandwich, the breakfast burrito and probably half the menu at some time or other and I cant ever being disappointed. The one in the south loop seems to have a shorter line.
