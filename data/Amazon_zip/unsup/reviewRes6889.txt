I'm not a huge BBQ person, but after a suggestion by a friend, I decided to check Chicago Q out. To start off, I really liked the classy, yet "down-home" atmosphere. The place is lively and fun, even at 5:30. We loved the bread and butter pickles and BBQ chips waiting on the table when we arrived! One of my favorite dishes was the BBQ Lemon Shrimp and Grits appetizer. The shrimp and grits were cooked perfectly; definitely a 5 star dish. The baby back ribs fell off the bone and had a very smoky flavor. We also tried the trio of meats, which I would recommend for an appetizer so you can have a "taste" of the different meats they offer. It came with 4 different BBQ sauces, and it was fun to sample the different styles. I thought the cole slaw could use more flavor; it was a bit bland. The corn bread had a good taste, but it was a tad dry-I've had better. The milk and cookies for dessert had good flavor but would have been a lot better if warmed up! Service was very attentive, and I would definitely go back. I'm excited to try more of their dishes!
