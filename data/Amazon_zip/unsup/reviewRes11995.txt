The best way to describe this place is a foodgasm. My fiancee an I go here when we want to treat ourselves. Prices are a little high and the wait can sometimes be long but I can tell you that its worth it. Even with those two negatives, I do not hesitate at all to give this place 5 stars. When we go, we usually try and split two of their dishes. I would recommend ordering one of their delicious pancake/french toast creations (deliciously sweet) paired with something more hearty like the breakfast burrito or eggs benny. Any way you go at this place, you will not be disappointed. We are moving back to Colorado in a couple of months and Bongo Room is the restaurant that I will miss the most!!
