I went here on Friday night during Restaurant Week. The lamb meat was excellent. The fillet mignon wasn't as good as I had hoped. I loved their pao de queijo. However, I was disappointed when the server brought the banana cream pie. It was too sweet, and we didn't even get a chance to choose our dessert.
