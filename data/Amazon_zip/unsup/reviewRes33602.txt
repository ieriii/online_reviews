Last night, we had reservations to go to a...different place. The reservations fell through, and boy am I glad they did! We called Mia Francesca, sure they would be booked, but they were so accommodating and fit us in at the exact time we wanted. Proving again that this place never disappoints! Every time we come here, we leave happy. I haven't come across a less than stellar thing on the menu, the staff is great, and the price is right! With four of us last night, we had two appetizers (calamari-some of the best I've ever had, and a pizza) and two salads (fresh crunchy peapod salad and the Francesca one), and then split two pastas. It was perfect and delicious. Then came the torta lava. I am a chocolate fiend, and this is one of the best chocolate desserts. Ever. Melts in your mouth. We couldn't get over it, so we just shut up and devoured it. And-with all that food and two drinks, the total bill was a little over $100! For four people! And amazing food! What's not to love?
