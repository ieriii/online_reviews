I'm a big fan of pho and I've eaten at many places. This place yet to be the best in Chicago. I love how when I first entered the door, I could smell deep aura of pho. Their pho is pretty salty which I do like and all asians like because we eat saltier food than any other ethnicities. All in all, I would prefer it less salty because not all customers like it salty and they rather would add in some hoisin or sirarcha sauce in it. I've also tried another place that actually tops pho tang's noodle soup.So I would rate this a two because I've experienced a bettter place that is well rounded on every dish not just only pho.
