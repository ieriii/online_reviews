Just great food and drinks. Had a ham-steak on cheese grits for brunch. Just blew my mind. Also a big fan of using local ingredients from nearby farms. The whole atmosphere is fantastic. Some might think it is a bit dark, but the intimate nature is still maintained even thought the place always has a wait. If I had the patience to wait everyday, I'd go there every day.
