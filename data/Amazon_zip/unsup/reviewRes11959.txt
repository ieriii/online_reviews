this place was really good but ridiculously busy. it was pretty crowded but i just took that as a sign that the food was good. it was good, a bit pricey- but i guess most popular restaurants are. i kind of wish i had come in a bigger group so we could have sat in the big booths instead of sitting at the counter- all in all the food was delicious but it wasn't the religious experience i was expecting from the reviews.
