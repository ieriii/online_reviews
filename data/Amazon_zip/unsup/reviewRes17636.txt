GREAT place for dinner-- the food, service and ambiance were all FANTASTIC. For meat-eaters they have a ton of options-- my boyfriend and I went for our anniversary and our steaks were cooked to perfection, and tasted phenomenally! It's a bright fun place for a date or a celebration :-) and I have highly recommended it to all my family and friends, I can't believe we didn't go sooner!
