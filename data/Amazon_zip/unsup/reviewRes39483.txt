This place is over-hyped. With over 600 raving Yelp reviews and over 2 hours wait on a Friday evening, I just didn't think it was worth it.  Meatballs over polenta - these were very tasty Scallops with oxtail and gnocchi - probably my favorite dish; the scallops were cooked to perfection Buffalo frog legs - meh, basically skinny chicken wings with a fluffy bleu cheese dipping sauce Venison- not particularly my kind of thing, but others at the table liked it; the sauce was tasty Pasta dish with butternut squash and smoked cauliflower - way way too salty and smokey; not very good Dessert- nothing sounded good, so we didn't order anything There are a lot of similar places in Chicago that I believe have better food at equal or lower prices with less waiting. The service was friendly, but it is so crowded in there that we kept getting bumped into by people standing at the bar and getting our jackets knocked off the backs of our chairs and onto the floor by servers walking by. The food was good enough, but I doubt I'll be back.
