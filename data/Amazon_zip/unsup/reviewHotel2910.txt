The Good: clean and nice mattress. Fabulous views. Shula's Restaurant in the hotel is a good Steak house, expensive, but very good. The breakfast cafe was also good, and the catered meals were very good. Chibar was excellent, with good service and a great mojito. The Bad: lackadaisical maintenance. In my room alone: the door lock did not work. The armoire was probably unbalanced because the door and all the drawers would open by themselves. If I got up at night, this trap blocked the path to the bathroom and could have nailed me if I'd not been alert. Some of the staff demand tips. The bellhop held firm to my bags until I took out money for a tip (he hadn't helped with the bags, I brought them to him, and then retrieved them on my own when no help was available). The doorman passed me over twice until I took out cash for a tip so I could get a cab. Haven't had people this agressive for tips since I was in Bangkok Thailand where they live on tips alone. They charge for an internet connection, so I'm glad I brought my own hotspot. I was here for a convention. The escalator from the lobby was out for most of my stay, so we had quite a hike from one end of the hotel to the other and back, plus up and down multiple floors. Seems like they converted lower level space for meeting rooms as an afterthought because meeting rooms are split between 4th floor and the first floor, and there are no elevators to 1 and 2 below the lobby.
