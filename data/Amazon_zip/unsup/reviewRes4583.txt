We were able to fit in only 2 main meals--one of which was Alinea--during our 36 hour trip to Chicago so I researched high and low for just the right option. It had to be brunch/lunch on a Sunday, during which time our first choices (ie girl and the goat) were closed, and it had to be w/in walking distance of our hotel (state/lake). So Purple Pig it was! And I'm so glad for it. Great food. We had the roasted artichoke and potato antipasti; pork sweetbreads with roasted fennel and apricot; bone marrow w/ parsley, shaved fennel and capers; JLT pork jowl, frisee and heirloom tomato w/ toasted bread; milk braised pork shoulder w/ mashed potatoes; lemon panne cotta. I wish we had opted for another antipasti in place of the bone marrow. I LOVE marrow...but marrow is marrow anywhere you go. The parsley, fennel and capers were a nice addition, but didn't add enough flavor. It would've been nice to see a fruit jam of some sort to accompany the marrow instead. And the lemon panne cotta was overwhelmingly sweet. I wish I could have the sweetbreads every single day w/ a beer or two. The JLT was PERFECTLY seasoned..every component. Milk braised pork shoulder should be a dish at every Thanksgiving dinner from here on out. Delish.
