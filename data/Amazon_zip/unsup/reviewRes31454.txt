This place shows how starved Bridgeport is for funky new restaurants!!! Entirely organic menu for about the same price as a normal diner in Chicago. Beautiful seating area, window seats can be a bit harsh in full sunlight. My boyfriend and I went on a Sunday morning, the line was out the door!! My advice is to get there early and don't come starving because you will wait. Speaking of waiting, they need to create a better waiting area. We waited for 15 minutes standing up, staring at the other patrons eating.. Please get that settled Nana's.... Great decor, exposed brick facade. Family owned business, sweet staff. It's nice to have a decent place to eat at on the Southside. We will be back in the future!
