Irazu is a great spot for a casual lunch/dinner/date. Highlights (not in any particular order): 1. Parking: There was ample street parking in that area (at least the day that I was there- 7ish on a Thursday evening). 2. The host: Upon arriving, I gave the host my name to secure a table. He then proceeded to semi-scream it out (STELLAAAAAAAA). Not the first time this happened but still cracked me up.  3. The service: The waiter knew his stuff. Was attentive and knowledgeable. 4. THE FOOD:  Appy: The ceviche was awesome. It's served with crackers but tasted better with the complementary tortilla chips they give you when you first sit down.  Dinner: I had the El Tico. Rib eye steak with red peppers and onions. The steak was a little on the chewy side but the flavor more than made up for that. Whatever the heck they cooked the steak and peppers in, I want it in everything. I believe the Costa RIcan take on rice and beans may be my favorite. It was light and fluffy and GOOD. Dessert: The flan. I love flan. I love Irazu's flan. Will definitely be back to try everything else on the menu.
