Wow, this was truly a unique experience. If you want to spoil youself and enjoy a great evening you must go. When you are being seated they greated us by name and the attention never stopped. The sommelier recommended a bottle of wine and we tried is was very good. On to the food started with prime beef tartar, grilled diver sea scallops and avacado green apple salad. They were just fantastic so much taste and flavor. Then onto the butter poached maine lobster, white asparagus, bisque, orange -almond. Delicious. After your dinner out comes the cheese cart, desert and candies. I will definetly go back the service and food is just outstanding. Happy Aniversary to us.
