Oh MY God! What a difference a few years and too much word of mouth makes. This place is an overly priced shithole-- patronizing service, underwhelming food, and really boring vegetarian options. You trade me fried radish for scallops and try to impress me with strawberry marinara sauce along some friend cheese curds and then ask me whether I was impressed with my "vegetarian substitutes." C'mon-these days hippies are slinging sweet potato coulis in Omaha and all I got was some tofu smothered in fried mayo.
