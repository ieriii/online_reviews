*Red Velvet Pancakes- not all they're cracked up to be. The texture is doughy and awful and there wasn't nearly enough of the only good part- the cream cheese vanilla sauce. Apparently at the other location they use oval plates so the cakes are spread out and sauced evenly. Not here! They were in a short stack with sauce only on top. When I asked for more put on top in the to go container (by the way, they reheated ok), I was charged for it. I would've been ok with that if I was asking for more than a necessary amount to enjoy the icky textured cakes. I also had a side of *bacon which was way thin, crisping apart, greasy, and served the same way it's packaged- all sticking together in a glob. The taste was fine though- it's bacon.... My Eggs Benedict addict of a friend got the *Croissant Egg Veggie Sandwich with potatoes. I had a few bites of the sandwich and it was quite good! She usually comes on the weekends and gets, surprise, surprise, the *Eggs Benedict and highly recommends them- p.s. they're ONLY served on the weekend. Considering the experience and quality, I find this place to be overpriced. Street parking was easy on a Friday morning. There are several cute vintage and small shops around to shop after, but they open around 11 so we were too early. Our waitress was aloof, but attentive. The coffee never went dry. I recommend going to the other location- if at all.
