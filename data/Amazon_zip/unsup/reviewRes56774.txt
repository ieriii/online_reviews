I've been looking for great Neapolitan pizza in Chicago since having the BEST pizza at Grimaldi's in Brooklyn... and I have to say that this place is spot on! It definitely satisfied my craving! I think pizza is best when it's simplified, they definitely get that here :-) Delicious, and I can't wait to go back! Oh, and the canoli is sooooo good!
