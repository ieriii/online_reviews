Ok SO I give in.... I love this place now.. Actually sitting at the bar made the difference for me.. Michael the bartender/ manager? Was a doll! My friends and I were impressed with his teqnique and personality. Honestly if you don't actually watch them make a drink you are missing out on an entire aspect of this place. He wanted to make sure he made my friend exactly what she wanted. He noticed she wasn't drinking her cocktail and made her another one with out even asking! What service! Pimms Cup and the egg nog were excellent
