Sitting directly in the heart of Greektown, Artopolis puts out beautiful decadent desserts. They also happen to have one of the best eclairs I have ever had. Artopolis, though I have never tried it, seems like a great lunch spot. The interior characterizes the atmosphere of Greece. If you are in the neighborhood, do not miss Artopolis Bakery!
