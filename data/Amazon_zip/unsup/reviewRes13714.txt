I am 10 years old and I can't get enough of peanut butter cap'n crunch. Scratch that, I am a grown woman who ocassionally needs to dive into a bowl of ridiculously sweet cereal. I am not talking about the skinny me, "ohh, I think I will splurge and have a bowl of Smart Start." I'm talking about gimme the stuff I would never buy for the house, only find at Wal-Mart, kind of craving. This place seriously ROCKS! Start with a bowl of cereal and move on to the crab benedict (ohh that spicy hollandaise-and those meaty crab cakes) or the trout and hash. Finish of with a single pancake and you've located the cure for a new year's eve type of hangover!
