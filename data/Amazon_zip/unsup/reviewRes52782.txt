You need to make a reservation because it fills up fast, but it's really worth it for a low-key and great-tasting meal. Our waitress was very friendly, had great recommendations, and provided excellent service. It was a gorgeous evening in the city, and we brought the wine. If you are going to get sangria, bring cheap wine. The homemade sangria is delighful! My husband and I split the Cuban bruschetta (I can't remember the name),the surf and turf and the avocado salad. The bruschetta had chorizo and was super tasty. The meat of the surf and turf was cooked perfectly and also had a perfect flavor. My 4 star reason: I knocked it from 5 because the avocado salad wasn't as good as I would have liked. There was a good amount of avocado, but it was on iceberg lettuce with some tomato slices and red onion. It was just okay. The other reason is that we only received 3 shrimp on our surf and turf. I would have liked 4 to consider it fair for the price. It's 3 shrimp, a nice size of meat, and rice and beans (and we know those are cheap), so for $25, I would have liked more shrimp. Still, loved the atmosphere, overall the food was great and and it's a sweet little BYOB. We will definitely go back and sample other plates and drink the sangria.
