Being at Alliance is like reading its reviews on here: a LOT of people preoccupied with cupcakes.....(get a life people)  The uptight ungracious tsk tsk attitude of the place is constantly annoying: if you want the relaxed atmosphere of a cafe and the chance to meet people occasionally, THIS IS NOT THE PLACE FOR YOU .....Apparently all these people who feign study and high concentration are way too easily distracted, so they must not be studying or doing anything they care passionately about.  If you talk in there, or answer your cell phone, not only do you get a lot of hostile looks, but there is always someone twerpy and backward enough to explain condescendingly that you should NOT talk on your cell phone in there: again: get a life people: its 2009, people talk on their cell phones EVERYwhere now, and if you develop your mind a little bit (say get past the preoccupation with cupcakes and goody-goody attitudes) it is easy enough to learn to concentrate no matter what is going on.  But it does require having a life...and probably living a committed life--both alien concepts to the Alliance environment.
