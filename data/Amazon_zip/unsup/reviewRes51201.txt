I went to Big Jones a few years ago and remembered the food being great. So I thought that it would be a great place to meet two of my best friends for brunch today. We made a reservation and a table was available for us as soon as we arrived even though the restaurant was busy. One of the owners seated us and politely introduced himself. The food was amazing but the service was a little lacking.
