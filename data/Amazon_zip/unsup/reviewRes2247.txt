this place is insane. coming here in the dead of winter and waiting for a hot dog was not my brightest moment. i believe we waited a little more than an hour... i stopped checking after the one hour mark. this place has gotten extremely popular and they know it. check before you show up due to its strange hours and abrupt closings. they do it bc they can.... and for good reason. the best hotdog of my life. yes. really. i ate 2 of them and had the duck fat fries (fries are good but honestly couldnt tell the difference from other fries). allll good things. docked one star bc i almost lost a toe for this hotdog. come at your own risk. but if you do, i guarantee the best hot dog experience of your existence.
