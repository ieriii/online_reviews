My first visit to the Chicago Diner, and I was impressed. First up, I didn't realize they served booze, and I'd be able to get a beer with my dinner. That's a good first impression. Second, there wasn't a single thing on the menu I didn't like the sound of. I got the "Southern Style" plate. The seitan wings were tasty, if a little tough. The mac & "cheese" was good too, but the highlights were the greens and black-eyed peas.
