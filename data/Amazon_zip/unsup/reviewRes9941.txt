What's not to like? Easy to park, easy to get to. Ambiance is great, classy and upscale without being too stuffy. It's clearly a date place - lots and lots of couples that are there on first dates or more established couples. Food was pretty good - didn't care for the appetizers that much, especially the Cecina Frita, as it literally tastes like fried hummus and it's too rich. The Mushroom Risotto they had available for dinner was really good and the Paglia E Fieno was extremely flavorful. The only downside I see is that the Chef seems to have a fixation on Rosemary ... I swear you'll taste it in the bread, the apps and in every other entree. Let's tone that down a bit, huh?
