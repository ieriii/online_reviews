I am always hesitant to go into a restaurant that is in too good of a location. Garcia's is another perfect example of a place with mediocre food and atmosphere that is doing very well for itself because of where it is at. Tortilla soup was terrible. Chicken fajitas were average. Vibe of the place was crap. Floor was dirty. Which makes me wonder about the shape of the kitchen. Anyways, not going back.
