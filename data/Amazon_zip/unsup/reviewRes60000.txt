I came here about two months ago, and never got around to writing a review. So when I saw this place rated 4 stars while I was yelping in Andersonville, I was a little shocked.I came here for lunch in the mood for some cajun. We were the only people in the place which should have clued me in. The experience was pretty downhill.I ordered some iced tea and gumbo. The iced tea had a fly in it, which I would have pointed out immediatly but the waiter disappeared until our food came out. Pointing out the fly in the iced tea resulted in an offer to repour the iced tea from the same cooler that the fly was swimming in! I declined and asked for another drink instead.When the gumbo came out it was liquid charcol. I've had a lot of gumbo and been to New Orleans a few times. I've never had runny gumbo and never gumbo that tasted like someone threw it over the coals of a bonfire and scooped it onto my plate.Two bites in, I was ready to leave. Unfortunatly I didn't see the waiter again for 20 minutes. By the time I got the bill, physically chased the waiter down again to pay the bill, I didn't have the energy to point out that they charged me for the fly water tea I didn't drink.No way I'm giving this place a second chance even if people say the brunch is better - A cajun restaurant shouldn't be known for Sunday brunch as their only redeeming factor!
