Coming to Frontera, you expect a certain something. After all, it's Rick "Master Chef" Bayless we're talking about here. And it didn't disappoint.  The Ceviche Trio is the best I've had, the tuna and mango really standing out.  The margaritas are as good as they say and will make you forget every overly sweet, cloying margarita you've ever had.  They don't take reservations as a rule but if you get there between 11 and 12 on a weekday, you should be able to get in for lunch reasonably quickly.
