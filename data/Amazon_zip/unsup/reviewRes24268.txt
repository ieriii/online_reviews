The food at Irazu is superb and the staff is very friendly. It is relative inexpensive, especially considering the plates are piled high with food. One of the things that impressed me the most was their "milkshake," which in Costa Rica is basically a blend of milk, ice, and a fruit of your choice. Having been to Costa Rica and having had multiple milkshakes their everyday, I've tried to make my favorite type - pineapple - here in Chicago and have always failed. It always has tasted quite strange when I've made it. When I ordered it at Irazu, the waitress suggested that she make the pineapple milkshake with Soy make rather than regular milk, since the regular milk would apparently curdle... The result was pure deliciousness and I now know how to successfully make one of these myself! Finally, be sure to get their fried plantains! Now for the reason I did not give this place 5 stars - Authenticity. A few things struck me as odd. Although costa rican food varies widely, it is usually considered to be "bland" compared to the food of neighboring countries. Irazu definitely spices up their food and makes the dishes much more elaborate than you would find in the country. In Costa Rica, in order to make their food tastier people usually put Lizano Salsa on their meals. I was quite surprised when I tasted their rather spicy "Lizano salsa." In Costa Rica, this salsa is not spicy at all and is actually usually compared to a Worcester sauce! When I got home from Irazu I actually cracked open a bottle of my own Lizano Salsa just to confirm that it was completely different from what they were marketing! Finally, the last non-traditional Costa Rican item were the tortilla chips on the table. All in all, the food is great and you get a lot for the price, but its authenticity is a bit in question. Addition - I went back and specifically asked for Lizano Salsa - they gave me a little plastic cup with ~1 tablespoon of the salsa and charged me $1 ;(
