For those of you familiar with Sonic, this place's service is just like in. Old school dine-in where you pull into the parking lot, find an open spot then order from the convenience of your car and a server will bring your food to your vehicle. They have burger, hot dogs, and milkshakes. I personally only tried the Superdawg which was pretty darn delicious. It came with onions, peppers, mustard, & a pickle. Fries were inside the box along with the HOT, hot dog. The fries are "crinkle-cut" and very tasty, although they need a little bit of salt. I didn't know it was cash only and the lady was nice enough to notify me that there was an ATM inside and that she would come and get the money when she comes to pick up the tray. ALSO guys, flip the SWITCH UP when your done eating so they can pick up your tray. Overall, this place is gonna get more visits from me. Food is delicious, good service, great old school environment.
