Sat outside, which was a nice touch. Service was decent for a busy night, attentive to water and wine. I really liked the "japas" - we had a salmon and avacodo tartar type thingy with crunchy chips. Very interesting. Sushi was what you normally expect for these prices. BYOB always a nice touch - great way to save $$ with a big group. I enjoyed it but it was the not the best sushi I've ever eaten. I will be back to keep trying stuff off their extensive menu. **update: went back and was pleasantly surprised with some of the more "complex" rolls ... definitely worth a visit.** ****update part deux: They've added 4 more tables inside - cutting down on the wait time. Try to spicy tako roll - delish***
