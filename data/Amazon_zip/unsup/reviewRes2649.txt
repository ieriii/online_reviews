um 5 stars for the best stuff you can possibly get! i dont care how long the line is or what the weather is...ill stand in the worst chicago has to offer weather to get food here. the one gripe is that the hours are a bit rough...closes at 4 is a bit hard for people who work day jobs and granted thats not a prob for me it could be for others. but when u get the business they have they could close earlier if they wanted...but PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE dont...but it def keeps the late nighters out so that is a good thing for them because they do cater kids. and the fact that the owner is the face of the restaurant and is probably the nicest guy ever is awesome!! btw the wait goes by fast for how long that line is...its intimidating but they blast through people quickly! but for the food half everything i have ever touched from there has been gold. to this day my fav was the rattlesnake dogs...i just had to wipe the drool off my keyboard typing it. but not only was it the most unusual thing i have ever tasted but it was phenomenal!!! so would anyone deter from eating here...sure....but they would be a damn fool to do that LONG LIVE HOT DOUGS!!!!!!
