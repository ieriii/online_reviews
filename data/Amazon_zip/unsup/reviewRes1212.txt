Perfectly cheesy decor. Quick attentive service. Good prices. Great food. We went here right out of the gate. The gate at the airport. Our first culinary experience in Chi-town and we still had to wait though we got here 5 mins before they opened and the line was already 30-40 people deep. 45 mins later we had ordered our food and what a happy experience it was. We ordered 4 dogs. Marsala and Roasted Garlic Wild Boar Sausage with Bacon-Garlic Mayonnaise and Smoked Gouda Cheese , the famous Foie Gras, Venison, and the Saucisse de Toulouse with Sauce Moutarde and Truffle Affinois Cheese. Our clear favorites were the wild boar and Foie Gras followed up by the Toulouse Sausage, leaving the venison as our least favorite. The wild boar dawg was delicious as the bacon garlic mayo was a perfect compliment to the boar and the cheese smoothed it out. The Foie Gras was the funnest. Yes I said funnest. It was a duck sausage that was topped with four sliced pieces of smooth Foie gras the sausage was delicious but the Foie Gras completely made it a gourmet experience. For me the Toulouse sausage was a bit to overwhelmed by the mustard and Venison was far to strong a meat for a tasty dog. We also ordered the Duck Fat Fries which did not leave me thinking that it was the holy grail of fries. But the were good. Chicagoans are very lucky to have this place. I have dawg envy.
