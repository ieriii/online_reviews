Yes! Reasonably priced, great tasting and inventive food? Plus- near my house? Yes- this place apparently does exist! After a few hours of tasting around town, we wanted to sop up some of the booze. I had been wanting to try XOCO but usually there are long lines...and I don't like waiting. Fortunately for us, a storm had scared everyone else away from here and into their houses- so no line! After you order at the register (everyone was super friendly- ask them what they suggest!), someone seats you and they bring out your food. I asked what I should try and they suggested the Ahogada (juicy pork, broth, and you can ask for it with different levels of heat). I felt that I had to finish it all...but then when our churros came out I could only take about one bite. So- lesson learned- maybe next time I shouldn't be afraid to take some of the food home and enjoy my fresh, hot churro at XOCO. Oh- and as we were leaving all of the chefs were eating their own dinners, and most of them had Ahogadas (although probably much spicier than what I chose)! I'll be coming here again, line or no line, to try all of the different dishes (especially the hot chocolate). If you're around this part of town, or have guests staying with you, I highly recommend that you come here!
