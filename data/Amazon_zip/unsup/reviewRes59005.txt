Normally I would not take the time to write something like this, but being in Chicago for the past 12 years and seeing restaurants come and go I was blown away about how rude the hostess was when I called to make a reservaiton. Yes, I understand that you are new and may be busy but when I asked her "how are you doing this evening?" she responded "we are fully commited." Restaurant 101:  Actually take sometime to listen to what your guests are asking. Really sad when customer service is thrown to the side and you have robots working for you that all you have to do is press the play button. Good luck surving in this economy with a start like this.
