Wilde is a pretentious, deep-fried mess... in a bad way. Trust me, you leave there thinking "did I just pay $25 for a lousy bowl of mac-n-cheese and a beer, really?" Their portions are stupidly small for the price. The food is below par and a rip off. The wait staff is spacey and you can tell they hate their lives, because they work at Wilde. Some bonuses are that it's a good looking place on the inside with pretty bathrooms. It's comfortable, except in the wintertime when there's a real fire in the fireplace and you feel like you've entered through the gates of hell. If you want pub food, don't go here, go to Cullen's on Southport. If you want pretentious slop, this is the place to be.
