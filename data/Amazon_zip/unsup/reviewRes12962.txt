Without reservations, decided to give this popular place a try. I had their sangria (my boyfriend agreed mine is better, sorry). We had an hour wait, but the food was worth it. We both enjoyed our meals, which began with bread (a bit on the hard side) and a sweet chipotle butter. Quite tasty. We had the Ropa Vieja and the Bistec a la Cubana. Despite the thickness of the bistec (steak), it was cooked to perfection. It almost melted in my mouth and was delicious. The yucca and plantain really enhanced flavor of the whole meal. We will definitely come back with reservations.
