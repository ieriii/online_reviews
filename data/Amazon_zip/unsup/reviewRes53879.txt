Came here for a late lunch, early dinner. The service was horrible. First, we sat there for over 10 minutes before we were greeted, when finally a waitress came over and tool our drink order. As soon as she walked away another waitress came over with the same robot introduction. It was mid afternoon, and not busy. We received our drinks and ordered appetizers. The house made meats were good. Cheeses were also very good, and a great assortment. Our waitress never came back to take our order for the rest of our food. Never in the dining room so I couldn't even get her attension. She was chit chatting with the bus boy and the other servers while we were waiting and waiting. We finally ordered the rest of our meal and it was good. Not anything amazing or memorable. Definatley not worth $150 price tag without tip for 2 ppl. Probably not coming back.
