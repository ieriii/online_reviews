When you enter, the left side is more upscale, the right is much more laid back. The right side has a circular bar with oysters being shucked at one end and an open kitchen layout where you can see cooks and wait staff moving at an insane pace - love! Great drinks, creamy clam chowda', and killer oysters on the half from both east and west coasts. Great for lunch, after work hang out, or higher end dinner - suits all needs!
