This place is so perfect if you are out on Michigan Ave to shop downtown, no matter what time of year it is, however, during the winter there are always the fond memories of the snow blowing outside.The deepdish pizza here is top-notch, using the cornbread crust, amazing sauce and the best cheese you can find on a pizza. Don't be surprised if you try to shove one extra slice in your stomach more then you can handle and leaving the place feeling like you just finished Thanksgiving dinner.No matter which toppings you like on your deepdish, they are sure to serve it the best, however I personally prefer just cheese deepdish pizza.Filling with a great atmosphere where you can write on the walls, you will be wanting to come back months and years later to try to find your mark on the establishment, to see if they haven't covered it up or it is still there from years ago.
