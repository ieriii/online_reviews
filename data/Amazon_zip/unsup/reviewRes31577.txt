Went to Nana's on Sunday morning near 10:30. Bridgeport must be starving for brunch places because there was a thirty minute wait to get a table. Once seated, I ordered the Chilaquiles, which was just awesome. My fiancee order Marscarpone filled French Toast, which was also delicious. While we waited, we noticed a burger being served with an egg on top (somewhat similar to Kuma's), it looked scrumpteous. Can't wait to try their lunch menu. Overall: great addition to Halsted Ave in Bridgeport. :)
