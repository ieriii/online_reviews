The Pepito ("braised Tallgrass shortribs, caramelized onion, artisan Jack cheese, black beans, pickled jalapenos") was very good. The Ahogada ("golden pork carnitas, black beans, tomato broth, spicy arbol chile sauce, pickled onions") was absolutely out of this world. Great agua frescas help it round up to the full five stars. A member of the sandwich pantheon.
