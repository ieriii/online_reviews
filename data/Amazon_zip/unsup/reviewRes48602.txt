This is a good restaurant, just not for me. Mainly because I have very picky tastes and just do not eat a lot of the meats that they serve here so my options were few. That said, the service was good, the interior was impressive. The crowd was trendy and loud as expected. Although it was weird eating late and then watching a large crowd come in for a beer drinking event (think of 2 shows in one night at a club) I didn't have too many issues. My girlfriend who eats everything had a better experience.
