Went in tonight for the first time and was treated so rudely by the hostess that I will never go back. Don't bother coming here with a party of more than 4 because evidently that means that you cannot sit outside (we had three adults and two kids), but instead are relegated to a huge table right next to the waiter's station in a hot, insanely loud, cramped dining room. The food was good, but we were so uncomfortable that we were unable to enjoy it. Shame.
