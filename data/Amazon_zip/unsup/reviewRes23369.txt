I was SO excited to head to dinner in Chinatown on a weeknight knowing that I could more than likely get a table at Lao Sze Chuan. I was pleasantly surprised to see that there were a few tables and then what? The host said go upstairs? Smart move Lao Sze Chuan...you got a second space upstairs! Yes folks it's true there are now count them two dining spaces for Lao Sze Chuan. Service was super slow and I was salivating the second the waitress set down the menu. I got my favorite staples (green beans with black beans and dry chili beef) and while they were good they weren't great. Huh, what's going on? I'm chalking it up to an off night... Yeah for the additional seating. Boo for the food that is still as spicy as ever but was missing something...
