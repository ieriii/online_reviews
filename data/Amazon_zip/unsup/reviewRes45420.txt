When bars have drinks that cost more than a six pack at the Jewel I usually don't give them four stars, but in this case I make an exception. Wilde is THE place to go if you are a fan of intricate, custom, and impressive wood mouldings. Rare to rate a place based on its interior, but theirs is awesome! The place also seems new making it more of an anomaly since most newly constructed bars are cheap, quick builds ,comprised of shoddy materials and just look chinsey. Wilde is not the norm in this regard. The have a huge interior, Guinness on tap and a killer sidewalk patio in the summer. If you are in Lakeview and with an architecture snob who likes good beers, though a little expensive, go here, its worth it.
