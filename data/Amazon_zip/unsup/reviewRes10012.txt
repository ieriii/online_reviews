Piece serves honest, simple pizza. Like what you might make at home if you had access to high quality ingredients and maybe your dad was a chef or something, the pizza is heavily focused on the cheese and toppings and just a bit disheveled, with the sometimes-saggy/sometimes-crispy dough seeming more like an afterthought. It all comes together in a way that sets it apart from traditional Chicago thin crust places without necessarily being better or worse; just different. My fiancee and I also tried the goat cheese appetizer, a rich, creamy spread that I would recommend to anyone. Cheesy food is just half the experience though (if that). They also brew their own beer - and they expect you to stand around at the bar drinking some while you wait for your table or else risk looking awkward. Between the two of us we had the Dark-n-Curvy Dunkelweizen and the Worryin Ale. Both were full-bodied and tasty without being revolutionary and were a perfect complement to the meal. All said, Piece is an excellent addition to the Chicago pizza and beer scenes that, while not extraordinary, is certainly uncommon in its handcrafted attention to detail.
