Food here is pitch perfect with pastas, fresh catch and antipasta as star features.The vibe was good from the start when I made the reservation and was told about limited free parking in the lot around the corner. We sat outside in the comfortable little covered patio. We enjoyed an excellent Baralo as the waiter patiently responded to questions about the specials. Started with a variety of appetizers including olives, peppers, zucchini, couscous,and beets. It was a veritable delight with good ciabatta and EVOO. Halibut in a bag was moist and flavorful. The whole fish special of sea bass was bones for us and grilled to perfection. Nice dessert offerings include yummy chocolate tart and strawberry and rhubarb fritatta. Service was friendly and efficient. All four in my party raved about their food.
