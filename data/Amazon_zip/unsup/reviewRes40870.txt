I'm keeping my review at 5 stars because Bon is still one of my fave places for a lovely night out that won't break the bank. But....I will say that the Saturday night underground menu (6 courses for $85) is a poor value compared to the usual options. This was our 4th trip to Bonsoiree but our first time on Saturday night. While service was top notch as always and two of the dishes were mind-blowing (though just slightly too small to really satisfy), I left a bit disappointed, and that shouldn't happen at an $85, Michelin-starred restaurant. After four dinners here, I've realized that I can always pass on the first course; I've never had one that I didn't take two bites of and then give to my husband to finish. Swap those first courses out for that divine scallop motoyaki and I'd have been much happier. The soup was good filler and the turkey and foie gras and the lobster and pork belly were both phenomenal, but then out came the tiny scoop of basil sorbet. It was laughable. Really, this counts as a course (which, if you break down by price and allot $20 each for the 2 meat courses, is still over $10 per course, so $10 soup, $10 sorbet? really?)? Dessert was gingerbread cake with ice cream, tasty but not as creative or delicious as other desserts I've there. Verdict: go to Bonsoiree, just not on Saturday.
