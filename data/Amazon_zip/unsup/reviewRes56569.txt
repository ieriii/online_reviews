Chicago is known for their steakhouses, but there is a new big bog in town! Mastro's is doing everything right, from the food to service to ambiance! I honestly didn't have one complaint about the experience. The steaks were amazing and all the sides and dessert were just as good. I went for the NY Strip which was cooked to perfection. Dessert was creme b. and the yummy whip cream they serve it with. This is my new fav. steakhouse in chicago!
