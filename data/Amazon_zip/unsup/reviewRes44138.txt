MACARONS!!! I tried 6 flavors while I was there are they were all pretty good but here is how my list would be ranked: Lemon Poppy Seed Coconut Lime Pistachio Manjari Hazelnut Raspberry Bacon Maple I was surprised I wasn't in love with the bacon maple...I do love bacon. My friend who regularly seeks out macarons also said that they were larger than the average macaron she comes across, so that's a plus to me!
