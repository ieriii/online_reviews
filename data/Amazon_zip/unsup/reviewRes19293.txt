Olives and PickleS. They give you 1 large pickle that's cut in half. I don't think that constitutes as plural. Definitely not worth it since every sandwich or burger comes with a half a pickle anyway. The green olives weren't pitted. Thumbs down. Fried chicken liver, pretty awesome. Get it. House poutine, it was okay. Just fried drenched in some sauce. Very cheesy. Can get kinda messy. Tried the Gage burger, medium. Overall, not bad. Expresso was strong, just how I like it. Although one my co-worker got a bad one and a dirty spoon. Tsk tsk tsk. Probably around $30 per person without drinks.
