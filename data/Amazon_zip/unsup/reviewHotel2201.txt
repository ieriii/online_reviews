The Intercontinental feels like home to me, considering (that aside from the Convention Center), I've spent the majority of my 72 hours here. The stinging pain of 7 am debriefings is palliated slightly by breakfasts in the majestic Moorish ballroom, with its view of the city skyline. Although my boss will freak at my $35 room service tab for a glass of wine and French onion soup, it was served with Midwestern hospitality (pronounced with a hard "a"). Personally, I love hotels! Heaven is ordering room service and watching The Sopranos. I deducted a star only because the water pressure is slighly weak and the loud a/c, which interferes with sleep.
