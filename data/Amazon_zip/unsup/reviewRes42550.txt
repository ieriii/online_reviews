This was my first time trying deep dish pizza. My airplane seat buddy from my four hour flight recommended I try some once I get to Chicago. Of course, once I landed, I yelped deep dish pizza and found this place to be very popular and wanted to try. I went with a friend of mine and we ordered a whole pizza. Boy, we were wrong in doing so. Haha. Out of 6 slices we were only able to chow down 4. Slices are huge and sooo good.... that's a good thing. :] My friend said that he was in Chicago a couple months ago and tried a deep dish pizza at a place that had expensive deep dish pizza (don't remember the name) and didn't get the same great quality that this place has. P.S. He now recommends this place and craves it once in a while.
