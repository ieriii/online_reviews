Leave your diet at the door. I'd hear nothing but good things about this place from vegan friends, and they didn't steer me wrong. Yea, it's not particular healthy vegan fare, but it's damn delicious. After running the Chicago Marathon, my guy and I were more than ready for something decadent. They have a huge menu, period. The sandwiches that we ordered were perfect (and this coming from a gal who never liked meat Reubens), they have Michigan beers (as a former Midwest resident, this was wonderful) and the BBQ ribs are SPICY. I wish I'd had more money and room in my belly. I want to move to Chicago anyway, but doing so might be dangerous for my girlish figure. The staff was attentive, friendly and helpful.
