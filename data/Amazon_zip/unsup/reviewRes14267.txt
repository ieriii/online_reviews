Came by for lunch today and had the a great mushroom pizza with white sauce, tarragon and truffle oil - delicious!  Sat by in the open window seat taking in the sun since it was such a pretty day. Service was perfect and quick, restaurant has really good ambiance.  Looking forward to coming back and trying their brunch menu!
