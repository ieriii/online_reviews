If you like meat, eat! The salad bar would have made a fine balanced meal, one offering on the salad bar that looked not-so-fresh was tuna maki and sashimi. I was surprised to see that quite frankly and even if it were fresh, it seemed out of place. The beef, pork, lamb chops, leg of lamb, and bacon wraped filet were delish! Oh, had a tender juicey smoky sausage too. Very attentive service.
