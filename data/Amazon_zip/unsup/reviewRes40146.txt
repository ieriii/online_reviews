My husband and I have tried several Korean restaurants in Chicago but I have to say San Soo Gab San is our my favorite. There is no other Korean restaurant serves so many BanChan (little dishes) and I love it. Whenever we visit Chicago we really look forward to dining there. When we arrived there on Friday around 7 pm, we were promptly seated and the side dishes were brought to us immediately. The waitress was very attentive and our water glass was refilled a few times during dinner. We ordered fish egg soup, which is one of my husband's favorite Korean dish, and some short ribs to cook on the table.  They were all very delicious.  We can't wait to go back!
