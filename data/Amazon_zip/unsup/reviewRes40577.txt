It's always a full house in here ! It doesn't even matter if it's 3pm in the afternoon. When I was a wee high schooler I would come in here for the Green Tea Bubble Tea (YUMMy). But the pho and the fried crepe are also delicious. Nothing extraordinary. But I do enjoy the portion size of the noodles. Trust me, it's a lot of food !
