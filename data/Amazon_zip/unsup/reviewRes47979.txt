Came here for brunch and had an amazing meal. If you werent sure of the relationship between the restaurant and the meat deli next door, just look at the menu... If you have a vegetarian friend, I probably would not suggest bringing them here...unless it is a cruel joke. We sat in a booth... a booth that was designed to look like a pig pen. they close the doors on you after you get in which gives some privacy (and a little claustrophobia) but appears to go with the theme of the place. The theme being country chic with an emphasis on pigs... but in a good way. At least the food was simple and delicious Literally everything we ordered had pig in it. The bacon was really good. Extra thick cut pork belly with a maple glaze. worthy of a plate lick. Also had the spicy pork rinds which were very crisp and tasty (not that spicy though). The chorizo flatbread had piles of chorizo on it and a sunny side up egg on top. Very well prepared and perfect for brunch. They also had a schnitzel and waffles which was their take on chicken and waffles but with pork. It was very good schnitzel and the compote and syrup it was served with paired nicely with the dish. Service was great. Coffee was good. They kept up on refills and were attentive. We left full and happy. We made a reservation for saturday brunch. Seemed a little busy as we were leaving so I would recommend you do the same.
