I thought I'd already written this review, but here I am. My first trip here was my first time eating Ethiopian food and it was amazing. I loved every bit of it. The honey wine was a little sweet, so I just drank lots of water to go with it. The service was great. I felt a little off eating with my hands at first. [What can I say?! I'm a girl who eats pizza and chicken wings with a knife and fork! Don't judge. I see you!] Since my first trip here, I've gotten food for carry out and every single time it's delicious. Definitely give Demera a fair shot. I'm ashamed to say I lived in the neighborhood for two years and hadn't tried it until this year. Don't be me.
