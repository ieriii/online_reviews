I know it's kind of known as an upscale version of the Cheesecake Factory, but the food has been consistent and yummy in my tummy. (I do not like the Cheesecake Factory.. so that means this place tastes nothing like it!) They always ask if it's my first time here.. guess it's a tourist hot spot? No wonder their food is consistent, they constantly need to impress out of towners! I LOVE: Roasted Beet and Goat Cheese Salad Mixed Greens, Fresh Roasted Beets, Goat Cheese and Toasted Pistachios Tossed with a Hazelnut-Citrus Dressing. (Wow, I love each and every one of those ingredients + what an amazing dressing idea. ) Yellow Tomato Pasta Pomodoro Spaghettini Tossed with Sauteed Cherry Tomatoes, Fresh Basil, Parmesan Cheese and a Light Yellow Tomato Sauce (I asked for this WITHOUT the cheese! Still YUM!) Yeah, those are my favorites thus far. I know it's touristy .. and some people may say it's Cheesecake Factory 2.0.. but it's not!
