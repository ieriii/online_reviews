This charming italian restaurant is a MUST try! My husband and I sat at the bar and enjoyed flavorful food and delicious wine on a weekday evening. We had the Cacio E Pepe (spaghetti with pecorino and black pepper) and the Riccio di Mare e Granchio (linguine with sea urchin and crab). Both pastas were delicious. We also tried the pizza dalla terra which had mushrooms, leeks, tallegio, and truffle oil. This was delicious as well especially for garlic lovers (which we are). We met the owner, Scott, and his wife, Dana. They were so hospitable and made us feel right at home. We enjoyed bottles of the Sangiovese (they also sell bottles to take home) and also fantastic desserts! We are definitely coming back!
