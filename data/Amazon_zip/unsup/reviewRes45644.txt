I would give this place 10 stars if I could. Awesome bar/restaurant. The decor is breathtaking. There is an actual library and a HUGE, gorgeous wood bar. The place just has a really cozy feel to it. I've been there three times and every waiter I've had was wonderful. The food is heavenly!!! If you aren't sure what to get, order a burger. I've had their "Blue Burger' and even if you aren't a big blue cheese fan, this burger is delicious, with just a hint of blue cheese. I've also had their chop salad, mac & cheese, mahi mahi and fish and chips. Their desserts are excellent. if it's available, try the mint ice cream pie. It's covered with chopped Andes mints...so tasty. Great selection of beer and wine. Moderately priced, but well worth it!
