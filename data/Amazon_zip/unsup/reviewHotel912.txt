Stayed 2 nights recently while I was in Chicago for my job. Located at the corner of West Washington and State, it's the perfect location for shopping, theater and sightseeing. You can reach the Burnham easily from O'Hare via subway -- stop is just around the corner. The Art Institute and the Chicago Symphony are both within walking distance. The rooms are small, yes, but are beautifully decorated, though perhaps not to everyone's taste. Enjoyed the free evening wine reception and the hotel bar/restaurant seemed quite popular. Staff are extremely friendly and helpful and create an all around warm atmosphere. I like to exercise but their tiny fitness room did not meet my needs. No worries-- there's a Bally's on the next block up on W Washington that allows non-members to work out for $10 a day. Perfect!
