Being from New York and having tried Bon Chon, UFC, Cheogajip, Kyochon chicken, it was a nice surprise to have found Crisp. I read their review on Time Out Chicago and had to check it out.We ordered one of the Buddha Bowls, Marty's Mushrooms, and 10 wings. Now realize that 10 wings at Crisp is 20 wings anywhere else at half the cost! We got the wings half sassy and half BBQ by recommendation of one of the owners, Doug. I was able to pick the veggies of my choice for the Buddha Bowl and got it with tofu. The veggies and seasoned perfectly.The chicken was OUTSTANDING. the outside was ridiculously crispy and the inside moist and juicy. They were not smothered in sauce like at Cheogajip. The sauces complimented the chicken really well. Thinking of the chicken right now 2 days later makes my mouth water for more. Did I mention that the chicken is made to order? HOT CHICKEN! mmmmm.The mushrooms were tasty as well. Doug let us sample 2 different sauces. My only complaint was there wasn't enough sauce for the amount of mushrooms we had. The seating is communal...3 large tables with benches and then there are bar stools with a counter along the wall. Wet naps were supplied as were an unlimited roll of paper towels on the tabletops. I was told that they are working on a liquor license and sidewalk seating. That would be most awesome once summer comes around. What is better than cold beer and fried chicken on a summer day??? They are BYOB so if you can't wait for their license, bring your own (no corkage fee).As for the other items on the menu, I saw a lot of people order the whole chickens. The owners were very informative, patient and helpful to the customers ordering, like myself.I will surely be back for more.
