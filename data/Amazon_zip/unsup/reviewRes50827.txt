Based on the positive reviews, I realize my mistake was coming in on a Saturday evening for dinner instead of brunch. I was really hoping for some real Southern comfort food in coming here -- maybe some ribs or fried chicken or something deliciously artery-clogging. I appreciate the move toward making Southern food healthy, I truly do... I just want something more than boring salads, xyz cakes and grits. The dinner menu felt a bit lacking, and its execution failed to impress. The evening kicked off to a great start: warm, sweet-savory corn biscuits and an awesome server. She may have checked on us a little too much, but I prefer that over the other extreme. I had the vegan black bean cakes with both the red bell pepper sauce and mango salsa... with sides of mac & cheese and beet salad. The black bean cakes were pretty tasty... nothing I'd ever crave, but solid. Against the advice of the server, I ordered the beet salad since I've recently been on a beet kick, and I was very pleasantly surprised -- simply dressed in oil, salt and pepper with thin slices of onion. Terribly disappointed in the m&c, though. It required me to step out of character and ask for the salt shaker! My dining companions had the Louisiana chicken salad and spinach/ricotta stuffed chicken. Both were unimpressed and felt the grilled chicken was overcooked (plus, the skin was apparently left on?). Even if brunch is their thing, I doubt I'll be back to try it with the plethora of other good spots in the city. I don't know why I feel so bad saying that. :( Sorry, Wishbone, I wish I liked you more.
