This is one of two hotels my company uses in Chicago, so I stay here a lot. It's fine, and could be really good, but I just wish it would fix some of it's foibles. Pluses: great fitness room with new and high quality equipment. Free wireless. Comfy beds. Good idea: happy hour, with good quality booze. Bad execution: the room only seats about 20 people, and in 15 days here I think I've been able to find a seat twice. Good idea: breakfast set out on each floor, and the coffee is really good. Bad execution: show up at 7:10 instead of 7:01, and it has been raided, with no idea when more might be coming, unless you want to go to a different floor. So-so: River North location. Close to lots of restaurants, but can sometimes be full of loud bar-goers who make noise at night. Just hope your room isn't within shouting distance of Public House. Not good: I think the night desk guy is snotty and not terribly helpful. Weird: room service comes from Harry Caray's. They do at least have salads and sandwiches on the menu in case you don't want a $35 steak for room service. I'd like to like it here, but I've just seen too much of the place's quirks to be really happy with it.
