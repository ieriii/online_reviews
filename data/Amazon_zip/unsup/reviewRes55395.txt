1.) Great Food - Amazing dill rice and very generous portions. The pan seared white fish was delicious. 2.) Very nice waitress and staff. Made my wife, 3 sons and I feel right at home. The hostess had a great smile and was able to seat us right away.3.) The restaurant is small enough for an intimate lunch/dinner but it was not crowded. Plenty of table space to accommodate all the wonderful dishes. 4.) Reasonably priced. I did not spend more than I would on a meal for 5 than I would at any other chain restaurant. 5.) Child friendly. I guess as well as your children all well behaved and exhibit manners. We did not feel uncomfortable bringing the children in. 6.) Food portion is awesome! 1 plate is enough for two people. Get ready to take some home!I will definitely return very soon. I will also consider them for my next catering order.
