It was Playoff Game #2 for my beloved Cubbies, so a buddy and I decided to check this place out (plus they had the debates on too). We got there early enough to get a seat at the bar and ordered food. Having already eaten, I ordered the sweet potato fries. OMG! They are sooo good. My buddy ordered the burger which he devoured in 2.2 seconds. I guess it was good, eh? Since they had a decent selection of beer, I stuck with that while my friend sampled the beer cocktails (cocktails made with beer - and you can't really taste the beer - interesting concept). The service was great - bartender was very attentive. The crowd was a mix of 20's and 30's. It wasn't too Lincoln Parkish - but maybe because it was a week night. I would definitely go back during the week. As for the weekend, based on the reviews, I would have to be in the mood for that or have a pretty good buzz going in.
