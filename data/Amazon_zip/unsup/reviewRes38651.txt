A friend and I stumbled on Hopleaf while looking for a dinner place on a late Sunday evening. The place was packed, and we were surprised that such a large crowd was out drinking on a Sunday night... but we liked it. We finally got a table, and took a looong look at the extensive beer menu. It was overwhelming. Neither of us are exactly beer experts but settled on a pint. The beer was fantastic, the atmosphere was an eclectic mix of hipsters, couples, and locals. We looked at the dinner menu and decided that none of it sounded good to us (pork belly, frog legs etc.). We enjoyed our slightly expensive beer, and the surrounding people. I'll be going back, for beer, not food.
