This food is disgusting. I'm not vegetarian. I'm a food-tarian. If it's good, I'm eating, period. And this food was not good. First of all, there are practically no vegetables on this menu...weird. But ok, I ordered the Reuben that is supposed to be amazing. The meat-substitute was just ok--not amazing like every body insists. It was a little rubbery and the taste was not spectacular. I could have eaten this sandwich if it were not for the vegan cheese. That cheese made me want to vomit and it kind of jiggled when I tapped it with my knife. And the vegan thousand island dressing was so/so. I ordered greens as a side. You would think that a vegan restaurant could properly prepare some greens. NOPE! They were sauteed with too much garlic to actually consume. Disgusting. The Chicago Diner encourages me to continue to eat meat, because there is no way that you can convince me that the meat substitute that they use is better than eating natural meat within the context of a balanced diet. Seitan is wheat gluten that has been manipulated to look and taste like meat (even though it fails at those attempts). People often forget that it's a processed food with plenty of salty additives. It's unnatural. This ish is nasty.
