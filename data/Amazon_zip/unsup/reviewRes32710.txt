Maybe I expected too much. My bf had been here before and said it was good. We went up to that area the other day and decided to stop in for lunch. We walked in and there was nothing designating whether we could seat ourselves or had to wait. We opted to sit inside as it was hot as balls that day. Our server took awhile to approach the table...maybe she could sense my icy demeanor. We ordered drinks and then we waited...and waited...and waited. She finally arrived with our drinks and shortly after our food arrived, brought by another server. I had the seitan ceasar wrap with mashed potatoes. The wrap was good, but the seitan was quite burnt on some pieces and the gravy on the mashed potatoes had way to much seasoning; it tasted like something from a frozen dinner. He had the dagwood, which had fake bacon and such on it. I thought the ceasar wrap was tastier. Our server never once came to ask how anything was. Even if I was eminating a bitch vibe, I feel a server should still check in. I may go back...we'll see.
