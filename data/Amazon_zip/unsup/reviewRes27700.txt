Yes, the burnt edge on the crust is AMAZING! But I feel like the crust to topping ratio for the rest of the pizza is skewed too much to the crust side. And I was saddened to know that the thin crust didn't have the same delicious burnt crust. I really wish they would just bake my pizza in a super loooooong rectangular pan so there would be more of that delicious carmelized cheese or that they would combine the thin crust with the carmelized crust. Oh well. You can't get everything you want in life. I don't usually get a lot of toppings on my pizza and usually opt for just cheese. However, I always get sausage and mushrooms here. It's not the same without it. I think the sausage helps to counteract the sauce. Yes, it's on the sweet side. And I HATE sweet sauces. Honestly think that Aurelio's and D'Agastino's are worse than Domino's (and I mean before they "improved" it) but somehow I'm ok with it here. I've never eaten here and have always done delivery or pick up. I can only imagine it's even better fresh out of the oven.
