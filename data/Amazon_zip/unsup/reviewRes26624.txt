I really enjoyed this place. The smoothies are awesome. They are huge. I had a strawberry one. The owner is really welcoming here. I had the lemon grass chicken. It was delicious. The waiter brought my sister and I oranges and these little cookies. It was a nice ending to the meal. I will definitely go back again. They have a really good lunch deal that I would like to try.
