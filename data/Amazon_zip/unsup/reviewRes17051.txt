Had a date night here last night. I won a gift certificate through my high school reunion,and it was about to expire. I wish we had used it sooner. The decor is festive and invites you to have fun. It is an old warehouse turned into a beautiful restaurant and it works! Yes,it is noisy,but.....the space is open and the ceilings are sky high...don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure the logistics out. Service was fantastic. Marc(or was it Mark??) was our server last night. He was very knowledgeable and attentive. He was VERY helpful in helping my heat sensitive husband select the perfect entree,the Churrasco. He loved his steak. I would have loved to have tried some of the mouth watering Ceviches..but...hubby was not feeling very adventurous,so we split the Guac. It was delicious. I had the seared Ahi Tuna....like butter,it was.Melted in my mouth. The side of Plantains...heavenly! I had the leftovers for breakfast this morning..happiness!Great wine list and some really great looking specialty drinks. Will go back with a more adventuresome dining companion and delve into some serious Ceviche love!
