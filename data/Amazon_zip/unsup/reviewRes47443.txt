So I ordered from here via Grubhub having heard nothing but praise for their burgers. Being a self- proclaimed Leona's burger addict and having experienced my first PB burger in N'awhlins I thought for sure I would be disappointed but alas (happily) I was wrong! Pretzel bun - necessity for any decent burger and sure enough theirs was great Meat - plenty of it, cooked perfectly medium rare (amazing for a delivery order) not seasoned ridiculously so you could really taste the meat and its great quality. Though I think I am definitely over my PB burger days ... such a great burger should have mushrooms, cheese and grilled onions instead of the more adventurous ingredients. So I will definitely need to come into this place, as the hand cut fries (that looked divine) were unsurprisingly mushy (totally my fault) however, I ordered a side of the mac-n-cheese and that made up for it tremendously. Not overly cheesy, with some bacon bits and chive - like the best loaded baked potato but with pasta - if that makes any sense?! You'll just have to try it yourself to know what it's all about!
