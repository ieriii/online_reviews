I stayed one night at this hotel and I really wasn't there that much during that time. Our room was really small, it had one king size bed and a couch that was big enough to sleep on but the cushions were very hard and not very comfortable. The view was nice but it's far enough from the lake that even if you have a lake view, there are lots of buildings and construction in the way of the view. The location is great, right on MI Ave and somewhat in the middle of Water Tower, Navy Pier and State St if you are walking. The bathroom had 2 different levels of lights and the shower was pretty was nice. The Crabtree & Evelyn bath products came home with me.
