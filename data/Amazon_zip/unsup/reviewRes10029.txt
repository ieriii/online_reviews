Currently, I'm on this ridiculous diet where I maintain strict adherence to a spartan regimen of meat, eggs and vegetables 20/21 meals a week. But for one glorious hour per week, I'm allowed, nay encouraged, to go crazy and eat as much junky carbohydrate laden food as possible.  I'm sure you can imagine the time and preparation that goes into such an occasion, dear readers. Prisoners on death row eating their last meals don't enjoy their food half as much as I do from my carb-up. So, finding myself in Chicago for a day trip, my friend suggested pizza and I concurred.  Maybe I didn't get the full gist of the place because we ordered delivery, but I thought it was interesting how even though the restaurant was 2 blocks down the street, it took an hour to get our food. I was also thoroughly nonplussed (is that even possible??) to see that the "fresh tortilla chips" advertised with the spinach and artichoke dip were the oval shaped corn chips you get out of a 5 lb. bag from Costco. The slice of carrot cake that we ordered was of a similar "straight from the supermarket" feel. Still, this place is called "Piece Brewery and Pizzeria" and the pie was pretty damn good. Billed as "New Hampshire Style" pizza, the crust was thin and deceptively chewy and the artichoke and Italian sausage that we got as toppings were tasty. Out of a possible 18 slices of the large pizza, your humble author ate 8 slices, half the order of the spinach and artichoke dip and 2/3 of the carrot cake. 4500 calories later, I stumbled over to the couch and proceeded to groan for the next half hour in a combination of contentment, food coma and a healthy dose of self-loathing... Ahhh, the things I do for physical fitness. 4 1/2 stars for the pizza, but have to subtract 1 1/2 stars for the obviously store bought tortilla chips, carrot cake and the 1 hour delivery time. Carb-up only lasts an hour, mang!
