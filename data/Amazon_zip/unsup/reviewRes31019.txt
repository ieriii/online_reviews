Oh god how I love this place. Being a born and raised Chicagoan, I have a natural affinity for diner food. But since becoming a vegetarian in 1991, my diner options were limited to fries and grilled cheese (great but boring) until I found Chicago Diner about 10 years ago. I almost always order the same thing when I go: Signature salad (add avocado and bbq tofu) and sweet potato fries. Unfortunately the Signature salad is seasonal, so during the off seasons, I usually order the Rabbit Food salad (or a similar salad) with the Signature salad dressing. Everything else I've had here has also always been DELICIOUS. Radical Reuben, Dagwood, NACHOS!, quesadillas, buffalo/bbq wings, bloody mary's, Irish milkshakes (I think this is what it's called? basically a milkshake with what I assume is Bailey's) - it's hard to find something that doesn't make me want to punch myself with happiness. They also carry the best ketchup, which my friends think is weird until they try it and end up losing their shit. I've been coming here for years (up until I moved out of state), and the servers have always been super kind, welcoming and extremely attentive. Just the sweetest bunch of people ever. The desserts have always been great and so mouth wateringly delicious, though by the time I'm done with my meal I usually don't have room for dessert. But do try their cakes! If you're looking for some hearty and delicious vegan or vegetarian diner food, PLEASE go to Chicago Diner. It will not disappoint.
