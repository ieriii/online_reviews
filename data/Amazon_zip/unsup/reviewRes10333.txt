I'm from Chicago and know good Italian food. This place has excellent Italian food. Try the Penne Integrali all' arrabbiata! Totally delicious and has a bit of kick to it. The grilled vegetable panini is yummy as well. Very cool ambiance and cannot wait to head back soon! Good date place. The servers and managers are some of the friendliest and professional I have ever met.
