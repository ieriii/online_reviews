It's a lovely restaurant. The food is good, the service exceptional. I was a little disappointed by the Buffalo calamari - a signature dish...found it to be a little too floppy/mushy. But, since it's an Italian joint - meaning I got no business ordering such a thing from there anyway - I'll let it slide 'cause everything else was very good.
