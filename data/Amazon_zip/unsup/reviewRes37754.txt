A great bar with a great beer selection. I started with the Allagash White, I've had it in bottle but never on draft. It was very good. Next I moved onto the Laganitas IPA. Again, had it in bottle before at home, first time on draft. I can't say enough about Laganitas, what a great brewery. I've tried about 5 of their brews and they are all fantastic. I next had a Surly, which was so good I had two more.  I really wanted to try the new Metropolitan Flywheel Bright Lager but was told they didn't have it so I was disappointed in that.  Hopleaf is a great bar but don't go late on the weekends and expect to get a seat. All the beer geeks know about this place and it's always gonna be crowded on the weekend.
