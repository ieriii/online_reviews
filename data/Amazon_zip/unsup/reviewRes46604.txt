This was my favorite restaurant for perhaps the first 15-20 years of my life. I am not kidding when I say that I practically grew up here; some of my earliest memories were of my mother bringing me to Grunts while she had a three-hour curriculum planning lunch. I love the restaurant for sentimental reasons and because the Gruntburger (medium rare, of course) with rare cottage fries (so they're still floppy and oily in the center) is just so darn good! As I grew into my 30s, sometimes I'd start having the peppercorn burger, which is a Gruntburger slathered in peppercorns, but fundamentally the song remained the same. It's tight, the bathrooms are tighter, yes - but that's part of the dimmed lights, 70s music, dark wood, retro gal servers (some of whom I've had for over 30 years!) that are just part of the ambiance and, for me, the insanely good and comforting memories. Only recently have I started doing the salad bar (I must be getting old!) but it's an amazing bar - two soups, tons of things to put on a salad, absolutely awesome. Not highbrow; just good eats. Come on, folks. This is what started it all - the very first Lettuce Entertain You gig. They tried to close it and Chicago fought back (attaboy, Chicago!). It's a landmark, an icon. If you haven't ever been, you gotta go. If you have, you need to go back. I wait for the day when my doctors clear me to have a Gruntburger again. (It was so hard for me not to give this 5 stars purely for sentimental reasons... but it's awesome common food, not highbrow, and I have to be realistic. At least a little.)
