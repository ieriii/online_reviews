What happend? How did I get burned? I had the highest expectations for 90 miles. All my fellow yelpers had given this place head over heals reviews. The coffee was awesome. But the sandwich was nothing to rave about. I didnt think the flavor or assembly was mind blowing in any way. Their prices are generous, since they do deliver a nice looking and great smelling sandwich. Plus a lot of places try to take you for a ride over anything they can. I need to give 90 miles another go, because everytime I pass the place I yell at them in my car. I know, i'm a child...
