The food is delicious. That's the best part. While our server was very nice, the fastest item that came to the table was the check. It even took the waiter a while to first greet us, but as I said before, he was really nice. I know this is the place to 'see and be seen' but I can't imagine the noise level in there on a typical Friday or Saturday night (and I'm only 33). We went on a Monday night and they had a good sized crowd and our waiter still had to bend over to hear our orders. I can't imagine working there or trying to have a conversation with more than one person on a weekend. Again, the food is very good, so I would definitely try it - just go during the week... or don't expect to talk to anyone at your table.
