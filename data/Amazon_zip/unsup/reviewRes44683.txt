We had a deep dish pizza with half supreme (sausage, mushrooms, green peppers, and onions) and the other half with our own mix (sausage and pepperoni). This was very cheesy. I mean the second you cut it cheese slides all over the place. I think a slice of pizza is about 60% cheese on slice that's 2 inches thick. The crust was not corn meal but more buttery, think a buttery pillsbury croissant in the twist can. We also ordered calamari which was good. It was crispy on the outside and just melts in your mouth. There was about 1-2 pieces that were a bit rubbery out of the whole plate. I think I expected more from the pizza. But I guess I have to preface this by saying I'm not a huge fan of cheese. For those from the bay area in California I think windy city in San Mateo is more flavorful than this.
