I ordered a "Superdawg" recently. I was assuming that that's the dog that made them famous, so that's what you eat. It comes with all the usual veggies, in addition to a small amount of fries all crammed in the same box. For something that is supposed to be their claim to fame - I have to say I was severely underwhelmed. The dog was not anything special. In fact I would argue it is worse than most divey hot dog stands I go to. And the price was completely outrageous. I paid almost $20 for two hot dogs, each with fries, and a small milk shake! I recently went to Susie's Drive-In on Montrose and got a dog and fries for $3.59 - and it BLEW SUPERDAWG OUT OF THE FREAKIN' WATER!!! This place is severely over-hyped, and is clearly taking advantage of it. I would never go back.
