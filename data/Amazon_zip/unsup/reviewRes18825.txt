We stopped in thinking this was a step up from a pub/burger joint, and were pleasantly surprised. Our server took great care of us and didn't steer us wrong. We started off with the Scotch Egg, their specialty, followed by fresh, delicious ceviche served with amazingly flavored popcorn. My husband had the sausage platter which included boar sausage, all made in-house. I opted for a couple of small plates and tried the Bison Tartare (yes you want to try it) and a carmelized lobster with quinoa and curry that is easily one of the best things I've ever tasted. Definitely pricey, but we just opted to celebrate our anniversary a little early and splurge. Location and convenience makes it a perfect place to show off for out-of-towners. I wish we'd gotten a table in a little more of a secluded spot, but we made the reservation a couple of hours in advance so I cant complain.
