The tortas are awesome. The surprise for me was how great the bread is. So crispy and perfect for soaking up all the flavors - especially with the Ahogada Torta which was dipped in a tomato broth. The pork was tender and delicious. We also tried the Goat Barbacoa Torta (daily special for Saturday).  That was good, but i still liked the Ahogada more. We also had the chips & salsa (fresh chips!) and the chicharrones. I wanted to try the chicharrones and i think i'm just not a fan of chicharrones in general... For desert, we got the churro and some of the homemade mexican vanilla soft-serve to dip as well as Classic hot chocolate. First, the churro was small, but yummy - should have ordered 3. Vanilla soft-serve was good too. The hot chocolate was uber rich (i gotta try the Mexico City Thick version next time) - if you love the taste of chocolate, you're gonna love this. That all being said, everything does quickly add up so it can quickly become pricier than you expect. The tortas and hot chocolate though are gonna keep us coming back in the future.
