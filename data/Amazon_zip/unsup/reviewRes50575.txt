I only need three words to describe this place "best bacon ever". I love a good Chicago brunch and I've been everywhere, Toast, Bristol, Bongo Room, Bacon n Eggs, Tre Kronor, Banana's Foster etc. and this place is on the top of my list. I loved the decor, it was light, refreshing, not overly to-hip-for-Chicago looking. The seats where comfortable and I liked being able to make a reservation through http://opentable.com. The service was great and I was with a part of 5 and we were demanding. I really liked that the service level and how the treated us brunchers was above the normal regular brunch places, almost to the level of finer dinning where they brought us new silver ware after the free beignets. Yum
