Best dirrrrty martini in the city. Hands down. It is salty ice perfection. It won't hit you until halfway through the second one, because it is so smooth and wonderful. And if you are a good girl, it will come with a blue cheese olive. Two, in fact. Oh yeah, and they have seafood.  Sit at the bar. Talk shit with the bartenders and out-of-towners, it will be fun, I promise.
