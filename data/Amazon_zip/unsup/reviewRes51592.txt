This place makes my favorite burrito. EVER.  ^^ Avocado burrito suizo with ranchero sauce, for anyone who really cares deeply enough to emmulate my burrito order. Seriously though, most burrito joints will take a veggie burrito order as an excuse to stuff a burrito with rice, which, in my estimation, is about the most boring thing one could ever invent to stick in a burrito. Might as well fill it with wall plaster for all the delciousness rice adds to a burrito. Just my little hangup.  No rice/wall plaster here though.... It's all beans, lettuce, tomato, and GOBS of avocado. Add in that suizo/ranchero combo and you'll find it dripping with melted cheese and delcious red sauce. I'm getting a serious drool on just thinking about it (and it's 8 a.m. - not even burrito hour)!  Are you convinced yet? Perhaps I should add that it's open late, it has a bar, it's totally affodrable, and the burrito will most likely feed you twice unless you're Connie Conehead.
