Wow!! What great service! The general manager, Doug, made it possible for me to send my son at Northwestern University a huge delivery of cuban food as a surprise for his birthday. We're from Miami and I wanted him to enjoy the Cuban food he craves.I am sure he will be frequenting the restaurant with his hungry friends looking for that home-cooked cuisine. Thanks again for making a mom's wishes come true.
