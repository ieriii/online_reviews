Pretty darn good. Not sure if it was worth the 30 minute wait, but I'm glad I stayed in line. Not sure if I'd do it again, though. It is, after all, just a hot dog. Had the Marty Allen grilled w/ mustard on the side (husband hates mustard) and he had the Keira Knightly. Husband wished he ordered the spicy ribeye sausage since the KK wasn't hot enough. Also calorie-splurged on the duck fat fried fries. Good cheap eats if you're willing to wait. Line does move "quickly" though and you are likely to get a table. (Tables turn pretty quickly.) People are super friendly.  Good menu; something for everyone. They even have special dogs and weekly game dogs, which I think they were out of since I didn't see it on the board (went on a Saturday).
