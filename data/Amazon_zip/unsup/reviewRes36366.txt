Despite wandering in at about 2:59, the servers still let us order from the list of lunch specials slated to end at 3 PM. Lunch special items appeared to also be available on the main menu, but getting them as part of the special allows you to get an appetizer and soup/salad thrown in for the same price. I went with the eggrolls, miso soup, and the pad thai - a pretty standard getting-to-know-a-new-Thai-place kind of meal. While the miso was not the best I've ever had, everything else was delicious. The pad thai was large enough to have wrapped and take home for lunch the next day.  The servers further endeared themselves to my heart in the during the ordering process. I'd ordered my pad thai with tofu, and our server came rushing back out from the kitchen to make sure I was OK with having egg. I immediately made a mental note to recommend this place to my vegan friends and meat-a-phobe family. The most striking thing about the food, however, was how *pretty* it all is. These guys reallly have a grasp on the art of food presentation. Lunch Buddy's spring rolls were my favorite, as the sauce was drizzled out in a quasi-floral design beside the rolls. I was here for Thai this time, but would definitely like to come back for sushi (especially the Crocodile Roll - it looked so cute! I may just have to be photographed with the darling croc before its consumption...)
