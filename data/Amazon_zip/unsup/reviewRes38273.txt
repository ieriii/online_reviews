We came to the windy city to try some of that famous deep dish pizza. After a few days being in town and a bit of research we settled on Giordanos for our chicago deep dish spot. We waited the 35 minutes (on a tues night) then ordered the family appetizer and a small special stuffed pizza. Wow. Were we suprised when even the family appetizer came out! It was huge! I mean we expected the pizza to be filling but figured since we were quite hungry that some appetizers will hold us over. The thing in the picture looked small but what came out was a meal for a family of four! It was packed with calamari, zuchinni, mushrooms, chicken fingers, buffalo wings, mozterlla sticks...and all fried of course. By the time we waited the 45 min for our pizza we were 75% stuffed! And then you have to see these pizzas! The pizzas were preeettttyyyy deep! Filled with a whole bunch of cheese and some sausage,bell peppers, and mushrooms! Wow. The pizza wasn't at all oily from all that cheese. I wished that there was more other ingredients than cheese also. I barely made a dent in my slice of pizza and that's me picking out all the veggies in that mountain of cheese and eating the crust. I was stuffed way past my ears! The pizza was ok for me but I guess I'm used to a regular pizza since I do love the thin crusts but hey I had to try the famous deep dish pizza that chicago is well known for! Take a crack at the pie if you love cheese and pizza. I say hold off on anything else unless you are training for an all you can eat contest.
