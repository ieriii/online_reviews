What's up with the giant wine bottle they bring at the beginning? The food is pretty good, but overpriced. Italian food is about heartiness, not a four inch squid tentacle that costs $14. Was it from a golden squid? If your food were incredible, it might be worth it. Originality and ambiance doesn't make up for great food.
