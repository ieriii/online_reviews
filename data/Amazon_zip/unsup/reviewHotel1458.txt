I got mad move for ya omni...! Its probably a 4 or 4.5 star hotel but it acts like a 10! I loved the rooms, the (albeit small) pool and hot tub. no one was ever on the terraces and they had a beautiful view. housekeeping and all staff was awesome. the concierges were a daily stop for me. they set up a lil starbucks cart for coffeee, muffins and fruit. the store is really small, for basics only (not a gift or souvenier shop) and it is to the left of the front desk staff. 24/7 u use ur room key to access it and bring ur purchases to the front desk people.
