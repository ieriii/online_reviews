I didn't have the pannacotta, but it did look outstanding! Liked the atmosphere. Food is average to good, so yes--in my opinion, as others have said, it is too expensive for the portions and quality. I had a half order of the spaghetti with mussles and clams. Gerber makes larger portions, but I was saving room for a giant waffle cone down the street so that was ok. The sauce was skimpy and nothing special. Hubby had the ravioli and I thought it was great, but pricey. Server was a little kooky, and not in a good way. However, they were packed and rushed and everyone still seemed pleasant and in no way did they make us feel like we had to get out so they could use our table. If they changed the menu/prices a little, I'd probably be a fan. As-is? Meh.
