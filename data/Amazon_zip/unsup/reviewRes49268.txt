When I lived in the neighborhood, it was a requirement that anyone who visited me had to take a quick trip to the bakery for some cookies, brownies, or cupcakes (my treat, of course). Although they are not the best cupcakes and cookies in the world, they're pretty damn good and I'm hooked. Not only are they delicious, but some of their creations are beautiful to look at -- I fear eating them will destroy them! I'm sad I'm no longer in the neighborhood and cannot walk a couple blocks for a quick treat anymore. I do look forward to going back!
