Best. Dragon roll. Ever. BYOB - they say they have a limit of one bottle of wine or one six pack per two people, but I just carry a really big purse and, WOAH, where did that 2nd bottle of wine come from?! You can gorge yourself here without spending very much - with a group of four we usually spend $20 per person or less. This is my go-to sushi place in the city.
