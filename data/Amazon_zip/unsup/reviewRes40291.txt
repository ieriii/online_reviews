Round 2 at L&E. I'm not going to talk about the food because it was just as awesome as it was the last time. I would love to give a shout out to the staff, they were fab. The gal at the door was happy to seat us for dinner, even though they weren't serving dinner just yet. We got settled in to our table and had some delicious brews and our server came by with menus when it was time to order. He was helpful and attentive and most of all, he noticed that we were celebrating a birthday for my dear friend, Karrie. Our food came out perfectly timed, just about finishing one when the next arrived. When it was time for dessert, one came with a candle, we did NOT mention this to him, he was just paying attention. Also, there was no cheesy Happy Birthday song, which is just the way Karrie liked it. Thank you, L&E for another delightful experience!
