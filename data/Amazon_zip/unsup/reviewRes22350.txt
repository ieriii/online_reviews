SERVICE was TERRIBLE but their food was awesome. I give it a 3 stars because even though we couldn't get any more refills for our food unless we asked, it was still good. I went here with a group of friends and we got hotpot. It was basically unlimited so it was a good deal but it seems like every time we got our plate filled back up, there were hardly any meat. Their menu is pretty extensive. And if you like spicy food, this place would the best one in the area. Located right in Chinatown, it was authentic so you can't really complain about the food. If only the service was a little bit better, I'd changed my mind on the rating.
