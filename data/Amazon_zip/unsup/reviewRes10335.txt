I think the only time it's worth going here is on a slow(er) weeknight or maybe weekend brunch. The pizza is sooooo good if you step outside your comfort zone and order a combo you've never tried or even think sounds good-- trust me, it is really freakin' good. They lose a point since the service is always mediocre and they won't deliver to my house even though I'm just 2 doors north of Fullerton.
