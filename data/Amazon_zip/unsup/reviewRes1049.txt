Hot Doug's is a one-of-a-kind place that has three elements in common with most successful businesses--identity, vision and leadership. Doug Sohn is a visionary leader who gave his business its profound identity right from the start. He makes no apology for its quirks and idiosyncrasies. Someone less visionary may have seen their business grow and said to themselves, "Hey, I'm making a killing at this--maybe I'll... * ...take credit cards." * ...stay open later." * ...open on Sunday." * ...hire friendly, talented people to 1) take food orders from my customers and 2) collect my money." * ...open up a location at Navy Pier or O'Hare (or both) and take advantage of the tourist trade." * ...franchise this thing and take advantage of everybody." "...do a Groupon." Doug just does it his way, and it's always been his way. I do not want to intimate that, with the exception of the "Groupon" thing, any of the above observations are akin to soul-selling, but so many businesses have lost their way when attempting to grow and change. Hot Doug's has not made any of those changes hence, there has been no degradation. I have been to Hot Doug's a dozen or more times in the past five years. I have had char-grilled dogs, steamed dogs, polish, fois gras sausage, turducken sausage and other delights. It's not the cheapest place in town but I always get a good meal at a surprisingly good price and I never walk away hungry. To sum things up, I know I'm going to have to stand in line. I know I have to bring cash. I know there is a chance that Doug might be out of town and the place will be closed when I get there. That's just the way things are, and I'm ok with all of it. Thanks for being there, Doug.
