We stopped in on a tip from a friend and had one of the most fabulous dinners that I have had in a long time. Lucky for us it was restaurant week - Organic Lettuces to start (YUM!) and the grilled angus steak with goats cheese and fontina grits, fried kale (SUPER YUM!!). My fiance had the Amish Chicken with roasted three rivers potatoes - which were amazing. I wish I would not have ordered the poached pear for dessert - too hard to eat with a fork - but didn't not matter after our amazing dinner. Service was impeccable - atmosphere was relaxed. I would recommend to anyone. We will definately be back soon.
