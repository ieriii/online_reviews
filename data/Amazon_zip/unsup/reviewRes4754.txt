One of my favorite Chicago dining establishments--I've never had a bad visit. The fare is eclectic and interesting, and the 'small plates' style lets you try a lot of new things that you might not otherwise be able to try. Some of my recommendations: Bone Marrow - if you ever have considered trying marrow, this might be the place to do it. Their's is rich, buttery and decadent. Pork Neck-Bone Gravy - I know it sounds weird, but it's absolutely delicious. The meat is 'meltaway' tender and the tomato-y sauce and ricotta complement it perfectly. Milk-braised Pork Shoulder - I've never had a more tender pork shoulder dish. For anyone who isn't quite as adventurous, this is a must get. It's no accident that all my favorite dishes are pork. It's called the purple PIG for a reason, and I think you have to try it at least once. They also have a fair number of meatless dishes, for you vegetarian types. The roasted Anaheim peppers with sea salt were great, for example.
