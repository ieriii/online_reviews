Every year my husband and I come here for dinner before we go look at Christmas lights. Don't ask me how this became the tradition but every year we order the matrimonio and the chorizo con arepo and we leave overfed and extremely happy. Take it with a grain of salt that we only visit once a year and always get the same thing, but at the same time, it certainly delivers.
