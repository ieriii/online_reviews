You can't visit the Windy City and not indulge in a stuffed, deep dish pizza...it's like going to Vegas and not gambling!!!  My girlfriend and I ordered a small (mind you) pepperoni. We waited about 30 minutes for it, but they tell you ahead of time that it takes that long...I hate waiting esp. when it comes to food, but it was so worth it! Each piece had to be atleast a couple of inches thick and layered with CHEESE, CHEESE, CHEESE! Everything melted together perfectly...each bite was like heaven. We each only had a piece...we were totally stuffed and satisfied. If you order a day or so earlier, you can request the pizza of your choice and they will freeze it for you to take home. Between us, we brought four pizzas back and totally did not mind lugging it around the airport!!!
