My experience this time was better, but not great. We sat at the bar because we didn't want to wait 2 hours for a table. We still waited about an hour before we got bar seating. My advice would be to put your name down and tell the host that you're willing to take a seat at the bar in the restaurant. But then go to the other bar and see if anyone leaves, because you can also order food there. Otherwise you'll be having your drinks standing up in a crowded room, and getting smashed from the very strong cocktails. This advice probably only works for small parties (2 or 3). The ceviche trio was pretty good, but the drinks and the rest of the food were just OK. I just don't like the flavors that much--they were too sweet, needed more acid, or in the case of my drink, too peppery. You can save yourself $60-70 and make a few dishes out of Rick Bayless' Mexican Everyday cookbook that are simple and taste great. They sell signed copies at the restaurant.
