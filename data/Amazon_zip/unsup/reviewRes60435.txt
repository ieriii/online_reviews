Hands down my favorite restaurant!We ate there for our 2nd anniversary and the menu allowed us to be so creative. mushroom risotto, polenta with spicy rapini, sweet potato relish. two quartinos of wine (no mark up for smaller size). Two veggie pasta entrees including goat cheese ravioli with olive butter, sage and orange zest - sublime - and a ridiculous chocolate tart to top it all off.we were happily sated, and happy to pay $50 a person.Not many options for the vegetarian though.
