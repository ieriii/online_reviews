The worst, worst, worst Vietnamese restaurant I have ever been to. This restaurant with all the reviews are for foreigners and/or non-natives who has never been to a Vietnamese Restaurant before and/or have never had Vietnamese food before. The noodle soup is bland. The glasses are dirty, with water spots, oil spots. I am glad it failed inspection because it is filthy there. The service is terrible. I will never go there ever again. The restaurant is by far the worst restaurant I have ever been to, it is filthy, noodle soup is bland, and other dishes are flavored disgustingly. There are much better Vietnamese restaurants in the area. This is the worst Vietnamese restaurant in the area of Chicago, and this restaurant will definitely not survive in California. It is doing well because there's a small number of Vietnamese restaurant in Chicago, but definitely the worst I have ever been and I have been to California, and worldwide. I do not recommend this restaurant at all & it does not deserve one star. It does not deserve a star at all. The dishes, glassesware & utensils are filthy and the quality of the food is bland and terrible, a very substandard Vietnamese restaurant.
