While there is nothing like grandma's home cooking, this place comes pretty close. Whether it be 8 pm dinner, or 4 am gorging, this place has always filled my belly with satisfaction. I go for the kalbi most of the time, although the kimchi stew or teng chang stew are comfort foods for me. I love the service there because I know some of the late night staff and they are so ridiculously funny...although I have heard of some run ins with some not so nice ladies...sorry i cannot share names. But true to the BBQ, please don't wear cashmere or silk or any other nice fabric here...for it will smell forever of beef...unless that is your thing. :)   I recommend going with a big group for the experience and try to get a seat in the back rooms or the other side, where you can sit on the floor. and don't be scared of the millions of panchan that come with the food, for it is the Korean way. try a little bit of everything and all the flavors will really melt together. This definitely is not the only Korean restaurant, but it is a good one.
