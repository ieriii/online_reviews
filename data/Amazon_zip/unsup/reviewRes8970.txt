We went in with a group of people and sat down in front of the massive food fired oven and I was in heaven. We ordered four pizzas and each one got better and better. If you want to eat good pizza try to find a place that has a wood fired oven they make the best pizzas. The staff was great and knew the menu well. A must go place.
