I read about this in Food & Wine magazine and marked it on my list. Then, Neelam P. recommended it to me as well. I figured if 2 sources were telling me to go, it's legit. Funny enough I was staying walking distance to Xoco - it's a sign! OK, on to the more important part - the amazing food. SO SO SO GOOD!  I ordered the mushroom torta with goat cheese. Perfect combo of flavors- the salsa they give you on the side is yum too (and you can get a spicy one!). It wasn't crowded when we went which was a bonus, got a table to sit at no problem.  And for dessert? Churros con chocolate! Growing up in Miami and spending a lot of time in Spain(and studying there) allows me to be a churro connoisseur. The churros here are delicious! It's hard to find a good one up here. They need to franchise this place - or I should. We tried going back for breakfast on Sunday morning (churros for breakfast, duh!) but they were closed - next time I will check that ahead of time.
