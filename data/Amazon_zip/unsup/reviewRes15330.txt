I liked my Pear Martini. The drag queens in bad, matted wigs shoving people waiting at the bar trying to start fights? Not so much. The fact that Management didn't escort the troublemakers out? Even less to like. Calo Management, This is not 'Jersey Shore' Please escort out those who are trying to start fights! It does not make me want to return.
