One of the things I loved about moving to Logan Square was that I'd be closer to this gem of a place. I'm originally from Miami, and of Cuban origin so I had a lot of high expectations. I'm happy to say they were all satisfied. The black beans are great, the Cuban sandwiches are yummy, the bread pudding is yummy too. The staff is always friendly and their patio is great, as well. I love that they serve water in small jars.
