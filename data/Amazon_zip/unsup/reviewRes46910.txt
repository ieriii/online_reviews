Comfortable and spacious with enthusiastic, not overbearing, service. After an early dinner, my fianc and I moved to the bar where the live bluegrass was top notch; however, my fiance's 2nd signature "agrapolitan" tasted nothing like her 1st, as if they'd run out of a key ingredient. So, what's the major problem? Notable Chicago restaurants make unexpected combinations work; here, unexpected combinations were just odd. We both found flavors to clash, not harmonize. It's risky for a chef to venture out from the meat and potato basics. We'll come back for the music, not to risk the cuisine.
