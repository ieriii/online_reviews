Visited Glenn's early evening - 5ish. Some empty tables but got the "no reservations?" interrogation from the hostess when we walked in. Even though the place is small - she scoured the room like she really had to think about whether or not to seat us right then. Do people really make reservations for dinner at 5:00? Maybe it's just me. Anyway - nice menu with lots of choices. The crab cake appetizer was very good but for $12.00 for 2 small/medium cakes? The brushetta was also good. Our party of 3 had the scallops which were excellent - perfectly cooked and seasoned, the burger which was also excellent, and the Cobb (they call it Dobb) salad which was sizeable (lots to take home). For 3 people - no drinks our total was $89.00. Pretty pricey considering one entree was a burger and one was a salad. Great food but not priced for frequent dining.
