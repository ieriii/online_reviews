I am usually pretty ok with crap service, and in the end it's the food that matters the most for me, but the other night when I went to Sultan's (and it was not my first time) I am pretty ruined by the "I don't really care that you are a customer" attitude of almost every person working there. I am sorry that I dared to interrupt your conversation to pay for my meal, cash register man and I am so darn sorry to ask for you to serve me food, chef type person. Even the bus boy seemed pissed off that I dared to get in his way to get to the salad bar while he emptied garbage and after many visits to this place the attitudes are starting to make me super turned off. The food here is ok, bordering on great. It can be hit or miss or should I say, a mess. Sometimes I am super excited to eat it and sometimes I wonder if I am eating yesterdays or last weeks leftovers at the salad bar. Also, perhaps some new labels for the salad bar are in order? The peeling white tape with barely legible writing is fine for those of us who have been here before but when I bring a new person here, it is almost embarrassing. I almost want to say, "I swear this food won't give you worms." Sultan's Market, you are not the Weiner Circle, so your piss poor attitudes aren't comical or an attraction, they are a detraction and not worth the ATM fee at this point.
