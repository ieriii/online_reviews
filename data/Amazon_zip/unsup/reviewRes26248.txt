My fianc and I decided to celebrate our engagement here. Unfortunately if we had to do it over again we'd probably have went somewhere else. This is not an indictment of the service and the hospitality there, not at all, everyone there was great. The hostess, bartender, and our waiter were all very welcoming and attended to all of our needs, and I could tell the manager himself felt honored that we chose Gejas to celebrate our engagement. The reason I didn't rate Geja's any higher is because I just didn't enjoy the food there. The cheese to me was too pungent, and as a first time fondue goer, it became a little too much. The second course included surf and turf and my fianc and I started feeling queezy because of all the oil that we cooked our food in, it was just a little too much. By the time the chocolate came by, our stomachs were too unsettled to be able to enjoy it, and it was a shame because from the little bit we had it was really good. My suggestion would be to skip any type of meat and stick with the cheese or chocolate.
