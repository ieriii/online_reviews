I was there recently with a group friends and children. One of the kids is a new born and the other 2 yrs. So the fact that they put the 2yr old on the end of the table with her back to the next table not so good. She was reaching for things from the other table and the people didn't seem to mind, actually the guy was interacting with her more than the woman he was with so I felt bad for her. We would have moved the high chair but with the space given no adult was fitting there. The food was wonderful as always. Love the Salad bar! The Hard cider was so good I could have drank it all night, but I had to drive. Our server was very friendly and understandable with the needs of Children. However I do not remember her name.:(
