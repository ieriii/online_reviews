I like this place because it feels like a vacation. It's cool how you walk into the kitchen and the seating is in the back (or outside). It's not the typical layout of an American restaurant. The flavors aren't groundbreaking, but they have wholesome, fresh food of good quality, and the price is right. The hearts of palm salad isn't over-dressed, and the cabbage is shredded finer than angel hair. I had a few bites of chicken soup that brought me back to childhood, and my companion's steak was satisfactory. The oatmeal shake is not a big deal. It's pretty much exactly what one would expect. Kind of rice-pudding flavor, but oatmeal. Maybe suitable for breakfast, but as a dessert too....oatmealish...and along with a meal, again, too oatmealish. I wouldn't waste the stomach space again.
