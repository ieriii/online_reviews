I loved this place so much, that I went there twice in one day! HA... just coincidence really. But my friend was performing here and so my boyfriend and I went to check out the food. Unfortunately she was late and we had another performance to attend at a nearby theater. After we saw the show we came back for more martinis! We ended up drinking them out of vermouth so in the interum of them getting more they gave us this crazy liqueur on the house. In all the madness that ensued, my boyfriend and I had delectable food with incredible mood lighting and FLAMING CHEESE! There's a free spirit and warmth to this place that makes everything incredibly tasty, fresh and the owner is by far one of my favorites in the city. Here's that yelp review I promised you almost a year ago! 5 stars for a restaurant that thrives on service and deliciousness.
