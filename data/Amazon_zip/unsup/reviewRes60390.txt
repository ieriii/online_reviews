I had the worst service experience of my life here. My friend complained because it took almost an hour for them to make our pizza. I understand that these pizzas take a while to cook and a long wait is the norm, so I wasn't going to make a big deal about it, but it mattered to my friend. The manager reacted in the most immature, angry way, to the point of being verbally abusive. My friend continued to firmly but politely push his point. The manager was throwing around curse words, getting in my friend's face and all but hitting him. It was totally unexpected and kind of scary. Then the manager ripped the pizza out of my friend's hands and charged his card back and yelled 'THERE, now you can go wait somewhere else for your meal!!'. He continued to verbally abuse us as we walked out in a stunned silence.I reported him to the corporate office the next day, but they never got back to me. After repeated phone calls and emails I finally reported them to the Better Business Bureau. I called other branches and one of the guys I talked to said it was a known problem at this branch, but the manager is related to one of the higher-ups in corporate and nothing is ever done about it.It reminded me of another experience I witnessed a couple weeks earlier, when the manager had been berating one of the workers in the kitchen, loudly and angrily. It was awful to be around, but it wasn't directed at me so I didn't take action.This was the worst service experience of my life, and I certainly will never go back. The fact that they keep a manager with known anger management problems in his position and ignore the complaints of the customers he harasses says a lot about them as an organization. Steer clear!
