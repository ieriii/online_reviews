I think I am becoming a connoisseur of Churrascarias. I only wish they were like in Brazil, but what we have in the states is pretty good. If you like meat, this is where to go. Lots of choices and lots of meat. To make the experience perfect, fast all day before you go and be prepared to overeat! I like Fogo de Chao because it is more elegant and upper class than the others I have gone to. The meat is good, it could have been a little juicier, but some cuts were fantastic. At churrascarias, different servers continually come by with different cuts of meat until you tell them to stop. A meatlover's dream!
