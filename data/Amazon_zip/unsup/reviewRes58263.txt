I watched you at MU, beating Kentucky, in the Final 4 vs. Kansas, watched as you became a world beater in Miami, wishing you were a Bull, rooting FOR you in '06 vs Dallas, and, until this year, still proud to state all of the above again and again, to anyone who would listen. In the span of a short NBA season, you have become a whiner, an instigator, a primadonna, and co-conspirator of a group of individuals playing a team sport (no, isolations and a pass don't make a team). Woe is me...the Heat are losing and this is what the world wants. Coughing and teasing Dirk on camera when the series is far from over. You let LeMoron get to you and brought you down. You won't care at all about a diatrabe like this from one of your previously biggest fans, and even 12 months ago, I think you would at least think about it. On to 90 Miles...I'm a loyal fan and will be for a long time (unless they make any Decisions soon...staff: don't take your talents to Armitage). Yes the coffee is great, the lechon rocks, maduros, steak, etc; it's been said time and time again. The staff, however, makes this place. In the busiest times, you are human like the rest of us reviewers, but you are quick to remedy. In normal times, the staff is quick for a chat and a smile. In addition, the cooks in the back at Clybourn serve big portions and prove time and time again they are better than their counterparts on Armitage. So here is to you, 90 Miles Clybourn. Keep doing what you do.And to the DB with the Miami hat: even your questionable loyalty to a team only Miami can root for, cannot hide the fact that you are as considerate and cool as the rest of the staff there.
