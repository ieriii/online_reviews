Been here at least half dozen times, of all those times, twice were absolutely wonderful 5 star worthy and rest were an absolute nightmare, so it averages to a 3. Start with good- late summer night, small group, relatively empty restaurants, attentive wait staff, CHEAP wine, decent beer selection and oh so so many yummy delicious stuff to choose from! I am a huge fan of the beet salads(I always order it to make me feel less guilty), pork shoulder (when I am in the mood), skirt steak (so worth it). Then there is the bad- as much as I love this place, it is just overhyped. crowded and damn uncomfortable sometimes when it's filled. The communal table is uncomfortable and I always feel like I will knock someone's table over. I get it, the communal concept is "in" (not really anymore), but seriously, communal table, tight space AND high table is NOT a good mix. getting in and out of the table is always a struggle (that's my problem, I know, I am short at 5'4'', but still, shouldn't they take short customers into consideration?). There's something off about the acoustic of this place and it's always impossible to hear each other when you are inside. The hostess always seen overwhelmed because they don't take reservation and there is always a 2 hours wait and the hostess stand is positioned in such an awkward corner. I get irritated just thinking about it. All in all, I feel like I'll always having a good experience coming here as long as I eat out at the patio and not actually step inside....The food is definitely above average but they really should consider hiring a new interior design team.  Oh and the bone marrow? fatty, no favor, they never give you enough toasts to go with it....being Asian, I love bone marrow, but why spend money to suck on flavorless fat? I guess I just don't get it.
