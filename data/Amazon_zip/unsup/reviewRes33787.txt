Had Yelped existed five years ago (did it?), and I was reviewing Sultan's then....they'd probably get 4-5 stars. Now, I think they should thank me for three. Pros: It's cheap, quick, and most of the time, the food is pretty good. Oh, and the salad bar --- delicious selection and yummy miso ginger dressing. Spicy Falafel is yummers. And the lentil soup can soothe the tummy. Cons: Some of the guys that work here are jerkstores. Not that I care that much, but when the jerkstore makes your fallafal infused with his jerkstore style, I suffer with a drippy, sloppy, half-ass concoction. That said, even their bad falafels are better than any others I've had in the city. Salad bar made the pro list, but be warned: selectivity is key. Lots of time the greens are too wet or icky...and some of their ingredients look like they've been sitting out for days, untouched. Floors need to be scrubbed really bad. And sometimes this place is overcrowded with hipsters and wanna-be hipsters. Cash only, don't forget, but they do have an ATM inside.
