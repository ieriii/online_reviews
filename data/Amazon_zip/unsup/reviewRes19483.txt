I walk by this restaurant everyday on my home and it always looks closed because it is so dark from the outside. Once you get in the inside its just as dark. Apps 1. Sear Sesame Scallops: they were okay when you ate them with the salad 2. Spicy Miso Soup: wasn't spicy Maki's: didn't taste fresh and the presentation was sub par. They sprinkled tempura flakes over all the rolls so it was difficult to determine which roll was what.  All the rolls below except for the Coast Crab roll tasted very similar. 1. Volcano Roll 2. Spicy Tuna Crunch 3. Spicy Salmon 4. Coast Roll I can't say I enjoyed anything. It was strange to see 10 sushi chefs on staff when there were only 2 tables being served. Also, it was awkward when my wife and I were attempting to flag someone down for our check and everyone who wasn't are waitress ignores us. Everyone continued to clean and didn't even bother to grab our waitress.
