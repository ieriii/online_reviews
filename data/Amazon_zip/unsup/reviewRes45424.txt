Wilde - Fireplaces, dark wood, dimly lit, good beer, comfort food. Appetizer: artichoke cheddar dip - very tasty, smokey and slightly spicy. 4/5 Entrees: Shepard's Pie - classic, generic (and that's not necessarily a bad thing in this case, it was just what one expects when you order a shepard's pie. wasn't anything extraordinary about it) 4/5 Mac & Cheese - very fancy, rich and tasty (caramelized onions, irish bacon, garlic crumbs) 5/5 We will be going back! Nice to have a place like this in the neighborhood. Impressive yet comforting place to take friends and family to.
