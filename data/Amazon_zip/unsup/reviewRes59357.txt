I go to Fox & Obel on a regular basis because it's right across the street from where I work. Whenever I get my lunch from the cafe, I can always depend on Juanita to make sure all is well. If something is just not perfect, she's there to make me happy again. Hats off to the excellent service she always provides.DKW.
