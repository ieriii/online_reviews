Here's the thing, I had just tried Graham Elliot the week prior and everything after Graham Elliot ends up being just a-ok. None the less it was good, but not spectacular. I went during restaurant week with my boyfriend, it was a nice prefix menu lots of tasty fish dishes, decent use of coconut milk, I had a smoked trout steamed inside a banana leaf with rice noodles roasted peppers and a creamy sauce on the side, this was the only course I remember, good thing or bad thing? Not sure. Definitely was more Vietnamese than French in my opinion. Pretty decent wine list, check it out if you're curious, hopefully it'll blow your socks off.
