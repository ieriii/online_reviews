I'm going to preface this by saying that we did a 5 course meal in the private back-room which included a private talk and Q&A session with Graham himself. Our group got a great rate. Overall, Graham was the highlight of the night -- really likable, obviously very smart and with a lot of interesting opinions, great fashion sense (white Prada eyeglasses!), and gracious enough to allow us to take a photo with him. With that in mind, it was a fun experience and well worth what we paid. However, without the group rate and Graham, I would give my overall experience a 3-star rating. The food was pretty good -- the two courses that I enjoyed were the Caesar salad/Twinkie and a soup. The proteins (fish, meat) weren't as flavorful as I would have liked; however, they were beautifully plated. I think I would have appreciated the big hits to be their main entrees vs. first/second courses, but to be fair the beginning courses were very flavorful, very unique, and tasted great. Portions were small, but perfect for me considering we had five main dishes in addition to amuse bouches and drinks. Service was mixed -- took awhile to get my drink. Overall, I would recommend checking this place out if you've got some money to spend; but there are other places that offer better food at the same (or lower) prices.
