It's weird that this place is marketed as a southern restaurant. This is what a southern mother who hated her children would cook. It's boring food - overpriced - and some of the food is inappropriately spiced or not spiced at all. Our service was not great. We had to call the waitress over for drinks and for our check. Although I live in the neighborhood, I won't be back. You bore me Wishbone. Food shouldn't be boring.
