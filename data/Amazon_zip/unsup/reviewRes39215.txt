Went here for breakfast on a gorgeous Wednesday morning. Dined outside. The skinny: Food-breakfast, sunny side duck egg hash with duck confit, spring onions, yukon gold potatoes, black truffle vinegarette. Fried chicken & waffles with pork belly hash & sweet potatoes. Service- friendly, helpful and attentive Decor- simple, understated, resembled a renovated old irish pub. Outdoor seating was pleasant and ideal for people watching. Ambiance- relaxed and confortable. Neighborhood feel. Return visit- absolutely! for brunch, and look forward to experiencing the dinner menu!
