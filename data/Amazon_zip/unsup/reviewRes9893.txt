This places is great. Nice ambiance. Delicious, authentic, thick balsamic dipping sauce for bread (we ended up buying a bottle of it). The food was delicious, and the service was impeccable considering we were the youngest people there by 10 years at least and we could have easily been overlooked. We were here to celebrate valentine's day, and it was a very romantic spot. Huge wine list. I'm sure you could find anything you want (it's not too overwhelming if you are like me and strategically buy the second cheapest bottle of red wine they have). I hear the outside patio is where it's at, but it was February, so I couldn't verify.
