Before I write this, I should probably mention that I tend to think all martinis taste like window cleaner, and I'm more of a laid back brew pub guy. I don't go for velvet ropes or frou frou BS. So take this with a grain of salt. As a consequence, it sorta ruffled my feathers from the get-go that I had to wait in a little curtained foyer to even enter the damn place. I don't understand how they determine who comes in when, but I was meeting people (who thankfully had left already) which seems to only conditionally carry weight as to the speed of your entry. It's dark as hell in here, lit primarily by candles. I can see it as a good date place, but I go out to let loose and not have to act like I am meeting my in-laws on thanksgiving....this place is ALL about putting on airs. Definitely going for an upscale lounge atmosphere, which it pulls off well enough. The freakin' drinks are crazy expensive...like 10 dollars and up.  I guess it's ok if you're trying to impress a date, but I got the hell out of there post haste and went to Innertown, which is more my speed. I should've known better. Overall, this is great if you're one of those martini lovin' types who likes sort of an air of exclusivity, but if you are a beer n' rock lovin' guy like myself I would stay away from here.
