If you're one that's not for a place that's big and loud enough where you can barely maintain a conversation with someone in your party, then you're not gonna like this place.  Inside was large, very colorful and the majority of people seemed dressy in a casual way. I thought $19.50 for something basic like shoulder pork (which was pulled pork) with fried plantains and rice & beans was rather high, considering the average-sized portion and that its pretty much a Puerto Rican working man's dish. It was good but, not $19.50 good. They accidentally overcharged us $100 worth of drinks that we didn't order, which ended up being from a nearby table, was one BIG error that they made and thankfully we spotted in time and they were apologetic and professional about, even though it kind of left a bad taste on your mouth. Bill was in the neighborhood of $650 for 14, including 4 alcoholic drinks and with 6-7 appetizer plates. There's better places to splurge your mad money on.
