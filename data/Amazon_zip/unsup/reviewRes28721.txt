Pequod's has the sickest lunch special in all the land - for $5 you can get a personal pan pizza and a drink (soda or beer). These personal pan pizzas have a divine and addictive caramelized crust - crispy and a little burnt, and so damn good you'll crave it for weeks. It is really a good thing I left the contract job I had down the street, because otherwise my health would be in serious jeopardy from daily pizza consumption. The Pequod's lunch special is a sometimes food.
