I've been here three times because a friend always drags me here before shows at the Empty Bottle. I never liked it but the last time I said fuck this place, never going again. I am a lifelong metalhead but this place is like a kitschy tourist trap and I hated every moment of being in here.  This place is so incredibly dumb. The concept is stupid, it looks like Hot Topic on the inside, the service is poor, and beer is so fucking overpriced I could hardly beleive it. I've drank at thousands of bars across the country and I've never seen a pint of Lagunitas Czech Pils (a beer I drink all the time) cost so much in my entire life. I make pretty good money but there is no way in hell I am paying $6 for a pint of Pils. Way too much. I read another review with someone saying that beer prices here are good. Yeah, maybe compared to American Airlines! I finally convinced my friend to leave and we went across the street to the Empty Bottle and drank just-as-good beer WAY cheaper, with much better service in a much better atmosphere.  My advice: Eat at Bite Cafe instead, drink at Empty Bottle instead (the small cover charge will not even matter because of all the money you'll save from not getting ripped off at Lockdown)... both are directly across the street and you will have a way better time.  Like a lot of other people said though, if you're a bro then this might be your thing.  Just another trendy, expensive Chicago trainwreck.
