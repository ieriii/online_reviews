I LOVE your yogurt and granola. Delish. Sooooo crunchy and refreshing. Nicely sweet. Generous portion. Love it love it love it.  The hubs usually gets the breakfast sandwich, bacon eggs and cheese. It's so easy to please him. But he enjoys it too, especially with the homemade chips.  Can't wait to go back and try the lunch stuff and one of the specialty "french toasts or pancakes of the day"
