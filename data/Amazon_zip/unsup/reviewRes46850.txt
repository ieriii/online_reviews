I am torn between 3 and 4 stars for this place. Not that I don't think this place deserves 4 stars but it always bugs me when restaurants can't quite deliver on their lofty promises. I do think that this location is way better than its Wrigleyville counterpart.  We started with beers since we were outside and it was sweltering. You would think that a place offering craft drink and food could offer something other than Sophie, 312 and Daisy Cutter. I suppose you can give them props for supporting the locals but it left me wondering if these were really the best craft beers they could find or if the waiter was "dumbing down" the beer list for me. I have really enjoyed some of their cocktails in the past but did not partake on this particular visit.  We had the mussels which I enjoyed but my husband insisted that the tomato 'fondue' tasted like ketchup. We then had the sockeye salmon and the grilled farm steak. Both were a bit underwhelming. The salmon itself was tasty but came in their Green Goddess Dressing which was reminiscent of a plate full of tartar sauce. The steak according to the hubs was a little dry but good, the plate visually was not that appealing for me so I passed on a taste.  Overall, I do like this restaurant. The atmosphere is good. I think they change the menu relatively frequently so maybe next time they'll earn another star.
