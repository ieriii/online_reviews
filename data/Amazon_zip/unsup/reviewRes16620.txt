I went with my boyfriend and another couple to this restaurant and had a FANTASTIC TIME. It's a bit pricey for us 23-year olds (3 of whom are medical students and thus don't have any source of income) but we found that by sharing guacamole, 3 ceviches, 2 entrees, and one dessert we were full and happy! It came out to be about $40 a person with alcohol, which isn't bad considering we ordered the Churrasca for one of our entrees - it runs at $38 a pop.  The ceviches were incredible! My braised short rib was out of this world. I am still dreaming about it. I will certainly go here again!
