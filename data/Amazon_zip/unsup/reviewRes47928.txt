My husband and I were looking for a unique venue to host our small wedding this past fall. We definitely wanted to keep our wedding in Chicago and wanted to stay as far away from a cheesy banquet hall as possible. We had visited a lot of alternative venues with the hope of finding as unique a location as possible, all without breaking the bank. Since our wedding was going to include approximately 50 people, we found it difficult to find a location which worked for that size group perfectly. Enter Zed451!! Zed had exactly what we were looking for: unique decor, great food, fantastic location. To top it off, the concept of having our guests enjoy so much variety as opposed to the standard chicken or fish fare served at most weddings was an incredible treat!  Little did we know that as we began to put the details of our wedding reception together, Zed would exceed every expectation we had. First, the staff is a joy to work with. Gina was the event coordinator we worked with and she was a joy. We felt completely at ease and knew that no detail of our reception would be left to chance. Everyone who works there seems to genuinely enjoy what they do. We received some of the friendliest and most attentive service we've received anywhere. Jamie worked with us on the day of and I can't say enough wonderful things about him. Second, the food....fantastic!!! We loved having the interactive variety. There was something to satisfy every palate and our guests really enjoyed the concept. No one went home hungry. Thank you to everyone at Zed for making our wedding so memorable! We will certainly be back for our anniversary dinner!
