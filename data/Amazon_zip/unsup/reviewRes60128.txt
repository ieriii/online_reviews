Bummer Trip - I've been to Pho Xe Tang probably 10 times since I moved to Chicago 10 years ago. Tonight though was a bad experience to say the least. It started out great because my companion was very knowledgeable about asian food and I was learning new ways to enjoy it.Then my friend removed something from his Pho bowl and put it in a napkin and waved the waiter over. It was a cockroach.The waiter took the roach and the bowl away and said he would get a fresh bowl for my friend. My friend had lost his appetite and refused another. The waiter returned to say that we would not have to pay for that bowl of pho. No real effort was made to express concern or an apology.I could not finish my own bowl of pho, or even the spring roll that had been so delicious a few minutes earlier.We asked for our check and I was very surprised to see that we had been charged, as the waiter promised, for everything except the roach tainted bowl of pho.We guessed that the waiter did not even call the incident to the attention of his manager. Hopefully this review will find it's way to someone at Pho Xe Tang who cares about their customers.
