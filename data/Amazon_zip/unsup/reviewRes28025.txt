My friends constantly rave about Frontera, but I just don't get it. I've given it 3 tries, and each time, it's the same. Maybe my palate is just too boring for Rick Bayless' style of Mexican food. The rice is always dry and bland (note to the rice: just because you come out in a pyramid shape doesn't mean you're tasty)... and $18 for some tiny tacos does not a happy Karen make. Basically... the guacamole is the only thing keeping this review above 2 stars. That stuff is pretty freaking delicious, but you should get more for what you are paying. Also, I do appreciate that Rick uses mostly organic and really fresh foods. The drinks are really good (although $$$$), the food is OK, the wait is horrendous, and be prepared to leave your first born behind as payment. I've got a stash of cheaper, friendlier, less-wait-time Mexican places that I'd pick over Frontera any day.
