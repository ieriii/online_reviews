not a hotel. it appears to be run by monkeys! the value proposition sucks.suites??? no they're not. they're oversized Motel rooms. that's all. :/when i got to my room, or should I say, massively oversized empty useless and badly decorated "space", the first thing that came to mind was only a really scrubby family would need 3 sinks! (one sink in the bathroom, one next to the "kitchennette" and one in the bedroom). they really think that their guests are bad at personal hygiene, huh? Even though his was supposed to be a "suite", the mini-bar was empty! when i called, the rude and unapologetic response of the "night manager" (doug) was: "no we don't run mini-bars, not even in suites." ... LAME ... on a business trip, i can't have nuts, water, beer nor wine or spirits when I most need this comfort? .... service at the Embassy Suites is worse than at American Airlines!! omfgThey didn't even have wi-fi included in a $500 "suite" / night ... so I called again, only to find an even more unhelpful attitude from the front desk staff. LAME ... once I frustratingly tried to pay and connect by myself, I had to go and sit through a 5min technical call to get the wi-fi connected. plus, the curtains don't even shut properly, the bathrooms are tiny, the carpets are ugly and the phones are obsolete models. .. . BER LAME please boycott this hotel chain - oversized crap at overpriced rates with a topping of arrogant, unfriendly staff. un abrazo
