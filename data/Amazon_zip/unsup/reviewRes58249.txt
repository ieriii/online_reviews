I'm about to serve up a little more whine than cheese on this review. The name of this place should be The PRICEY Purple Pig! I am a HUGE wine connoisseur and I was incredibly unimpressed with this place. I finally went on a late Sunday afternoon in early March on a date after wanting to go to this place since I moved here. When my date and I walked in, we were seated with a large group of people we didn't know which was a little awkward, but I thought Oh well, it's a wine bar...it should be fine. Anyway, the waiter asked what we'd like to drink. I was in the mood for a red wine, and my date didn't have a preference, so we went for one of the more moderately priced wines. We were perplexed on what type of cheeses to get, so I asked the waiter for some suggestions on what to order that what compliment the wine. He gave us some suggestions, and naturally him being the expert, we took them. He brought us the plate and both my date and I did not like a single one of them!! It was obvious we didn't care for them because we pretty much left the entire cutting board of cheeses untouched. The waiter never asked any questions, or if everything was OK , nada! But he did ask if we wanted anything else? Well of course we do, we're still hungry!!! So, we chose the meats (ourselves this time!) and ordered a meat tray, olives and a few breads, They were OK, nothing to rave about,especially for the price. I'm not exaggerating, but there was hardly enough meat on the cutting board to make a small sandwich. By this time, we were both disgusted and unimpressed with everything, so we asked for the check and then left. I felt so bad for my date, and he felt awful too. Poor guy kept apologizing, when I chose the place! Thankfully, we went to and had a delicious meal, dessert and wine somewhere else for less than $85 dollars. I'm sorry, but I should never walk into a restaurant pay $105.00 tab and still be hungry...or tipsy for that matter. Tragic.
