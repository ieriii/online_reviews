Tasty tasty duck. The only personal gripe I had against the duck was that they don't provide scallions/onion with the duck. They give you some cucumber, cabbage and carrots if I remember correctly. I just love my duck with scallions please! Isn't that Beijing style? We had the duck (peking duck, fried rice then transformed to a soup) and oysters. I think it goes without saying it was exceptional. Yes, this place gets very busy and one of my friends wondered if they should hire more waiters... I knocked this place down a star for the service. It's hard to flag someone down for more bread. We kept telling each server we saw that we needed more. Then much later we got two from different servers. I think this is frowned upon because the manager came to us and said not to do that - just let your one server know. Well, I'm glad we told more than one because we didn't have to wait to long for more.
