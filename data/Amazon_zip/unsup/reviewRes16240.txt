This is one of a few places doing really high end cocktais in Chicago. Probably its greatest strength and its greatest fault at the same time is that they refuse to compromise- all cocktails are of the highest quality, made with the highest quality ingredients designed to match the flavor profile of that particular cocktail. I've heard of people getting upset that they can't get a heinekin or a bud light or a hennesy here. Sorry, this isn't that kind of bar. This is a true cocktail bar dedicated to the art of crafting cocktails and they do that extremely well. The bar staff is always professional, pleasant, and smart. The drinks can take some time to create, but that's the nature of a high quality cocktail.  Just a note, the best way to experience this place is on a Sunday through Wednesday, not on the weekends when the kiddies come out to play in Wicker Park.
