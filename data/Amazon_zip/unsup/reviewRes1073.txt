My first visit to Hot Doug's and it did not disappoint. Waited about 20-30 minutes which seems to be pretty good when compared to other reviewers experiences. My nephew had an Uber sausage with Havarti cheese and I had a pecan roasted jalapeno flavored pork and chicken sausage. Both were very good. The chipotle sauce on mine was just right and the spiciness was hot, yet mild enough to enjoy the flavor and taste of the sausage. Next time I go, I'll likely order the small order of fries - one large order would have been fine for both of us. Friendly staff and the order took less than five minutes to make and serve. Thumbs up!
