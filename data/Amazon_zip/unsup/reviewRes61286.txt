Combine great food, affordability, tremendous energy and you have the recipe for a terrific night out. I had the Portobello Mushroom for an appetizer, the Snapper Filet for an entree and the Key Lime Pie for dessert -- each was a winner. Our server was Raul and he could not have been more professional -- friendly but not over-bearing. The energy in this place is incomparable -- not haughty, but casual, friendly and dynamic!. We left at 10:15 last evening and people were still lining up for tables! A repeat visit is definite.  (It is BYOB as well)
