I went here for valentines day with my gf and we had a great time. The most memorable tapas were the cheese w/hazelnut chocolate, the rabbit ravioli and the grilled shrimp. If I went back I would get more of the grilled items. The decor is unique. Only downside would be that it is a bit pricey but I think it is worth it on a special occasion or if someone is visiting from out of town since it is right near the park
