My family has been coming to Calo's for years. It used to be just for the pizza, but after more and more visits, we expanded our horizons and went on to things such as the ribs. The atmosphere here is always friendly and the service is great! I dont think I have ever tasted anything from here that I didnt like. If you are in the area and want a decent slice of pizza or some really good ribs, stop in - it is worth it. There usually isnt a wait. I would go three and a half starts, but that isnt do-able.
