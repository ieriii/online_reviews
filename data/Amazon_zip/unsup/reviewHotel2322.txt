This place was ranking high on my favorite full-service Marriott's until the last evening....get this, they don't turn the heat on until it's in the 40s outside. Chicago, rainy, cold, windy, whatever...and 53 degrees at 5PM and I get told they won't be turning the heat on for the evening, and that they suggest to turn off all "heat" buttons on our in room fan because that will just blow cold air. Would you ever think to ask if a hotel had heat?? I wouldn't, and have certainly stayed in some less than desirable places.  Yes, this is a good location, and yes the free bar/lobby/2nd floor wi-fi is great, and the bar area is fantastic (lined with granite and marble, also chilly when the temperature drops) but when it's cold, nothing else matters. Comment from the manager- "Call me and I'll bring you some hot tea and blankets when you're ready to go sleep. A discount on the room won't make it any warmer." Apparently, the heat was eventually turned on, but this is an old location, so we never noticed the difference. Seems as though Chicago buildings need a minor revamp (and I bet they had heat at the Ritz).
