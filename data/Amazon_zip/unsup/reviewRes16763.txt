My absolute favorite bar in Chicago, introduced to me by one of my besties. I love that they have rules. Love that it's not a place to go get wasted. Love the high-backed chairs. Love the incredibly knowledgeable bartenders and waitstaff. Love that the bartenders have meetings where they're required to bring a new drink recipe and these recipes are voted on to see if they meet the Violet Hour standards. The first time we went, we waited in line for... an hr? Maybe? Ended up being seated at the bar, where we were enthralled by our amazing bartender, Kyle. I left completely enchanted. As in... I couldn't stop gushing abt it for days. And the drinks? Absolute heaven. This bar is at the top of my list for reasons why I would move to Chicago in a heartbeat (the other being Maxwell's).
