I love this place. I am a pizza lover and do not discriminate between deep dish, thin crust, pan... Luckily no matter which type i'm craving, Art-of never lets me down. Friendly service and feels family-run. Carry-out can take a while, averaging 45min even if they say it will be less but even dine-in is kinda fun. It has a food court feel but is BYOB!
