Eh, I could take it or leave it. The menu is pretty simple, yet the food is not consistent or anything special. There are definitely a lot of other better brunch spots, but if you're in the neighborhood and want something quick, it's a safe bet. I do like the bright ambiance and the patio seating of this cafe, but the ordering process has a tendency to be a nightmare.
