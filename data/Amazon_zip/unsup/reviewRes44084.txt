While visiting in Chicago, my husband and I thought it was only appropriate to try a steakhouse. Unfortunately, we were somewhat underwhelmed by our experience. We both started with chopped salads, which were okay, but standard mixed greens with a few veggies. For our entrees, I had the filet encrusted with blue cheese, served with a cabernet demi glaze, and my husband had a peppercorn strip steak with the demi glaze. For a steakhouse, we both expected our steaks to be cooked perfectly, but my medium turned out medium well to well, and his medium rare came out medium. I would definitely recommend ordering 1 temperature down from what you like. The steak, along with the demi glaze wasn't very flavorful. It was good, but nothing exceptional. We also had bacon scallion smashed potatoes which were very good, but we didn't go there for potatoes. We finished off our dining experience with the chocolate terrine, which was a layer of chocolate chiffon and chocolate mousse, covered in chocolate ganache. Again, it was good, but nothing exceptional.
