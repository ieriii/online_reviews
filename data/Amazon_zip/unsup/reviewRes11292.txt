Only giving it 3 stars since I haven't dined here yet, but I do plan to. I must say that I love the Dark & Curvy Piece beer (can't spell the German name of it lol)!!! $7 for a 22oz of excellent beer! I'd like to get a jug of it to-go next time, which they have for $16. Came in later Sat night, around 11pm, & the place was still decently packed. Nice setup, & nice privacy in the bathroom stalls I might add. lol Our waitress wasn't mean or anything, but she didn't seem too friendly. Maybe she was having a bad day, who knows. So right now I'm hesitant on what to say about the service. Actually came for the live band karaoke & do plan on coming back for that as well. Maybe I'll have more of a review to write after that, but all in all, 1st impression was good!
