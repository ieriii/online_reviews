As a Filipino yuppie w/o a car, I'm psyched to have homey treats just around the corner from my office in River North. It's a bit pricey, but they have "Industry Night" on Sundays in which your business card gets you 50% off of everything except the main entree section, grill section, and the lobster roll. At dinner, my friend had the white tea mojito, which was super refreshing, and I went gaga for the Filipino San Miguel beer, for which they adorably gave me a tiny third world bar glass. Lumpia (misspelled on the menu for cuteness?), Pancit Canton (love canton noodles best , even house parties tend to favor the stringy vermicelli), braised pork belly in Adobo sauce that was so tender it could be torn apart by a gentle tug of the fork- mmmmmmmm. It's about the same menu for lunch but with smaller portions.The decor has that dark, heavy Southeast Asian aesthetic while minimizing the mass-produced PF Chang's look. Props to the chef for capturing the saucy fattiness of island cooking, yet not making you feel cheated about the lower fat and salt content :-)
