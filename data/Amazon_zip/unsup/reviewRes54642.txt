My wife and I were in town for vacation and wanted to try somewhere nice and we weren't disappointed. Service was excellent. We both started with the lobster bisque which was good but could of had a little more lobster in it. Just being a little nit picky though. I had the swordfish, it was cooked perfectly. Very flavorful and juicy. My wife had the seafood platter which consisted of scallops, garlic shrimp and a crab cake. All were great. As a side I would definitely recommend the au gratin potatoes. The portion is big enough for 2. We finished of the meal with desserts of Key Lime Pie and a cobbler with ice cream. All very good. Anyone staying in Chicago should go to Shaw's
