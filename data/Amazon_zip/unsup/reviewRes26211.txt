Pequod's, you've done it again! My friend Amanda and I grabbed 12 of our friends last night for a birthday dinner. We originally had a reservation for 10 but with some late additions we were hoping they could accommodate. Because of the large size of our party they moved us to the upstairs of the restaurant which had a few other large parties. The other parties of about 10-12 people ordered 3 large pizzas and people nibbled on them. Our group of fatties ordered 6 pizzas; some ordered their own 10" pizzas, and some groups of 2 split larges. I'm sure the waitress thought we were nuts but I kept confirming that we only ordered this much just so we could have leftovers ;) Even though she had to maneuver in many ways to get the pizzas on our tables and serve us each individually our first slice, she did it and gracefully.  Everyone left full and happy and thoroughly enjoyed the food. Thanks to the staff for making our friend birthday dinner a big hit!
