Yolk or "Cough, Cough, Yikes" "Oh, don't you make it my dyin', dyin', dyin'...cough " - final words of 'In My Time of Dying' by Led Zeppelin I've had this strange issue lately. Whether it's going out to a restaurant or sitting in class some strange phenomena leads me to sit next to That Coughing Guy who looks something like this: (http://tiny.cc/this935) You know the type, that dude who's incessant coughing builds up throughout the time you're sitting there. It's so constant. It's like the never-ending story of coughs. The type that people around the classroom look up and around at. My classmates, they feel my pain, I'm just the guy who was unfortunately placed next door trying to avoid the plague. Oh, here comes my food. Maybe he'll stop coughing while I eat. Wishful thinking. My plate: Awfully hard sausage I attempt to bite into vehemently disappointed. French toast that may as well be called fried bread. Almost as bad as the bastardization they call 'french toast' I used to get as a tyke in London until I couldn't take it anymore. The eggs consisted of a sort of conglomeration of mush opposed to the scrambled fluffiness I prefer of my scrambled eggs. I wanted a great breakfast at Yolk before I hooped on a jet plane 2,00 light years to 'home' but you can't always get what you want. At least my waitress was sweet as sugar. I still had to give a little something special tip wise because the food did come out particularly quick considering the amount of people there and the service was undoubtedly stellar. Most likely what makes yolk so popular. Admittedly, with such an expansive menu its hard to completely judge this place on one go-around. I have no qualms...
