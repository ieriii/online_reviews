The worst thing about writing this review is that I had to give it one star or I couldn't post it! I had to write in as I can't believe anyone thinks this food is good. Being Mexican I know what amazing Mexican food is and the food at Nuevo Leon is disgusting. My boyfriend and I took one look at what we ordered, had one bite and left, as it was inedible. I don't have enough words to let everyone know what a horrific experience eating that one bite was, I advise you to avoid this place at all costs. Spend a little more and get good Mexican food at an array of other restaurants.
