I do eat meat, but I prefer a mostly vegetarian diet. I had been a vegetarian for nearly 10 years and I remember going to the Chicago Diner and thinking, "This is it! This is the best thing ever!" All of a sudden foods I missed like sausage and chicken were almost available to me! And at the time it was great...but then I started to get smart about what food to put in my body. A friend suggested we go there for brunch a couple of weekends ago and as you can see by the 2-star review, I dunno, it just seemed "meh" The sauces were waaay to salty, everything on the menu was in quotations, "sausage" "chicken" "steak"  I ordered the biscuits and gravy - the biscuits were good, but the sauce was luke-warm and super salty and the "sausage" was cold. I would just prefer a fresh menu of good, non-quotation food. And I am not even saying it has to be healthy, just do it right! If you are nostalgic for pseudo foods, I guess go here, but there are other vegetarian restaurants that do it better with fresher ingredients.
