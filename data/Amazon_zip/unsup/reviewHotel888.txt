It was one of my first architectural discoveries in Chicago. I fell in deep love with the wrought iron staircase, the mosaic floor and the detailed elevator doors. That was 5 years ago. I live in Chicago and so needed a good occasion to stay in one of the rooms. I got married!!! (what's this for a plan?) We had the reception at the Reliance Room and were appointed to a complimentary suite for our wedding night. I loved it. The location is just unbeatable and the views.....incredible.... We decided right there and then to spend every anniversary night in that room and I can't wait for the first one!
