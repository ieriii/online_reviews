I didn't have time this trip, but would like to come back here for their afternoon tea service. The interior decoration spells opulence and timeless class. There is a live performer playing soothing harp music for the afternoon tea diner.  Everything here suggests old money, fancy, and don't come here unless you are ready to be pampered and do dress well! =)
