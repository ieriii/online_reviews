EDIT 03.09.11: While I once dismissed their mac n cheese as off-white motor oil and noodles, I must say that it's not necessarily the case. However, consistency is still an issue. Be it the mac n cheese (one day it'll be thick, gooey, and abundant, the next it's watery and tastes more like Velveeta-covered shallots) or the burgers (I've received some... interestingly cooked burgers from them in the past.) Now if they could just figure out a way to deliver once crispy fries to my office without them being L.O.A. (limp on arrival) we might be able to take this rating up a notch.
