My youngest daughter has perhaps my dream job. She tests and tastes craft beers for a living. So, when she identified Hopleaf as her Thursday eve routine for drink and dinner, I knew it must be special. During my brief visit last week, we certainly didn't break from her tradition. But, we did stop first at one of her employer's own brewpubs (see my review of Goose Island Brewpub on Clybourn), choosing to postpone dining until our arrival here. There are certainly Belgians aplenty (the kind typically served in goblets), and her fave here is a sour from Rodenbach. I preferred a saison, and then a tripel karmeliet on this occasion (only because I had already sampled six premium Goose Island draughts at GI Brewpub). But, the real surprise here is the food. In what appears to be the best kind of watering hole - where the food is often relegated to minor pub-grub status - this kitchen puts out fare that matches (or bests) some of the finest establishments I've eaten in at home in New Orleans (where we certainly know great cuisine) or anywhere! I'll agree with other reviewers that the bar area was wall-to-wall with the after-work crowd. But, we moved quickly through that to a great corner table upstairs - quaint and out of the ruckus. Gastropub (with a nod to reviewer Tim V) truly is the best descriptor for this superb blending of culinary artistry and comfortable, friendly surroundings. Four of us ate and drank well, yet the total tab and tip was $160. No doubt this is worthy of a repeat visit next time I'm in Chicago. And the next time. And the next time. You get the picture.
