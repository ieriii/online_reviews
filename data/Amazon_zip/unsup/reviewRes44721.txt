Item: the pizza was excellent. Item: the pasta was reasonably good. Item: the Diet Coke had a subtle evergreen bouquet. Item: the appetizer took approximately 47 years to arrive. Item: my side salad came not with the appetizer, but with my dining companion's personal pizza. Item: my pasta came after the pizza, creating an awkward lag time post-pizza/mid-pasta consumption. Item: my dining companion and I accumulated nine plates by the end of our meal, as the waiter inexplicably brought four dinner-sized plates upon which to eat the appetizers. Item: we spent 1.5 hours in the restaurant *after sitting down*. Item: our lengthy stay at Giordano's resulted in a series of events that culminated in a heroic dash for a train that pulled away literally seconds after we boarded. Conclusion: good food, weird service.  Excellent story, but only because we made it onto the train in the end.
