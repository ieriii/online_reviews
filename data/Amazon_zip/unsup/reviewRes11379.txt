This place was packed. Service was good and food was good but not great. My Eggs Benedict was disappointing as my pouched eggs were overcooked (I specifically asked that they be under cooked in an effort to keep this from happening.) The potatoes that accompanied the dish were ok but by no means "special". I also tried the breakfast burrito which was ok. I should note that the chocolate tower of french toast was very good. Overall with all the hype and the forty five minute to hour and a half wait on weekends along with the "good" food I give The Bongo Room 3 stars.
