What a terrific little (as in small) gem - wow!  OVERALL EXPERIENCE: Remember how you waited to see Slumdog Millionaire until after it came out on DVD and then wondered "why in the world did I wait so long to see that?" Well, this place will have you wondering why you waited so long to try it. FOOD: Cubano sandwich - perfect quantities of each ingredient, melted Swiss, ham, pickle, mustard... it all comes together for a ton of wow! Lechon sandwich - a mouth full of deliciousness... pulled pork never tasted so right! Be sure to order the guava and cream cheese empanada or a mango shake to satisfy that post-meal sweet tooth - Yum! SERVICE: Prompt, attentive, and the owner is funny and engaging. We went there on a Saturday around 5:30pm and waited about five minutes for 3 sandwiches, 3 empanadas, sweet plaintains, and yuca garlic fries. Hungry yet?  SEATING: In case you didn't catch it earlier, this is a small place - counter seating for 10 or so. However, I heard that they have outdoor seating when the warmer weather arrives, so that should allow for a greater number of people to enjoy their meal more promptly. Still, large groups are probably better off taking their food "to go" or you could wait until their 2nd location opens (in approximately 3 weeks?) and hope that it has more seating.
