If you like enormous portions of great food, this place is for you. The sun-dried tomato ravioli alla panna (a special) is the candy version of pasta. Homemade, yummy goodness. The risotto gamberi was perfectly made. The linguini all' arrabbiata showed up in what would more accurately be called a cauldron than a bowl. I got the gnocchi gratinati and I'm still thinking about it. I can eat a lot, and I only got halfway through this thing. The service was great and it's BYOB with no corkage fee. If you haven't been here, go. You won't be disappointed.
