This was a pretty crappy experience. Host took a while to seat us even though the place was half empty. The calamari tasted stale. The spinach/cheese sticks weren't terrible. The pizza was pretty bad. It was just a bed of cheese on some undercooked dough. Half of my dining party got sick that night. How can pizza take 50 minutes to make and still have undercooked dough? It blows my mind. I haven't been to Giordano's since 2007, but from what I remember, it was a lot better than this.
