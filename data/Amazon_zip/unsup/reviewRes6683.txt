A memorable culinary treat! Amazing presentation, tasty, unique dishes. Our server Phil was a great "navigator" from starter thru dessert. Favorites: seared octopus (yummy), tomato/watermelon/basil salad--and dessert, a chocolate/hazelnut ( can't remember the name) so cool, they forgot to add calories! I'll be bAAAck!
