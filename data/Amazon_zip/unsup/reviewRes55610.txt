I went to Cafe 28 recently and was disappointed with the food. We ordered the baked goat cheese appetizer, shrimp quesadillas, veggie fajitas, and a couple of steaks. The goat cheese appetizer and the quesadillas were both cold, even though they came out very shortly after we had ordered. hmmm?  The fajitas did not have very good flavor, and the tortillas were not warmed. I didn't try the steak, but my friends both said it was ok (it was the rib-eye steak). I tried a mojito -- it was weak and not flavorful. At least it came in a pint glass.I will say that the service was very good, food came out quickly, and the server was attentive without being annoying. We were also seated immediately, and the atmosphere was pleasant and warm. All staff we interacted with were friendly.
