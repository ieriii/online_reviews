I have some rules when people come into my apartment. Most importantly the rule of removing your shoes before you leave my foyer (I'm a germaphobe). I know some people are terrified of my wrath if they break my rules, even if I'm out of state. Upon my first trip to Violet Hour, I believe I came as close to feeling this terror as possible. I am a staunch rule follower so I was thrilled to show off my skills and obey the lounge's decrees on proper etiquette. I am pretty sure I earned an A+ for my obedience. Fortunately Violet Hour also earns an A+ for their cocktails and ambiance. It's so hard to flip the mental switch and not expect that when you sit at the bar you're going to have to lean to the left or the right every few minutes to let someone squeeze in to order a drink, but that's just how it is there. It was pure personal-space heaven. My friend and I got to enjoy our food, beverages, and conversation in peace. I could never begin to describe the drinks and do them any sort of justice. It's a lot of showmanship, a lot of egg white options, and a lot of amazingness that make up those purely delicious libations. I would go back in a heartbeat.
