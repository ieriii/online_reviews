Seriously, get in there. The food is f@#king wicked! If you're vegetarian or carnivore doesn't matter. The ambiance blows, so don't get dressed up. The service is fine for type of place that it is. Get one of those smoothie things. Kicks the shit out of Jamba Juice. This could be a weekly stop for me. By all means get in there.
