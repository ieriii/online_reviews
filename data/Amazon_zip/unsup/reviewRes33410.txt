Not sure what all the fuss is about. It's a good Italian restaurant, don't get me wrong, but I've had better. I also don't love how claustrophobic it feels, or how I watched non-customers walk in the unlocked back door and cut me in line for the bathroom. The food was OK, but the price for the size of the portions left something to be desired. I'll probably try other Italian places in the city before coming back here.
