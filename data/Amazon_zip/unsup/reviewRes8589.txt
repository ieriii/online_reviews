Mmmmmeat. Yum. This place is spectacular, but be sure to limit your food intake the day of, and maybe the day prior. You will be sure to maximize your meat for your dollar. While the salad bar looks tempting, be sure to hold off for the plates of meat that you are about to devour. Remember, green means go. All you need is a little flip of your wrist to turn that card over to keep bringing it on.
