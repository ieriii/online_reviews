Thank Jah- a sushi place near my house that delivers! I must say I would have probably given a 4 but the consistantcy just hasnt been there. I havent eaten at the venue, so my review only pertains to the delivery aspect of things. The first time I ordered late and they told me the "chef" wasnt there any longer and i would be limited on what i can get. the rolls seemed to be very rushed when created. They were not tight rolls and seemed to be bursting at the seems. The miso is good, not too salty and the tofu not too soft. They couldnt cook gyoza the forst time i ordered so i was a bit disappointed... The most recent experience was a solid sushi experience. the salmon rolls were good and not too fishy. i went with the less traditional asparagas roll this time and was not disappointed. The miso was once again stellar and the seafood (ebi-shrimp) gyoza was very nice! the sauce they provide was spicier than any sauce which i've had before- and ive had A LOT! overall- not too bad. not too pricey...
