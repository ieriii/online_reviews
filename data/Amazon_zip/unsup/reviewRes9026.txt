Loved the ambiance and the accommodating staff and their service. Entrees were excellent and well worth the prices. I had Filet Mignon and shrimp, wife had trout and vermicelli wrapped in banana leaf, both were exceptional. Would have given five stars if it weren't for the appetizers which are just okay.
