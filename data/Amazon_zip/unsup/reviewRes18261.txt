Extensive beer list. The $1 one-ounce beer pours are great for the people who are undecided. French fries were really fantastic, the best I've had in a long time. The poutine was really good. Fried cheese curds were out of this world. Some people really liked the home-made ketchup. Prices are really reasonable, $9 for great burgers. They have no problem with swapping the bread choices - english muffin, pretzel bread, texas toast. Service was excellent and attentive. However... I had the black&bleu burger and it did not make the earth move for me. It was missing something, and the blue cheese topping seemed to overpower the burger's flavor. Wife got the Edmund Fig-Gerald and it had a smoky flavor that really pushed the flavor over the top, which the black&bleu was lacking. Others at the table had the beer flights and in both the light and dark flights there were two out of the five beers that were just nasty. The beer menu is huge (4 pages or more) and is typeset in a way to make it nearly illegible. The beer list on their website is better organized. Maybe I'm getting old. I think this place didn't live up to the hype for me last night. If you take it in the context of a $9 burger bar the place is really great. If you consider it as a gastro-pub then it somehow comes up short. I'd give this place 4-1/2 stars if I could. Next time we're in the area I will want to try it again.
