I'm not certain how to go about this review... How about a pro/con list Pros:  nice hotel. I think it was recently remodeled. Nice sized bathroom From the 28th floor the views are nice There is a closet in the bathroom which I find very helpful because I had to leave before my wife and baby son woke up. If you don't have a fridge, they will get you one Great location ... In the heart of the city Friendly staff - they must be trained well with customer service Big rooms Fast elevators Cons: No pool No continental breakfast Small elevators - but they are fast and it really isn't an issue AC is by the window and doesn't cool evenly Pros beat Cons by 4 stars
