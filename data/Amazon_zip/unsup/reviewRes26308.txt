Simply It could survive simply by its extravagant service. Try to say that ten times fast! But it complements that outstanding service with superlative food. I could go here just for the soup, but the main dishes are all creative and fun to eat. The owner caters to the theatre crowd in a big way too. As a theatre geek, nothing could make me happier than to see local businesses helping out the local productions by putting up their flyers and encouraging them to eat there before or after the show. Theatre is nothing without a good dinner experience, and Simply It is a great way to complete that experience in style.
