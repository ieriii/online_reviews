It's been awhile, but Tru was far and away* the best dining experience of my lifetime. Food and service both. From the understated unpretentious service, to the cheese flight (*drool*), to the original Warhol looking down on us, to the candy cart after dessert, to the personalized takeaway menu at the end - all of it simply stunning.  Saving my pennies to do it again sometime soon! *This reminded me of that terrible early 90s Tom Cruise/Nicole Kidman epic disaster of a film. Made me chuckle.
