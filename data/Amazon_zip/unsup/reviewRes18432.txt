Good food, with the rustic mexican style that I like, but the food and beer were expensive, and hoped that salsa and hot sauce condiments were free and easily accessable, but were not. Good to try out but I enjoy more latin cultured restaurants where you can mix and match itmes and savor the different salsas etc. Don't get me wrong, I know that this is suppose to be a gringo american twist on south american food, but I guess I was expecting more.
