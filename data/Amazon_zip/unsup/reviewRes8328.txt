Im a big fan of Neopolitan style pizza and this place does it serious justice. The flavor and consistency of the dough is otherworldly...and the toppings are high quality. We had to wait a half hour last time in on a friday night, but while we waited we were treated to a taste of black truffle pizza, really black truffle? wow. Dinner was truly tasty i would highly recommend the salsiccia and mushroom pizza as well as the margahrita. as an added bonus on the way out th owner handed us a complimentary cannoli, one of the best i've ever had. I shall return.
