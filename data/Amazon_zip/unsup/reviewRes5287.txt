The ambiance here is quite chic - you just feel cooler being around here. There is both indoor and outdoor seating, and the service was gauche, albeit not in a bad way.  The food ordered isn't particularly plentiful, so don't come here if you're starving and don't want to order multiple dishes. I got the Porchetta with Salsa Verde, which was tasty, and luckily I wasn't that hungry as it came with only 2 little slider like sandwiches. No garnishing, so I'm not sure what I was really paying for (besides the location and the cool factor).
