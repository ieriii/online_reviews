C'mon people! The place serves breakfast at all times how can that be bad? The only knock on the place (and I will be the first to admit it is unfair) is the wait. I am not sure how long it is on their busier times but we went on a weekday in the middle of the day and we had to wait 10 minutes. (Hey it was a hot day so stop judging!) Also that they have one of those shiny radio frequency things that vibrate and shine is not a good thing. The service was excellent. Despite being extremely busy at no point did we feel neglected. They also did the courtesy of staying out of the way. The food was fresh, tasty and you get a generous portion. I had their Meli chicken sandwich which was memorable. I will return but with an even number of friends because the odd number played a part in making our wait longer. Finally -what's with "we only accept two credit cards?" You lose a star for that!
