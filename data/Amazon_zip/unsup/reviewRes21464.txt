Honestly I'm a little surprised that there aren't any five star reviews at the top of this page, so I'm fixing that now! I LOVE Superdawg. I've been going here with my family and friends for as long as I can remember, and it's always amazing. Sometimes the wait is long, but it's always worth it. This place is a drive in, not a drive thru. You park next to a speaker and push the button to order, then when they bring the food out, they have you roll down your window so they can perch the tray on that. This can be problematic if it's particularly windy out, but it really only affects the napkins so just suck it up and put them in the car instead! When you're done, flip a switch and they come out to take the tray and your money. They have one of my favorite hot dogs ever here, and I've never found one like it anywhere else, though everyone is always shocked when I order it without anything on top... but everything else distracts from the hot dog I love so dearly, so it must be done. The fries are also fantastic, never soggy or too greasy, though they do need salt. Not that I ever have room left over, but for an extra treat with your meal, get the Blackkow (root beer float)... though you might want to share it so you don't explode!
