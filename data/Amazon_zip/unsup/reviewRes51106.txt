I enjoyed the painting on the walls of animals, and want my own copy of the one that we sat next to. The service is above par, and they have their own merchandise memorobilia, which is always a good thing in my eyes. I may still go back for a Wishbone t-shirt. I detected a strong cajun vibe here, which was unexpected and nice, because my girlfriend and I only stopped in because it was close by and it was pouring rain outside. I'm a fan of Shrimp Po Boys already, but thanks to Wishbone, I know I like Crawfish Po Boys as well.
