Was looking forward to trying Bin 36 for the first time. Even though the place was practically empty on a Saturday afternoon, our waitress couldn't seem to find the time to check on us or even smile. Other staff were just standing around talking while one sourpuss waitress handled 3 tables and avoided making eye contact with anyone, like it was a major inconvenience to have customers there at all. The food was acceptable, though not outstanding. It took ages to arrive. (Maybe the waitress was also doing the cooking?) Mussels were good, but came without any bread or accompaniment, and we all know that half the joy of eating mussels is soaking up the garlicky broth with a hunk of crusty bread. Wings were a tiny portion, so hope you aren't too hungry. The wines were fine, but with so little attention to providing information or presentation, it wasn't much different from ordering at any hotel bar. The bill was over $40 per person for 2 glasses of wine and a "snack". Not a great value. Certainly didn't make me want to stay and purchase anything in the shop. Maybe Saturday afternoon is not the time to come here. While I'd still be interested in trying the cheese bar, based on the extremely poor service, we'll probably never go back.
