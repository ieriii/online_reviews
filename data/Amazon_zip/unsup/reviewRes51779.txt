I refuse to go back to Garcia's - every time I go I've always enjoyed their tacos (flour tortillas for me, corn makes me feel queasy) and have had no complaints about their food. The one thing that makes me want to pull my hair out is the variety in service - some days you'll go in, sit down, and somebody will be immediately over asking what you want to drink and then taking your order. The last time I went in (there were at least three/four tables open, meaning it wasn't THAT busy) - we sat down, somebody came by and brought us our drinks....and a good 10 minutes later a party of 8 walked in and sat down...and then 5 minutes after that the waitress (the same one that brought me my drink) went to the table of 8 and took their order...and still didn't come by our table. We'd already tried to flag them down, but these waitresses are on a mission when they get flustered - they are so focused on getting whatever task they need to get done that they aren't aware of anything else that's going on. At this point I was starving and completely annoyed so we threw down a couple bucks for our drinks and left. It's not the first time we've had to wait forever for somebody to acknowledge that we are at their restaurant to EAT - what a concept. There are plenty of good Mexican places in the square - don't waste your time and your money here.
