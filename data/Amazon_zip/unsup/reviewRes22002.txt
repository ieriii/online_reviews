After several more visits, a few dozen soy-chocolate-oatmeal-shakes, a couple orders of that amazing salad with beets and hearts of palm with a vinegar base, and taking a long, hard look at my initial 4 star rating of the veggie burrito I'd heard so much about and analyzing the under $5 price tag of said burrito, I decided it was about damn time I throw up that 5th star. Again, I stand by my initial sentiment that the veggie burrito isn't 'all that' (or at least no all that it was hyped to be), but I will admit that it's exponentially tastier if you do what I've down on my last few visits with friends and splurge the extra few quarters to add an extra ingredient. Irazu recommends adding plantains (which I generally am not a fan of) and I have to agree. The sweet plantains mixed with the savory everything else... they're really on to something. Other things you need to make sure you get down on at Irazu: - Famous oatmeal shake, choose chocolate and splurge on the soy, it honestly tastes better than the regular milk. - BYOB... so cost effective when dining, make sure you take advantage. - That freakin' delicious salad with beets and hearts of palm. Best are the best, hearts of palm already have my heart, and being the vinegar freak I am, the dressing is what my dreams are made of. - Veggie taco... so good with LOTS of the hot sauce. Git yer nose runnin! Pura Vida, Baby!
