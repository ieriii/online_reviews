BYOB and solid Cuban food. I'll have to chime in with everyone else--the empanadas are indeed amazing. You can choose your empanada filling, we ordered the guava and cheese, beef, and ropa vieja (shredded beef)--all delicious. Bistec (steak) sandwich w/ lettuce, tomato, grilled onions, shoestring potatoes--pretty darn good. My date's ropa vieja sandwich was also very good, would definitely recommend that. The crowd and staff--yikes! A scary and eclectic crowd, that's all I can say. This was supposed to be the bigger 90 Miles location and it was still small and cramped. There were definitely some problems with the service but our server comped the empanadas because they came out after and not before our meal. Reasonable prices for good food--I would go here for a casual night out if you don't mind the weird crowd.
