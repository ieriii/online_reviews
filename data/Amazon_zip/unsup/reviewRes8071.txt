Loved, loved, loved this place. The selection of meats was amazing, but the best part is their salad bar...not only were the mixed greens very fresh and of high quality, but the buffalo mozzarella was extremely tasty....even satisfied one of my co-workers, who's a vegetarian.  Also, the Caipirinha's are a must hit....I just wish they'd open one of these places in my hometown of SF.
