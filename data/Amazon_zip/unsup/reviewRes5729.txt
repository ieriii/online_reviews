My wife and I wanted to try something new so we headed to the Pig. I am not a huge fan of communal dining but can tolerate it. Except...we were seated next to a woman who was your typical, "I come here all the time, I know the owner (who didn't seem to know her), I will tell you what to order, and would you like to hear my life story, person. The second problem was our condescending waiter. I noticed many interesting looking craft beers on the menu and not being in the mood for wine I ordered a brew. BIG MISTAKE. The waiter acted down right disgusted with me and after informing me that they were out of each of the beers that I inquired about, he rudely told me that this is a restaurant known for wine, not beer. Look, I get it but don't make the customer feel like a jerk. If you are going to put craft beers on the menu don't treat someone like crap if they order one. I opted then for wine. I am not a wine expert but I do know what I like. Obviously this place has many varietals that I was not familiar with so I asked the waiter for a recommendation. He said " do you like Spanish wine?" I said yes and he rambled off so many choices and in such sophisticated terminology that I was confused as hell. I asked for something along the lines of a Pinot Noir. I know, not very sophisticated. Then the waiter loudly proclaimed that there are no Pinot Noir's in Spain. Okay, thanks for making me look like jerk AGAIN princess. The food was very good, but watch out for the arrogant service.
