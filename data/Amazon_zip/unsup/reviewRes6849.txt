Yes, the barbeque here is fantastic. And the mac n cheese? Dreamy. Read all the other reviews for more on that. I wanted to write about the decor. Whoever designed this place blew me out of the water.  The wait staff are outfitted in plaid shirts, but crisp and tucked into clean khakis. That sums this place up. It is the perfect combination of preppy cape cod, southern bbq, and gold coast dining. The white beadboard-esque walls, wrought iron fixtures and hardwood floors, combined with the towering staircase leading up the GORGEOUS second floor... wow. And the use of mirrors makes the room seem light and even larger than it is. The patio space is small but lovely and comfortable. Our group of seven was seated in a huge, clean booth. The large opening dining room was happily noisy, as a good BBQ joint should be. If I was hosting a rehearsal dinner in the city, I'd rent a private space here in a heartbeat. The aesthetic of this place and attention to detail are really stunning and refreshing, and just my style. I'll go again for the decor and ambience alone, not to mention the life-changing BBQ.
