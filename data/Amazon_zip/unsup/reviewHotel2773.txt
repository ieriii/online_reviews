I recently had family in town and they stayed at The James. We went to their rooms several times. The staff was very friendly. The work-out is great - they have fresh lemon water -yum! Very retro modern decor. Mini bar in room w/ other tempting snacks and a 'mile high kit'. Rooms have flat screen tvs. I will recommend any visiting family and friends to stay there in the future. Room service food was delish.
