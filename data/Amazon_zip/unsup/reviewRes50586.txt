Glad to have you Big Jones, you take slightly heavy and meaty and put it on the pedestal it deserves. I had the Fried Green tomato BLT - amazing - the tangy tomato complemented the rich and perfectly cooked bacon. My friend had the burger, which might be my new favorite in the 'hood. I heard the sausage dishes were great - although I didn't try them myself - and they had a good selection of microbrews. My only disappointments were two bland dishes: (a comment that I read below from others) the chicken liver appetizer reminded me of a McD's nugget, and the mac-and-cheese was nearly completely lacking in flavor. But all in all a great new addition to the dinner scene.
