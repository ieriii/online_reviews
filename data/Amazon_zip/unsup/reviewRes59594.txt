This place was really fun. The zillions of appetizers that accompanied our meal were all very tasty, and colorful. My Husband took me here for my birthday dinner on Halloween. We were fortunate enough to be sat next to a group of Asian College students who were just finishing, which meant less smoke in our faces, no loud people sitting with us, and a more traditional atmosphere. Lets face it, the service is shit- you need to be prepared to be ignored, or to go up and tell the waitress what you want, and not get fussy about it. With that in mind, we had an awesome time..unlike the yuppie assholes who sat near us and expected to be waited on hand and foot. Get real! Go to Applebee's- its where you belong. Also, unless you believe children should be exposed to smoke, don't bring your kids here
