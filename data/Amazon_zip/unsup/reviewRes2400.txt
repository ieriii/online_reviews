Best food lover "secret" in Chicago. As 1300 reviews show, this place is no secret. However I am still amazed at how frequently I can surprise foodies with this barely hidden gem. My wife and I make it our annual Valentine's Day date, showing up at 10:00 am and ordering several game dogs each and duck fries. Then we pass them around, commenting on everything we taste while telling each other how much we love each other ( aw.). The only bad experience I ever had was when my i took my father-in-law and he ordered two regular hot dogs. "What, I like hotdogs!" he barked. Seriously, the place is great. And they go beyond for a hot dog joint. There is a "host" (again with the quotes?") who makes sure that no matter how crowded it is, if you have placed an order, you have a place to sit. Be prepared to wait, be adventurous, it's one of the best restaurants in town.
