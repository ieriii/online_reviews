Tried out Mercat this Friday night. Had 9:30 reservations and didn't get seated and our pitcher of sangria until 10:30. I understand they've been open for less than 2 weeks but an hour wait? FOOD: Overall pretty good, but definitely hit or miss. The diver scallops were the only real stand outs. Calamari was terrible: incredibly rubbery and off-smelling. Goat cheese & ham ravioli melted in the mouth but the portion was laughable; 3 of the smallest pillows of pasta I've ever seen. Seasonal sangria was quite nice and the basil toned down some of the sweetness. STAFF: Friendly overall. They seem to be doing the best they can with an awful setup: the tiny bar and restrooms are downstairs while the dining room is upstairs. Apologetic about the wait but didn't comp anything which was a bit outrageous. THE ROOM: Some cool elements but a bit theme-y. Honeycomb spiral staircase was interesting and the tile above the kitchen is fabulous. Offset by the fact that every window & mirror is covered with decals which sends it into Disney/Vegas territory. Tables were too close together. Music was cheesy early-90's-runway-style dance music and too loud.... why can't they just play some new school bossanova? The kitchen/dining room was loud enough without a techno soundtrack. OVERALL: I would probably try it again in a few months when they have time to work the kinks out, but won't run back (which is unfortunate as i live 2 blocks away). The bill for 2 of us was $113 and we left with a full belly and a nice buzz so definitely a good value. Oh yeah, those headsets NEED to go!
