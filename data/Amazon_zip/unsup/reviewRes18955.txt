First off I have to say, i love Rick Bayless!! His passion for cooking really comes through in his food. After eating at Topolobampo's Top Chef tasting menu during my last trip in Chicago, I've made it a mission to try all of Bayless's restaurants. I came here for lunch on a weekday and had the Ahogada: golden carnitas, black beans, tomato broth, spicy arbol chile sauce and pickled onions. It was so delicious, especially on a chilly Chicago day. I would skip the churro next time since it tasted like it was fried in old oil. Their soft serve was just ok as well. I love visiting Chicago and will be returning to Xoco!
