The beer is awesome - the Rosa beer is my favorite, but the food was a disappointment. I had the tofu pot pie, thinking it would be warm with a filo dough crust like all standard pot pies are, but it more like a bland, cold tofu salad with peas and carrots scooped inside an even blander somewhat burnt taco shell-like crust. I love food, I would even say I'm a foodie, and I was hungry but couldn't finish this dish, it got sort of nasty at the end.  My boyfriend who is also a foodie got a burger, and although it looked awesome (huge, with a duck egg sunnyside up on top) it was bland, as if the meat was not seasoned much. I will say the sausage is fantastic in the charcuterie appetizer. I don't know if it is home-made but it sure tastes that way. If we go back for dinner I will definitely try something else like the fish and chips, but I would return for the beer for sure. They are all very well done, well balanced and creative. The chocolate cake with porter ice cream is also good, but not awesome. By the way, you will wait 90-120 minutes on a weekend for a table, and they are not accurate about the wait times.
