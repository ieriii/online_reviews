I liked this place. Very cozy and small. We did have a hard time geting to the order girl.. even though we spoke her native langauges- spanish. Very friendly owner.. I had the cuban sandwich and it was good. I liked their rice and beans.. I can't wait to go to the new one on armitage since it's near my job!
