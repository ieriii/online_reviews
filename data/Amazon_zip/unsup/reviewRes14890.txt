3.5 stars. i was really looking forward to this place after reading the great reviews. maybe my expectations were too high? got the cubano cuz, well, it's a cuban cafe and i was very happy. liked it better than the cubano at cafecito. better meat to bread ratio. also got the goat cheese empanada based on previous yelpers but was a little disappointed. it was good, but not great. the goat cheese flavor was a little weak. it tasted more like tomato and cream cheese. my friend got the guajirito. think i'd rather have a jibarito. 4 stars for just the cubano. minus half a star cuz of the empanada and the guajirito.
