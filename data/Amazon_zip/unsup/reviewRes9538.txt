Fabulous meal. Took the madre here for her birthday and the family was not disappointed! Our server was genious. He knew it all and it seemed like he already knew what we were going to order. Total maestro. I had the Coconut Curry Shrimp and man was it tasty. I wouldnt call the interior "authentic" but pretty damn close. Really didnt feel like I was just off Rush St. I really enjoyed the specialty drinks! Next time I want to sit upstairs on the terrace, or have a drink at the beautiful bar!
