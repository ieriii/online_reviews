Quite a large crowd and a thirty minute wait for a table on a Friday night, this place sure packs them in. The vegetable lo mein was made of limp greens in what appeared to be over cooked two minute noodles and not cheap. The char sui pork (bbq pork in honey?) was chewy, fatty and just not edible. When raised with the waiter he asked "have you ever eaten char siu pork before?". "Ah yes and this is terrible". The manager came over to our table and to her credit apologized and swapped the dish over for char sui that was tender and tasted good. The roast pork was just OK. On the bright side they had some good Goose Island beers on tap. Think I will give them one more go and try the duck - guess so many people cannot be wrong.
