This is a fun brunch place. I've only been here for brunch, so I can't really comment on any other meals of the day. I love corn bread and they have the most delicious corn muffin that comes with the meal. I always feel like I get a ton of food, and a lot of variety within the meal. Sometimes you may have to wait, but then you can have a coffee and hang out for a bit with your friends before you sit down. I don't know if it is the best place to go when you are in a hurry during the weekend, but I'm not usually in a hurry on the weekend, so it works out well. Also when you are there, check out the decor. The lamps are amazing... they are shaped like an egg yolk.
