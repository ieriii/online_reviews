Went here this past Saturday for a friend's birthday (after another had seen this place featured on Check, Please!) To start we got two orders of the crab rangoon which were nicely different than at most places - more crab and less cream cheese - yay! For our dinners, the girl next to me got shrimp in lobster sauce, which was very tasty. I got Sauteed Tofu which was.... well, soft and pretty bland - it was a white sauce not unlike moo goo gai pan (sp?) and the tofu was ultra-soft. The birthday girl got Sweet & Sour Chicken - which never arrived!! We were all basically done eating, and then we reminded our waitress and she finally brought her dish out. Next to her, a friend got the Orange Chicken made spicy, which was quite good. Finally, the last friend ordered a chop suey dish which was also good. Overall, I think the food is very good. However, the service (our waitress seemed incredibly irritated to have to do her job at 8:30, but gradually got nicer) was, as others have said, questionable at best. At least we didn't have to pay for the birthday girl's dinner?
