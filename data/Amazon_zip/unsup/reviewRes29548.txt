So, I basically think the food here is fine, as long as you can actually GET IT. holy cow, i have better luck placing a delivery order with a non english speaking employee at my local "asian fusion" joint and have what i ordered arrive in a decent time than here. Not sure if I interrupted the employees from their work party or if the manager is more concerned with the hostess's opinion of him than a paying customer's.  Terrible customer service - I'd rather spend my money elsewhere.
