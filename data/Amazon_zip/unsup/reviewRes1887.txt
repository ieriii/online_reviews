Huge line or not, Hot Doug's is pretty much untouchable. Having eaten here regularly for years, I cannot recall a single bad meal. I recall one solitary chicken sausage special that I thought was a bit "eh" on the Hot Doug's scale, but otherwise the food is always top notch. I almost always order something from the specials menu, often a variety of chicken sausage, but the regular menu items are also great. The fries are insanely good, and I've never even gone for the duck fat fries because I can't imagine them being any better than the ones served every other day of the week. Also, their fountain Coke is top notch. Best fountain Coke in the city, I think. Saturday will always be busy. I've arrived there at 10:30 some mornings, thinking I'd beat the line, and it's always at least out the door by that time, if not firmly around the corner. If you can come mid-afternoon during the week (yes, I work a full time job in the Loop too, but sometimes am going to/from the office during the day and sneak by), there will barely be a line and you can have your food in under ten minutes. If I moved from Chicago, Hot Doug's would probably be one of the things I missed most, and friends of mine who have moved list Hot Doug's among the top things missed about the city. If I could give Doug more than 5 stars, I would. Also, unless the line is out of control and your family is impatient, this is a great place to take family visiting from out of town. Sure you'll get the "I'm waiting in line for a hot dog?" look from some of them, but it will all make sense when they get their first sausage or dog in them.
