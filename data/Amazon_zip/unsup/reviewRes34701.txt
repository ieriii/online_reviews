This place has great food cheap which is maybe why they don't take credit cards or serve any alcohol. It's best for carry out since there is absolutely no ambiance whatsoever. They do have outdoor seating but it is also pretty lacking since it is right on North Ave. The place is run like a cafeteria but they run through food fast since there is usually a line around common meal times so everything is fresh. The Falafel is amazing but they have other tasty things too like their Chicken and Lamb Scwermas.  They'll make party platters up for you if you ask. I love this place.
