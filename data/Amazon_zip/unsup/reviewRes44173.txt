I have not been in the lounge (yet!) so this is just about the bakery itself. We just moved to the area and this is the spot I have been the most. Not only do they have Intelligentsia coffee but anything you get with it will be delectable. I've tried their breakfast pastries, desserts and lunch time spread (curry chicken salad sandwich is wondrous!) and have yet to be disappointed. I feel the price is in line with the quality and the fact they are open at 6am will keep this my top bakery in the area.
