When I first walked in, it seems like every other restaurant in the city. I didn't know it was meat free till about the second time I ate at their booth at "Pitchfork Music Festival" (hate if you must.) I was very impressed by the meat free corn-dog thinking "No, no, no, no there has to be meat in this." I was truly impressed with every dish I've had thus far. Perfectly made and for good reason. (vegans are picky eaters don't cha know) The only bad item I had was the organic root beer (It's not root beer!) which is really the distributer's fault. The service is perfect. Every server is different but all have their own charismatic and inviting style that makes me want to give them a tip that would make my mother roll her eyes. My only problem is that it's not 24 hours. Le sigh.
