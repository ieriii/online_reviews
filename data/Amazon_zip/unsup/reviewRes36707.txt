Just love this place! I had gotten take-out/delivery from them in the past but a group of us decided to check it out in the restaurant when one of our favorites had too long a wait last night. Even though they were super crowded, they had a perfect table for us and our waiter, Winston, was a hoot. The food was exactly what we wanted, a little of everything across the Asian slide and all of it was prepared to our taste. The sushi was great, soups, and the curries were exquisite. Love having a new place to frequent!
