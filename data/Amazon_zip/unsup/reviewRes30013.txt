In college there were a few places that everyone told me I could go to get away from the other college students around me. Surprisingly, Third Coast actually did provide quiet corners despite multiple recommendations (which indicates that plenty of college students frequent the place). The atmosphere in the evening is sort of like a quiet European bar - lit by candles, littered with newspapers, fantastic bottomless coffee and drinks, and great food (the pizza was great, thought slightly expensive). I came here when I planned on needing to sit and talk for hours.
