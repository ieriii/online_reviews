My rule of thumb is to visit a place at least 3 times before making a judgement, so after my fifth visit here, I feel like I can say with some authority that this place is definitely worth checking out. I'm a cheese fanatic, and with 50+ cheeses to choose from...I'm hooked. Goat cheese crusted in cocoa oil??? Super yummy. Cheddar cheese rolled in espresso and lavender....amazing. It's not just the cheese that I'm enamored with, of course the wine is a centerpiece as well, the food is great, and I've had nothing but great service so far. I like that you can come for the lighter fare of cheese & wine in the tavern, but can also have the full dining experience in the cellar. Both are great options.
