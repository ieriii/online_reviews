Everyone else has said it but I am going to say it again. Hot Doug's is the real deal. Every bit as good as you can imagine. Each bite was a revelation of taste and creativity. My friend and I decided to get 3 of the speciality dogs (which are a little more pricey) and share so we could taste more of what was to offer. This ended up being a great way to experience the glory of more than one of these unique dogs. We had chicken, alligator and bison. All fantastic.  Rumor is that the duck fat fries are amazing but they only serve them on the weekends. So that is good to know. Also, for obvious reasons, Hot Doug's is very, very busy. Going right when they open or about an hour before they close will save you a lot of wait time (we went around 3pm and only waited for about 15 minutes). Also, make sure to bring cash so you don't end up like the girl in front of us who waited through the whole line only to come rushing back out of the restaurant pleading "Where is the nearest ATM!!!"
