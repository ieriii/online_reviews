Awesome food. This is one of those places you go to where the dining experience/process is as memorable as the food. Our table had two bbq pits built directly into them. Shoeless and seated Indian-style, we enjoyed twenty-two little appetizer dishes, Korean BBQ, bibimbap, some sort of fish stew, and soju. If you've never had Korean BBQ before, I suggest you give this place a try. It stays open until 5am and is group-friendly. But if you plan on getting fresh with your date, I wouldn't recommend this as a date place, since you go home reeking of smoke/bbq meats. I'm sure whiffs of smoke/bbq isn't an aphrodisiac for most.
