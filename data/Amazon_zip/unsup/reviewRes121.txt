Completely incredible experience. 27 individual, tiny "bomb-like" experiences in a row. Little "micro courses" of flavor, texture, temperature, and smell. I read Peter Segal's book, Vice, on the flight to Chicago and booked dinner from the plane. My buddy and I had 4 hours of never-before and never-again food science creations from this amazing sensory experience. These course come out at intervals, there's plenty of time to savor and then reflect on what you've just had, and the staff does a great job of explaining and couching the food. Get the wine pairings so you have the ultimate experience. Be prepared for a lengthy stay, though. Be ready for conversation as we don't typically have 4 hour, dozen-course meal here in the States. Even foodies may reach the "oh my god, we have YET MORE courses to go" stage, but stick it out! You'll likely never experience such a series of elaborately-prepared and intricately-delivered foods again.
