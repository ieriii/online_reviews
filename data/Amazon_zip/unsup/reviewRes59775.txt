Art of Pizza lives up to the name, I moved to Chicago from South Carolina and this was the first Chicago style pizza that I tried, and it's the only place i'll order from now. They have a great selection pizza by the slice and their daily specials are unbelievable. The daily specials are simply just too much food... Wednesdays and the Chicken Parm are a must!!Easy to get to by car, nice eat in experience, and the customer service is top notch!
