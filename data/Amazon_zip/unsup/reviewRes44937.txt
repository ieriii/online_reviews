On our visit to Chicago we tried Lou Malnati's on N Wells St & Giordano's on E Lake St. I really liked Lou Malnati's but I LOVED the pizza at Giordano's! You do wait 35 minutes, so if you want to call ahead that would speed things up. I had the spinach & cheese & my husband had the pepperoni & olives. We ordered individual lunch sizes, and I have to say that if you are really hungry, I would go for a small size instead of the individual. When I return to Chicago, I will definitely be going back to Giordano's! :)
