It's been three months since I've last dined at LBB but Branko remembered me and greeted me with a warm hug. This time I came back with a few partners in crime for our mini class reunion. Here's what we ordered: ***Appetizers*** 1) Mussels - The bowl and portion was ginormous, but I think it should've been a little more thoroughly cooked. 2) "Saganaki" Oppa! flaming kasseri cheese - Blazing. Sodium-rich. Mouth-watering. ***Entrees*** 1) Sausage-Stuffed Chicken Thigh 2) Chicken Schnitzel 3) Braised Short Rib Goulash - The short rib was very well marinated with each bite bursting with juice and flavor. Aggressive. Loud. Savory. 4) "Sarmale" Stuffed Cabbage - This is a very unique dish. Delicate leaves of cabbage wrapped around minced pork/beef made every bite go from crisp to lisp. Why? Keep your mouth shut and keep chewing until you finish every bite of the delicacy. ***Desserts*** 1) Apricot crepes - Hmm...should perhaps go elsewhere for crepes. 2) Strawberry crepes - I'm not a fan for their strawberry jam. 3) Fruits with white chocolate It's always nice to dine with a group because you can take a bite from everybody's plate and try different dishes. (Unless people guard their plates with steak knives.) It was a blusterous night for LBB. In addition to our group, they also had a meetup and birthday group. Branko and the wait staff were panting for breath as they ran from table to table to put up with their best service. They definitely didn't let us down with their efficiency and vigor.  P.S. We purchased a http://restaurant.com $50 gift certificate for this visit. The minimum purchase is $100 and there is a 18% gratuity add-on. Our group had seven people but Branko didn't include the gratuity until we gave him the gift certificate. He doesn't like to enforce a strict gratuity rule for parties over six. The choice is in your hands.
