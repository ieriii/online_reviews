Came highly recommended by a friend so my wife & I & 2 other friends went early on a Saturday night to try to beat a long wait & try it out. Parking's a pain in the ass in that area & after 20 minutes we found a spot 4 blocks away. Got there & were told they were at capacity & the wait would be about 90 min. I had heard good things & figured it would be busy so we planned on having some beers at the bar. We started to make our way to the bar & were told we had to leave the building because they meant the building was at capacity. They suggested we try to find somewhere else in the area to hang out & they would call us in an hour & a half or so (same deal for 2 other groups that showed up when we did)....seriously?If you're busy enough to fill your space to fire code danger capacity & have people willing to wait 90 minutes for a table I think you can start taking reservations (no rez's for parties less than 6) rather than turning your customers away or sending them elsewhere to wait. I've got better shit to do rather than gamble on a chance at this place. Their success will be their downfall.
