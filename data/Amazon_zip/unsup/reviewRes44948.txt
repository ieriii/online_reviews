I've taken several visitors to Chicago here due to the close proximity to all the tourist attractions in the Loop. It's a good intro to Chicago deep-dish, but not my favorite. I don't think I've ever had fantastic service, and sometimes got the feeling the wait staff just wanted to get us out as fast as possible (not an easy thing when waiting 45 minutes for a pizza).
