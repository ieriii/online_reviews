I've been going to Frontera for years and it has never wavered as hands-down one of the best restaurants I've ever been to. From tongue tacos to ceviche to goat cheese ice cream, I'm consistently amazed. The only downside is the long wait for a table. Being able to make a reservation would definitely add to the experience.
