Came here on a Tuesday night and it was hopping! The service was very good. Our waitress was training someone new, and we got a few laughs out of giving her a hard time (all in good fun).  They have some great beer and wine choices. I had a $7 glass of very nice Chardonnay.  We ordered THREE orders of cheese fries for 6 people...one of the friends we were with really loves them. I am not a huge cheese fries person (hate that fake cheese), but these were absolutely delicious! That was REAL cheese on there!  I had a turkey burger and sweet potato fries. The turkey burger came with LOTS of pickles, which is a good thing. A few people at the table had salad; they ordered two different dressings, and both said they didn't like their dressing much! Not a good thing... They bring hot washclothes with lemons at the end of the meal...only had that at Asian restaurants before, but it was a nice touch.  I would come here again if someone suggested it, but I wouldn't necessarily suggest it myself.
