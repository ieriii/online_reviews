This is theeeeeeee best pizza I've had outside of Naples itself. Not kidding. I've been there several times and I've taken out. Always good. The owner is super nice too and when theres a big wait he will bring out a pizza cut into small slices to both tide you over and force you to wait...who could leave after such a taste bud teaser?? hee heeSo good
