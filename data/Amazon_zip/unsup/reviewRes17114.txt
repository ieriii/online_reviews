Delicious food. Nice atmosphere. Intimidating menu.  Bit pricy at around $90 for dinner for two with a bottle of wine. Spent 15 minutes staring at the 8 page menu, with 15 items per page. This is normally fine, but the descriptions of the dishes were not very helpful to a non-regular Indian connoisseur. Ended up settling on the Special Dinner for Two. Soup, Salad, enough meat for 4 people, and some rice pudding for desert. Everything is very good, would recommend it as a nice place for a special treat.
