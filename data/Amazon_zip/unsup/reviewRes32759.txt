Well where do I start? I had a very negative perception of Ethiopian food going into this whole ordeal ( I thought it would be twigs and leaves).  But unfortunately, I was never able to correct my perception because we (my girlfriend and I) waited over thirty minutes for a waiter to come to our table.  The only service we got was from a busboy pouring water in the glasses at our table. The food descriptions on the menu looked good, but its a shame we never even got proper service to place an order.
