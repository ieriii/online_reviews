3 1/2 ! Totally great for a date. The ambiance was a lot more romantic that I'd thought it'd be.. (candles/exposed brick wall/byob).. and kind of random but.. it smelled like mothballs when I entered the building..? loool.. Very cheap for the amount of food you get. My friend ordered the beef ribs and WOW.. it could feed 3 people ! HUGE plate of korean bbq lookin' ribs w/veggies.. and a HUGE BOWL OF RICE. WOW. I ordered the fried tilapia.. and.. it tasted like fish sticks in spaghetti-o sauce.. it didn't taste BAD, it just tasted... very random.. and not.. Vietnamese. haha. :x I'll order something else next time. Servers were very attentive and sweet. We were given puffed rice cakes at the end :) My friend had her HUGE order to go, and it included with this very sweet letter from the owner and how grateful he his for his customers. T'was sweet.. Lovely ambiance/good portions/good price/good service..but I'll have to order something else next time.
