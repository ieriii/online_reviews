Honestly, I wasn't impressed with the food. We got the BLT and the California wrap. If you plan to stop here, then just stick to the basics. They are supposedly known for burgers, so if I ever get back here, then that is what I'll order. What salvaged this review were 2 things. 1. Grapefruit juice - Fresh squeezed. And thus delicious. 2. Free desert - Our waitress asked if we had ever been to the restaurant and we said no. At the end of our meal, a guy named "Ron" stopped by our table with a large cookie sundae with homemade chocolate fudge. It was delicious and you gotta give it up for a place that does cool stuff like that. My only question...Does RJ stand for Ron { }? If so, then that's pretty awesome.
