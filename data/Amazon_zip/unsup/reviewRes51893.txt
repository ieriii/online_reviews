On our 2nd day in Chicago, we had pizza for breakfast again. It was a mission to taste chicago pizza not just in one place but several. It was a sunday late morning so what do you have to drink? Bloody mary's of course. I had a few as we waited for our party to arrive and it gave me an opportunity to scope out the environment. This place is a great place for tourists. You can put your mark on the walls, if you can find room. The place is filled with names and remarks about "being in chicago". I mean everywhere! When we got seated, our waiter seemed a little rude and "attitude-ish" but after awhile and a couple more drinks, he became magically funny and entertaining. Shawn helped make the experience because we all gave each other a hard time about everything. From ordering ranch to asking for markers to write on the wall. He came thru and was totally great. Now that you got the feel that i had a great time there, lets talk food! We had to do it right. We ordered a deep dish and a thin crust. The deep dish was a meat extravaganza:sausage, pepperoni, bacon, canadian bacon, then topped with sauce and cheese! Damm that was so good. I tried the thin crust too but its pretty common. It was good but hadn't really had deep dish before, i was all in! Overall, great staff, great drinks, great pizza. A must if you hit up Chicago!
