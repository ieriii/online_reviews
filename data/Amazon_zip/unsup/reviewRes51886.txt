You have to try this place because it's famous, but it's honestly not THE BEST deep dish I've ever had. It's not considered decent in my book. I know, I know it's blasphemy. Chicago deep dish is sacred. Just that this pizza was really soggy and sloppy. You pick up a piece and the integrity of the pizza doesn't even hold up. You're just eating slop on a plate at that point! But if you ever are in the SF/Bay Area... Try Little Star Pizza and Zachary's!
