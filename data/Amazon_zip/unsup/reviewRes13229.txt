I had been wanting to check out Glenn's Diner for a while now, but it's rare for me to make it out to Ravenswood. Also Glenn's is an Open Table hold out, which virtually renders a restaurant invisible when it comes to me planning dinner outings. But, my boo was on point, calling Glenn's up and scoring us a table for 5 on a Thursday night. Added bonus, easy meter parking scored across the street so parking cost us about $2.50 for the evening with no waiting for valets. I was really impressed with the variety of fresh seafood offered. I was less impressed with my particular dinner selection--the pretzel encrusted walleye--which while fresh didn't really drive me crazy. What did drive me crazy was the amazing shrimp and cheese appetizer. I don't know what it was called, but I would eat another half dozen of those. The beer list is pretty respectable. The deserts were so-so, although they offer an impressive key lime pie. I would definitely come back here to check out more of the menu, and enjoy some really fresh fish, in a comfortable, neighborhoody environment.
