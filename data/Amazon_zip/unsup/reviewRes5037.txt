This place is fabulous! I happened to show up with my family on an unseasonable warm April evening. This VERY small wine bar / restaurant does not take reservations, so just expect a long wait. Trust me its worth it. The hour or so of hanging out on their long patio and enjoying the warm weather with a dozen or so other soon-to-be patrons was just enough for us to finish a bottle of very nice wine.  On to the dining room were we were told that the menu items should be considered like tapas and that 3 people should order 6-8 items.  Without getting into too many details... everything we ordered was excellent. The best of the best was the Mortadella, Balsamico, and Pistachio Smear, Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs, Razor Clams, and the must-have Sicilian Iris (dessert).  I can't wait to try the rest of the menu!
