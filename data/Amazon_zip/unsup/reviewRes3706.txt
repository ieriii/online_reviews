I kept hearing about how wonderful the wings at Crisp were. I finally decided to find out for myself and was very impressed. Had the Seoul Sassy sauce per yelp's recommendation and was blown away. Also, I'm a big guy, and 5 wings were plenty for not a lot of cash. Next time I need a quick awesome meal in lakeview, Crisp FTW.
