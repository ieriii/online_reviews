I was excited to try a Rick Bayless restaurant...and so were a lot of other people because this place was BUSY! The only downside was the wait (we probably waited about an hour). But the food was very yummy. My husband had the Shortrib Red Chile Soup - very tasty. I had the Pork Belly torta, which was good but a little too spicy for my taste. The agua de dia they had was absolutely delicioius - it was orange, mint and I believe pineapple. Not too sweet and the mint added a refreshing quality.
