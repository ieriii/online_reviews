We've been to Schwa twice and both times my husband was able to get through for a reservation on his first try - dumb luck, I suppose. Schwa is like that dinner party that is thrown by people so much cooler than you, you're not really sure how you got invited. However, after the wine starts flowing and you get comfortable, you're in the kitchen doing Jameson shots with everyone. (yes, this actually happened.) Start to finish, our meal was simply spectacular. Highlights included pink lemonade sous vide salmon, coconut-crusted foie gras with apricot puree, pheasant, a mushroom "petrie dish" with Thai flavors and obviously the quail egg ravioli.  Service and atmosphere was fun and totally unpretentious. If you're looking for impeccable service, this is not the place. The music is a little too loud, the server a little...ummm...whiskey'ed up, the language a little coarse - all in a good way. It's all part of the vibe that you're at a dinner party at someone's home instead of a Michelin-starred restaurant.  The irreverence of it all is refreshing and makes the experience, in my opinion. (pro tip: bring a little something for the kitchen staff. it will not go unappreciated.)
