I'm just wrapping up a two night stay at Public and I can't say enough great things about this hotel - however I'll try to sum it up below. The Pros: - Amazing Staff. Everyone from the doormen, to the people at the front desk, to the folks delivery room service. They are super nice and super helpful. - The decor is beautiful. I would love for my house to look like this. It modern, tasteful, and looks like something you'd see in the most upscale NY Hotel. - The beds are super comfortable. - The water pressure in the shower is excellent. (Nothing is worse than discovering a hotel with low flow shower heads!) - The happy hour and night life is great. (And this was on a Tue and Wed - The weekends are probably even better.) - You can walk to lots of great restaurants and shopping. - They have bikes that you can borrow - FOR FREE! - Wifi is free and easy to access. The Cons: - None, Zero, Zilch I will definitely be coming back to this hotel.
