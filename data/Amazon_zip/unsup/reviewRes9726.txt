Great food, lousy service. Dale Levitski might want to crack the whip before the front of the house sinks Sprout. A busy weekend at an established "fine dining" restaurant should not be this chaotic and it wouldn't be with professional servers. Food came out lukewarm, matched wines were late, servers were too busy talking to friends at the bar and my current pet peeve: Texting in the middle of a busy service right in the middle of the restaurant in full view of patrons waiting forever for their courses to arrive. The hostess was doing it too. Totally unacceptable. What did arrive when it was supposed to was great but there were far too many mis-steps for a restaurant at this price point. We won't go back.
