What a neat place! Warm n' funky decor, every corner of the place look different others. In the middle of the restaurant, there's a little area that made to look like a library, cool. Went in for just a drink, it was a bit on the pricey side, but you get what you paid for, cool place, decent service. Want to go back and try the food.
