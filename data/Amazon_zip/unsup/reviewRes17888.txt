This place is wicked awesome! I've been in a couple of times and I love it. I love the ambiance in the bar! My husband absolutely loves this bar, too. The food menu is very unique (not a bad thing). They make their own ketchup, which is delicious!! The chipotle FF are my favorite! I finally had a beer flight, not bad at all, but I honestly rather order by the glass. This place is great and we will keep coming back!
