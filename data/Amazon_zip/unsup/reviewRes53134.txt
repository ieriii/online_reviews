The croquetas and empanadas got us off to a roaring start, especially the beef empanadas. The steak sandwich smothered in cheese and onions with a healthy portion of chimichuri was toasted in a luscious panini type bread. The joint also allows for BYOB. I truly enjoyed the ambience and will be back to try out the media noche sandwich.
