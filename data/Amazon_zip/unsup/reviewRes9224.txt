I absolutely LOVE this place! We come here at least once a month, the service is great (family owned, very friendly and they always remember us). The food never fails to amaze us! I think by now we've tried a little of everything on the menu :) We usually leave the place already making plans for our next visit. This is definitely my favorite Persian / Mediterranean restaurant. I HIGHLY recommend it!!!
