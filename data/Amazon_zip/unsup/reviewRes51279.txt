One of my favorite Mexican restaurants with great service, you might have to wait for for a table cause it gets packed. if your into soups, try the chicken soup perfect anytime or the chicken enchiladas. Great prices. if you complain, your a cheep a$$ and you should stay home. i rate this place 5 starts. i have been coming here for the past 20 years. i love it. i highly recommend this place. i will definitely be back.
