I cannot comment on the pizza, for I happen upon Piece while looking for a Saturday hangout with friends. As for their Saturday night entertainment, I have 3 words: Live. Band. Karaoke. We were walking down North when I heard Bohemian Rhapsody blasting from the door. Naturally, I stopped dead in my tracks, looked at my pals and said "Done. We're here for the night." I got an awesome beer with an innuendo-laced name (moose knuckle, maybe?) and sat back to watch the spectacle that is karaoke...only the people who sing here are ridiculously good! I didn't cringe or suffer from second-hand embarrassment once, which is I was completely anticipating. Anyhow, we had a great time and I def. plan on going back. I'm already rehearsing my awesomely bad rendition of "Hurts So Good"!
