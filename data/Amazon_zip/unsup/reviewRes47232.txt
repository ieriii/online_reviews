After a few visits this summer I can finally review Lockdown and give it a solid four stars. 1/2 price burgers on Tuesdays is awesome, but I usually end up making up the savings in a huge bar tab, hanging around watching Ronnie James Dio videos afterward! I have learned that I need to order burgers here Medium Well, or they end up a bit bloodier than I prefer, but the Hawaiian burger with grilled pork, pineapple and BBQ sauce is amazing! Service is absolutely on point, in this loud metal bar. It's Kuma's with half the wait! Seriously, at peak wait times on a Tuesday, we saw a group wait max. of 20 minutes. Booyah, Kuma's! They have a nice tap beer selection, or check in on Yelp or Foursquare and redeem for a free beer! I've grown to like this place for burgers or a pre-lube to the Bottle. Burgers and beer are on lockdown at Lockdown!
