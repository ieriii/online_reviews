My favorite Pizza place in Chicago. If it was not a bit far from my place I would be there way more often. Thin crust is just right. I've tried by now quite a few pizzas and enjoyed all. As a nice final touch you get a decent size cannoli. To be honest, I am not a big fan of cannoli but this one is something else.
