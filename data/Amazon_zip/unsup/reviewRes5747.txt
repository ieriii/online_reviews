I was recommended by a friend to check out Wildfire, and I am so glad I did! I really wanted a nice steak dinner during my first visit to the great city of Chicago. Being a Texas native, I am really picky when it comes to my red meat! Wildfire did not disappoint. I made a reservation through the Yelp app which was really easy to do, and we arrived at 8:45pm. We were seated within 15 minutes, and the place was really full which was a good sign. First thing I noticed was that they had a very vast menu full of choices - I went with the horseradish crusted filet (medium rare) paired with a caesar salad and au gratin potatoes. Not sure if this is a Chicago thing, but I noticed that medium rare wasn't as juicy and bloody as I am normally used to, and it lacked seasoning. In Texas I am used to my steaks being a bit more saltier, and medium rare means I can run my meat across the plate and sop up the juice! It wasn't just the restaurant's style because we went to another steakhouse the next day (see other review for Harry Caray's) and it was the same deal. Regardless it was a really good meal at a fun restaurant with a great atmosphere. You can dress casually, and although a bit pricey it is worth it. Great drink selection as well - I went with a local blonde. Service was a tad bit slow, but it's pretty busy and they bring out bread and butter to hold you over just like most steakhouses. If you order an appetizer the timing is right. Take time to peruse the beer and wine selections, or order a flight!
