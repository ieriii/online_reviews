Sat at the bar last night with 6 of my friends and we had a great time. I have to say that all the bartenders there were extremely nice. One of my biggest pet peeves are crappy bartenders! We all ordered dinner and were pleased with the food. I was absolutely in love with my meal. I had the Rainbow Trout and it was so yummy. We will be back!!!
