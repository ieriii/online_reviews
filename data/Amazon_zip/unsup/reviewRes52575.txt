I've been to them all (except Texas de Brazil since that's too damn far). Meat is pretty much consistent across all of these restaurants. Friends like pork at Sal and beef at Fogo... blah blah... we can debate until we're hungry about it. I've been to Brazzaz twice most recently since the gauchos also carry around damn good shrimp and even pineapples. I feel bad for the pineapple gaucho though since he's more of a novelty. People may reject him since pineapple is really just filler. I also do love the salad bar since they have good additions of rice, risotto, and sushi.  Plus, you can't beat the evening special PLUS they were giving out $25 coupons when our bill came.
