Oh yeah. I mean, really. I'm not a native Chicagoan, and as such can only eat Chicago style pizza occasionally. I've been trying every pizza joint around to find one place- just one that makes pizza with the kind of crust I like. Score! My husband, BIL and I went for lunch last week and ordered three types of pizza; white with anchovies, New Haven style with clams and mashed potato and bacon. I honestly could not tell you which was the best they were all so good. The beer list is great, but you'd better not go when you're in a rush- service takes forever.
