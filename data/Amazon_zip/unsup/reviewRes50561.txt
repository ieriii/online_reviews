Went here for dinner with my folks. I have heard some good things about their brunch and breakfast. So, maybe I should have tried it at those times. I was pretty disappointed with my meal overall. I got the crab cake dinner with mac n' cheese and fries. The food arrived cold. Nothing is worse than a cold crab cake and mac n' cheese. Flavor wise the mac n' cheese would have been good if warm but the crab cake left me sour. It looked to have crab in it but no real crab flavor...in fact no flavor at all. The 'sauces' they provided with the cakes were flavorless too.  Thankfully the hot sauce they had on the table provided some help. What surprised me was the service was good, though the place was pretty empty... So I'm not sure why my food came to me cold, unless it was improperly reheated, which scares me a bit. Now one saving grace was the dessert. My Ma wanted pie so how could I say no. I ordered the bread pudding. Which was delicious. It came out in a pie slice form, which I had never seen before. It was rich, soft and chewy, and the caramel sauce that came with it was a knock out. So the dessert leads me to believe maybe this is a place best reserved for brunch and dessert. Two of my favorite meals! So I'm not sure what to think if this place but for right now it lies in the, "Meh, I've experienced better." category.
