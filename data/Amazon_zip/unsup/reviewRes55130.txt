Used to be a HUGE fan of Wildfire, but the last two times I ate there the salad dressing was sour.  I even bought a bottle to take home when it was opened, the salad dressing was sour, it was returned and we received a second bottle, got it home opened it up and it was SOUR. You can have your Wildfire eeeeeccckkkk.
