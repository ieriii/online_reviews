Maybe I just don't appreciate good Cuban food but this place really doesn't do it for me at all. I've tried it 3 times now (I practically live next door) and each time I'm left with the same sentiment - 'meh'. I've tried 4 different sandwiches, all were decent but nothing remarkable and definitely overpriced. The empanadas weren't too my liking either nor were any of the other sides. Everything seemed bland and soggy. I may give this place another shot this summer but I'm resigned to 2 stars for now. I do give them credit renovating the nasty vacant hot-dog stand that occupied the space before they took over. The mural on the side of the building is beautiful and the interior decor is interesting as well.
