Dark but larger rooms in an older converted residential hotel. Bathroom was tight. Had a suite, though never sat in the dark LR. Tiny functional kitchenette, full fridge, lots of small closet space, king bed. Nice location at $160 a night. Relatively clean and quiet. Great for couples or small families on a budget. Money you save on groceries will pay for the $160 room rate.
