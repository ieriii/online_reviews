2/24/11 5:50pm - Cashier #002 - I was on way home from work last night and I decided to try Fox & Obel again. My last (3) visits I found the food to be either very bland or badly seasoned. I stayed away from the deli and chose the Buffalo Chicken Wrap ($6.99+) and Beef Chili ($4.00+) from the "What's New" cooler which is located by the $30.00 per pound Lobster tails. The wrap was terrible, the Buffalo season wasn't even close and it was so bad I just tossed it. They need to take the chicken out of the description, b/c there was barely any chicken in the wrap. You think the Chili would be like "grandma made it." Not even close. Whomever the Executive Chef is, he/she needs to do a tasing on all the "to-go" items. Also, I see many culinary employees smoking outside by the water. Do they really wash their hands when they return to work? Last night my visual experience is a "no" to my last question. Finally, some of them look pretty "grunge!" After tossing my dinner, I went to Subway and got a foot long sandwich with chips and a drink for $6.67. Fox & Obel , you need to go back to the basics and quit trying to be like Chef Rick Bayless...at least him food is seasoned to perfection and I do not toss it for a Subway. I'll never walk in your store again and I'll definitely will tell (10) people!
