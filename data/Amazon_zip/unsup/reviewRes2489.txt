On one of my many trips to chicago, I finally visited this place after seeing it on "No Reservations". The Foie Gras with Duck Sausage, I imagine this is what Crack is like. Since I've come back to NY, it is all I think about. I regret trying that first, because it lessened my taste for my other purchases that day. Not that they weren't good, but they couldn't compare. Duck fat fries are good, but the regular fries are also quite tasty.  Dying to return to Chicago. There was an opening 10:30 rush, and by 11:30 the line was around the corner. I arrived at 11 and waited only about 10 mins, and you can tell the 10:30 rush because all the tables emptied at about the same time. The owner is also very friendly when taking your order, great experience. He suggested I get a small soda since I was dining in and its free refills, great guy.
