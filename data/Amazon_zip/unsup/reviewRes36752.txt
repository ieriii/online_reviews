We ordered Indie Cafe to go, the first night we were in our new place. The crab rangoon was some of the best I've ever had! We'll have to get a double-order next time. My boyfriend, who was having Thai for the first time, had the basil chicken and it was pretty tasty and served with white rice. I always order green curry when getting Thai, and this one was nice. Not the best I've ever had (that one was homemade by a friend) because I feel it could have been spicier. Also, they don't have coconut rice, which is kinda a downer. That said, I would order the curry again, just spicier. The big plus, they deliver to us.
