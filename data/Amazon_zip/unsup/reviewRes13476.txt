Ohhhhh man. Round two at this place left me a seafood lover. I normally say I dont like seafood. I am just not that big of a fan, but this place has changed me.  I ordered the Charred Diablo Fish - which was Salmon with a Diablo Sauce, sprinkled with shrimp. I would eat this everyday. So much flavor in a great portion. I can't wait to come back and try other specials!
