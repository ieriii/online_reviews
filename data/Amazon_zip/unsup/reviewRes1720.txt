So, obviously everybody and their dog has reviewed this place and loved it. I have NEVER had anything bad there, the veggie dog isn't the best, but everything else is fan-f-ing-tastic. My favorite thing about Hot Doug's is that no matter what the line or the weather is like every. single. person. there. is happy. It is against an unwritten code to be a jerk there. I love it. In a city like Chicago where there are so many d-bags on every corner, taking sanctuary from them in a hot dog stand is heaven (and seemingly appropriate).  Not only do you leave Hot Doug's feeling satisfied and full, you also leave feeling a tiny bit better about humanity.
