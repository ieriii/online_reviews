I'm still loving the Publican. I made a last minute reservation for dinner, and ended up having to push it back twice... they were super accommodating! I was a little disappointed that they took the beets off the menu! We had the Little Gem Salad. I have to say that deep fried pig ears are delicious. It was pretty fantastic. We then had the shrimp and the dover sole. Both were perfection. I don't know why I don't come here more often. That's all.
