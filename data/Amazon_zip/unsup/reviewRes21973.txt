Went down to buy a gift certificate for a friend's birthday and grabbed some takeout. Even with it being very far from our house, we will definitely go back. We got a couple of empanadas (beef/potato and spinach) that were very tasty, and a couple of tico tacos (little taquitos with skirt steak inside, cheese and crisp shredded cabbage on top, and a weird but good mayo/ketchupish sauce). Everything was great, but the knockout was the oatmeal shake. Kind of like drinkable horchata-flavored oatmeal. Sounds strange, but it was very good (and I could see that being a very good stick-to-your-ribs, on-the-go breakfast). Nice guy at the counter, too -- clearly a guy who enjoys doing what he does. One word of warning -- they don't take credit cards, and the little ATM they have seems to have problems with Chase debit cards' magnetic stripes. The counter guy explained all of this, apologized profusely, and told us where we could go grab some cash quickly (the McDonald's up the block). Check it out -- it's very similar to Mexican food, but different enough to be really interesting. And you can either do the big entrees for $6-$12 or order a la carte -- the gift certificate aside, two of us ate pretty well for $15.
