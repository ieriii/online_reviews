I can't believe that it's only the first time I am having deep dish pizza. Well, I guess there's no better place to try it for the first time than right here in Chicago. Thanks to a coupon I got from the John Hancock Observatory, we scored an order of garlic sticks for free. Eating those garlic sticks while making that 45-minute wait for the pizza makes it so much more bearable. I thought the pizza's sauce was great and the sausage patty was quite decent, too. However, I thought the deep dish pizza was a bit pricey and I think I still prefer my pizza New York style.
