Had lunch with my family today to celebrate mothers day. I was expecting much with the restaurant since recommended by a friend. The loompya (egg roll) was not so good, the nasi goreng (fried rice with salmon) is not so exceptional but I love the salad crispy salmon, it's yummy. Ebi (sushi) is okay, while spicy "tail of two tunas" is good. No fruit juice for kids. When we got our check, 4 items totalling $60+ was added to our bill. Although the waitress apologized, they could have done better. Check what you ordered. The servers and attendants were exceptionally fiendly and fast service.The food are expensive. You'll enjoy more if you eat in Joy Yee's.I will definitely not recommend this to friends.
