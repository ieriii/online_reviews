I am trying to decide where to start with this review. Giordanos was by far the worst, and most disappointing, experience of my trip to Chicago. I am Italian and I enjoy all types of pizza... thin crust, thick crust, whatever, but Giordanos really let me down. I suppose I should start with the fact that my party of 4 people had to wait for nearly 1.5 hours at 7 PM to get a table, and once we were finally seated, there were empty tables everywhere. ...Or maybe the fact that we were encouraged to pre-order our pizza, only to have it come out at room temperature.  ...No, what I should really emphasize is that this is not a pizza at all. This idea of a "stuffed pizza" is a thin layer of crust, a nearly 2 inch layer of cheese, and a thin sprinkling of sauce. It was not good and left my stomach hurting for a solid two days. It tasted more like a giant mozzarella stick. For all that waiting, and the high price, I'd say save your money and go somewhere else.  Next time I'm in town, I'll have to try one of the other famous pizza joints.
