While the sushi is fair to middlin' - with an occassional innovative twist and the one-in-while off tasting piece of fish there are plenty of other great places within walking distance.It is with the service that this place really suffers, taking it's diners along for the bumpy ride. Though we have had a pseudo-friendly server occasionally it is the exception. Most present themselves as seeming far too cool for your time and are brusque and, at times, rude. Even if one craves sushi which is accompanied with a side of cool, as I admit I occasionally do, there are far better places that do the cool with a least passing interest in your enjoyment as a diner.
