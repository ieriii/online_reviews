Great, great food as everyone has already noted. But I am not going to pander to masses on the quality of service. My rating of two stars is relative to my expectations on the overall experiece (food, service, atmosphere, feeling during meal) and cost. Clearly it is an amazing restaurant but from my perspective it did not live up to the accolades.The bottom line is the service was just not up to par. The staff was very rigid and made me uncomfortable from the minute I sat down. The wine steward actually insulted me when I made a joke about desert wine not being Chateau d'yquem ( he said that some people only look from brands... - even if true that was a serious b-slap to a customer). In the end the Chef came out and prepared our desert (which was amazing) but barely said a word - zero personality. Not much of a total experience. To be fair if this was a lessor restaurant it would not be as much an issue but for the best restaurant in North America...well I hope it is not because I will hang my hat up on fine dining.As a side note the upselling of the wine pairing was not really worth the extra. It was actually kind of cheesy the way they introduced the idea half way though the meal. Why was there a better wine pairing that they are holding back when I am already spending 400 per person? I guess they wanted me to be 4 glasses down before asking. All in all not what I expected.The other 3 couples I was with were also disappointed. Hope future patrons of Alinea do better. Happy eating (and drinking).
