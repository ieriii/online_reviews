This place is awesome. Generous portions for such cheap prices. The appetizers are all so great. We also had the entrana last time and it is delicious! Not many options for vegetarians but the carnivores loved it. The drinks come in great too. We have now been there quite a few times now. The waiters are all friendly but we had a great experience with one waiter in particular, Miguel - he went to lengths to make sure we were comfortable. The only reason I give this place 4 stars is because it doesnt have too many options for vegetarians. Overall great experience everytime we go there.
