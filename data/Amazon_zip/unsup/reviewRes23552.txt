Came here some months ago...my sis treat ;) I had never been to a greek restaurant before and I must say I really liked it,,,the food was so yummy...and the decor is so nice,,,,its fam oriented...and it could also be perfect for a nice date...the only one thing I did not like was the valet parking,,,The guys wherent the most friendly,,,and asked too many questions,,,ummm which was weird...but I would definetely come here again,,,
