Great korean style chicken and excellent sauces. Quick for pickup but difficult to get a table on the weekend. Crisp is my go-to for football sundays and trumps any other rotisserie or fried chicken in the area. The only reason i didn't give 5 stars was because of the lack of variety. Theres really only 2 sauces besides the buffalo sauce and the sides could be better.
