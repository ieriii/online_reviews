This place is great for anything from dinner with the parents to a night out in the neighborhood for drinks. The large leather chairs and darker, browsing room/library feel is a huge plus. I've also been told they have a high quality sound system.In terms of food, everything I've had here is delicious: iceberg wedge salad, mac and cheese, portobello mushroom sandwich, chop salad, spinach cheese dip (YUM!), and the apple crisp dessert (YUM YUM!). The only down side is that there aren't many non-breakfast options for vegetarians on the brunch menu.Another huge plus: awkward date people watching. For some reason every time I'm there, there are a bunch of couples that seem to be on awesomely bad dates.
