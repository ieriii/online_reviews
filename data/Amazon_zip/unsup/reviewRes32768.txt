i know people love to hate on the chicago diner, but my first defense would be this: the people who work here are diligent, friendly, very hard working, always pleasant, and sincere in their service. the food, mostly hits but sometimes some misses (that vegan chicken wing appetizer was a hideous disaster!). the specials are always seasonal and creative, they always have raw options, and the deserts are generally amazing. all in all, one of my favorite vegan stops in chicago. not a total orgasm, but for sure a fun and satisfying roll in the hay.
