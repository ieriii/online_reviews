Can't say enough good about this place. Took a couple of friends from LA. We went at opening. We got there at 10am and at 10:20am a line began to form. After they opened the door, we ended up 5th in line. When we left 45 minutes later, there was a line around the corner and up the block. Absolutely amazing - the lines and the food. I don't like waiting in any line, but this place is worth it. Best encased meats I've ever had. Duck fat fries? Addictive. The is 1 problem with this place - it's hard to make up your mind what to eat. I wanted to try one of everything. When it gets warmer, I'll be back...and standing in line.
