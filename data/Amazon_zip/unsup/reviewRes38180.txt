So....we ran an "errand" (meaning 45 minutes away from the restaurant) after we placed our order and still had to wait for another 20 min after returning to our seats. Food was pretty good, although if you have had any sort of heart issues or are predisposed to health ailments (a la, heart attack) I would stay away from their pizza. Service is lacking, atmosphere is like pizza hut, food is good, but heavy.
