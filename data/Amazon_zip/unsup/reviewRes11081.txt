I love this place....a lot. The pizza is delicious. We tried a medium red pizza and a medium white pizza for a group of four people and it was enough food for a party of eight light eaters.  We arrived at 6pm on a Saturday night and had to wait for an hour. The place was packed and it was was difficult to shove our way to the bar. However, it was well worth the wait. We were seated, ordered promptly and the server brought our pizza to the table quickly. It is a noisy place. Saturday nights there is also live band karaoke there. So be warned, this place fills up fast!
