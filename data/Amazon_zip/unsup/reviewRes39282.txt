An overall "solid" Korean restaurant, that specializes in BBQ. They have the largest spread of panchan of any Korean Places that i've been to (although not as much as the Garden Buffet, but that doesn't count). I've had stews, do it yourself BBQ, kitchen cooked BBQ, and all has been good. I like their kalbi better if they cook it for you in the kitchen.. which is strange for a bbq place, but that one dish in particular tends to be better. The staff can be a bit cold, but that's typical for Korean places. Just smile at them and they lighten up :)
