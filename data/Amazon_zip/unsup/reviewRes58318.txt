Well, I would love to give this place a 4 or 5 star because their food is pretty good. However, there service is a complete joke. My fiance and I order delivery from Sultan's frequently. They take forever and when they finally get to you, your order isn't right. Mine has been correct once or twice out of a dozen times. All I order is the Lamb Shwarma with hot sauce and tahini. They always, always, always forget the Tahini.So, tonight I decided to call. The service I received made me so mad! The phone guy begins by saying I take customer service very seriously. After I explained that I was sick of my order getting wrong, he says Well, you have to understand. We get busy and we offer cheap food. What the hell does that mean? I'm a server. I work in the industry and I think that getting someone's order right isn't a stretch. It's pretty much the foundation of eating anywhere or ordering anything.He refused to give me his name or his manager's name after he got down right insulting and mocking.Do yourself a favor and head to Greek-town... the counter staff and management makes this place a joke.
