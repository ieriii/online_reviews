I guess Yolk is now technically a chain, and in general I don't love chains, but I *LOVE* Yolk. Yes, it's always busy- because it is FANTASTIC. Delicious coffee, fresh-squeezed juices, good service, but most importantly they have a huge menu with something for everybody. I almost always have the banana bread french toast (how did no one think of this before?) served with peanut butter. Sooo good. Portions are huge; good for sharing or for mopping up the excesses of the night before. Because of the large size of this location they can usually accommodate big parties if you wait long enough (and you will have to wait!) Yum.
