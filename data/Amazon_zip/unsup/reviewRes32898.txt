We usually head to Ras Dashen for ethiopian but decided to try Demera since its close to where we live. We were seated immediately and given water. The guy that seated us mentioned he was part owner/ manager or something to that affect, gave us menus and took off. He didn't come around much and we waited and waited to ask questions about specials and sample plates. He finally comes, we ask our questions and are told to write our choices down on the paper tablecloth.  We ordered a sample plate for 2 that included 6 options. The food came pretty quickly but waiter wasn't able to identify the piles of food. We knew what we ordered but wasn't sure which pile was what. The food is ok, but we'll continue to go to Ras Dashen as their food was more flavorful. The few times our waiter guy came around, he was pleasant. Will I go here again? Probably not.
