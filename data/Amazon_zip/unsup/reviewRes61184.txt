OMG....this was the best pizza I have EVER eaten! I am NOT a fan of deep dish so we ordered the thin crust with hamburger, spinich, and mushrooms. Although it was pricey it was well worth it......and to top it off the service was great! Since returning to Texas, I have not been able to make myself go out for pizza. I have had good pizza but it just doesn't measure up to GIno's East! I definitly recommend the thin crust over the deep dish. It looks like they only ship the deep dish across the country but if they shipped the thin crust I would jump on the opportunity!
