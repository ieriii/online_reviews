This hotel is with in walking distance of just about everything but that is pretty much where the praise ends. The rooms and beds are super tiny. The bed felt comfortable when we sat down on it but we woke up in pain every morning. We found this hotel as part of a secret deal on Hotwire and because of that I feel we were given a room next to the elevator, and I mean right next to the elevator. Any time and at all hours we could hear the elevator chime and whoever was in the hall way. Even the elevators in this hotel were small but at least there were 3. The walls were also extremely thin and on several occasions we could hear the couple in a room by ours having sex. The staff was friendly and the rooms were clean. I also appreciate that this hotel was eco friendly but it seems like they took a Holiday Inn, put some fancy light fixtures in the lobby, slapped an eco friendly brand on it and called it 4 stars. I wouldn't recommend this hotel or stay there again, not at least for the price we paid.
