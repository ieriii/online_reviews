Hopleaf is by far my most favouritest place here in Chicago, but i dare not go too often, as it's an impeccable place to shoo your diet away and load up on creamy, carby, deliciousness.  If you haven't been here.... you are just silly! Don't be overwhelmed by the beer menu. It is large, yes. But the descriptions they provide are right on and the servers will always assist you. The menu is seasonal and it is so fantastic. I dream about frites and aioli.
