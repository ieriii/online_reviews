Fabulous Italian food.  Mia Francesca is one of the best Italian restaurants in the city and is a great date spot or place to bring out of town visitors since it doesn't disappoint. The service is great and the open kitchen makes the experience completely authentic. I dropped it down to 4 stars because the restaurant itself is very small and somewhat crowded and there is almost always a wait (can't they expand out a bit?!?). But their food really is hard to beat!
