My first time at 90 miles about a year ago wasn't a bad experience which is why I gave it an extra star. However I dined there yesterday with some friends and had a horrible time which will prevent me from ever coming back. My main problem was with the service. We waited for over 45min to get our food and our appetizer never came. Our waitress only checked with us once and apologized only after we were finished eating. We waited so long to get our bill that we just got up and left to pay at the register. The table next to us was also experiencing issues with another waiter and apparently got the wrong food. So basically not worth a second trip. The food also tasted much blander than before and they forgot to put plantains on my lechon sandwich. I would say try the one of Clybourn if anything.
