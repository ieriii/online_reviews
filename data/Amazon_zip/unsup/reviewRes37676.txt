Excellent meat, fish, and prepared foods (although all are a little pricier than Whole Foods), but their selection of high-quality staple foods is uneven. For example, they have about 150 kinds of balsamic vinegar, but only about three kinds of canned tomatoes, none of them the good San Marzano kind. If you're starting with crappy canned tomatoes, it's not going to matter whether your balsamic vinegar was aged for so long in such-and-such a barrel in such-and-such a country.
