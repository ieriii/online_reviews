I hate to do it. I live 1 block away. But their cafe menu is an embarrassment to this fine establishment. Had their angus burger with blue cheese, medium rare. It came out well done with BARELY a half ounce pinch of blue cheese. REALLY!?!? I get more cheese on a cheeseburger from McDonald's Dolla Menu! Sweet potato fries were not cooked. And I got maybe 12 fries in the order (remember, it's also a $2 upcharge!). Note to self: Order 12 dolla double cheeseburgers at McDon'ts down the block for the same shit food....or go 1 block west to Boston Blackies. Hell, even Reagle Beagle cooks up a decent burger for $8 (plus ample exotic toppings!). I'd rather eat at Denny's at this point.
