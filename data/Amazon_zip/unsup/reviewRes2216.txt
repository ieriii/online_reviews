Doug has dragged the traditional corner hot dog stand kicking and screaming into the twenty-first century without losing the fun and taste of the original. A regular hot dog is only a buck and a half and is available steamed, grilled, deep-fried, or deep-fried AND grilled. Caramelized onions are not only available, they're standard issue. The fries are nothing short of perfect -- hand-cut and not too greasy. The specials are what set Hot Doug's apart, however. Sausages made with exotic meats and topped with unusual sauces and cheeses are on the menu side by side with the rest of the fast food fare. The nostalgic decor is heavy on sausage and Elvis memorabilia. The mens room has a picture of a bun with a hot dog in it -- the ladies room, an empty bun. Hot Doug's is a MUST for any serious hot dog lover!
