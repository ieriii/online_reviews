Went here once for brunch. Nice place. Menu was nice and had variety. I got the crab cakes w/ poached egg on a muffin. My wife had the chiliquiles. Both very good. The waitress was nice, she comped our dessert b/c she forgot to ask us if we wanted it. So that was very nice of her. Would go again for brunch and might try their dinner menu.
