For a place that serves a $30 sandwich, one would expect at the very least the bathrooms would have properly working locks. Or in my case, a lock at all. But Bin 36 seems to suffer slight dementia when it comes to anything outside the wine and cheese realm and therefore dining stalwarts we oh-so-often take for granted (i.e. prompt service, decent portion sizes and updated bathrooms) have long been lost in this minimalist River North space. The goat cheese flight was tasty. However, accompanying our four smears and slabs was a bowl of nuts so large, I don't even have to make an inappropriate joke here. More nuts than necessary and not enough fruit. The half chicken that was ordered - it wasn't dry, but it also wasn't juicy. Not seasoned, but not bland. It was nothing to write home about. And those $30 sandwiches? Open-faced soft shell crab. The crab was tiny and my two colleagues joked they were still hungry after dinner. The saving grace was the dessert wine which accompanied the roasted strawberries my boss ordered after our mains. Having taken way too long to come out from the kitchen, he wolfed it down in seconds and then we all twiddled our thumbs while our waiter followed the strawberry route and took loads of time forgetting to come ask if we wanted the check. It wasn't busy - it was a Tuesday night at 8pm. I had no expectations for this place, but nothing will ever pull me back to try it again. Go for dessert and pair it with a sweet wine, otherwise, Fulton's or Flatwater would be better by-the-river choices.
