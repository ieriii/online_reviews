Bin 36 is a solid wine bar that is definitely a cool place to meet up with friends or maybe a date. The crowd is mellow and usually a little bit older than my normal bar crowds (sorry, I mean like 30s, I'm 24). The staff is pleasant and does a good job of keeping up with clearing glasses, taking new orders and keeping your really cardboardesque bread sticks fresh. Couple of issues here, though. While there is nothing that I would describe as bad here, the wine list feels small. I am used to a much wider selection of available wines - they go pretty heavy on the popular wines (pinot noir dominates the selections for reds) and only had a few of the more hard to find varietals available. This is not to say you won't find any, but I happen to prefer trying interesting and different varietals when I order by the 2.5 oz pour, it makes it more fun. And that is what I like about wine bars - the variety. I would have also liked if the staff was more willing to talk a little bit about the wines with you or to offer some suggestions. These are both very personal complaints and might be completely not a turn off to others (and by all means, I will come back here). They do have an incredible cheese selection. My friend and I ordered the Bin 36 regular cheese selection and we were pleased (the one with lavender and coffee on the outside was awesome in the strangest way). All the wines that I did try were well chosen by whoever puts together their list - tried 8 and all 8 were very pleasant. I will also say I like that any wine can come in a 2.5oz pour so I could try quite a few. As for the small wine store, the selection seems even tinier than the bar (I could be wrong but that is the impression I get) and I have always felt like I'm being robbed when I buy a bottle.
