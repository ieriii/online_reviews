My family likes to come here often and recently I visited with friends. They can accommodate groups on busy Saturday nights (I don't think they take reservations) and the wait staff is very tolerant of large groups of diners. The menu is large and offers a wide variety of authentic Greek food. I usually stick to lamb or seafood dishes and can't complain about any of the food choices I have made here. I particularly recommend the Mediterranean sea bass and the grilled octopus for entrees. The atmosphere here is always festive and is very family friendly. This is a good standby if you like Greek food and are looking for a place that a group would enjoy. And, they have free valet parking, in case you missed the photo.
