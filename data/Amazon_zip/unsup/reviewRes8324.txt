I have been here several times. Each time I've had excellent service and excellent food. The pizza is, as far as I know, authentic Italian style. I've had many different types and have not been disappointed at all. Spacca Napoli also has a reasonably priced wine list.  This is really, really good stuff. If you think Pizza Hut knows how to make a pizza, this place is not for you.
