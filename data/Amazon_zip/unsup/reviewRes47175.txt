Lockdown definitely lives up to the hype! We happened to go here on Tuesday night and the burgers were half price. Wowow!! We had 2 giant meals and drinks - all for under $20.00. My husband had the elvis inspired burger with PB, banana and bacon. He ate the entire thing and loved every bite. I opted for the slider sampler. I couldn't decide on a burger and liked this option since the chef picked them (took all the pressure off me to pick the best burger). They were three huge sliders. I could only eat one. It was BBQ, bacon and chedder - pretty basic but the flavor of the meat was great and it was cooked to perfect. My husband had the other two the next night and loved them. Can't wait to go back.
