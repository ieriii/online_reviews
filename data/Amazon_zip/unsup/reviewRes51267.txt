Ive been to Garcia's twice. If you want bland, boring, generic mexican food this is your place. If you want fast but totally impersonal service this is your place. If you want a loud echo chamber of a dining room, this is your place.  Here's the thing, Chicago is home to some really great mexican restaurants. Even the near vicinity of Garcia's has far superior mexican restaurants. Los Napoles right around the corner on Western is FANTASTIC! Why anyone would choose Garcia's over that or many other places is beyond me. Sure, its right on the square, its never hard to get a table, its ultra kid-freindly but the food and the atmosphere are mediocre at best.  The guacamole was straight out of a bag and clearly not made fresh. The beans have virtually no taste. The burritos, while huge, are very bland.  What they have going for them: Location (right in lincoln square) Low Prices Size What is not good: Pretty much everything else. There are 2 things that would dramatically turn this place around. 1. FOOD!!! Add some spice! Get creative! do something interesting! MAKE YOUR GUACAMOLE FRESH!! 2. Atmosphere!!! Add some acoustical panels on the walls or hang some tasteful sound baffles, the place is far too tall with no absorptive material anywhere...this creates an atmosphere that is very loud, very cold, full of echos.  Overall, its just not comfortable.  I might stop in there again if im pressed for time, in the square, and just want to fill up on some cheap mexican food but otherwise I wont go back unless they change the above 2 issues.
