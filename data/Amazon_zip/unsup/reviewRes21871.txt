A big thank u to my fellow yelpers, that torta ahogada is out of control delish. 3 days later I'm still drooling for a new one. I'm normally adverse to wet sandwiches but this was toasted to a lovely perfection. I was not terribly impressed with churros. Let's be clear tho, they were good, but nothing I haven't had in any street corner in Mexico. What was amazing was dipping it into the chocolate almendrado. The Bacon ice cream didn't have much Bacon flavor, but that crumble was absurdly delicious. Pork belly Caldo was good, but come on, it's pork belly. A Lot of flavor In that chicken Pozole, happy to see a mix of dark and light meat in that. Mr. Bayless, you are all that is promised, I will be back soon.
