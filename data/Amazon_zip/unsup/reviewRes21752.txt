My boyfriend raves about this joint...so, we just had to try it out. I went here with my siblings as they are from out of town and decided to go do touristy things so we ended up here. Parking was chaotic as the lot was a decent size but it was packed to the max! I approached the restaurant and first thing that came to mind was "this is it?!" The building for the venue was tiny. You are not able to sit "inside", so you order and try to find a table (the hardest part if you're planning on eating there since they only have 2-3 picnic tables). Once you walk in, you approached the counter to order immediately. You have to know what you want before you enter as the space is small and standing to make a decision easily holds up the line. The menu was small but it's what you get for a dawg joint. Personally, I think the cost of the hotdogs was quite high since it's just a hotdog. FYI - if you only carry plastic, this place isn't for you since they only carry cash. The cooks were quite speedy with their preparation of the meals so we didn't have to wait long. After getting the meals, finding the table was another story. After waiting for about 10 minutes, we finally got to sit down to see what Superdawgs had in store for us. The meal just seemed original to me. It was just another hotdog. I even got a hamburger to test it out and yet again, I wasn't as highly impressed at the BF. Nothing much to say about the food as it was just original. All in all, I wouldn't go back here for the price and original quality of food but if I were in the area, I wouldn't mind stopping by.
