I go to Depaul and the food sure does get boring around here. I decided I wanted something different. And Simply It, simply did it for me. I ordered the lunch combo for pick up. The person on the phone told me 10 to 15 minutes but I did come in before that and my food was already done when I came in. The food was delicious, fresh, healthy, and pretty cheap. How awesome can it get? The person at the counter did tell me that they take reservations for group lunches. Sounds really good to me. I will have to come in with my friends one of these day.
