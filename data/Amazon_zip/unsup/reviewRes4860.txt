I have to say I am sooooo sad to write this review but also pretty angry. My girlfriend and I have been really excited to try the Purple Pig out. We've heard great things and decided to take go today, a Monday afternoon at around 3pm. We were seated right away at a two-top outside which was great.. what was NOT great is that after over 10-15 MINUTES no server had approached us. What made it sting is that a few servers had made their rounds between the few customers they had and slowly passed by us, made eye contact, and walked on by. So we left! What a let down. A server should approach your table between 30 seconds and 1 minute after you have been seated (we work in the industry as well and work right down the street). Someone could have at least said "I'm sorry I'll be right with you" , but nothing. Our server missed out a pretty decent sale as we were going to order a ton of food and a bottle of wine and a fat tip would have come their way. I sure hope other people don't get the same treatment.
