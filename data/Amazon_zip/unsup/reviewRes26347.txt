I had a really lovely dinner here with two friends on Monday.  The food: to start we ordered the Bon Vivant Platter (an assortment!), and for the main courses we shared the Catfish in a Clay Pot and Simply It's Beef. The food was delicious! The catfish came with lots of veggies in an amazing caramel and garlic sauce. The beef was very tender and very flavorful. I would order either again! The place is BYOB, always a nice perk. The service was good too. The only negative was no air conditioning (an important consideration if it's really hot outside), and the portions were pretty small. If there had been a big eater present, we would have needed twice as much food. I definitely look forward to going back.
