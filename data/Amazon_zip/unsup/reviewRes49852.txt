Went there for an anniversary dinner. Partner and I are big foodies and found ourselves delighted with each course and the wine pairings. Great laid back atmosphere that combines casual sophistication and good service. All of our courses were perfectly prepared, interesting, and combined to make for a full and wonderful experience. Well worth the price, although, it's not that expensive
