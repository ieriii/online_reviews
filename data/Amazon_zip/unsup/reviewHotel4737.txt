Newer hotel, cosmopolitan decorum. Nice rooms (little small), good staff, good locations. Short walk to public transportation that will take you to most city sites and shopping. Did not notice any Hotel bar or restaurant, lobby is kind of small but comfortable. Short walk (4-6 blocks) to some of Chicago's popular restaurants and clubs. Only con, as usual in Chicago, is parking. Parking in downtown Chicago is a B***h, thanks to Mayor Dayle. Parking is tight and expensive. Closes parking I could find was 4 blocks away (this is why valet parking is so expense at all of the downtown hotel). Unless you really need a car its best to leave it at home and use what public transportation is available (bus, taxi, shuttle, etc)
