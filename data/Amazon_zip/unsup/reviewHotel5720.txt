Nice hotel, but honestly I've had better experiences with the brand. The ups: -comfy beds -plenty of towels -pretty good price for location -good decor -key card access elevators -Great food districts in walking distance (randolph st, french market) -free wireless internet The downs: -outlets in the room were loose, including the bathroom -drone of constant highway traffic noise from outside. In the pits: -horrendously rank homeless guy dropping bricks in the first floor lobby bathroom, walked out without anyone even approaching him. ~$40 valet parking (what????) I can almost get my monthly pass for that much where I'm from!
