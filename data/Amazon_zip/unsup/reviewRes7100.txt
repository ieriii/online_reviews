Initial Disclosure: I'm vegetarian, so I did not try a majority of the items. However, what I did try was above par. The onion strings were crispy and salty--so very delicious, probably the best I can recall ever having. The pig powder chips actually have no pig in them, they are just potato chips cooked til brown and seasoned, and they were ok. The salad was way above average and great, and the macaroni and cheese was good, but didn't rock my world. The cornbread was very delicious and not at all grainy and very moist. The homemade lemonade was very good too. We had a sampling of all of the desserts, which were great too. If you are vegetarian be aware that one of the cookies has bacon in it, and the pound cake club also has bacon in it. I realize that vegetarians are not the target customers, given that it is a bbq place. However, I'll probably go back with other people, and it would be great to have a vegetarian entre next time. Seems like a black bean burger would fit in pretty well with the rest of the menu. With an option like that, I would bump this to a 5 star rating. The atmosphere is really great. It's definitely more upscale than an average bbq place, but does not cross over in any way into being prissy or pretentious. I described the decor as how I would want my South Carolina summer house to be decorated (you know, should I ever have one of those). Service was very, very friendly. Hopefully this place will be a great success!
