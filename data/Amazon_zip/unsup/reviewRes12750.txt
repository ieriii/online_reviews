I thought I was going to a bar but luckily mentioned to my roommate where I was going before I left..."Isn't that a nice Cuban restaurant?"..Uh, what? I got it mixed up with a place down the street! So I arrived to see my friends, who incidentally I hadn't seen for 4 years! The place was lively and smelled awesome! There was about 10 of us and we sat in our own little space which had just our table. It was nice but I would have liked to be out in the crowd more but that's just me. I ordered a sangria to start. It was really yummy and fruity. For my entree I ordered the Ropas Viejas. Shredded beef that came with black beans, rice and the best plantains ever! I also ordered a side of Tostones. The tostones were good but I've had better. The ropas were really good though. My friend, the birthday boy, got the pork chops which was a massive chop(he saved half for a meal tomorrow) grilled and served with sweet potatoes. Good service & great food. I want to come back under more casual circumstances and maybe share some appetizers and sangria!
