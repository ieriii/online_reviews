I don't really know much about Indian food. I have only been to a few restaurants so I don't know how to this place compares with other Indian restaurants nor can I attest to its authenticity. From what I know about other restaurants, it's a good sign if you see Italians eating at an Italian restaurant, Chinese people eating at a Chinese restaurant or even pirates and sailors eating at a seafood restaurant. That being said, there were a lot of Indian people eating here so I assume it was about as authentic as you are going to get. The crab curry I had was excellent, as was the rice that came with it. Almost every dish I saw at other tables looked great, they even looked better than mine. The service was as good as you are going to get anywhere else so no complaints there. I would definitely eat here again but there are some factors that may inhibit that: A. the mixed drinks were $9. Of course, I didn't know they were $9 until the bill came at the end of the night and I ended up spending over $100 for two people. B. Parking. There is no free parking. I believe the lot next door charged me $12; I can't believe that valet would be any cheaper. I do believe they are close enough to the Redline Grand stop so that could work. The fact that I live a few blocks south of Devon will probably keep me from returning to India House unless I happen to already be downtown. That and when I do return I'll get one of those 40oz Indian beers instead of Gin and Sodas.
