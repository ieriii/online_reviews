I've wanted to try Yolk for awhile, and with my parents in town, finally got a chance to check it out. After a 25 minute wait (pretty standard for Sunday), we sat down at a table in the back. The restaurant was definitely busy, but the tables seemed to be turning over relatively quickly, so the wait didn't bother us. The menu had a huge array of breakfast items, and it was interesting to see that salmon is a focus in quite a few dishes. Here's what we had: Huevos rancheros - SO good; fresh jalapenos and perfectly cooked eggs Salmon scramble - rich and flavorful, but could do without the cream cheese French toast - AMAZING Ham omelet - delicious and served with a side of fruit Fresh squeezed juice The portion sizes were quite large (only my dad finished), and the prices were super reasonable. Would definitely recommend Yolk as one of my new favorite breakfast spots in the city.
