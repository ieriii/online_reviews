The meat was mostly OK, a few of the offerings were a bit overcooked. The staff are attentive and polite. Our waiter talked so fast that we couldn't understand what he was saying and there was a mis-communication about getting plates. That guy basically just judged us the whole evening. Since the waiters are trained to offer you something every time you turn that chip over, it ends up that a lot of people are standing around the room staring at you while you eat. When we got there it wasn't crowded at all so that might have been part of it. I only drank ice tea and had a coffee after eating and it was $60, which I think is too much to spend - even for endless meat. Part of the problem is if you have, say, three pieces of meat on your plate you can either keep getting more meat (which means your three pieces go cold) or you can just eat those three, which are either very thinly cut strips or two-bite kabob-style servings, so if you eat them you have to flip your chip over again and again to feel like you're getting your money's worth. Eating those little slivers of meat doesn't feel satisfying at all, though, and it's kind of like eating endless samples but never getting to tear into any real meaty goodness. I'm not a fan of having people hover over me at all, much less when I'm trying to have a conversation with friends and eat. The food was really only just OK, and overall I don't think it's worth the money. I'd rather spend the same amount of money and go to Lawry's where the staff is attentive but not invasive.
