Drool. From the Falafel to the Kefta, you can't really go wrong with anything on the menu. It's got that taste that tells you "oh man, this hole-in-the-wall grub tastes really ethnic... I've got some Immodium at home right??". But you don't end up needing any. None at all. Because you're probably too stuffed to fully digest all the miscellaneous camel parts you just ate. You western, imperialist pig. (Come back again soon!) Sad to hear the place has gone downhill lately, I last lived in Bucktown in 2005, and have been dreaming of Sultan's since.
