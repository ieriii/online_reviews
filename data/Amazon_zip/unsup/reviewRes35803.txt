Our first trip to Shaw's was last night for my hubby's birthday. We had made reservations on the "fancy" side but when we showed up there was a blues band on the oyster side. We decided to forgo the reservation and easily got a seat on the oyster side.  This place was BUSY for a Tuesday night. The ambiance was crowded and loud, but it wasn't the annoying type of crowded and loud. The band was great and the service was fawesome. We asked so many questions and our waiter answered them all completely.  So we decided to get the lobster dinners for 2 people becasue-get this- it was cheaper than the crab dinner!!! They start you off with lobster bisque and end you with key lime pie. Anyhoo, hubby has some family in Maine and asked the waiter if we could get the lobsters un-opened. Thanks hun, I was really hoping to work for my meal.... I digress, after much cracking and twisting and pulling and squeezing we got OODLES of yummy lobster meat. I didn't even attempt the corn or potatoes on the plate. After that they brought us full sized wet napkins to wash off the carnage. (much more useful than the regular wet wipes) Key lime pie was for dessert and I was so stuffed I needed a nap. If you are looking for a nice lobster dinner go for it!
