I live down the street and just ate there for the first time. (on a Tuesday) I had a great experience. The list of draught beers is better than Crust and rivals Hop Leaf or Publican. It is better than Feed the Beast (the previous tenants of the space) but let's stop comparing to FTB. These are new owners with a new plan. Bad Apple is burgers and beer but they are very serious about both. The list of bottle beers, if you ever get that far, is amazing. They are pulling no stops on quality. There is Tripel Karmeliet on tap and Kwak in bottles, along with an impressive selection of domestic craft brews. I sat at the bar and got to see the selection of "house wines" along with their spirits - the entire bar is top shelf. The prices are perfectly reasonable, maybe even cheap for this kind of quality. I ordered a burger with arugula, tomato, and blue cheese - according to the menu it's named after their butcher. Again it was excellent. it's not a boatload of food, like you can get at the taps across the street in either direction, but ultimately it was the right amount and the quality was far better. The burger was cooked exactly how I wanted it. The bleu cheese was real not the crap that usually gets thrown on a burger. The fries were perfect. If you like Hop Leaf then you should definitely give Bad Apple a try. If you want to impress out-of-towners with the city experience or just want really great food and drink without going broke then do likewise.
