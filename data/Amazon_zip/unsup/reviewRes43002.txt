Wow! I have now had the best stuffed pizza in Chicago. The crust is a bit thicker on the bottom, which I love.. there's actually something there rather than the thin cardboard others use. The cheese is perfection and the sauce and herbs are AMAZING. Delivery is sloooww (90 minutes to Old Town), but the pizza arrived wrapped in foil and very hot (burned my mouth.. oops). Free liter of pepsi too.. This is my new favorite!
