There is nothing like popping into Fox & Obel before a movie w/friends, picking up several mini bottles of amazing sparkling sake, and then watching Die Hard while imbibing said beverages. Granted - they did cost 15 dollars a piece. However, for providing me with the opportunity to drink sparkling sake during a movie, I give Fox & Obel 4 stars.
