This was my first venture into Ethiopian cuisine really, so I had no idea what to expect, but what a great surprise. Wonderful food: interesting, well cooked and presented. My wife found the Teff bread to be a bit acidic, but that's just the nature of it, having tried it at a few other places since. Other reviewers have faulted the service, and it was a bit... tentative at first, but she seemed to warm up a lot as the meal progressed - so overall I was quite happy with her.We'd definitely go back.
