It is often said that change is good, however unfortunately when it comes to the new chef at Graham Elliot that is not the case. What was once one of my favorite restaurants in the city has now been marked off my list. My husband and I dined at GE six months ago and had an amazing experience. Endless amounts of truffle popcorn was complimentary, there were plenty of a la carte options to choose from, the service was warm and friendly, and we walked out not wanting to eat for the next week. We couldn't wait to go back for more! Last night we took a group of friends to dine at Graham Elliot and were underwhelmed to say the least. Apparently a new chef was brought in a numerous changes have been made. They now only offer four appetizers and four entrees a la carte, and are really pushing the tasting menus. The appetizer and entree portions were smaller and more pricey from what we remembered. And, the biggest bummer is there is no longer complimentary yummy popcorn brought to the table. Our service was just average. In my opinion, for these prices one should have more food options available, excellent service, and not leave hungry. There are many other places in this city you can go to where you can get immaculate food for these prices and have a more elaborate experience. Sorry Graham Elliot, but I am no longer a fan.
