My girlfriend and I were in town for Lollapalooza this weekend. We were looking for breakfast and not knowing the city or area, we stumbled upon The 3rd Coast. We loved it the first time, and came back for breakfast two more times during our stay! Food was great: we tried something different each visit. Our server(s) were also great. Thanks!
