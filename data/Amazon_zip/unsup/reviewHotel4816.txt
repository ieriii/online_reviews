Disappointed. The Wit should feel the way I'd feel if I failed a test in school. From begining to end they failed in customer service. I felt like an unwelcomed guest in a strangers home. When talking to a hotel Manager I felt unheard and undervalued. Bottom line I wanted a nice experience and ended up regretting I hadn't stayed somewhere else. Although, the bath tub was nice.
