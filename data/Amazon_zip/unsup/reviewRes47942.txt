This is a suburban chain that people in the city are willing to wait in line for? I am confused. I have been here over half a dozen times and everytime, the service is either subpar or downright embarrasingly bad. The bartender I had this evening acted like a teenager, poor manners and poor customer service and just downright amateur. Don't let the line and the ridiculous velvet rope outside fool you (this is a suburban chain, remember, just like PF Changs, why wait? go to Nomi or someplace with a bit more class) the upstairs is always dead or filled with cougars with trout pout. This is not sexy, this is desperate and sad. The last time I was there, the line outside was around the block but I made it upstairs and was told that the reason they had flow control was due to the fact that they ran out of barware. This place is poorly managed and making a ton of mistakes along the way. And it is quite obvious that a majority of the bartenders here are working their first tending job because the service is downright awful. you'd get better service at a divebar.  Be wary. My crew left and we went to the Nomi roofdeck which was a much classier, sexier, elegant experience and not a suburban chain. Plus we had a bartender who knew how to actually bartend without all the faux stuffiness. Zed is all smoke and mirrors and I doubt it will be a hot spot after the summer ends.
