My go to place for out of town guests. Great beer, even better pizza, and while it's always crowded the service is great even when the place is packed. The pizza crust is thin but floppy, and I mean that in the best way possible. There's grease but just enough to be enjoyable, not stomach wrenching. Good quality toppings, and the green olives are a personal favorite. The $25 carryout deal on Sunday gets you a large pie, a growler of your choice and a happy group of friends.
