When we came there the first time, it was the middle of october. And raining. Where were we seated? on the "patio" and all that sheltered us was a heavy plastic tent and heat lamps. we had to keep our coats on because it was so cold. Our waiter wasn't exactly the friendly . He spilled a bottle of hot sauce and didn't bother to clean it up. He was acting very bitter and kept slamming our plates down when the food came. The chicken wing were awesome! Not bad for it being soy. My Philly steak sandwich was very flavorless. I politely took it home and seasoned it. It tasted so much better. During the summer we came for a brunch. I ordered the pancakes which came out crisp black. It tasted terrible, and they didn't bother saying sorry or do you mind. So my breakfast was. 1/16 of a vegan cinnamon roll (which was pretty tasty) a 3 in soy patty (also flavorable) and a vanilla chai milkshake.
