This review may not be the most accurate portrayal of the restaurant, as I went here for brunch no Easter Sunday. The brunch was exquisite!! It wasn't too crowded, but definitely enough people there to know you are eating at a popular place. There was everything you could have wanted- my favorite being the cinnamon donut pudding. They had a meat station, omelette station, and of course a dessert and pancake/waffle station. I mean, this is one of the best things I've ever tasted, no joke! Prices were reasonable enough and I can't wait to go back for dinner!
