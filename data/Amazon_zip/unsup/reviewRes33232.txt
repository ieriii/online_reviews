Baked Spinach Pie = Win Baked Meat Pie = Win Baked Zater Bread = Win Hummus = Win Lamb Shawerma = Win Sultan's Market = Epic Win Hellz yeeeeeeeeaaaaahhh!!!! It's official. My tummy and Sultan's Market are BFF's. I love this place, well, I kinda have to, after all, it is BFF's with my tummy! I've been here a few times and each time I'm here it never dissapoints. Massive amounts of yummy deliciousness in exchange for a lil bit of your cash moneys. It's not a fancy place, but who needs fancy? Not Sultan's Market. They've got awesome food for great prices and the staff serves it up really fast so you can sit down & enjoy and possibly slip into a food coma. I highly recommend Sultan's Market based on the deliciousness they offer. The fast service & great prices are a bonus. If you come here, I'm sure your tummy will have a new BFF :) Holla!!!
