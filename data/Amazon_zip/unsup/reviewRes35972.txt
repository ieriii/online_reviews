As lots of people said, its all about the duck. If you're a vegeterian, dont even bother coming here. I have a few dietary restrictions - no pork and no seafood, and the duck was the only thing aside from tofu that my party of 9 could eat. However, we got 3 beijing duck feasts (each one could feed about 3-4 people), and it was the best duck we've ever had. of note, you can get the duck as either fried rice or noodles, so we got 2 fried rice and 1 noodle for the last course. If you took away the duck, this restaurant would be average at best, but the duck is the best ive had. Also, ORDER EXTRA MANTOU. it only comes with 6 pieces, you need 12. Service is meh, so just know that going in.
