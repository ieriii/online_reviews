Take a bite out of some contemporary art. Alinea is an extraordinary dining experience. I loved every second of Alinea and would highly recommend this for an intimate dining experience. The service was impeccable.  Some tips: . . . . . You'll need to book your reservation months in advance. . . . . . Chill out. Do not make after dinner plans. To truly enjoy the experience you'll want to relax and not be cognizant of time . . . . . Do enjoy the wine pairing. After all, you're already spending a few hundo on dinner, might as well go all out. . . . . . If you have to choose between Moto & Alinea, I'd pick Alinea every time.
