I just went here for lunch for the first time recently. The doors open at 11:30 and there's always a line down the street at that time. We were pretty far down the line, but still got a seat right away. I advise getting there early to avoid a long wait. The guacamole is some of the best i've ever had. I split an order of chicken quesadillas with my friend which was good, nothing too spectacular.
