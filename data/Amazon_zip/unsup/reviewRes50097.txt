I don't know if this is as good as it gets, but I can't think of anything negative, so it gets five stars. I've been here a few times, I think it is a great spot- easy, nothing special, not a big deal, but that was exactly what I was looking for each time I went. The place is pretty cool, atmosphere-wise. Nice patio, but the wall/windows open up and if you sit on the inside, it still feels like outside. Which was perfect when I was there on a drizzly Friday for happy hour. The service is always good, the dudes are funny and flirtatious, but not overly so. The girls are nice, again, not overly so but still attentive and not at all bitchy. The food is pretty good, for bar food. Best sweet potato fries I've had here. Looking back at that, I don't want to say that the food is good for bar food, because that sounds like it's decent. It is good. Real good. And they have smoked gouda for the sandwiches. Yum. I had lunch here by myself on the patio one day, I can't wait to do it again. A nice little spot, next time I'll bring the pooch. Not my best review, but I will say go here. It's perfect for the uneventful days/night sI enjoy on the regular.
