Awesome! I don't even like hot dogs but I LOVE them here!!! The line was long, all the way down the street, but man was it worth it. We probably waited 20 minutes, but I didn't even care !! I never thought I would be this excited over a hot dog, go figure. It just tastes great ! I got the Kiera Knightley, which is a fire dog, with everything, just right and spicy ;) ! You'll wait a while but trust me you won't care either. Everyone that works there is super nice, and so is Doug. The chairs are comfy. The fries are yummy, they're the kind with the skin on them. Be careful of the sport peppers, they're extra hot. Oh and it is cash only.
