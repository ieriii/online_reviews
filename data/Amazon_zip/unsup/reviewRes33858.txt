This place has one of the best spicy falafel ever. I haven't tried much of their other stuff because I can't stop eating it. It is quick, easy, and conveniently located - which was close to my ex's apartment way back when. The falafel came in soft, chewy pita and were cooked perfectly. Sometimes they can be dry or chalky but these were delightful. I like that you can request is spicy and all the little extras (like veggies) really make it taste fresh. I don't think I ever ate at another falafel place in Chicago and I really miss it here in Boston!
