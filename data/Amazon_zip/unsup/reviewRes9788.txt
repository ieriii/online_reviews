Very nice dinner. Taking in the decor of stone, wood, etc., the atmosphere is warm, inviting, sophisticated. The crowd was diverse (late twenties through forties). The vibe was really enjoyable- relaxed upscale casual. Not super trendy nor pretentious. Service was excellent. Our server was friendly, knowledgeable, and professional. I was really happy with the pacing of our meal and thought the amount of time between courses was perfect. Tables are well-spaced and the low noise level allowed for easy conversation. The food was great. The dishes' flavor profiles tend to be of the comfort/heartier nature (e.g., frog's legs, short rib, white bean, etc), but the food is not heavy/greasy at all. Many dishes present familiar flavors that incorporate a playful/creative element. "Comfort food on crack" is how Dale described his food when he emerged from the kitchen to say hi at the end of the evening. Furthermore, Dale was so cool. Sociable, funny, and passionate. He mentioned Sunday brunch plans for Sprout beginning early 2011. Chic, yet relaxed atmosphere serving comfort-esque food with an element of creativity thrown in.
