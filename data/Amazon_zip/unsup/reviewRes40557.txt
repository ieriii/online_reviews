When I walked in and saw the setting (big cafeteria-like tables, in which you're seated next to strangers - not my thing), I was instantly disappointed, but the food more than makes up for the noise and crowdedness. First, the selection is really impressive (especially if you are vegetarian/vegan, for whom Vietnamese cuisine can be challenging). I got a very simple dish - just stir-fried vegetables over rice - and was at awe with what they were able to do with it. It was truly delicious. My dining partner had noodle soup with curry coconut milk and was beside himself. I concluded the meal with tapioca green tea, which was one of the best I've ever had (and I'm addicted to tapoica teas). From a place with such marketplace like atmosphere, I would have expected somewhat lower prices, but the food and service were really impeccable.
