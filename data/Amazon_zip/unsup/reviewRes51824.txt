Still strong after all these years. PROS: - The deep dish is great. - This location has some history. - Yes, you can still write on the walls (on almost everything, in fact). CONS: - Servers can be a bit surly, like they are hate tourists (but we're all tourists). - You might have to wait a while for your table. - It's slow. They say "60 minutes for deep dish" when we all know it should be 40 or 45, but whatever... The deep dish is still excellent. Crust is more yellow than Lou or Giordano's, and gets pretty crunchy on the edges. The sauce sits on top and is pureed (less chunky than Lou's). Family-style salad is a bargain if you've got two or more who want a salad first. The bowl they bring is huge, enough for four or maybe five side-salads.
