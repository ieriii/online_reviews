YOU MUST TRY THIS RESTAURANT! I've only been to this restaurant once, but I've ordered delivery at least a handful of times now, and I plan to continue eating their food. Atmosphere: Not a very big restaurant but very nice people, and it's worth the wait. It's BYOB, and there is a wine place conveniently located across the street. FOOD: I definitely recommend the CASADO (steak and chicken are both delicious) and the OATMEAL SHAKE. The casado meal is big enough for two people to share. The meat is grilled with onions and served over amazing rice with a fresh vegetable slaw-type thing on the side and a side of sweet plantains. The oatmeal shake may sound a little weird, but it is sssooo good. My roommate enjoyed the VEGGIE BURRITO. The GUACAMOLE is fresh and tasty. The small is a pretty big-serving (which makes up for it costing $6.50) and you can get it spicy or not spicy. Price: I wouldn't say cheap, but it's definitely a value. Even with tip, you could probably get very full for under $20. [The actual restaurant isn't very big, but here's a helpful tip: If you order delivery off http://grubhub.com, not only is the food just as delicious but you can use a credit card.]
