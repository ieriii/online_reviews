As a frequent traveler, i'm often suckered into overrated establishments in whichever city I may be calling home for the week. I was looking for a good Chicago dog and someone at the airport suggested Hot Doug's. So I did a quick search on Google Maps and head over to California Ave at 10:30am on a Monday. My first impression when driving past Hot Doug's? - "This place must be good." At 10:30 am (opening time), on a Monday mind you, there was a line already out the door. I had no idea what to expect at hot doug's so while waiting in line i opened up yelp and the rest is history. I was expecting your run-of-the-mill good hot dog; just your standard beef/pork frank with the fixins. I couldn't have been more wrong. Doug was working the counter and took my and every single persons order in the most polite, friendly manner I honestly have ever seen apart from 5-Star restaurants (but even then you know its not sincere). I had the game of the week and the celebrity of the week. Unbelievable flavors you would never expect out of a hot dog(encased meats to be correct). Honestly, all I have to say is: BELIEVE THE HYPE. Go out of your way for Hot Doug's. PS- I later found out Anthony Bourdain listed HD as 1 of the places to eat before you die. I could not agree with him more.
