I'm looking forward to having actual dinner here. I came by myself during tea time (like 2:30 or 3:00, so I could have a pot of tea and a little snack and enjoy my book. I felt a little weird, since there was no one else by his or herself, and in fact there was only one other table occupied. Hearing all about the tea made me think this would be more like a coffee house, or a relaxation room or something. But even though it's more like a restaurant, I had a nice time sitting in the window and drinking my lovely tea. I also had the crab salad, which was crisp and tasty, and the deviled eggs. Not the best deviled eggs in the whole word, but I would sure as hell eat them (and I did). Looking forward to trying the food at a regular mealtime.
