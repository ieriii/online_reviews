I've been here twice now and have nothing bad to say about this place! Once I sat upstairs in the loungey area...and the next time sat downstairs in the main dining area. Service here is IMPECCABLE. LOVE that they have vegetarian/vegan menus amazing drink menus and cocktails the food is outstanding. Being vegetarian, I hesitate to go anywhere with French type of foods as it's not very veggie friendly, however Le Colonial was and it was not just rice and veggies. They have tofu options :) always a plus LOVE the ambiance here. Definitely trendy and a bit upscale. Highly recommended
