Stopped in Sunday for lunch. Got lucky and nabbed a table quickly, although the place was packed. We had a cheese burger and fish and chips. Both were excellent! The burger was perfectly medium rare and so savory it didn't need any condiments. Was that an egg batter bun? Fish and chips a big hit, too - although lemon wedges would have been better than the slices we were served. Loved the coleslaw! The fries in both orders were superb. Now the beer - Eugene Porter was smooth and silky. Followed up with the IPA which was crisp and hoppy and perfectly balanced. The service was outstanding. I'm so grateful Revolution Brewing is in the neighborhood!
