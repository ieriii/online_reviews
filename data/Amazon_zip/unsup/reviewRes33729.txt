I've been here and the one in Elmhurst- both are great. I always get the carpaccio as the appetizer. It's a nice starter if you want something light, yet delicious. I would definitely recommend something else if you expect a more substantial filler. I've also ordered a salmon special that was out of this world. Depending on what you order, it can start to get pricey (especially if you order wine like my sister and I do). This location in particular is on the smaller side, but it doesn't take away from anything. I went with a large group of people (about 12) and service was excellent for the limited space the waiter had to move around us.
