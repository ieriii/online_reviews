Big Jones is a really great southern cookin' restaurant and a rare find in Chicago. Each time I've eaten there I've ordered something different and I haven't been disappointed yet! Recently I ordered the catfish sandwich and it was a generous portion...The flavor was mild and the breading was delicate - not too heavy. The angel biscuits were light and flaky and absolutely delicious with the honey sweet cream butter. YUM! The meal started with some cheddar crackers and 5 pepper jelly. Their sweet tea is great, too! Just like how they make it down south. Big Jones pays close attention to flavors, spices, and accompaniments. They also have an impressive wine and drinks list. If you've never eaten at Big Jones before, try an early dinner so you can get a window table and "people watch" on Clark Street in Andersonville. Big Jones is a delightful restaurant with amazing food and exceptional service.
