Longman & Eagle just keeps giving and giving. Not sure where to start. The service is professional, but not over the top, just perfect for the place. The bartenders are the best I know of in the city. Derrick and Marta = Greatness. And the food just keeps getting better. Always surprised, in a great way. If you can love a place, I'm gonna marry L&E.
