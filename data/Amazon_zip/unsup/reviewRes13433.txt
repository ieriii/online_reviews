Glenn needs to come out of the fish closet and let me know where he finds this fresh fish so I can eat it at a price that doesn't kill the bank account. Luckily, I went for my birthday so lunch was paid for! You have to go fish here - silly if you dont. I know they have cereal, breakfast, etc but seriously, go fish or go home. (With that being said, someone at my table did have the meatloaf sandwich and it looked tasty, but I would fall asleep IMMEDIATELY after eating it). I went for the shrimp po boy after some reviews on Yelp leaned me that direction. READ HERE: YOU CAN MAKE THE SHRIMP PO BOY INTO A SHRIMP BLT PO'BOY. If you EVER, and I mean EVER turn down the opportunity to have bacon on a ANYTHING, you are no friend of mine (although the bacon could have been cooked a wee bit longer). The sandwich is monstrous. You get about 12 giant shrimp that our fried golden brown in a delicious cajun batter. The sandwich is on a beautiful soft hoagy roll, open-face, topped with tarter sauce lettuce, tomato, onion and bacon. Yum! Some things to note: Started with the clam chowder, and although it was good, it was not authentic New England clam chowdah. A little too thick, but tasty nonetheless and chock full of clams, potatoes and other veggies. And the potato pancake left something to be desired. The sour cream they add to the batter was too rich for my liking. Next time I would shoot for the piece of fresh fish, and maybe even the lunch special. Its a good deal with a lot food for $14.95! The progressive in me loves that their bathrooms are gender neutral! Yay! BEST PART - Margies Candies is across the street (yum) and the Brown Line is right there so you just need to plop yourself on the train.
