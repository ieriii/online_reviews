Yum. Yum yum yum yum. I have to say I wasn't sure what to expect. I grew up with a Granfather who used to make all kinds of sausages and other encased meats. No one's could be as good as Grandpa's. Hot Doug's, you have proved me wrong. I was a little leary of all the gourmet offerings but I went for it. Even added an order of duck fat fries to the meal. I ordered the Cognac-Infused Pheasant Sausage with Pomegranate Creme Fraiche and Goat Cheese. Fantastic. The meat was a little spicy and the cheese and creme fraiche were a great accompaniment. My friend E ordered the Blue Cheese Pork Sausage with Sir William Pear Cream Sauce and Smoked Almonds. A hot dog with a cream sauce?! Delicious. The flavors of the sauce and meat were perfectly paired. My other friend, J, ordered Spicy Jamaican Jerk Pork Sausage with Spicy Mango Dijonnaise, Roasted Plantains and Crescenza Cheese. Wow. That mango sauce...wow. And plantains!! *drool* We also ordered a corn dog as dessert. 'eh, it's a corn dog. You really can't screw up a corn dog. I didn't really taste the difference between the duck fat fries and regular fries. I'd opt not to try those again. One thing to note, tho....no mustard on the table. Only ketchup, salt & pepper. This is Chicago, people, and we need our mustard. At least I do. Even if it's just for the fries. All in all, this was a fantastic meal and I will be going back. I do want to try their Chicago dog. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know a lot of people wouldn't waste the money, but I'm a huge fan of a vienna red hot once through the garden.
