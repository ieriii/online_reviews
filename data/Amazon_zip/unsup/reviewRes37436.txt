Belgian Beer is always a draw in this town. Hopleaf keeps an awesome tap and great selection of bottles on hand. But I tend to show up for the food too. Their mussels easily rank in my top 10, just under a place in Belgium. Their fries are probably some of the best in town. Most of the dishes can be a bit on the greasy side, but in a buttery excellence way. I really liked their sweet breads. I know, a bit adventurous for some, but they are perfectly prepared and might just open up the closed minded eaters out there. Getting a table can be a wait, but see the first note about the beer selection.
