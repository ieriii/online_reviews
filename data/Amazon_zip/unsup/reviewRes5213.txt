If you like small plates and snout to tail cooking, this is a great place to go. Almost everything I tried was tasty, service was friendly, and prices were reasonable, especially considering the location. The highlight was the thinly sliced fried Pig's Ear mixed with pickled peppers and a fried egg. The only disappointing dish was the chorizo stuffed olives, which hardly tasted of chorizo at all. The only other issues I had were that my $11 draft beer was served in a glass that was still hot to the touch when I got it, and the waiter's recommendation of a dish that they didn't have. Despite those minor glitches, I enjoyed my experience and would recommend it to anybody who likes to try a number of things they haven't necessarily had before.
