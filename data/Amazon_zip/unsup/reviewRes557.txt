This place never seizes to amaze. I've been here several times for different functions. I always leave with a lasting satisfaction and also an appreciation to savoring your food.  To all those who come here, book now.. I believe this place is booked for weeks. Also make sure you have all evening depending on which course tour you will take. The tasting tour is 12 courses and the menu tour is 24 courses. I would go for the 24 course tour. You're already spending 135 for the 12 course.. why not go 60 more for 24 courses. I've had both and I would definitely choose the 24 courses just because you are left with a more of a satisfying and full feeling. Each course is going to be something you have never tasted before. The preparation, taste, smell, and the ingredients that compliment the course will leave you savoring each moment. Your tastebuds will be given a delightful gift each time you take in any of the delicious courses presented to you.  I can go on and on with the food, but it's more of the experience that really justifies the price.
