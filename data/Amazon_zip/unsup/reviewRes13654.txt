Excellent atmosphere. I enjoy Logan Square, and this place certainly adds to my affection. For an appetizer my boyfriend, his brother, and I shared the bacon fat popcorn. It was pretty good, but now that I've tried it I probably wouldn't order it again. My entree wasn't super. I was feeling ballsy and ordered the Workingman Burger. I'm not much of a burger person, so maybe anyone else would have enjoyed it. The beer was delicious. I had the "cross of gold," and it didn't disappoint at all. Would have been nice if they sold pitchers of beer, though. The service was also fantastic, but when we went, it was pretty empty. Giving it 4/5 because the atmosphere, service, and brews were wonderful. Didn't love my entree, but next time I'll try a pizza. Because YES, there will be a next time.
