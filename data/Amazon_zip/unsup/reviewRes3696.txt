Oh, yes, yes, yes. I always get the chicken sandwich, the one that comes with lettuce, tomato, mayo and cheese..but the star, of course, is the chicken. I don't know how they fry the chicken, exactly (I don't want to know, don't ruin the magic for me), but the way that it is fried makes the crispiness hold up to the rest of the sandwich. And the sauce, oh the sauce! My favorite is their BBQ...it is a sweet and tangy and just a teeny bit spicy...perfect with their fries and a cream soda.
