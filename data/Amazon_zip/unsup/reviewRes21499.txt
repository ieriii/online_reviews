One of my favorite places to hang out with my girls! Tuesdays and Thursday they have1/2 off Margarita special! Their food is really good. I usually get the seafood taco dinner or their quesadilla. The steak nachos is also fabulous! Mayan Palace is very afforadable. 2 Margaritas with dinner came out to be about $30 with tip. Not bad!!!!!!!  Its a little loud here but the atmosphere is excellent. They have a back patio area so there is never a long wait.
