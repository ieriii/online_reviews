I've been here 4 or 5 times, all for dinner, so I've got no experience with their buffet. The dinner menu is enormous. I'd have given this place 4 stars, but the last visit, some mixed seafood dish, perhaps a lightly curried one, was an inedible disaster. Tasted improperly cooked and also probably was the lowest quality fish you could buy from a guy on the corner with fish wrapped up in his Streetwise. I can't bring myself to lower it to 2 stars because usually, this place is my favorite Indian restaurant not on Devon.
