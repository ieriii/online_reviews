Terrible service all around. The first night, my bathroom smelled like urine, so badly that I had to hold my breath as I brushed my teeth in the morning. I waited in line for over 30 minutes to get my room changed. The water pressure in my shower was basically just dripping water out, and it took the engineer 4 hours to come to my room. Then, there was a billing issue, and I called three times, left three messages, and nobody called me back for a week. I finally had to call the front desk manager, who was cold, rude, and was basically rushing me off the phone. All of his responses were completely standardized, like he was reading from a manual. I'm sure other Westins are great, but this particular one is a nightmare and I will NEVER stay here again.
