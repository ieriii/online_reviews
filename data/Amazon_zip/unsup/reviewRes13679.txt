"Yay! I'm a fan." totally highlights how I feel about Glenn's. A few highlights from the most recent visit: 1. Though the dining room was booked for the night, not only was the patio available, but the guy at the door took my cell phone number so that we could go grab a drink vs. standing there for 20 minutes looking pathetic and hungry. Why can't any restaurant with a phone offer this basic/simple service vs giving you those stupid buzzers that act as electronic leashes!? 2. The food was delicious. All you can eat shrimp for $16? Hellz yeah! Wasn't AS huge a fan of the bbq-style but the garlic shrimp was amazing, and our plates were always refilled proactively. 3. Great service that isn't overbearing. Waiter also made a great wine recommendation. 4. Patio was nice. Sitting on a patio eating great food on a beautiful evening is the way to go, and having the El pass by every 10 minutes truly made it a classic Chicago experience. I was disappointed that I didn't have the 8 stomachs of a cow because EVERYTING on the menu looked great. Can't wait to go back again for more.
