Once you step out of the hotel to the right, you can see the John Hancock tower looming over you. Nice! The staff is professional and accommodating. They allowed me to switch my room from a 1 queen bedroom to a 2 queen with no hassles. The room was spacious and clean.The bed was very comfortable for me especially after I ran a marathon. My only issue was this dark brown fur coat thing on bed that was used for decoration. I certainly hope that it was not real animal fur. I quickly threw that off to the side. The hotel is across the street from the Four Seasons. Save your money and come here instead. This spot is cheap compared to other hotels because of its location. At the time I went there (October 2009), they were still renovating, which wasn't an issue for me. No free internet here and you pay $10 a day. I didn't realize this until my last day that they offer free wireless in the main parlor room in the lobby. Closest El Train: Chicago-Red (about 4 blocks away)
