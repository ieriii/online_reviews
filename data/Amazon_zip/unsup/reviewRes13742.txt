MMmmmm. That cheddar ale soup is Tasty (with a capital T). I also ate a pizza--yeah, thats right. A bowl of soup and almost a whole pizza by myself--no sharing! It was that good. (There may have been chocolate cake, too but you didn't hear that from me.) I spent a lovely evening at Revolution Brewing Co. with a gentleman and his sister. We hung out long enough to eat all of that and have a few of their brews. I had the Cross of Gold and it was simply a damn good beer. I had high expectations based on all of the hubbub surrounding this joint and I was not disappointed.
