I walked about a mile to get to Hot Dougs then waited in line 30 minutes to order... Totally Worth It... Had the standard dog with all the fixings, foie gras , and the duck fat fries - never have I wished more that I was Joey Chestnut so I could sit there and polish off the whole menu. Doug took my order and was great you can tell he loves what he is doing and takes pride in serving such great and inventive foods. I can't wait to get back to Chicago to go here again
