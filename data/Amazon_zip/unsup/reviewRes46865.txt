Sigh. I really wanted to rate this place higher. Truly. I mean, the food was good. The wait, on a Sunday morning, wasn't horrible. But the service... One of our party didn't get their meal until after the rest of us had been served and were finished. We were ready to leave when her order arrived. And it was wrong. And we'd asked for it to go and it came out on a plate. The problem was with the customer service. Our waiter avoided us like the plague. I understand that no one wants to be the bearer of bad news, and yes, there's a "shoot the messenger" mentality that the wait staff gets saddled with. But come on. At least acknowledge us. Let us know what's going on. We weren't yelling. We understood that it was a busy brunch crowd. Treat us with a little respect. We're still going to tip. And where was the manager? He should have been johnny-on-the-spot. But we didn't get to chat with him until we were leaving because, though we had been told the meal was comped, we had actually been charged for it TWICE, so only one came off. When we stated that we were frustrated, he cut us off and said he was having a frustrating day as well. No. No. No. You don't get to make this about you. We're the paying customers. We've had crummy experience because of your staff's errors. The least you can do, even if it's fake, is pretend to empathize and apologize. I'm sorry that you're having a bad day, but we chose to spend our time and money in your establishment. We came to visit and enjoy each other's company, but instead we spent the entire time trying to track down our waiter and get some simple answers. For me, there are several Cardinal Sins of Restaurants happening here. And because of that, I won't be spending my money at this place again.
