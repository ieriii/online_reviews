The atmosphere is fun, the ambiance just puts you in a good mood. The service was excellent, helpful but not pushy. I went early on in the night so it wasn't over crowded. THE FOOD WAS AMAZING! All the samplers and the entrees were unstoppable. This place is a must go if you like Latin food. Their food was fresh, the service was right on point, and the vibe of the restaurant starts your night off the right way. Nothing bad to say.
