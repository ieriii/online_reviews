Pretty darn delicious! I had passed this place at least 673 times before actually making the effort to check it out... and I'm not sure what took me so long! I absolutely love Latin American and Spanish cuisine. Carnivale is my "happy place" :) We walked into an extremely large dining area, filled with bright colors, oversized art and lighting, and great smells coming from the kitchen. My husband thought the decor was cheesy, but I liked the loud colors for a change. We were totally impressed to see so many of the Spanish wines on the wine list that we enjoyed so much while on our vacation in Spain. While we didn't order a glass of wine, he ordered Estrella Damm and I had the Cairpirinha--a cross between a mojito and a margarita. A dry rum from Brazil... And boy was it good. Oh the Manchego! We ordered this cheese with drinks and were very happy we did. Ever so tangy and satisfying. I found it interesting that it was served with blueberry jam--but what a perfect flavor combination it was.   For dinner, we ordered the Costilla De Res (braised short ribs) and the Churrasco (beef tenderloin), and we were very happy we did! We each shared a bite with one another and decided we weren't willing to share more than that. My Churrasco was prepared with goat cheese mashed potatoes and drizzled with a green arugula sauce and pickled beet salsa. Those flavors totally worked it! For dessert, Flan. Garnished with a white chocolate whipped cream, it was the best damn flan I've ever had.
