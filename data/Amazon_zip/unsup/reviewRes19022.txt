In two words: Fresh and Focused. The Bad Apple strives for quality over quantity and they are succeeding in my opinion. Even though I am a big-time carnivore I felt tempted enough by the ingredients of their veggie-style burger to stray from my grilled meat roots. The patty was made from chickpeas, corn and mushrooms topped with spinach leaves, goat cheese and caramelized onions served on a fluffy bun. This concoction is titled the Strange Famous. The patty stayed together relatively well considering its veggie makeup. The goat cheese combined with the caramelized onions was a total party in my mouth. I learned later that because this burger has been so popular they had to pick up extra ingredients from Whole Foods earlier that day to make sure they could continue serving it fresh. Nice to know they don't keep a bunch of frozen stuff in the back. This was served with a side of hand-cut fries that were lightly seasoned--also delicious. And how about the back room with the Ms. Pac-man, pinball and Foosball table? Definite score!
