I met up with a friend for dinner and she suggested this place saying how much she loved it and has been wanting to go back. I have found my new favorite Persian restaurant. The service was great...very friendly and attentive. The room was comfortable.I loved the Caspian Eggplant appetizer..it was sooo good, I want more. They also brought out a very large hummus plate complimentary. I had to stop myslef from eating too much of the appetizers to save room for dinner. The portions were very large...the shrimp and dill rice was excellent. I will definitely go back.
