I'm going to share a secret with you. Come close..closer..a little closer...okay, ready? I LOVE Grand Lux Cafe. Love it. Love the ambiance, the food, the service..love it. It's overrun with tourists and herds of folks from the outer-reaches of suburbia who make a trek into the city to see Wicked, but, sonofabitch, I love me some Grand Lux Cafe. The food portions are gargantuan which is really a good thing. You can share, you can have leftovers, or, *ahem* you can be a big greedy hog and eat everything in front of you..not that I've done that there. Me? No, never. So many of the dishes are delicious and it's always hard for me to order because I'm worried that I may have passed up something even better. My favorites: the wedge salad, pasta telefono, chicken salad sandwich, and their fries. Oh their fries, man. They're just like McDonald's fries. Okay, now for the deserts. I am not a big desert person. I don't have a sweet tooth perse, I don't crave chocolate or eat ice cream by the pint full, but I cannot ever possibly leave GLC without ordering dessert, specifically the banana cream pie and/or the beignets. Oh who the hell am I kidding, I order them both! The banana cream pie is creamy and cool, the crust is flaky and buttery and the bananas are always the perfect texture. The beignets will make you pass out; served hot with a side of raspberry sauce and warmed up chocolate sauce, and honey. Honey, you'll reach over and slap your dining companion they're so good. GLC is situated right at Michigan Ave. and Ontario, and during the holiday season it's a really magical place. They have huge windows that look out over Michigan Ave, and with all the lights twinkling it's the prettiest place around. So yes, it's touristy, and it's crowded, and it's a chain (the horror!), and it's kind of gimmicky. All that aside, it's really good food in a really good location, and you'll have a really good time.
