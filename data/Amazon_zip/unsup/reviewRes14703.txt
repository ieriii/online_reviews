Very impressed with this place. I've heard it said that with a brewpub it's the beer that gets them in the door, and the food that brings them back. I didn't do much in the way of food, but I'll be back just for the beer. Delicious, everything I tried. We did do some appetizers. The Bacon popcorn is decadent and awesome, and the cheese plate that day was quite tasty. All around, very enjoyable. I highly recommend it.
