Well I mean it's a meat fest. Don't come just for the salad bar - it's all about the meat. The salad bar is good, but not like amazing or anything. Most of the meats were really tasty. I LOVED the bacon wrapped filet.... sooooo good. The lamb was tasty, bottom sirloin better than top sirloin. I'd say it's worth the price - just don't get wine here.
