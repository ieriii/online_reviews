I liked Brazzaz. I do... It doesn't get a "bend and snap" from me but it was a great experience. I was taken on a business luncheon and I was glad that I had a chance to try it without shelling out my own dough. I am a red meat eater to an extent. It was fun to be able to try the different types of meats without being wasteful. The highlight for me was the bacon wrapped filet and the bacon wrapped chicken. Bacon really does make everything better. Oh, and the little cheese puff rolls that they keep fully stocked on every table at all times. The salad bar was good with all kinds of different cold and hot pasta dishes, veggies and cheeses. It was almost too much though; I wasn't sure where to focus my attention. Talk about over stimulation!
