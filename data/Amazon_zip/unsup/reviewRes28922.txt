As I'm sure you've noticed by now from the reviews prior to this one (or post even) one of the staples of Opart Thai House is their zealous use of spice. So if you are looking for bland then this restaurant is not for you my friend. The service here is very quick, friendly, to the point and correct. Should you be a meat eater definetly jump on the curry chicken band wagon and for the veggies out there... when you taste the way they cook their tofu you are will most likely have an orgasm in your mouth. I have never had a negative experience here.
