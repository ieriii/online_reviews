I had a really good experience at Demera. I found the service to be very attentive. My friend and I were seated right away and a waitress came by quickly. We took a while to decide but the waitress did not abandon us. After we ordered the food came probably 15-20 minutes later, and it was delicious! I had never had Ethiopian food before and I loved it! It was a great dining experience. Only downsides were the table we had was kind of small and cramped and the waitress was somewhat, shall I say, brusque? There was definitely no chitchat, but that's okay, the food was great.
