I was extremely surprised that i was checked into a room #2107 friday 5/25/2012 where the room was hotter than outside 80 degrees, smelled like old wet carpet and when you turn the light on you can see the dust on the desk and on frames etc . The desk the LCD was on was chipped. I felt like i was in a motel 6. The blue chair, it was white smugges/stuff on it. I'm thinking this can't be happening. This must be a bad dream. Wow! Now don't get me wrong love the Marriott and I have stayed in some of the Marriott hotels in different cities. But this is a first I experienced this at the Marriott especially downtown and I'm still in shock. I called their front desk/ays dept and informed them it seem like no one hasn't stayed in this room for a while.Even though I had turned on the room temperature 50 degrees at 7pm, at 4am the next morning it still felt like it was 85 degrees in that hotel room. The gentleman front desk/ays dept stated that if i would like to have an engineer to come and fix it. I'm thinking at 4am in the morning and my fiance and I will have to get up and put cloths on because they placed us in a room they knew was not used in months and that the air condition didn't work. So i said no, because it's going to be an inconvenience and checkout is at 11am so I stated that it wouldn't help. The gentleman explained to me that the building is old and needs some minor repairs and he apologizes. I'm thinking WOW!!!! But then, an Express checkout/bill was placed under my door. LOL!!!! But I was not offered and continential breakfast or a refund or anything. LOL!! Wow!!! Not even an room change was offered. Lmao!!! I know this is not the type of service that Mr. Marriott will ever agree with. Mr. Marriott always has pride his self and the corporation on cleanliness and providing exceptional service and great customer service.
