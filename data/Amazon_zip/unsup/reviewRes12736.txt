First things first, the staff was awesome because of their honesty. Let me demonstrate: When we first walked in we waited at the bar for the rest of our reservation to show up. We asked the bartender which mojito was their best and without hesitation he said the original. My man was right! So delicious and refreshing on such a hot day! Once we were seated on the beautiful patio, we began asking our waitress questions. -What's your favorite thing here? -Is this good? -What's a good side to go with that? She gave immediate and detailed answers to every question. She even explained the possible reasons for not liking something, and she was right! I had the green tamales which were great. They weren't in a husk and were cut into nice sized triangles. I also split the jalapeno honey pork chops with a friend, which I highly recommend because you get 2 chops and they are both as big as your head. Well maybe not your head but at least a babies head. (weird) They had such a great flavor. Sweet with the undertones of jalapeno. mmmmmm pork chops. They came with sweet potatoes that just swam in the sweet delicious honey jalapeno sauce. Can't wait to go back!
