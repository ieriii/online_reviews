100% worth the wait. My feet were frost bitten by the time I made it in, but it didn't even matter. Excellent Chicago hot dogs and sausages at a reasonable price. And I also got a specialty one -- a hickory smoked Cajun pork sausage with blue cheese on top. Worth the money, worth the wait, lives up to the hype.
