This is a great meat eating experience. Go with a 3 day starvation prep. All the food was excellent but I didn't care for the lamb or the sausage or the chicken. Stick to the beef baby. It is a more expensive dinner but nice to go to occasionally to fill the hollow leg. Best meat is the picanha. Just feed it to me intravenously.
