We need more places like this. I hate the typical River North bars with squawking LOLZ OMG overhighlighted faketanned scum, as well as the laughable-at-best doofus hipster PBR hangouts. It felt nice to be somewhere quiet and refined, but not too stuffy. I had a couple of drinks, the "Etiquette" and the "Part and Parcel," both of which were delicious, while still packing a punch worth your money. There were no loud, screaming examples of Mother Nature's shortcomings, and the staff was polite, if not slightly inattentive (one star off for that, sorry). When I saw little placards in the washrooms stating "No Baseball Caps" I just about peed myself. Good thing I was already in the washroom. Lovely place.
