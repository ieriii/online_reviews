Went here with my boyfriend and another couple.  This place had a great beer list but the wine list was just okay. We were stuffed in a booth that had doors...it was cozy but strange. The service left little to be desired as my second glass of wine never came and when I asked about it they acted like I didn't know what I was talking about. You really have to like meat to come here and you should have an adventurous appetite as the menu is not accesible to everyone. I don't really care for blood sausage and sweet breads so it just wasnt for me.  The portions were really small and not really enough to share. I left feeling hungry. This is the dude's equivalent to the Girl & Goat (which I loved btw). Go to the G&G you will get better service, larger portions and a menu with more variety for everyone.
