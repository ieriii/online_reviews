Huge portions of "American" favorites that aren't even Bennigan's quality served in a huge amber-hued room.  Another point in the argument AGAINST chain restaurants, this places proves why the Cheesecake Factory should stick to desserts. Lackadaisical, mind-numbingly slow service. Jackass valets that barely speak English. The kind of place where "spicy" on the menu means "we dumped a mess of cajun seasoning on this before we cooked it". Leave this place to the tourists visiting from Nebraska and Canada. They may as well build a monorail over to the Marriott. I've never had the salads, I see them being complimented on this board, but a tasty array of veggies and dressing is hardly enough to rate more than a star in my book.
