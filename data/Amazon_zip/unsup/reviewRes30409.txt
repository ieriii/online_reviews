Felt compelled to weigh in on this gem. Often these Asian restaurants are over thought and the food doesn't live up to the presentation. Service was great. Highlights - Corn fritter Tuna crab cake - bar none best ahi I have had. I will preface this by saying I order it at least 5 times a month. Seabass - also fantastic and a huge portion. Overall a wonderful experience.
