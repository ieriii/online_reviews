It is too bad that the service sucks-- because the southern cooking is so tasty! Like the other reviews, when ever I go here they forget part of my order-- always forgetting or adding items-- then neglect to refill any of my drinks. Weekend mornings this place is a nightmare and is yuppie parents with their bratty children everywhere. They ask you not to bring in outside beverages-- but you may as well sneak yours in because they will never bring you a refill!! Bloody Mary was ick with a GINORMOUS celery stalk hanging out of it-- you could def poke your eye out with that thing.
