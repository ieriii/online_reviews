I am a southern boy. I love southern food, soul food, southern comfort food, etc. My momma is well known and regarded for her soul food straight from the low country of South Carolina. Given that, I enjoyed the food at Big Jones. The dishes were flavorful and inventive. However I do take issue with the accompanying pretentious and price. And I assure that some of the things good southern food is NOT is pretentious or pricey. It comes from the soul. It's made with cheap ingredients. Have you ever shopped for catfish, collard greens, sweet potatoes or cabbage? There are some of the cheapest things you can find. I don't knock them for putting twist on the classics but altering the essence of the dish and charging a buttload for it goes against the heart of southern cooking. If you do give Big Jones a 'go' I recommend the Chef's special of the day. The three courses gives you a chance to try different dishes. I started with a bitter green salad with a vinaigrette. (Never heard of it in southern cooking but oh well.) It was good but didn't remind me of anything remotely southern. The cornbread was a little dry and unimpressive. My entire was a great southern staple of fish and grits. I had the blackened catfish with smooth & velvety cheese grits. This dish was spot on...except for a weird and overly sweet pecan sauce over top of the fish. Next time I would order it without the pecan glaze and save it for some pancakes. I finished my meal with red velvet cake. It was good but not necessarily noteworthy. The question remains: would I return? The answer is yes if my momma came to town. I want her to try it because there's not many places you can have fussy southern food.
