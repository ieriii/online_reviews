I got take out from here last night. We ordered 4 dishes - Spinach Lasagna, Shrimp DeJoghne, Chicken Francese and Meat Ravioli with Meat Sauce. The food was decent enough. Reasonable portions, good flavor but a little overpowering at times. We live in the neighborhood so will probably order again, but it is not a new favorite. I will try dining in soon and re-review.
