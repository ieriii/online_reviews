Dear Tank, Your pho is the best hangover cure ever. Yummy beef balls, tripe, tendons, all those funky animal parts Americans usually hate make this the most hearty delicious food EVERRRR. I love drinking your broth is oodles of sirachia and lots of cilantro.  Dear Tank, I wish I wasn't so intimated by the rest of your GINORMORUGE menu~!!! yes there are pictures but there's so much vietnamese and english writing everywhere. It would take over half an hour to just to read the menu and their descriptions.  You think you could make a list of Tank Favorites for me? I'd love to try more stuff...but I just can't decide!!!!!!!!!!!
