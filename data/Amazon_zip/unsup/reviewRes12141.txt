Pizza was decent, service was not. We waited 20 minutes to even be addressed by anyone at all. Our waitress finally came and shyly apologized for the wait. So we put in our order (spinach, onion, and ricotta, not too bad and about 40 minutes later it was finally out. Apparently they had over cooked/thrown away the original pizza and had to cook another, probably something they could of told us about . We also could never find our waitress for anything, including the paying of the bill, so we just threw what $$ we had on the table and left (the meal had all been comped already except for the appetizer). I used to be a server so i am really understanding when it comes to waiting tables, but even for me this was bad. Pizza was good though, so i probably will give it another chance.
