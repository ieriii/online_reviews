This restaurant is in the space vacated by Madrigals. I went there for the first time the day after Christmas. At about 7:30 pm, the place was packed, so there was a half hour wait to get a seat. We were seated at the first table in the window, which made feel a tad removed from the crowd (not a good thing). I like to try new things, but the menu descriptions were written so that everything listed sounded too spicy or strange. We had the squid appetizer, which was good and plentiful, but was rather flavorless (at least it wasn't fishy). I do not even recall what we ordered for our entrees--so they were not very memorable. Disappointing best sums up our experience at Anteprima. If you are in Andersonville, and you are in the mood for Italian, you would be better off going to Calo's.
