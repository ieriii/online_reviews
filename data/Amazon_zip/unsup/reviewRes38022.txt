Believe the hype, the mussels are fab - brew list is good, too, although nowadays many places are focusing on craft beer and there was nothing here I haven't sen elsewhere - nice touch in that there is NO tv - big negative is how p-a-c-k-e-d this place is all the time - always a wait unless u luck out at the bar - good to go if you've never been, but be prepared to wait
