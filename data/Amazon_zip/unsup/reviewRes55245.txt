First off, if you are not a meat-enthusiast, don't go. From what I hear the salad-bar is outstanding, but who in their right mind pays $50 to eat a salad-bar? It's all about the meat! The wait-staff is very attentive, and if you haven't seen your favorite meat in a while, the friendly staff will more than gladly flag down your carniverous desire. Side dishes like polenta are replenished before ever running out, the service is great. The meat is a high quality, and seems to be cured well. I highly suggest the less expensive lunch, same food, less cost. Of all the brazilian steakhouses that are springing up all over, this is the cream of the crop.
