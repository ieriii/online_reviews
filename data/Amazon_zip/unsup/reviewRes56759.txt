Spacca Napoli exceeded my expectations. I heard this place was great, but I've heard that about so many average pizza places around the city. I thought this pizza really lived up to its billing. They say this is authentic Neopolitan pizza and I can say that it is definitely a unique style for Chicago. I had the mushroom and sausage pizza which is very simple. A little bit of tomato sauce and mozzarella, some basil and plenty of mushrooms and sausage. The key to the pizza is that the ingredients are fresh and I have to say that I love the crust. The outer crust is flaky and cripy and the inner portion is gooey and cheesy. I could see how some people would have an issue with the middle portion of the crust, and with most pizzas I've consumed a soft, wet crust is a severe detriment, but I only wish there more of the middle portion of this pizza. The menu is not that big, but I would definitely like to come back to try some of the other pizza options including the white pizzas. I wish there were a 4.5 star option because I can't quite commit to a full 5 stars, but it is close!
