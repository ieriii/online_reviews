It's so...CUTE. I come, order the special sandwich of the day (roast beef cheddar), nommed on it and wished that I had some water. And then a waiter, a spiky Adonis, brought me a glass. I was won over (I am also easy to please). I'd like to stop back in for coffee some time (I think they sell turkish coffee pots, which is neat). Definitely a fan
