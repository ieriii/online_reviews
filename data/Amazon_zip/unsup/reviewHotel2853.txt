For the high price I paid for a conference special rate, I would have expected a bit more. It was just average. And trust me, I don't mind paying a lot for a hotel room and I know how much they can cost as I live in Hawaii, but the higher the price (in this case $230+ per night) you expect more. At least some decent shampoo and soap in the bathroom? The cheaper hotels even give you shampoo these days! Like everyone else says, the bed is amazing. I would give that alone 5 stars as it is fluffy, big and loaded with pillows! The room is also roomy and very clean and the location on the river is beautiful. Shula's steakhouse in the hotel is also amazing and the hotel workers could learn a bit of customer service from the personable servers in that restaurant. The hotel service is what could use a bit of effort and some complimentary gestures would be nice. The hotel seems to want to charge you for everything. Little fees here and there. WiFi was about $12 a night. I would have liked to go to the gym, but I can run outside for $13 dollars less. A few elevators were also broken the whole time the 3-day conference was going on so that made getting from room to room confusing and the banquets were met by very loud servers that decided the middle of a speech was a good time to clear every hundreds of dishes from the tables. The loud clanking was not good at all. When they finished the speaker was also finished. Good timing. I had a reservation at the Embassy Suites across the street and had a night and day experience there. Much more value for your money.
