the shuttle from O'hare was long, but the driver was nice enough to inform us that the knickerbocker used to be one of the first gentlemen's club in the area and YES the hotel hosted Playboy back in the days. the location was great! minutes from everything imaginable, lake, shopping, even OPRAH winfrey's home [the big white house on oak st 2 blocks down] the room was small, but the decor made it cute. morning breakfast was served and it was a gigantic meal for the price, quite fulfilling. the hotel staff were nice and accomodating. the bartender at the martini bar made a martini like no other, ONE martini each and we were done for. one of the best martinis i've had. the price was fair, considering a million and one conventions the weekend we went.
