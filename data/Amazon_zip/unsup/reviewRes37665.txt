Very nice, it's great to go to a gourmet grocery store and be impressed. My first thought when I walked in was, "WOW, it smells great in here" I can't say that about any other market, EVER. The cafe was also very pleasant. It had a lovely menu and was priced just like any other place if you were to get a sandwich. I am a big fan of whole foods, but I might need to have a change of heart after going to Fox and Obel. I can't wait to find an excuse to come back!
