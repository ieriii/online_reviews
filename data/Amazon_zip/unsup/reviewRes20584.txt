We had a very nice evening at The Gage, with only a few minor problems. The food was excellent, and the waiter's recommendations were spot on. We started with braised Swan Creek goat which was incredibly rich and delicious. It was a perfect winter dish and the flavor sticks with me more than anything else we had that evening. Our second course was the tartare of bison. I am a huge tartare fan, so this is always a pleasure to see on the menu. It was among the best that I have had (although it cannot compare to the antelope tartare at East Side Showroom, in Austin Texas). The capers were a lovely addition to the dish. For out main entres we ordered the Indiana duck leg confit and roasted breast, and the Gunthorp Farm's pork chop. The duck leg was perfect, but the breast was undercooked. The problem with duck is that it is either done right or wrong, there is no middle ground. Everything else about the dish was perfect, especially the celery root puree! The pork chop was among the best pork dishes I have ever eaten. It was cooked perfectly, and the meat quality was far above expectation. I will dream about this pork chop. The service was okay. Our waiter was very personable and knew the menu very well. The only problem is that he was so busy that we did not receive the kind of attention that one expects. We waited a long time before we were able to put in our drink order, waited even longer to order our first course, and could have taken a nap in the time it took to get out main course. It wasn't a huge problem, but it did put us off a bit. The noise level in the restaurant was high, and the tables are extremely tight. We don't mind this too much, but some people will. Overall a fantastic dinner at a very nice restaurant.
