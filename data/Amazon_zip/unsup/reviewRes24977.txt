This review is 2.5 My husband and I came here on a Tuesday night to use our groupon. They have valet parking for $10 so that is convenient. They also have complimentary coat check. Beware that when you come out of here you will smell like grease. The atmosphere is cozy and very dark. It's almost a bit too dark. Be sure to request a booth so you have more space since the table and chairs are kind of cramped. We both had premier dinners. I had the beef and scallops and my husband had beef with shrimp and lobster. The cheese fondue was tasty and made for a really nice appetizer. I wish that there had been a bit more bread to dip but I guess they don't want you getting too full before your entree arrives. Now for the meat and fish. They bring you a platter of your raw meat as well as raw veggies and dipping sauces. You place the meat and veggies on skewers and cook it in the hot oil and then you dip it in the sauces. It was very tasty but it seemed like there wasn't that much meat. The scallops were definitely the highlight. They also give you 8 dipping sauces so it adds a little flavor since otherwise the meat isn't marinated and is cooked in plain oil, so the sauce is kind of necessary. Then came the chocolate fondue for dessert. It was good, although a bit too sweet. The strawberries that came with it looked kind of sad, but I guess it's not really strawberry season right now. It was fun to cook the marshmallows over the flame though. I think I would have preferred if they had given us whole graham crackers instead of graham cracker crumbs to make s'mores. Anyways, it was tasty and we left very full but it wasn't as delicious as I was hoping. The servers were very friendly and helpful though. Nothing was bad about our meal; however, everything was mediocre and at this price point, it should be above average.
