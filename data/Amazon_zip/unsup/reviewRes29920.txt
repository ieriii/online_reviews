I try so hard to resist their perfectly spiced goodness, but I tend to acquiesce at least once a week to either their curry fried rice or Rama, always with tofu. Perfectly cooked tofu, I should add. I stop by on my way back from work, and within 15 minutes tops, I am on my way out. There are quite a few Thai choices within blocks of the Brown line Western stop, but this is BY FAR the bet one, especially for the price!
