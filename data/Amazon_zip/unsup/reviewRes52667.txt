Food was bland, not seasoned well, the service was much like you'd find in a Ponderosa ... this is by far the worst Brazilian steak house I've ever been to. Don't waste your money here ... If you must gorge yourself with unlimited amounts of meat ...  I find the meats and service 1,000,000 times better at Fogo De Chao
