Ok, so I'm not even a huge hotdog enthusiast and this place blew me away. Feel free to pick your basics, and there are plenty- corn dogs, beef dogs, etc. There guys are famous, however, for their multitude of regular and daily specials. Ever want to try a boar dog? A dog with duck on top? You got it if you come on the right day! Staff are friendly here, prices are SUPER, but the wait is always long, the tables are few (but there is outside patio seating), and they only take cash.  Next time I'm in the mood for dogs, I will definitely consider returning, assuming I can get to the ATM first.
