I ate here a few times when I used to live downtown. It reminded me of the cheesecake factory, which I don't care for much. The portions are huge and the price is reasonable, but the quality, um, i'm just not so sure. I walked away with a bad stomach ache, probably from too much grease and salt to mask the bland food. Also, I'm always fearful of resturants that have HUGE menus....usually means that everything will be marginal but not good.
