holy sh!t.... this place is amazing. After a seminar got out on a half day, I went with a work buddy out here for some eats. We get there around 11:25 and there was a 15 minute wait (and no take out allowed since they're so busy). So this line may sound like a big deal.... but trust me it is a blessing in itself. If you think you're going to say give me a beef torta and that'll be the end of that, think again. Rick don't do 'standard' Mexican. Each torta comes with its own sauce, with toppings that are more than just lettuce, tomato, onion, cilantro. This is a Frontera experience that is on the cost for the average person. So I digress. We get two tortas (different ones so we can go halfsies and get two tastes). My friend gets guac and chips and a churro. The sandwiches.... the choriqueso and the Wudford Chicken. The choriqueso had some the best chorizo I ever ate. It was creating the magic pool of orange grease that usually accompanies a chorizo burrito at the local burrito place. The sandwich had poblanos, a jack cheese, and maybe some other stuff. It came with a tomatillo salsa. It was.....mmmmmmm The chicken sandwich had avocado and other ingredients and it came with a red sauce (I can't remember everything on it, but it was good.... not as good as the chorizo sandwich IMO). I tried a little guac with a chip. The chips were fresh and crisp with the right amount of salt. The guac was pretty creamy, but not enough garlic or spice for my taste. It seemed like a good safe guac with nothing special to stand out. The churro looked good and possibly had a cream center. I didn't try it so I don't know. I'll have to come here with my wife and get sandwiches, chocolate coffees, and some desserts. I already know next time I'm there I want the Suckling Pig Torta.
