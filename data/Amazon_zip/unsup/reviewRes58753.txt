Mmm, popcorn...I took my boyfriend to GE for his birthday dinner and we were not disappointed, though I will say there were a couple of blah dishes. The steak tartar appetizer was bland--the sauce that accompanied it didn't do anything for what I'm sure was a great cut of beef. I also wasn't overly impressed with GE's desserts. I call them "concept desserts" in that they were interesting to look at, but when it came time to eat them there was nothing fantastic there. I was waiting for a surprise with each bite and there wasn't one. Regardless, I do like the fact that everything GE serves makes you think...the plating is always interesting.Now on to the positives. The popcorn...mmm...seriously good stuff, people! Granted, if I hosed my popcorn in butter and oil at home and then put cheese on it, it'd probably be equally tasty, but still, props where props are due. I think we ate two baskets.Our mains were also delicious. They are no longer on the menu, but I had a fish dish and my boyfriend had GE's take on BBQ and wow. I think his mains are where he really earns his rep. It's hard for a restaurant to live up to so much hype, but I must say, I still think about that meal and smile.Finally, the drinks were really inventive and I loved the two I had (one was Blueberry Hill, the other is no longer on the menu). If you like to experiment with martinis, GE is the place to do it! If you don't, they have a great wine and beer selection for you to choose from.All-in-all, try GE. It's totally worth it. Mmm...popcorn...
