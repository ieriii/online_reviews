ah the purple pig was EXCELLENT. i love the swanky upscale feel of this place. the bone marrow was plentiful but extremely fatty, so be prepared to have some arteries clogged. the octopus was delicious, succulent, and flavorful but pricey ($15) for 2 tentacles plus fingerling potatoes and string beans. the milk braised pork shoulder was FANTASTIC. it literally melts in your mouth. this dish is highly recommended!!! for dessert, we got the sicilian iris (Ricotta & Chocolate Chip filled Fried Brioche). the texture of the brioche was absolutely perfect it was a wonderful dessert that was not too sweet wait on a saturday night was 1.5 hours, as expected, but open seating at the bar! luckily, there just happened to be 2 seats open for me and my friend so bring a good friend or a date on a busy night and stake out the bar seats!
