Crisp!!! Oh how you have disappointed me!!! =( ever since my first visit back in November I thought I was in love! I told everyone I know visiting Chicago about their AMAZING wings and even dreamed about them. I had planned to write a FIVE star review, but now dropped it to ONE =( In the past, I would make my boyfriend trek along with me from downtown Chicago all the way to Lincoln Park without a car to get those wings. However, I ventured to satisfy my cravings today by the bus taking over 30 mins each way to get my hands on the deliciousness only to get back home with wings that were completely DIFFERENT from what I had remembered! Instead of the traditional Korean hot sauce for the Spicy BBQ wings (the ones same with the BimBimBap), I got regular Chinese hot pepper sauce! Yes I'm Asian and I can tell the difference! Beware to check your to-go orders!! My wings were completely different from those that we had at the restaurant! They were soggy and oily instead of being CRISP when I opened the box! What happened???? I am so disappointed and distraught I was only able to eat one wing =( and for the value of 5 wings for $10, this is unacceptable. I may have to stop visiting and find a new wing shop...
