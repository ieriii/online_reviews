An Italian restaurant that knows how to make Gnocchi? For sure I'll be back, I've only ever eaten my own home made Gnocchi because anywhere I've had it, it's too mushy, and not made right and tasteless..Theirs is firm (like it should be!). I had the spinach ones..omg so good, and even good when I took it for lunch the next day...Great beer and wine selections, and damn can they make a margarita..maybe not traditional, or blended..but almost clear(we all know what that means...haha) The staff is super nice...oh and real Italians working in an Italian restaurant! Gotta love it
