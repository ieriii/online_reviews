With that beer selection, and w/ really pretty darn good food, more stars would seem natural. But the bar staff here is almost comically unfriendly. I used to go in here early every Wednesday for close to three years running, and I never received anything more than the most imperceptible of nods. Not that I was expecting balloons and streamers and free pints but sheesh. I have seen regular rudeness toward customers from this place for years. Looking down their nose at the folks who are so rude as to actually want to spend some of their money at this joint.
