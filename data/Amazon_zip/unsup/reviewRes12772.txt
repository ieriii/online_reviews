I use to live right around the corner from here and of course, never went here until I moved, which is a shame. They are known for their mojitas, I heard they were good but personally can't stand mojitos. I have had quite a few things on their menu and have not been disappointed yet. I sent quite a few people here, and always gets the rave reviews. Worth special note, is that they have a nice patio in the summer. The only reason I did not give this place five stars is some times thier service is spotty. Drink go empty ...bread is gone...left waiting.
