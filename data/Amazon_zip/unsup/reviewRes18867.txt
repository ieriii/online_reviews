My sister and I stumbled onto this super-yummy restaurant on our first weekend trip to Chicago! We were making all the touristy rounds and had just finished touring the Art Institute when we found this place for bunch. It's definitely a tourist's delight! We had the duck confit cash and vegeterian eggs benedict which were both to die for! Not to mention the goat cheese grits were heaven in my mouth! If I ever go back to Chicago again, I want to go back for dinner.
