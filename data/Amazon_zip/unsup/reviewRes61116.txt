The food is excellent... very fresh and served hot. The place is remodeled and now well lit. I have eaten at Frontera Grill and easily place Garcias right up there. One thing for sure that needs to be changed is the feel of the staff. They arent the nicest in town. They also tend to rush the meal. You can barely eat you app before you get your main. The sure enough comes the check.
