Well now I've been back for dinner and I was not disappointed. I went with a group of four for a friend's birthday. We couldn't get a reservation in the main dining room so we sat in the lounge. It was perfect and slightly quieter than the rest of the restaurant which was right up our alley. We had a small table with two lounge chairs on the ends and a long bench along the back where us ladies sat. Our server gave us a small table to place on the bench to hold our drinks which would come in really handy when our food came. We decided to share everything, thankfully, because everything was delicious. We started off with roasted duck bao buns, which are adorably served like sandwiches for easy eating. Then we had indo corn fritters and the lemongrass beef lollipops. The corn fritters were fried but not greasy, and absolutely delicious. We split sushi and a couple of main dishes for dinner. The Golden Child, Firecracker, and the Lobster Wagyu, and Sunda's Yellowtail Jalapeno which was served like sushi but just yellow tail wrapped around fillings with a jalapeno on top. They were all fresh and unique. We probably could have stopped there, but we also felt porky that night. We got the Adobo Pork Belly which I think we can all agree was the superstar of the night, and the Charsiu Barbeque Pork which made a valiant effort to keep up. We were all pleased with each dish. The Pork Belly was two huge pieces and would be a great solo main if you're starving and really love pork. However, I highly recommend going with a group of close friends so that you can try several different dishes. Because we were there for a birthday, we got the molten chocolate cake with a candle for dessert. It was okay, but not molten. I was expecting hot, runny chocolate oozing out of the cake with every bite. It was just chocolate cake though.
