It may be partially due to the fact that I don't really eat/like meat, but I really did not enjoy nor was I impressed with Longman and Eagle. I get the concept, it's carefully orchestrated dishes and a short menu. (which I normally like) My party of 6 went here on a Monday night without a reservation. Our hostess was incredibly polite, helpful, and accommodating and she was able to get us a table within 20 minutes. (This is why I'm giving this place 2 stars instead of 1.) Our service was ridiculously slow and our server was disinterested and unhelpful. Additionally, our server did not want to put in our desired bar snacks first -- so we could have them before our meal. (I don't know if this is standard.) After that and our long long long long wait for drinks/ordering I took it as a sign that I was not destined to have any bar snacks.  I had the sole vegetarian item on the menu, which was essentially lentils and cauliflower. It was kind of bland. The only saving grace (flavor) was the pickled radish on the bottom.  As a mostly-vegetarian and appreciator of interested servers, I would seriously protest another visit here.
