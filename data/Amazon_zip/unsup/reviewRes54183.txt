This is one of my favorite spots to grab a bite, but it's ALWAYS busy so there is usually a line. The dine in section is very small and only seats about 25 people so sometimes its better to take it to go. Services is fast, but like I said they are always busy. The tortas are delicious. My favorite is the Milanesa! The Churros taste so fresh and top off a great meal. Occasionally, you will see Rick Bayless pop in from time-to-time, he's very friendly and makes sure everyone is satisfied.
