Whenever I'm in Chicago I attempt to stop by for the ever popular Chicago style hot dawg, being pickled in nature this style is it's of it's own breed. I really like the strait up Hot Diggity Dawg with the picked hot peppers, mustard, and neon green relish. The retro feel of all the packaging, the drive-in experience, and naming schema makes me smile (before, after, and between stuffing my face with food). In addition to killer dawgs they have damn good cookies and milkshakes. Hit them up in the Southwest terminal at Midway if you're on your way out.
