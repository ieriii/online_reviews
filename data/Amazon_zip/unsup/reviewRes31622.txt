Went here for dinner on a Friday night and was impressed with the decor. Very cool and hip design and seemed open to all types. By types I mean rich, old, young, 1st date, etc.    Our server was very nice and prompt. We tried a variety of items from the dragon roll which was fresh but average. The Nigiri watermelon salad was better than I thought it would be. Pork belly adobo was very "adoboish" but strange with pork belly which I usually love just roasted plain. I ordered the garlic rice and was disappointed only because when I visited the Philippines the garlic rice was so delicious. It's usually just Jasmin rice fried with toasted garlic...like it's scented with garlic. I would still recommend this place as I think it's important to have Filipino cuisine updated and in the spotlight. Maybe I'm just not used to it.
