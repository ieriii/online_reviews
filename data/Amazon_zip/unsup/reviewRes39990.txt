So last night I stopped back at L&E at the end of a night filled with margaritas & tequila flights. All I wanted was one thing. The sloppy joe! My neighbor and I scouted ourselves two stools at the bar. I still like the ambiance of this place, the staff and the crowd that comes in. The sloppy joe was good. It's def. different than most sloppy joe's since it's boars head. It's tasty and served on a yummy pretzel bun. I wouldn't say it was the BEST sloppy joe I've ever had, but definitely satisfying. The bartenders really know what they are doing and it was fun watching them make drinks- it's like a science experiement up there! And they are all super friendly. I'm still excited with glee that this place is in our hood. Go visit it. Have some whiskey or one of their signature drinks. Stay a while, enjoy something yummy to eat. And welcome to Logan Square, my friend!
