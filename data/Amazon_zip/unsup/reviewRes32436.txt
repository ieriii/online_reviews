I have been to Sunda six times or so and each time the food has been wonderful. The atmosphere is fun and sexy. I've only has one bad experience with staff- a grumpy female bartender, otherwise, the service has been outstanding. I prefer going on week nights. Bring your patience and make a reservation for dinner on weekend night. I recommend trying the rock shrimp tempura..it is out of this world. Overall, I love this place and would definitely recommend it.
