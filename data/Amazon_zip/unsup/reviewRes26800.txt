GE round two. Overall, a much better experience. Now, it's possible that it was better because I was not on a weird date with an old dude. This time I was with a best girlie friend. It's also possible that it was better because I was a much better orderer this time around.  Friend and I were slightly confused as to who our server was, being that they kind of looked the same (beards & suits galore). Everyone we interacted with was friendly and relaxed, which I truly appreciated. Our water glasses were constantly being refilled, which was fantastic because it was approximately 8,729 degrees outside.  I ate the super amazing corn soup & halibut entree. HEAVEN.  As for dessert, my friend and I shared the chocolate flourless cake. I felt special when I saw Happy Birthday written on the plate. Aww! Thank you GE for being crazy good and helping me celebrate my 27th year of life. I have a feeling this is going to be the best year yet!
