I don't know if I just got there before the crowd or whether the ridiculous Chicago winter was forcing people to stay in bed longer on when I was there last Sunday, but I was surprised that our party of 5 were immediately seated for brunch. We didn't even have to wait until our 5th person was there to sit down. I guess I'm just used to waiting forever no matter where I go for Sunday brunch. Especially when I'm at a restaurant with such good food and service! Everyone there was incredibly friendly. Almost immediately after being seated we were given a plate of beignets and our drink orders were on the way. (I was desperate for coffee, but they had a great list of brunch cocktails that were tempting me.) I had my usual eggs benedict, but this was not the usual eggs benedict. The hollandaise sauce was fantastic, and instead it was served on a puff-pastry instead of a traditional english muffin. But I think the thing I loved the most was the Fried Green Tomato appetizer. They were SO crispy and served with an awesome remoulade and pickled shrimp on top. I would go back just for those. I live in the Loop so I don't trek up to Andersonville nearly enough, but if I find myself in the area again on a Sunday morning, you can bet I'll be at Big Jones. (In fact, if Spring comes this year, I probably would haul myself up there just to eat here.)
