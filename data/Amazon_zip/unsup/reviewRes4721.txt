I came to this restaurant while visiting Chicago last year since it came highly recommended. First off, the decor is really nice. It has a rustic feel to it and the outdoor seating is lovely. They have a very extensive wine list and the waiters/waiteresses are very knowledgable about them. The food is served tapas style, so you order a bunch of different plates to try. The tuna with lima beans, braised baby artichokes, milk braised pork, meatballs, beets and octopus were all delicious. I wish this restaurant was in NYC because I would go all the time - thats how good it was!
