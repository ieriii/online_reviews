I'm an outsider who recently came to Chicago to visit a friend. One of our top priorities was to try out some of the most famous deep dish pizzerias in Chicago - Pizzeria Uno, Gino's East, Lou Malnati's, and Giordano's. Giordano's came out on top (although Lou Malnati's was a very close second). Quite simply, the pizza was delicious. The defining mark of Giordano's is the cheese overload. We're talking massive, overwhelming quantities of mozzarella that will send you into a state of deep bliss. Unless you don't really like cheese, in which case this pizza would be horrible. But if you're a cheese lover like myself, it really doesn't get any better than this. The other toppings and the crust are also very good, but the cheese - oh god, the cheese - is what really brings this home. We came here at around 3:30 PM on July 4th (Monday). There was no wait (in fact, this Giordano's seems to be fairly well hidden, in a quieter part of the city) to get seated, but the pizza took around 35-40 minutes to come out (standard fare for deep dish). The service and ambience were fine - nothing special, but good enough. But the pizza - truly top notch, and the best I had in Chicago. Run, do not walk, to Giordano's.
