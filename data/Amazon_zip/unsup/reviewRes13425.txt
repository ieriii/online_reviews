Great beer! I am a bit partial as I am a beer lover, but they have a great selection of brews. I'm a big fan of IPAs and thought their "Anti-hero" was great.  The food is what should be expected at a brewery, some fantastic burgers and fries. I had the fish and chips which were great. They had a very good sauce for dipping. I ate way too much and it was a bit of a "gut bomb". Some people in our party had burger which looked great and they had nothing but good to say about them. I stole some of my girlfriends mashed potatoes and they were really good too. My friend had a pizza which looked really good to and she confirmed that it tasted great as well. The popcorn bacon appetizer was really great for sharing with the group as well.
