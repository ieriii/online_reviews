Yum!! Italian food! Delicious pasta and wonderful bread with olive oil. I came here on a date this past weekend, I have never been to this place before. We walked in and had no reservations, so that was a mistake. Very crowded and there was an hour wait. So what I thought was just one main dining area, we actually walked to the back, out to an outdoor seating area, then into another section of the restaurant that had a bar and smaller dining area. We ordered our dinner at the bar, and ate there. We ordered a bottle of red wine, which was delicious. I ordered this delicious pasta dish that had a tomato base sauce.....incredible! The spices and flavors in this sauce were so good. Since we were at the bar, the bartender waited on us and was very friendly and attentive. This place is worth checking out! But make sure you make a reservation! It gets crowded.
