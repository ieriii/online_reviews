We found this place using yelp on a recent trip to Chicago. It took us a while to find by foot, but we were very pleased when we got there. The atmosphere was great, and we had the lunch buffet. I enjoyed all the dishes, one after another, except the fish curry (it tasted like gefelte fish). My favorites were the butter chicken, the corn dish and the paneer. While not expertss of Indian Food, we love a great Indian meal when we get it and this was pretty top notch to us! It didn't hurt that we were seated right away and were able to dig in in minutes.
