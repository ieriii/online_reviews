I recently moved to Streeterville and was so excited to see F&O so near me.....I wish I still had the same feeling, worst service ever. walked in to the cafe for a coffee and a side of chicken sausage to go, thinking it would take no more than 5-10 min..never will I stop there for a quick cup of joe. I was late to work, while the server stared at me and didnt even ask what I was waiting for. finally after twenty minutes did I get my coffee and sausage. Thought I would try it again (since it was only a block from my place), same thing, except this time they were flat out rude. If you dont want to be late in the morning and want to grab a quick cup of coffee F&O is NOT the place to go!
