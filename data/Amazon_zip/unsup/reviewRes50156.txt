awesome service! super friendly and attentive staff. got the eggs new orlean--delicious! 2 perfectly poached eggs on top of luscious crab cakes and popovers! could totally tell eggs were not prepoached and warmed up! i asked for side of cheese grits instead of potatoes, which my waitress was perfectly fine to make the switch! i thought grits with the crabcakes, popovers, and eggs made a nice combo! free beignets while i waited for my food! how nice! werent theeee best beignets ive had...but nonetheless delicious fried goodies with lots of powder sugar! brunch menu looks super! i want to come back for more!
