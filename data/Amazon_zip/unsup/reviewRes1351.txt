WOW! I never thought of hot dogs as a real meal, but this place corrected that. I am saddened to say that its only open till 4pm Mon-Sat, but on those days I can play hooky from work, its the destination for a sunny afternoon. Expect a line almost any time of the day. But, its sooo worth the wait. Spend time reviewing the menu on the wall, and debating the choices. Also, don't forget that you can get the sausage grilled/charred, boiled, or your level of deep fried. This is not to be confused with health food. This is an epicurean delight for people who enjoy food. Don't forget the duck fat fried fries, only available Fri/Sat. Its a nice way to top the meal off. Though, I just get 2 dogs and call it a day w/ the one of the awesome drink choices. How many places stock Dr. Brown's Cel-Ray?? My recommendation is the Don Rickles w/ a Game of the Week pick. http://www.hotdougs.com You can take the California exit off of 90/94 and just head North. Its on the SW corner of Roscoe and California.
