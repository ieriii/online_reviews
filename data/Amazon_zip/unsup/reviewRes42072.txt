Why is pizza so good and why is it so hard to find a good pizza place in LA??? What I liked about my deep dish -mushroom, sausage, onions, and green pepper pizza was that even though it was deep dish it wasn't all bread, that the crust and dough had just enough moistness that gave it flavor, that sauce was good and the ingredients tasted fresh, that it wasn't expensive and that you can get it by the slice. Each person gets what they want!!! And even though it wasnt cooked to order it wasn't cold or tasted old! Can't wait to go back!
