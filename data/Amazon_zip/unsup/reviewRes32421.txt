I love meat, I mean really, more so than the average chick. I have married friends that both are vegetarian so I let them pick and finally got to try out the Chicago Diner! Buffalo wings -were okay, I prefer the Buffalo tofu at another Veg friendly spot though. I had the Philly with dairy cheese and it was good! LOVED LOVED LOVED the crusty sesame roll it came on and LOVED the sweet potato fries! I will be back although not for a while since it's not near my locale, but I wouldn't cringe if friends wanted to go again and would even be looking forward. Final thoughts - crispy delicious sweet potato fries and that bread! YUM!
