In theory the Violet Hour represents everything you'd want in a private, upscale swanky cocktail bar with its lush velvet curtains, fancy drinks with overly enthusiastic presentation (in the case of our bartender, extravagant shaking and pelvis thrusting), hushed tones and cande-lit glow. Bring one pal or two, but no more than three as this is not a good "group" bar. This is also not a "meet new people" type of environment as the staff keep strict tabs on crowd control and flow, most of the booths are pretty private and altogether the design has an air of "elegance in exclusion." Now did I love my overpriced drinks? Yes my dear. Did it take forever to finally find the bar? Yes my dear, yes. Was I a little put off by the smirky staff and felt a little out of place considering the crowd was a sort of more yipster than my own personal preferences? In French it is oui mon petit chou, oui oui. But will I go back after I save a small fortune in foreign currency? En el espanol, quizas, quizas quizas!
