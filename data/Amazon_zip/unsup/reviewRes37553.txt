I love Hopleaf. I love the food, I love the beer selection, I love the upstairs bar. I'm a vegetarian and they always have a few options available for me, including one of my favorite sandwiches ever, the C.B.&J. Also their fries with garlic aoli rock my socks! I have vegan phases and these two always call me back to the dairy team! Hopleaf, I don't care if I have to wait two hours for a table on the weekend, I will still come. Thank god for the Korsendonk Pale Ale and the variety of Sam Smith's, they always makes the wait so much more tolerable.
