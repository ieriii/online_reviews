I've lived in LP for 3 years and I've driven past RJ's for that long also. Never been, always wanted. Today was the day...dropped in for lunch and found the place was bustling and full of energy which was a pleasant surprise. A little pocket of good food and good service. Wish I would have dropped in sooner but will definitely be heading back...soon!
