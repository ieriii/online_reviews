Went to Rick Bayless's famous Frontera Grill for lunch. We went at the end of the lunch rush and it was surprisingly not crowded (it was snowing). I was with work collegaues so I did not get to sample any of the alcoholic beverages, which I will look forward to the next time I visit. We all shared the chips and guac, which was good. I was very happy with my meal, which was Puerco al Albanil. The brothy sauce of serrano chiles, caramelized onions, sun-dried tomatoes, bacon was delicious and the meat was tender. I almost wished there was more sauce. Our waiter was a little slow to take our orders but seemed very knowledgable. Possible highlight of the meal was when we were waiting for our coats from the coat check. We were standing around and Rick strolls back from the kitchen around the host stand and around the corner to the bar area where they were having a staff meeting. He was in his chef's jacket, so I can only assume he cooked my meal personally.
