Is the pizza excellent? Yes. Does the bonhomie of the owner towards a few select customers enhance the dining experience of everyone else in the restaurant? No. 4/5 times we've been on the receiving end of uninspired or downright rude service.  No welcome from the waiter, no thank you. Meanwhile the owner cruises around showering attention on persons who are perhaps regulars (or perceived "high rollers").  We asked if we could have a candle put in the tartuffo at a birthday celebration. This very basic request has been warmly accommodated at D.O.C and elsewhere. They utlimately obliged at Spacca Napoli too. Unfortunately the waiter had to first stare at us slack-jawed, making us feel as if we'd arrived at the restaurant via UFO. If some members of the wait staff had as much enthusiasm for the customers as the customers have for the pizza, this would be a great place.
