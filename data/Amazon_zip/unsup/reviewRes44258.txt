Ah, Wakamono. My boyfriend and I tried this place for the first time Friday night. VERY hip place. Super trendy. It has a nice ambience, though - very minimalist-like. We sat down and decided to skip the appetizers - we wanted to move onto the big show. The main squeeze. Yes. The sushi. We ordered 3 orders of Nigiri: Sea Bass, Red Snapper and Yellowtail. Yellowtail was by far the best. Oh God, it made me swoon. It was melt in your mouth type of good. It was PERFECT. Everything nigiri should be. In terms of the rest of the order, then the Sea Bass, then the Red Snapper. The Red Snapper was a little too fatty and fishy for me. However, I've never had Red Snapper before so I have nothing to compare it to. In terms of maki, we ordered the Godzilla roll, a spicy tuna roll and the Oedipus roll. The Godzilla roll was effing awesome. The Oedipus roll was good, but not as good as the Godzilla. There was a little too much mayo on the Oedipus. I regret not ordering more 'plain' maki (spicy tuna, yellowtail) instead of the fancy stuff. If I did it over again, I would have ordered the Godzilla roll, the spicy tuna roll and a yellowtail/scallion roll. Only get 1 fancy roll: That is my advice. Otherwise, stick with the more simplistic stuff. Overall, it was a great dinner. We'll definitely be back!
