Ok so i KNOW its expensive...and if you dont get there early enough ur gonna have to wait (but what brunch spot do you NOT have to wait at) BUUUUTTT....everytime i walk into this place i vow to redecorate my kitchen like they have their rest. AND yah the pancakes are expensive but you can DEF split them, they are huge and not only are they huge but they are AMAZING. Banana smore pancakes??? ummm yah ill give you my first born for some of those! and the OJ is super yumtastical. The staff has been nothing but nice even at their most hectic moments! Its def on the pricy side, so dont make it a regular spot but your missing out if you dont try it AT LEAST once!!!
