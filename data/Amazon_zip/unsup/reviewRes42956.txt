After a drunken night, I woke up very hungover and NEEDING some pizza. I called Domino's around 1pm. At 2pm they called me back to inform me they lost power and would make my pizza as soon as it came back. At 3pm they called to say the power wouldn't be on until 4 and I wouldn't see my pizza until after 5. So despite my craving for the delicious cheesy bready and doughy pizza crust of my trusty Domino's (not my favorite pizza normally, but I love it when I am hung over) I decided to take a chance and order from the Art of Pizza. By the time we found the menu, figured out what we wanted, and placed the order it was about 3:30. By the time the pizza came - it was 4:50. Perhaps had I not waited almost 4 hours from the start of my pizza quest to get it, I might have liked this more. But I just compared it to my Domino's and it fell short. The cheesey bread had no flavor - no herbs like D's, no marinara dipping sauce like D's. The pizza had the pepperoni under the cheese - sad becasue I like to pick mine off and eat it first. The crust was also too thick and hard at the top. I did like the fact that they had things other than pizza, so I could order a sandwich and fries for the fiance. But the fries were soggy and his sandwich only so-so. For $30 with delivery and tip, I would have rather had Domino's. I will say though, the pizza was actually better the day after which earns it a few points.
