I had a great time here. I ordered the frog legs and the etoufee. The frog legs were crispy and delicious. The etoufee was really interesting. I wouldn't say it was the best i'd ever had (they used chips or something so I felt like I was eating cajun nachos), but it was interesting and tasty enough. The food is sort of pricy, and the servings are not the typical jumbo XL, so I wouldn't come here starving, but overall, I was impressed with the menu and had some fun.
