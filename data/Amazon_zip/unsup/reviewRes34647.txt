By far my favorite sushi spot in Chicago. Not pretentious, good quality food, decent service, and reasonable prices. I HIGHLY recommend the Tuna tar tar. They make the chips homemade and mix it with a chili oil. My husband who hates fish will devour this dish. That is how amazing it is. BYOB is always a plus. I do wish they'd put up a website though. I don't like going through secondary sites to see menus or to use as a resource.
