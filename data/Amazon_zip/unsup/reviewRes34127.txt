coffee is too strong. potatoes were not hot. eggs were generic in taste. this restaurant is so average especially when compared to Sally's Restaurant in Naperville, where I happily drive to on Saturdays for a quick, hot, excellent tasting and welcoming staff second to none. It's the difference that make Yolk's just average. And its pricier to boot. Find a different restaurant if you can.
