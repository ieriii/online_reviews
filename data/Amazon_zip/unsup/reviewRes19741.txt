I'm not a huge fan of Rick Bayless as a person (he can be pretty rude to fans of his work), but you can't argue his culinary prowess. Xoco is delicious and well priced Mexican fare. Don't miss the vanilla ice cream and churros at the end of your meal... but be sure you carb up before getting in line, because the waits can be excruciating!
