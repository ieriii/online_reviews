That awkward moment when you realize your tostones' are better than a restaurant and that 40 bucks you just spent on a meal that consisted mostly of starch and you could have bought a truckload of plantains....but I need to get swimming 90 miles back to the shore of Florida because if this is what Cuban food tastes like it is no wonder Cubans are swimming on rafts trying to get to America. As someone who absolutely enjoys my food being 'well done' I feel it absolutely important to point out that anything you get from a grill here will be fried 'hard'. Which also means completely devoid of flavor. The tostones' probably could have chipped my tooth if I didn't really just swallow them whole. My 'Cuban' burger (aka ground beef and chorizo smashed together, not even mixed together, just smashed) was well done, although I NEVER was asked how I would like it cooked. It was burned but NOT warm.? The bun was also burned but NOT warm.? It was inedible. Really. It was disgusting and for 12 bucks I really could have gotten 12 whoppers and fed the homeless. At least the whoppers would have been HOT. Also, there are NO condiments in this restaurant. I had to ask for ketchup for the burger that was so dry only a shark could eat it without chipping yet ANOTHER tooth. And even then I only got a freaking tiny cup of it. Tiny cup. The only condiment they have is garlic. Minced garlic, it is not even garlic sauce. It is just minced garlic. Really, I am serious. Minced garlic. No flavor. No spices. Minced garlic. A word of advice: the prices of their sandwiches double after 5pm. Yes, really, double. They even have the nerve to have it listed on the menu as such. Really. Tacky. Let me bottom line it for you: if you like expensive minced garlic, 12 dollar burned but cold hamburgers, and waking up with heartburn and gut rot, by all means eat here. P.S. I still LOVE the other location.
