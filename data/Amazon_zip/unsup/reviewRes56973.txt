I was skeptical because we went during Restaurant Week.... However I could not have asked for a better experience! The staff was very attentive and polite! They constantly asked us if we needed anything or if we had any special request throughout the night. The food...The Salad Bar options at Texas exceeded my expectations as I have been to Fogo De Chao and was not impressed at all. I went around Texas' salad bar least 3 times just to make sure I had everything I wanted to try! :-) The Meat service was great! Again, because it was restaurant week I was fearful we would be overlooked and not have the opportunity to try everything we wanted.... I was wrong! As soon as we turned our cards over to green the servers catered to us, coming by several times throughout the night with every offering on the menu. And everything was incredible... the temperature, the taste, all perfect. Every bite I took was supremely satisfying....Towards the end of the night I motioned for one server to stop by as he was going back to get more of the house speciality and he kept walking! Thinking he ignored my request, I was a little disappointed.... UNTIL he promptly returned within minutes, directly to our table to serve us first!!! He had taken notice after all. Nice! Overall great experience. I will definitely be back! Don't forget to try the caipirinha's, strong and sweet! Salud!
