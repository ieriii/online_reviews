PER-FEC-TION. N. 5 stars! I had the Jicama Callejera ( crunchy jicama, cucumber and pineapple with fresh lime and crushed guajillo chile) to start. It was so sweet, and so crunchy and fresh and very refreshing! The chile was not spicy at all and it brought some flavor to the jicama. The presentation was so beautiful, this was a great starter! Now for my main dish....Puerco en Mole Verde Queretano (garlic-marinated Maple Creek pork loin, slow-cooked over the coals, with Queretaro-style green mole of poblano chiles, plantains, sesame seeds, peanuts and sweet spices. Savory corn masa tamales, nopal-poblano rajas) ... UN-BELIEVEABLE. I was a little hesitant as first because the word chiles scares me away because I'm not a fan of spicy foods. but nothing about this dish was spicy at all. The pork lion was very tender, and the mole verde sauce complemented the pork lion. The corn tamales were delicious, they were the best tamales I've ever eaten. The sauce was DELICIOUS. It wasn't heavy at all, and the portion size was fantastic. I left feeling full and it wasn't a food coma full. But full and very very happy. The thing i REALLY loved about Frontera Grill was that the menu was not your typical mexican menu with 75% of the menu filled with quesadillas, tacos, taquitos..chicken, beef, or vegetarian...... Everything on the menu was different from your typical mexican restaurant....I have nothing but amazing things to say about this place. Excellent. I will defiantly come back again.
