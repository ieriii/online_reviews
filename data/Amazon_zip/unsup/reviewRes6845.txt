One of my favorite places on earth! The food is amazing. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. My personal favorites are the lasagna spaghetti barese and the lobster ravioli. Not only is it one of the best places to eat in Chicago, it is just such a great experience every time my wife and I dine here. The atmosphere is phenomal, whether sitting inside or outside. Most importantly, then entire staff is so warm and kind writing about it would not do they justice. We go any chance we have. It is our home away from home. Thank you Sapori for the food and kindness you have provided us for years. Five stars does not give it justice.
