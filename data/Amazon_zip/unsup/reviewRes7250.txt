Damn those were some great ribs! Went with a bunch of guys and pre-ordered the competition ribs. They were the best ribs I have had in Chicago in the last 8 years. Clearly beat out Smoque and Fat Willys and several others. The Mac n' cheese was also the best I have had at any BBQ place. We re-ordered that several times. The brisket was good, but not as good as Smoque. The sauces were actually a big disappointing.. but the ribs were so good on their own, they did not need any sauce.. so tender and meaty and smoked right through - I still dream about them. The restaurant itself is very appealing and women will like it way more than your average BBQ place. You could host a nice business dinner her easily with the nice white limestone and big wooden beams in the main room. The butter pickles were fantastic to start as were the hushpuppies. Those went quite fast. The other stellar side was the mashed potatoes. Be forewarned that this place does not have many vegetarian options.. but I don't necessarily think a BBQ place should. The chef came to our table personally to see how we liked the ribs.. which was a nice touch. The private rooms upstairs looked fantastic as well. A great addition to the BBQ scene.. more upscale and very appealing. Mouth- watering ribs. Remember to pre-order those.. they are so worth it. (big slab though.. so share with someone)... Skip the brisket.. small portion and only okay. Pulled pork was also solid.. not amazing. Do not miss the Mac n Cheese.
