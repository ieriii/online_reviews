Uncommon Ground has been a trailblazer in the sustainable restaurant movement in Chicago. This second restaurant on Devon Avenue is devoted to supporting and showcasing sustainable producing and eating. We give them 5 stars for their sourcing of humane animal products. They list on the menu which farms the products come from (with a few exceptions). A phone call to the restaurant yielded a conversation with chef Daniel Jacobs about where they source the rest of the animal products that appear on the menu. For example, chicken and turkey comes from Gunthorp Farms. Cheese is sourced from farms such as Prairie Pure and Cedar Grove. Eggs come from New Century; milk and other dairy products come from Organic Valley or Kilgus Farmstead. Beef comes from Dietzler Farms and pork comes from Becker Lane or Gunthorp, depending on the dish ordered. Uncommon Ground goes above and beyond by also hosting Green Room Sessions, networking and learning opportunities for community members interested in green and sustainability issues. We applaud their efforts and heartily enjoyed the meal we eat in this branch of their restaurant. Room for improvement: Consider sourcing beef products that are completely grass-fed and grass-finished to protect cattle health. The Humane Choice is a project of Food Animal Concerns Trust (FACT). This restaurant was reviewed by FACT staff members Larissa McKenna and Lisa Isenhart. FACT is a Chicago-based non-profit organization dedicated to improving the way animals are raised on farms.
