Just what the neighborhood needed - a high-quality, innovative and fresh take-out place! The steak and salmon sandwiches are great - very flavorful, on delicious bread. I've gone for carryout several times and have never been disappointed.I've also gone to one of their Underground Dinners, 5 courses for around $55. AND, it's BYOB. You can have a fine dining experience in a cozy, dimly-lit room with great food and service, and not pay the fine dining cost by bringing your own. One other really special detail is that Bon Soiree can give you the number for another neighborhood business, Provenance, who will pair wines with the evening's menu, then deliver them to the restaurant so they are waiting for your when you get there!
