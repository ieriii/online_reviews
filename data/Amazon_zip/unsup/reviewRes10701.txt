Sugar-overloaded, beautiful pancakes!! I got 3 individual pancakes instead of a stack of 3: red velvet, oreo, and lemon ricotta. Oreo pancake was my fav. We also had an amazing breakfast burrito w/o sour cream with awesome home fries. A bit relieved not to live near this place, as I would for sure get diabetes for eating candies for breakfast every morning. On 8 AM on a week day morning, this place was respectably staffed.
