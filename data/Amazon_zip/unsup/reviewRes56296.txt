Cozy atmosphere, attentive staff (just a touch slow at first), vast menu, and great food. Some dishes were clearly better than others.The owners are very affable and welcoming. Dishes are delicious and portions are more than plenty.I would buy the artwork on the walls if the owner would sell it. Atmosphere was a pleasant surprise; the place is actually slightly romantic when the lights dim around 8 pm.I will be back. PS Pho is authentic and killer (reconciling it with my trip to Vietnam).
