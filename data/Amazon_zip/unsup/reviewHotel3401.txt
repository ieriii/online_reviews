This hotel could be so much better if it was less American. First of all, pls. Give the customers the option of not changing the towels every day. It is less wasteful and more environemntally friendly therefore less American:-). It is done everywhere in Europe. I told the reception of that. For one day, it was OK. Next days again they were changing every towel I touched. The breakfast is extremely expensive for what it is. They definitly need more variety. WiFI is free in the lobby area but $9 per day if you use it from your room. Extortionate to say the least. Even if you use a phone card to make an international call, as soon as you are connected, there is an outrageous $1.50 on your bill. Lastly, if you stay long and need laundry done, it is $8 per shirt! On the brighter side, the staff is good and professional. When I told them about the breakfast at check out, they offered me a free breakfast which is nice but it also made me think about the variety. I also complained about the breakfast in twitter which means they follow social media, also positive. The location of the hotel is excellent and the jazz they play at all times at reception is heart warming. What is really funny about this hotel is that British Airways crew stays here. So every day you either see them arriving or departing from/to O'Hare which makes it appear like a deja-vu each time you come to reception especially if you stay like I did for a week. All in all, I am not sure I am returning to this hotel.
