Went here with my sister last week. Was a bit surprised when we walked up, It definitely doesn't look like a restaurant from the outside. I thought the inside was so cute, reminded me of cottage. I love restaurants that steer away from the typical pre-dinner bread and butter, so kudos for serving delicious pickles and bbq chips. We started off with the pimms cup and ginger fizz. The ginger fizz was a tad strong on the bourbon. Got the bacon cheddar hush puppies, super yummy and they serve it with a spicy mayo-like dip. I got the pulled pork and sister got the brisket sandwich. Pulled pork was great and trying the different sauces was fun. Sister wasn't too big of a fan of the brisket, she was looking for more of a shaved texture rather than chunks/pieces. We got our leftovers wrapped, but wish they would have wrapped the sauces as well! Overall, good food and good service.
