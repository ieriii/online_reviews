This hotel has a European flair, by which I mean there is no superfluous space. The lobby, elevator, hallways, and rooms are all small. That said, the decor is nice & the beds are comfortable. As I had no problems, my interaction with the staff was limited, but pleasant. The location is great; it's just far enough off of Michigan to be in a quiet area but quite close enough to walk to almost all of downtown's attractions (those who are aiming for a location south of the river might opt to take a bus).
