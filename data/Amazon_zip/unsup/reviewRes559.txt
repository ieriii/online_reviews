You don't just go to Alinea to EAT food, you go there to EXPERIENCE food.  It is a common belief that out of the five senses we only use "taste" and "sight" when we dine, but Alinea shatters that misconception and entices every sense. I would love to go into detail about how they accomplish this and give a description of all 12 courses (which I could do from memory), but I almost feel like I would be ruining the experience for anyone dining there for the first time. One of the aspects that I was most impressed with was the well-orchestrated serving ritual, I felt like I was watching the servers dance a graceful waltz.. It was also refreshing to encounter a friendly staff in a fine-dining environment. You can tell that the staff takes pride in their work and they have a lot of respect for the Chef. I wish I could give this restaurant 10 stars. If you had to choose one place in the world to eat at in your lifetime, this is that place!
