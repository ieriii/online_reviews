The food is slightly above average for persian/med food. The curry rice doesn't hold a stick to Rezas dill rice, and the entrees aren't exactly overly fresh. But it's the incredible prices for the entree meals that keep you coming back. (Let that be a warning to the owners who might be thinking about raising the prices.) Didn't like the spinach pie too much, but the meat dishes were tasty.
