LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!!! My very awesome boyfriend took me here on our anniversary. He's the best and so is the food here! :) I've been here multiple times now and never dissapointed. Had the Paso Robles Zinfandel with the pork. Also had the YUMMY pumpkin soup. Please Campbells make that in a can so I can eat it everyday!!! My boyfriend really liked his meal too. AND to top it off, hands down amazing service everytime. Who doesn't like to be treated nice when they go out? Can't wait to go back again.
