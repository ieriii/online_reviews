Nice restaurant with modern decor. Attentive wait staff. We arrived for lunch to find they do not offer a lunch menu = somewhat pricey for lunch and large dinner-size portions. Had the Spicy noodle soup and rice cake with chicken. Like other reviewers, I loved the spicy cabbage that was complimentary, I definitely wanted more but food portions were filling. Would return with group so we could try more dishes!! Great find on this trip to Chicago!
