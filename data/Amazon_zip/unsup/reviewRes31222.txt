Divine from start to finish. I enjoyed the seafood as well as their sides. Meal: chopped salad, oysters, scallops, sweet potato mash, lobster mash potatoes, and a glass of Shiraz. Dessert: (even better then the meal) amazing cheesecake, butter cake and chocolate covered strawberries!!!!!! Guaranteed to satisfy!
