I've never been here for dinner or ordered off their lunch menu, but their brunch has never let us down!! The first time I had brunch here, I knew I had stumbled upon something incredible. We ordered 2 specials that they had on their menu at the time (however, no longer available.) I couldn't tell you exactly what they were, but remember that they were delicious. They also offer some unique drinks such as the cactus league with sparkling wine with hibiscus nectar and candied hibiscus flower. I'm not a big bloody mary fan, but every time someone orders it at the table, I always take a sip and are blown away by the different flavors going on in that glass! (You can't miss it if you are a bloody mary fan!) The food is good (consistent) and any restaurant that is eco conscious is an A in my food.
