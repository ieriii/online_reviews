Had a doctor's appt not too far away, and the receptionists recommended this place saying "it's their favorite, to die for and the sauce with the Seoul Bowl was out of this world". So we walked there to check it out. The place has a pretty good sized menu, and the owner, John was way helpful with explaining the different dishes and what were the favorites. We had the 10 wings, getting a combination of Crisp BBQ and the Seoul Sassy, as well as the Seoul Bowl. The wings were really good, and they are HUGE!!!! Definitely something to share with someone. I especially took a liking to the Seoul Sassy. The Seoul Bowl had a huge portion as well for $7.00. We for sure have made this place a top favorite and a to-go place. John, you are incredibly friendly and your business will soar with your customer service.
