Shaw's has a wide selection of very fresh fish and seafood, and they do an excellent job of cooking it expertly. Other than that, this is a plain old seafood house, the kind of place I'm sure you've been to many times in your life. If you are the kind of person who likes the comfort of knowing what is coming then this is the place for you. I am not one of those people, so I will choose to dine elsewhere. One other note, should you choose to dine here enjoy dining with the multitude of poorly dressed and loud conventioneers and tourists.
