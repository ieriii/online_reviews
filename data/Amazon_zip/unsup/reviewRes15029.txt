If you want to impress a special someone, this is the spot. Enter through a unmarked doorway in a brightly graffitied wall on Damen (right across from Big Star's patio), sneak through heavy velvet curtains in a darkened hallway, and enter a sexy, dimly lit den where stylish people are sipping craft cocktails in tall-backed booths that feel like secret coves.  Design wise, this might be the slickest place in Chicago. The ambiance alone is worth the trip. The cocktails were also something really special-- surprising, thoughtful concoctions mixed by expert bartenders and served up by knowledgeable staff.  Violet Hour is a destination for a memorable, impressive, swanky night out on the town. It lives up to the hype in every way imaginable.
