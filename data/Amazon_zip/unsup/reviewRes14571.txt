My boyfriend and I love trying new restaurants, especially when there's an atypical drink list involved.  We got to Rev. Brew around 7:30 on a Tuesday and the place was hopping! Not overly hopping where we waited an hour to get a table, but we did wait about 15-20 minutes. However, what I thought was very cool was they had a server in the lounge area-- we were able to get a drink (the Anti-Hero I.P.A) while we were waiting. We commented how we liked the vibe and atmosphere of the restaurant. Any restaurant that has eclectic groups of cliental is usually a sign that it's good. When we got to our table we were greeted by a friendly waitress. We ordered our food (my boyfriend got the Hombre Burger and I ordered the Tofu Chili Dog) and it wasn't long before it came out. Justin said his burger was a B+ ("about an 8.7, 8.8 out of 10) and I found my tofu chili dog to be pretty flavorful! Aside from the food, we were impressed with the beer menu. No Coor's Light, Miller Light, or Bud! They (for obvious reasons) highlighted their microbrews, but if you weren't interested in those, they also offered a plethora of other microbrewed beers. Like I said before, we tried their I.P.A (as I'm a huge fan of India Pale Ales) and it was pretty good. It wasn't as hoppy as an I.P.A usually is, but tasty none-the-less.  All in all, this place had delicious eats, good beers, and a hip vibe. We will be returning here!
