After a viewing of Waiting for Superman (a great documentary about the inequities of Public Schools- a must see) at the AMC on East Illinois, I decided to try Purple Pig. It was definitely worth it!! Ambiance- excellent, the place was buzzing and it was a Wednesday night. Food: I ordered the chorizo stuffed olives, which were also deep fried. It is a good choice for anyone who loves olives, although I could not taste the chorizo. And then I had the Braised Pork Shoulder, which was to die for. It was so soft and moist that it melted in your mouth. They even served it with a spoon as to say 'it's so moist, you don't need a fork." I would go again and again and again. Four Stars!!
