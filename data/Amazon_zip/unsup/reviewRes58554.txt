As far as restaurants go, this is as good as it gets. The chef @ Le Colonial creates the perfect dishes, perfect proportions and just the right twist on French & Vietnamese that you'd think it was it's own genre of food. In fact, it may be.If there is a bad seat in the house, I wouldn't know because the food is always the main point of interest for me. Their Wednesday date night is a great time to try it out if you are at all skeptical.LOVE IT!
