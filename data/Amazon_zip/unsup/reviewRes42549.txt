Disclaimer: I'm a West Loop-er but I really don't think that has artificially inflated this review in any way.  The first time I went to Gilt Bar it was for drinks only, I was really impressed w/ the cocktail menu which was reminiscent of Violet Hour or Sepia. Drinks were fantasic, fairly priced and on top of that the selection is endless. I think the liquor/beer menu is 5 times as long as the food menu. So much good beer. It's my new thing, so I know. I've traded cupcakes for beer, if I'm going to consume that many excess calories I might as well get drunk in the process.  The second time I went was at 9pm on a Wednesday night-- I was starving after a class and desperately wanted booze, food and not to drop a ton of money. As a small girl, small plates restaurants seem to be the best compromise. We had the orecchiette w/ sausage, a beet salad and triple cream cheese on toast (get that). Everything was really tasty, I was pleasantly surprised-- and on top of that I stopped after 1 drink, so the bill was artificially low and I left artificially happy. I love that.
