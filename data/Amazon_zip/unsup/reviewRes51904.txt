Right next to the hotel I stayed at so I had to try their deep dish! There always seems to be a line to eat at this place, so try to come at an off time or come really early. You think that when you get let in after waiting in line outside, you get seated right away...but nope think again, you have to wait some more inside. Anyways, the portions are massive so if it's just a party of 2, just order the small deep dish...no need to be overzealous and order a medium or large. The small is more than enough. I could barely make it through one slice before i called it quits. Too bad my stomach hurt after, but prob would come again next time i come.
