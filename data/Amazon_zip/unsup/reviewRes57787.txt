Finally!!! It took me a long time to find a restaurant like Nana...but it was worth the search! It's rare to find a breakfast/brunch place with such an amazing menu. This place takes breakfast to a whole new level, never again will I be satisfied with just plain eggs and bacon when I can have out of this world dishes such as the nanadict or eggs benedict crab cakes that are to die for! Not only is the food delicious (and all organic without the organic pricetag!!), but the place is so inviting and beautifully chic without feeling stuffy or pretentious. And then there's the staff. The first time I went to Nana I was served by a beautiful and super sweet girl who I later found out was the owner's sister. She went out of her way even on a busy weekend to make sure my picky 4year old got exactly what he wanted and to my surprise he ate every bite of his delicious pancakes and cheesy eggs! And since then I have had the pleasure of meeting the wonderful and sweet brothers Omar and Chris who started it all and their charming and beautiful mother who Nana was named after. What always puts a smile on my face is the fact that no matter what mood I'm in I instantly feel happy when I step into Nana because it is consistently a place where you will receive great service and awesome food! If you want to experience a real culinary treat and yet feel comfortable and unpretentious go to Nana, and I dare you to try and not go back once you have had a taste! =)
