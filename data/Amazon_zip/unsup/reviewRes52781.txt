The best BYOB in Chicago- no where else is as inviting and comfortable as 90 Miles and the Cuban food is authentic! Owner Alberto treats this place like his own home and makes everyone feel welcome! The outdoor waiting area/patio is a gem and the art wrok throughout the whole place is fantastic! I've been there time and time again and will continue making my way from downtown to start the night 90 Miles Cafe... only a 10 minute walk from the heart of Wicker Park nightlife as well!!! To order: Drinks: bring a bottle of rum and ask for a mojito mix pitcher! Best deal on earth and no corking fee... plus i love the mason jars filled with ice! They also do the same for wine and sangria. Apps: Choripan and yuca frita- both huge, delicous portions Lunch: Cuban Sandwich- legit and served w/ salty, crunchy banana chips Dinner: Ropa Vieja- specialty of the house and the best i've had outside Miami Dessert: expertly prepared Cuban coffee and pastelito guayaba... too good to be true. The staff is very friendly, also! Just make sure you go to the Logan Sqaure location for dinner and not the Roscoe Village spot which is a mini version better suited for take-out. Don't be scared off by the wait either- instead bring a 6-pack in addition to your rum/wine and chill outside in the couch filled courtyard or upstairs in the studio! Well done, Alberto! Felicidades. http://www.youtube.com/w
