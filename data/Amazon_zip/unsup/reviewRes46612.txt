My family and I have been coming to this restaurant for years- often after trips to Lincoln Park Zoo, as it's conveniently located across the street. This is the first Lettuce Entertain You restaurant, and it is one of the very best. It's a bit of a tight squeeze with all the tables, but very cozy, with a nice bar, huge salad bar full of fresh veggies, and walls covered with pictures of past waitresses. They have a great menu- lots of good options. The past couple times I've been there I've had their California wrap which is excellent. If you can, save room to split a milkshake. You really can't go wrong with anything you order off the menu, and the service is great. This is the perfect lunch spot.
