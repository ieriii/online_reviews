I love sushi and I love that this place is byob. It's always busy, but the food is delicious. I tried to get a reservation on a saturday and that was a no go- minus one star for that. When we did go, we waited forever for our food. Minus a star for that. The sushi is very delicious and I like the large menu. I'd recommend Coast for date nights, but it's definitely hard to go there with a group.
