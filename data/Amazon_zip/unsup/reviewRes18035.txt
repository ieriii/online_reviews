First...the bad. And it's not even too bad. This place is small, you will be elbow to elbow with other diners on a crowded Friday or Saturday night. But the service, ambience, decor, abundant kindness and attentiveness from the servers will eclipse any claustrophia FAST! And then when your food appears...OH YAAAAAAAAA! Exquisite and flavorful dishes, BYOB!, fresh ingredients, lots to pick from, but not so much you feel dizzy. Great eats, great service! Can't wait to dine here again!!!
