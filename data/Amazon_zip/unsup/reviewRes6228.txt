I have been to Wildfire several times, and it has never disappointed me! The service is always great and friendly, the steaks are mouth watering and so are the pork chops! I love their super fudge sundaes that's big enough for 4 or 5 people. The stuffed shrimp and bacon wrapped scallops are spectacular and are a MUST when I go there. I love Wildfire and I can't wait to go back!
