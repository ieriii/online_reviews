The only draw back is the faint but distinct smell of cigarettes in common area (elevator area) and also in my room. Or else, the staff is professional and efficient. Modern and minimalist decor throughout the hotel is calming. The bed is super comfy. Room's spacious- the room i was in had a separate room for kitchenette, a living room couch, and a reading/breakfast nook. Just lovely. Also, love that they offer complimentary Kiehl's products! I didn't even need to unpack to enjoy a hot shower after a long day of traveling!
