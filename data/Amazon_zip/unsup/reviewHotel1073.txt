I do so love Fairmont Hotels . . . Vancouver, Whistler, and, of course, San Francisco . . . so when coming to Chicago, we definitely stayed at the Fairmont Millennium Park. The lobby is beautifully appointed, with the check-in counter on one side of the circular lobby, the concierge on the other, and ENO (their lobby bar dedicated to wine, cheese and chocolate) dominating the middle. By the time we got our bags and the cab took us from O'Hare to the hotel, Lynn and I didn't check in until around 7:45-8:00, but our room was (naturally) waiting for us, and the bellman brought our bags up to the room immediately (good thing, too, as we had 8:30 dinner reservations). Our room was on the 15th floor, with a spectacular view to the east, of the yacht harbor and Lake Michigan. The pillow-topped mattress was perfect; the bathroom large and roomy, the shower good, the Bose sound system paired with the flat-panel TV sounded great; so did the iPod player, actually, that was built into the base of the desk lamp, and the room came with free wi-fi. The mini-bar wouldn't open, but we didn't need it (see below) except to store leftovers in, and they immediately brought up a small refrigerator to our room. The room was also on the opposite end of the floor from the Fairmont Gold Lounge, meaning breakfast, cocktails, and a concierge were mere steps (rather than floors) away . . . It was a SPECTACULAR place to stay. Gawd, I love the Fairmont . . .
