This is the quintessential Chicago hot dog experience. Stop reading this review. Find a friend with a car. Go to Superdawg. You cannot call yourself a true Chicagoan until you've had a Superdawg delivered to your car window. What they have: Chicago dogs, burgers, malts and sodas. It's a pretty simple menu but you don't need anything more. Make sure to bring your camera. You'll want a picture in front of the giant Superdawg and his girlfriend!
