Keep bringing the meat, Stop bringing the meat. My uncle lives in Rio and I went to several of these style restaurants in Brazil when I visited him and I think Fogo best represents what these restaurants are doing down there. All the meat is extremely fresh and delicious, the servers are all exceptionally professional, and the salad bar is just plain ridiculous. Plan on eating way too much and paying a lot but having a truly wonderful and unique dining experience. I previously gave Fogo 4 stars and had the above listed review which I am keeping up as it accurately describes all of dining experiences there expect the last one, which will be my last one since I had violent and painful vomiting for several hours after getting home from eating there recently.
