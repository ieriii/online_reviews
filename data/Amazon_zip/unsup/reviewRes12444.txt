I finally went to Cafe 28 last night after hearing about it for so long. I used the Yelp reviews to gauge whether I wanted to try it out and I was really glad I did! I had the shrimp app and it was so good! That was followed by the Ropa Vieja which was this juicy beef cut into super thin strips served with rice, black beans, and plantains. Delicious! Finally I had the pistachio cake and that was the only thing that wasn't super great. Perhaps the other desserts were better but if you want something sweet....just have the MOJITO! It's great! Great place...thanks for the helpful reviews, everyone!
