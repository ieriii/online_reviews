This place is absolutely fantastic! Best hotdogs I have ever had. The combinations are amazing and always changing and the encased meats are brilliantly garnished. If you're a picky eater (in terms of meat or cheese) probably not worth waiting in line for to get a traditional Chicago hotdog. However, if you enjoy trying new foods (alligator meat, foie duck sausage, buffalo meat ect) then Hot Doug's is a MUST. Aside from the hotdogs, the french fries are pretty good, Friday and Saturday's they have them fried in duck fat which are awesome! I've had all of the special hotdogs and can vouch for all of them! A few important things to consider: Hot Doug's ONLY takes CASH, no credit, so be prepared. The hotdogs are pretty expensive between $7-9 each. The line is ALWAYS long and extends outside of the building so get there early! Hot Doug's is only open for lunch, 10:00AM-4:00PM and are often closed for holidays so call in advance! And finally I recommend bringing 3 people and buying all the special hotdogs and splitting them in three so you can try all of them!
