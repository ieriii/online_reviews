Be ready to wait in line. Not really worth the wait, if you ask me. The drinks are very unique, but its for $12 a cocktail. Once you do make it in, they are very restrictive. No cell phone, no pictures, no hats. The high back chairs and booths, along with the curtains, make for a very private setting. We only stayed for one drink. Not really the bar for me. If I wanted to drink in a hidden room, I would have drink in my hotel room. If you're looking for a vibrant crowd, I'd try something else.
