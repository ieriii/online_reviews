I'm not a beer drinker so ignore this review if you're looking to see ratings of beers from this establishment.  I came here the other day with some coworkers. I ordered the mustard chicken sandwich, which was pretty good. Not WOW, but OK. My fries were overdone. A couple of my coworkers ordered the pizzas and they looked good, but I didn't try any. I don't have any issues with this place...I am just not a big fan of the trendy, hipster-magnet type places like this that are popping up everywhere. There is overpriced art on the wall for sale. The art is "revolutionary" themed but is rather uninspired. I can imagine kids from the suburbs moving to Logan Square, hanging out at a place like this to be "cool", and buying art from here to kind of "pay dues". Anyway, enough of that junk. This place is aight, but not on the top of my list.
