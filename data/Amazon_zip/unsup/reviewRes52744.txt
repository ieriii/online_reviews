I definitely still love this place. Perfect summer spot. Once the day starts to cool off, slip in here for dinner with a bottle of rum and you're golden. Sit outside and just chill. Get the mojito pitcher and the puerco rostizado. It's one of those places that's great for every occasion - date, girls night, boys night, family dinner, etc. LOVE
