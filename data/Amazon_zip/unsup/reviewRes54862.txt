Late evening of July 22, 2011 I took my European guests to Chicago's European bar to show high quality of US restaurants. I was always proud of this bar, and I was always bringing my friends here. I liked Hopleaf because of good European beers, and go here often although it is little expensive. I will never visit this place again. This time it was a disaster. Food here is just so so. French fries here are always burned, bitter and extremely salty. I don't think that anybody can eat this kind dark brown fries. This bar supposed to be open 'til 2AM. The rude guy forced us to move from restaurant to bar at 0:30AM. Then it turned to worst nightmare. This guy was putting chairs up on table around us 55 minutes before closing time. The guy was telling to my friend before closing time 45 minutes that he cannot purchase another beer. They turned off lights down to total dark at 1:15AM. When I said, that bar is open until 2pm and I can drink my beer freely, bald barman grabbed my full glass of expensive beer and spilled it on floor. Unbelievable. We spent over $180.00 on food and beers and then this guy was treating us like this. I showed to my guests from Europe how the staff of restaurant treats people here. I will never enter this pub even I love Belgian beers. When I think about Hopleaf staff, I want to throw up. Well done folks. You've just lost another customer. I wish to rate this restaurant 0 stars!
