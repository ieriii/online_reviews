I've now been to Mercat 4 times. Everytime the food has been excellent, however on the last couple of occasions the service has been pretty bad. This time there were 7 of us and the waiter didn't seem to care as his tip was secure. It was lucky we checked the bill as we were charged for 2 bottles of wine when we only consumed one!
