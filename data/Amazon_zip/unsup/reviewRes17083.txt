First impression: Beautiful and vibrant decor. I went here for lunch with a friend. The cubano sandwich was good, big enough that I had to take half home. It came with mixed greens. Excellent raspberry mojito. I ordered it then almost had buyer's remorse, thinking they may add some razmatazz or something...but was pleasantly relieved to see that they muddled fresh raspberries into the drink. The harmony of lime, mint, and flecks of fresh berry were a great combination. I think this restaurant is in the building that housed The Drink years ago. I bet the lounge area is nice at night. $5 valet. Eh. Well that area is parking challenged.
