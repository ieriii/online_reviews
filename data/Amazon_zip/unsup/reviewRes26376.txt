Probably 3.5 stars. Good: the Simply It's beef was outstanding, it's BYOB, the fried banana dessert, nice atmosphere and lighting, pleasantly surprised by the bill at the end of the night (probably had to do with the BYOB factor). Bad: clay pot chicken wasn't too exciting, none of the appetizers blew me away, the waiters kind of tried to hustle us out at the end of the night. All in all, a fun dinner with friends. One of my friends had a shrimp dish that she said was outstanding. I wouldn't be opposed to coming back here, but it's not high atop my list of places to eat in Lincoln Park.
