I had heard good things about this restaurant and while in Chicago recently decided to stop in and check it out. We decided on the "experience" tasting menu. Everything we had was absolutely delicious. As others have said the portions are a tad on the small side but between the popcorn and all of the courses on the menu we left full so it didn't pose a problem. Overall I have to say this is the second most enjoyable meal I have ever had dining out next to Mori Moto. I would definitely stop in if you have the opportunity and don't mind spending a little bit of money.
