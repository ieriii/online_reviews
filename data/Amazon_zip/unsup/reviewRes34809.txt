Falafel! Falafel! Falafel!!! Need I say more? For realz, best in the city and for next to nothing. The lentil soup is great and the baklava is mouth watering. I know they have a salad bar that people rave about, but quite frankly, whenever I go into Sultan's I only ever have falafel on the brain and haven't wanted to stray away from the sandwich line. And speaking of sandwiches, make sure to check out the guys making the falafel. Their slicing and dicing is an art for in and of itself.
