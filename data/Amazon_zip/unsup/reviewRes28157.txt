My new favorite deep dish in the city, and my husband has started requesting it on a weekly basis. There's nothing remarkable about the thin crust, but the deep dish is the perfect cheese/sauce/crust combo. The french fries were also lacking so I had to deduct a star, because fries and pizza are my favorite combination. But, it's nice to be able to get a table at a decent time without having to wait. Service is average but we'll come back anyways - the pizza IS that good, and yes, you should try it.
