When I imagine eating pizza, the pizza at Spacca Napoli is the pizza in my head: fresh and vibrant toppings on a perfectly balanced, flavorful chewy-but-with-a-bite crust. Keep in mind that this is not your typical American pizza; it's much less saucy/cheesy/fatty, more like a flatbread with (delicious) stuff on it. I have eaten my fair share of pizza in Italy, and if you want to save yourself the plane fare to Europe, just make for Ravenswood because Spacca Napoli is the real deal. The atmosphere is pleasant and low-key, although not especially a place I'd suggest for a romantic meal or a big night out. Prices for food and wine were moderate and portions generous. Everyone other than our server was very friendly and welcoming. Our server was competent enough but needed an attitude makeover; I don't expect (or want) Applebee's faux-cheerful, but I do expect it not to seem like a giant hassle to, say, tell me what the specials are. Not a deal breaker, but enough to keep me from going for a full five stars despite the excellent food.
