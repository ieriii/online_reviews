What a great slightly-hidden venue... we made a short-notice decision for a late lunch there while we were in the area. After getting on the 60-minute waiting list, we were seated quicker than expected. There were 4 of us in our group. None of us had ever been there before. Keep in mind when making your order that this is, basically, a tapas restaurant. We ordered 3 cheeses (Fontina, Blue Cave man and the Manchego); 3 from the cured meat menu (there was a jamon serrano, tartufo and the fennel-infused one that I can't remember the name of...); the fried pigs ear; the 'Pork Neck Bone Gravy with Ricotta' (YUM!!); Olive Oil-Poached Tuna with Greek Lima Beans (which was salty, this is the only one that I'd intentionally skip next time,,, and we finished with the "Pig's Tails Braised in Balsamic"(what a great treat, the balsamic gave it a nice sweet finish, kind of dessert-ish). Everything else on the menu looked great, very creative and we look forward to another opportunity to return... Do not go if you are in a rush or are looking for privacy. Most of the seating is on long tables. Reservations are not accepted... be aware! The hostess and server were great. We were very impressed with the menu knowledge and the honesty from the server.
