They honey roll was pretty sweet. Well not literally...although kinda. You know what I mean. We got the edamame and the wasabi mashed potatoes as sides. The edamame was good....that's kinda hard to mess up. Now. For someone who can't handle anything spicy, I actually liked the wasabi mashed potatoes. Not spicy, but had more of a warchestershire sauce flavor. They also played this weird anime (that was in 3d...not drawn 2d) on the wall. That kept me entertained. Overall I thought the prices were a little high compared to other sushi places of the same caliber but it's right in between work and home so I can't say I won't hit it up again sometime! 40/52
