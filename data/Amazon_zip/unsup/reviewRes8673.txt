Since I've met my husband, we have gone to many different churascurrias. He grew up in Brazil and loves his meat. Although we thought of going toTexas de Brazil--it was $5 cheaper per person-- we decided to go to FdC instead because he's been there numerous times before and raved about it. Fogo de Chao exceeded every expectation I had and I thoroughly enjoyed everything from the food to the service. We went at 6pm on Friday and when we first walked in, only about half of the restaurant was seated. By the time 7pm rolled around, the vast dining room was entirely full. However, the servers and the "meat carvers" came by regularly and tended to our every need. They were genuinely friendly and extremely helpful. When my husband asked for a specific hot sauce he used to enjoy back in Brazil, he was given not only the hot sauce but also the chimichurri. Both were extremely delicious. The picanha and the filet mignon were phenomenal... but how can you go wrong with those meats? Although my husband shakes his head at my preference for chicken at a Brazilian Steakhouse, it was so delicious I got second servings. The salad bar was extensive and fresh. The cheese balls were so delicious and so was the flan and the coffee at the end. Definitely definitely a GREAT restaurant.
