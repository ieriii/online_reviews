I have never been in a restaurant this loud. It was pretty cool. This is considered one of the top restaurants in the country, so I might have been a little outclassed.The alcohol was expensive but good.I showed up with my gf, and I was seated at the bar immediately.All of the food that we ordered was interesting and tasty. It was a place that I was happy to go to, but I doubt that I would return on my next trip to Chicago. We had:Braised Baby Artichokes, Fingerling Potatoes, Asiago & Salami Toscana - my favorite. It was about a one cup container.Chorizo Stuffed Olives - Again, this was a very flavorful dish, one I would have never considered. 6 olives.Pork Blade Steak with 'Nduja & Honey - This was tasty, but honestly I could have made this. It was a big pork steak well-cooked.Manila Clams, House Made Merguez Sausage,Manzanilla Sherry & Tomato - Again, it was good, but the portion was small. IWe actually left the restaurant still able to eat more. The food was good, but the portions were small.
