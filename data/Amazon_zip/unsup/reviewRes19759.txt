Coast is great sushi in a great atmosphere with great service. If you go to Coast you HAVE to get the White Dragon Roll. It is one of my favorite specialty rolls in the city! Its made of shrimp tempura, wasabi tobiko, cream cheese, avocado, scallion spicy sauce, wasabi dressing, eel sauce and tempura flakes. This roll is so good that some of the others can seem a little bland in comparison (like the sunrise roll). I would recommend a reservation and they also have takeout if you are looking for great food for a night in.
