This cute cafe is a hidden gem. It's located on a relatively quite street, which makes it a cool place to to relax and have your coffee. Great coffee drinks, and they serve you at your table unlike other coffee places.I've tried their food a couple of times as well. The soup I had was excellent. I would be seen there a lot if I lived in the Gold Coast area.
