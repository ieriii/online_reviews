We overordered, oh like 6 tapas sized dishes for 2 persons. Who cares? How often will we come back to Chicago? Highlights are the fried pigs ears just like crispy French fries and pork neck rillettes. Not digging the Big Ed cheese. The food was not overly salty at all. Show up at 11:30am ish to get a seat. They dont take reservations and do get packed by noon time even on a weekday. And if you are collecting pig t-shirts, get the $20 Purple Pig t-shirt!
