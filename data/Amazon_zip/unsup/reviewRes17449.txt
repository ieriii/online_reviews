Had the buffet around 1pm and it was the best Indian food I've had - buffet or otherwise. They bring tandoor chicken -sizzling- to your table and fresh hot naan too. Then you make your choices at the buffet table. They don't skimp on the spices or ingredients for the buffet here as happens in many Indian food places. I wish I had more room in my tummy for lots of plate-fulls.
