Wakamono, you've earned my wrath. You have awoken the Yelp monster inside me, and I must share my frustration with the world. First, the positive: the atmosphere is great for a date. I went on a Wednesday night, and the after putting my name down for a 15 minute wait, there was a line behind me. This lead me to believe that great things were ahead, both for my food and my date. And I will give great credit to Wakamono for not pushing us to leave our table. We hung around for almost 2 hours, and there was no one breathing down our necks to clear the table (however, had we needed more service, this may have been a problem).  Now, the negative: the price is horrendous for the quality of the food. We ordered 3 specialty rolls and edamame, and spent ~$70 after tip. First, only one of the 3 rolls was above average (Wakamono roll, btw), and I prefer my edamame a bit warmer and saltier. Then there's the $8 corkage fee for wine. The bottle was screw-top, and my date poured most of our glasses. How does this warrant an $8 charge?  This was my first Chicago sushi experience after many months of San Francisco's fine sushi options. I hope and assume there is better to be had, as there are so many sushi places in the city. Next time, I hope to get more for my money or better quality sushi.
