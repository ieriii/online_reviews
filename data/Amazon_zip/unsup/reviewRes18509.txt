I went to Caro Mio on Friday with a group of 16 people and it was AMAZING. I tried multiple dishes so I don't know where to start. First, every main dish is HUGE. I love this. Our group didn't do family style but everyone would put some of their dish on a small plate and pass so people could try em. Lots of us got the specials. There was a gnochhi infused with asiago cheese. That was my favorite. It was incredible. The gnochhi was so soft and pillow-esque. Combined with the Asiago cheese in the middle is was incredible. It came in a red sauce. I loved it. I ordered the lobster ravioli. It had a rich cream sauce. I've tried lobster ravioli at many places and this was by far the best. It was fresh and it didn't have the fishy flavor that can come with lobster ravioli. I tried some of the salmon portofino. The balsamic reduction was just to die for. Part of me wished I had ordered it (even though I was dying for pasta). I thought they did a great job managing our large group. The one down side is that we were a half hour late sitting down at our table. It was annoying with that many people as the restaurant is very small. It was well worth the wait though. This place just knows pasta! It is now on my favorite places list!
