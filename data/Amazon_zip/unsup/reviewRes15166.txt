I love this place. All of the people whining about the line and such need to get used to it. Especially if you came here when they first opened (everyone knows it takes businesses a while to adjust when they first open). Anyway, moving on from the too-cool-for-school haters, I really enjoyed coming here. My boyfriend and I came for Valentine's Day and we showed up about 15 min before doors opened. I love the quiet atmosphere and the fact that they were playing soul and jazz all night. Between the two of us, we had six cocktails and four or five appetizers -- costing just under 100 dollars. The drinks were absolutely amazing. My boyfriend's favorite cocktail in the city is the old fashioned at Longman & Eagle. After drinking here he said he found a new favorite (or at least a rival). I tried a couple of the "potable bitters" drinks and they were all effing amazing. Appetizers were great. The best of everything we tried were the cod croquettes. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a classy but relaxed night out.
