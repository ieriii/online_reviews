loved this place. went with a group of 5 and everything we ordered was fantastic. the ambience is typical for a trendy restaurant. can get a little loud but not loud enough where we cant hold a conversation.  i had the ropa vieja and it was perfect. tender and juicy. i had a taste of everyone entrees and each one was so good that i promised myself i would come back so that i could try all the other dishes. our waiter was great, accomodating and so nice. we will definitely be back soon.
