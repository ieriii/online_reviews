I took my hubby here for his birthday, which prima facie says a lot. He's a sabor-toothed carnivore and we've been around the Chicago steakhouse circuit on the hunt for melt-in-your-mouth succulence with good ambiance, and Wildfire delivered.  First, his shrimp and crab bisque was creamy and not too salty or viscous, which are flaws in a lot of bisques. My caesar salad was ok, but it was overshadowed by our beer flight which came with healthy portions and a nice sampling of flavors.  And now the drumroll please....he ordered the porterhouse medium-rare with a blue cheese crust, and it dissolved on our tongues, it was Just That Good. After finishing my own meal, I kept picking at the bone hoping for more slivers of goodness. I ordered the filet mignon trio with blue cheese, horseradish and bearnaise crusts, and I sang my meat mantra of of "mmm....mmm" throughout the meal, although my one gripe was that while I'd ordered the medallions medium, one was obviously well done, kind of a bummer considering I only had three little meat bits to enjoy.  His au gratin potatoes were standard, my mashed potatoes were so smooth that I could have asked for a Big Gulp portion and sucked it through a straw, and that's a good thing.  As for the ambiance, many steakhouses aim for the board room decor (why work away from work?), but Wildfire is inviting, warm, and the bubbly conversations never get to the level of a dull roar.
