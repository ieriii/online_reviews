Lots of great food at the Purple Pig. Appetizers: the burrata with vegetables (burrata is a delicious soft-center mozzarella cheese). Smears: the pork liver pate, the pork rillette & mostarda. Dishes: the milk braised pork shoulder, the turkey leg confit. Desserts: I love dessert, but sadly these are a huge disappointment (I've tried almost all of them!). Drinks: terrible beer selection, really; plenty of wine choices though. But above all else, if they have the Porco Bucco, order it! It's delicious and very aromatic, it falls apart in your mouth, and there's quite a lot of it to share. They usually don't have it, so if that's the case, the Turkey Leg Confit is a close second.
