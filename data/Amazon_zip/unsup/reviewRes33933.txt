We were hungry and wanted to try this place.. we found it on yelp of course. It was good breakfast. My only complaint is your feta cheese it was so strange and plastic-y.. sorry Yolk! We did have your nutella crepes with strawberries but, how could that go wrong! I also didnt like the links of your pork sausage, they were mostly just fat. Omlettes though and hash browns were delish.
