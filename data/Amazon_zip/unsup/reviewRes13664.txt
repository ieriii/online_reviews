LOVE IT! Perfect for a hangover breakfast or to stop in for lunch. Everything is great. Total comfort food. I have been for dinner, but I didn't enjoy it as much as I enjoy going for Saturday breakfast. .The fish seemed quite a bit underseasoned in all 3 entrees that we received. The smoked trout dip is super tasty as was the smoked mac & cheese. BYOB is also amazing!
