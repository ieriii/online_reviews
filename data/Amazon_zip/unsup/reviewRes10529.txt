If your looking for an adorable and very reasonably priced Italian restaurant-look no further. While I waited for friends to join me, I grabbed a seat at the bar and inspected the wine list. I havent seen prices that low for wine in the West Loop since dining on Greek Row! The Valpolicella Superiore was amazing and only $36/bottle (not bad for a wine that's dubbed a "baby amarone.") Moving onto the meal, we ordered a variety of dishes. Piccolo offers anything from tri-colore salads to pizzas, pasta, fish, meats-all very affordable and well-portioned without being overwhelming. Bravo to such a great restaurant. I would have been more apt to give 5 stars but our server was extremely forgetful. All is forgiven since everything else was stellar!
