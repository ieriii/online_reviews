I went here last night, and I am already craving the butternut squash raviollis. I am throughly convinced that ordering the Chef's selection is the way to go. It was $58, and quite literally a parade of food. Nothing disappointed.  The items were brought out three at a time which was a good pace, with a total of around 15 menu items.  Worth noting...I do not eat lamb, but from the mouths of those who did, "this is the best piece of meat of have ever had."  The service was excellent and not over bearing.
