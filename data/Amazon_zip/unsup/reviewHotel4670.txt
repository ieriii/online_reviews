The Felix. One star and most of that goes towards the doorman. Can't remember his name but that guy was great. He did everything but tuck me in at night. Checked in with quite possibly the slowwwest front desk staff on this continent. I have checked in to a hotel in Morroco where no one spoke english and it went smoother. We get to the hotel and got up to the room , small room but thats allright , to find out that apparently the carpet was soaked. I found this out when I kicked off my shoes and stepped on to the soaking carpet. Nice. Had to leave to go to work so down to the painfully slow desk I went. Told the woman working the desk about the carpet and her response was: "really?" After a moment of awkward silence I asked if perhaps by chance if she wasn't busy could she wrangle me up a new room. Her response was: 'Hmmmm. Let me see." Says she can get me a room later and she'll call me when its ready. Got a call several hours later , the new room is ready we'll move your bags , new keys will be waiting at the desk etc... All is well I think , They made a mistake and now are correcting it. Ah yes. Go back to the Felix and the bags haven't been moved , the keys are not ready and now my key to the slop soaked room from earlier will not work. Back down to the desk not once but twice to get everything rectified. The new desk clerk has no idea what is going on and is moving at a pace that makes the first clerk look like Jesse Owens. I started out giving this three stars but have since moved it to one. If you want to see the best thing going at the Felix just walk by and say hi to the doorman. He's the best in the city in my book. the rest of the place? Not so much
