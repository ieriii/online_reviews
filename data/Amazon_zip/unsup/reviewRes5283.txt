If you live or work in the Loop, River North or Gold Coast, cancel your dinner plans and come here immediately. If you like tender pork loin with creamy mashed potatoes, come here immediately. If you like perfectly fried pork chopped up into delectable slivers, come here immediately. If you like perfectly seasoned grilled octopus, come here immediately. If you like affordable small plate dining to be shared with friends, come here immediately. If you like an extensive wine list with glass, half-bottle and full bottle options, come here immediately. If you like spacious, quiet dining rooms, don't come here. It's loud, cozy and intimate. It was pretty crowded on a Monday night, but I still totally loved it.
