I came here on a weekday around 11 and it wasn't crowded at all. It was so good, I couldn't stop eating. The menu almost has too much to choose from. The pancakes were not out of this world, but they were good. I'd say average to a little above. The potatoes could use more seasoning. But the omelette we got with avocado and sour cream was SO yummy. They have different creamer flavors from International Delight that were a nice touch on every table. I was very surprised at how moderately priced everything was for the high quality. I'd go back if I lived there!
