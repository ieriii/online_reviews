I'm feeling a little intimidated writing this review. What can you possibly say after there are already 400 plus reviews? Okay, let's attempt *great kalbi- I must say that for someone who hates to cook, it's not that bad to grill your own meat here. Seasoned very well, it tastes excellent both medium rare and with the sweet char.  *20 (YES TWENTY) different types of salads and veggies given upon sit down and with grill order. Newcomers who have come with me do not believe me till they witness it themselves! *soup-the Korean, spicy version of the Japanese miso soup. Slices of jalapeno, beware! *service- A-ok. If you mess it up, and I'm grilling my own food, now that'll knock off a few stars and a few dollars for tip Okay, so how did I do?
