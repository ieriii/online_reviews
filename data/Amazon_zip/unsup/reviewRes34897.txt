A few friends and I were visiting our other friend in Chicago (we're from DC) and since most of them were vegetarian we decided to go here because of its vegetarian options. I had never had good falafel and really wanted to try so I got the veggie combo, which included 2 falafel balls, 2 pitas, tabouleh, hummus, and two kinds of rice (though you have to ask if you wanted one or the other or both). We also got a pot of tea. This was enough for 5 people. My meal was huge and was only a little over 6$ (without the tea). The place is cash only though, and our friend did not warn us. Thankfully, there was an ATM inside. There was a greeter there (though I wasn't really sure what he did because he kind of disappeared randomly) and he told us he would be taking care of us. Our friend who had been there before told us that, that had never happened and that she remembered the guy and he had never been that nice or helpful. He was nice enough to bring us an extra table and promised us tea refills, which were never brought. The tea did come with some mint leaves, which added a really nice flavor. The meal itself was huge and very, very filling. So filling, that I could hardly finish it. Overall, everything was delicious and I was very happy with the experience. I will definitely be coming back here when I am Chicago again!
