Agreed that it takes awhile and is a bit pricey but I do love their roast beast with radish slaw deliciousness. Pickles have a funky flavor but they grow on you - the homemade potato chips, unfortunately do not. Last time my sammich meat was a bit tough and not its usual pinkish self :-( I also tried an almond croissant which was highly disappointing Service is sometimes kinda clipped, borderline rude but if you love roast beast - best one yet!
