Decent deepdish. This is Chicago ya know. So it is hard for me to say it is the best or even a runner-up, but it is pretty darn good. They don't have the sauce on top, like Girodanos or Gino's, but that doesn't matter to me. I love that their crust is carmelized, but there is something wrong with the taste of the crust. It has a sourdough kind of taste to it, but like it's sourdough not cooked all the way. Well, whatever the reason, there's just something a little bit off about the crust and that was really the only downside. All in all this is pretty good deepdish and the service was great. We sat upstairs and I was thoroughly impressed that the waitstaff got up and down that huge flight of stairs so quickly so many times.
