Went there for dinner and had a great experience. Our waiter was amazing and knew a little about everything on the menu. We ordered the Bone Marrow, Beef Horseradish Fettuccine, Chicken, Mashed Potatoes, Spicy Pork Sausage Pasta, and Pork Belly--they were all great! Also, you can get house wine or 4 bucks--you cant beat that!
