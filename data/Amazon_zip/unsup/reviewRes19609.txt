It's a nice place for BYOB and a date. Dark inside. Bathrooms could be cleaner. Specialty rolls could be larger and cut into small pieces. Edamame sucked. Unsalted, so plain. Miso soup was pretty good though. A bit on the salty side. Service could be more attentive. We didn't get our soy sauce when the food was brought out, nor did he check up on us.
