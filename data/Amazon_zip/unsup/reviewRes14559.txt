maybe i don't enunciate, but i'm constantly getting something other than what i ordered. so i was not surprised that my vegetable sandwich was a tofu sandwich instead, and it's not like it was a ham sandwich or something so i ate at and was just as happy. or maybe happier. maybe the owner was like "oh no, tofu for you. i'll bet you haven't had any protein all day" in which case she's amazing. in fact, i'll bet that's it - because when i asked for a vegetable empanada she said, "how about goat cheese instead?" yeah, she's crazy intuitive. ...and the sandwich was unbelievable. roasted onions and peppers, a huge slab of tofu in a mildly spicy red sauce. a two-napkin endeavor.
