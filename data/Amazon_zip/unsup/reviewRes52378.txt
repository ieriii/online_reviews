Ok, The Pizza is pure Chicago Delight, Take people who are visiting you who want to know about Chicago. Otherwise, the service is not great and I accidentally left a package at my table at the end of a slow weeknight and came back 30 minutes later. The staff didn't want to help. I got the feeling they were divvying up my stuff. Better for take out than dinning in. Full of tourists!!
