Wildfire is one of my favorite places for steak in Chicago. When we go, my wife almost always orders the filet mignon trio with three different crusts, which is excellent. Even though it's a steak place, the fish specials are pretty good, as are the shrimp appetizers. The dining room is well-appointed and classic, service is always good, and the price is tough to beat for somewhat upscale (though you can still wear jeans) dining.
