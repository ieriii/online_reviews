Love this place! I haven't had anything there that I didn't like, but the Duck, and Honey Jalapeno Pork Chops are especially amazing. This makes a good date place, although it can be busy on the weekends. Weeknights you can get right in usually. Excellent location right near the Brown Line Irving Park stop.
