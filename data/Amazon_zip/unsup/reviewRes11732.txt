I'm still really curious about the pretzel dipped pancakes. And I probably should have tried it, but I was a little hesitant in case it was too sweet. Oh well. Guess it's an excuse to go to Chicago again. I definitely think this is a place to go with friends so you can order all of their fun things and share them. I got an omlette, which was delicious. It was one of those "someone please take this away from me because I'm going to keep picking at it, even though I'm going to explode" kind of meals. Yes there was a huge wait and yes it was pouring rain, so we were all crammed into the back, but if you go in knowing you are going to wait a long time, it isn't so bad. Besides, watching them make all the food was kind of fun.
