Went her on a trip to Chicago in early November 2008. The first thing you notice about the place is that it is wall to wall covered in graffiti. It is the Gino's custom to write your name on some part of the building. I thought it made the whole place feel very cool. The pizza is Chicago-style deep dish. This means almost all of the crust is on the edges of the pizza, and almost all the filling is in the center. Also, the cheese is on the bottom of the toppings and the sauce, so it actually appears to resemble a heart stew or soup. I was feeling under the weather during this trip, so maybe my tastes buds were a little off. It actually made me wish I were eating a normal pizza. The price wasn't outrageous, but it was a little more expensive than your local pizza place.
