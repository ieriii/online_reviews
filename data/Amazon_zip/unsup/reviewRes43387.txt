In a city known for its brunch, M&H doesn't disappoint. The menu is simple, THANK GOD! There is NOTHING that I hate more than opening a menu to be treated to five pages of options. I'm looking at you, Cheesecake Factory/Grand Lux! M&H has selected 5-6 entrees that it does well and that's what it offers. There is always a seasonal pancake and waffle, but their standards are an egg sandwich and juevos rancheros (casserole style). You CANNOT leave this place without trying the juevos--they're by far the best option on the menu and are served in their own mini-crocks with a side of crme fresh. Do it.
