So that evening we were in Chicago, well that was three of us. Two of us decided to meet in the lobby to work and prep for "tomorrow"; after harrowing into slides and technical shikes, we succumbed into cocktails. She said "crush" was to follow. Well, crush was already UN-crushed in my books, she did not know. Yet he diss'ed - he showed up in gym clothes and said, "Oh, room service for me tonight." Good thing, is what my brain told me. After all I'm bored with these really un-CULTURED Americans. I mean really, enough already of my fighting against being a "diplomat's daughter" - to put up with a blue-collar that has been so-called self-made? Awww, as the cynics would say, "Cry me a River." My Sales Rep and I ate like a pig at this restaurant - a Barcelona with a Catalunia twist inspired tapas, wine and cocktails and after bar. - squid ink pasta - lots of grilled scallops - prosciutto wrapped with steamed spinach - AND LOTS OF WINE - waiters were GREAT We made our meeting and I learned. I NEED A EURO VACATION! I should have lived in the Feudalistic past - I like them better. Oh well.
