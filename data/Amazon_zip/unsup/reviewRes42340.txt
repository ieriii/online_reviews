the pho with tripe... *smack* awesome. lots of selections!  Vietnamese cuisine is wonderful, and each restaurant has its own characteristics. All are worth a taste.  sandwiches and pho are great! we've done carry-out and delivery - have not eaten in.  This is a great restaurant to embrace the wonderful diversity of Chicago, to taste some cuisine from Vietnam, and to have fun while sharing with friends. Enjoy!
