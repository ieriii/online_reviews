PARRRRTYYYYYYYYY. I have had my eye on this restaurant for THREE years. THREE YEARS! Do you know how much facebook photo album stalking that equates to? I must have looked at a few hundred brightly colored and festive photos before finally taking the plunge and making a reservation of my own. I gotta tell ya- hopping off my plane from NYC to Chi and being driven straight here to dine with five of my great gfs? Pretty fucking fabulous. The ambience is incredible. Beautiful colors, high ceilings and a vibrancy not easily duplicated. The food was great! Although they are heavy on the meats, they sure know what they are doing. The braised short ribs were IN-CRED-I-BLE! The drinks are innovative and they even have wine flights. Hands down, one of my favorite Chi restaurants.
