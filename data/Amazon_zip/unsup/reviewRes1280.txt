What more can I say that hasn't been said already about Hot Doug's? See the wonders of encased meat at the website (http://www.hotdougs.com).  Under the daily specials you'll find a selection approximately around 8 different kinds of exotic blends and game meat. They change up the menu throughout the week, so check it out before going in. I always get a special, but if your funds are low the dogs, bratwurst and traditional sausages are also available. Everyone seems to mention the Duck Fat Fries so you might as well see what all the fuss is about (only on Fridays and Saturdays). The hours are from 10:30 --- 4 Monday through Saturday, but I would suggest avoiding the lunch rush from 12 --- 2. The line will literally wrap around the exterior of the building. Doug must be swimming in a pile of money Strooge McDuck style, because they frequently close down the store for vacation time. Again, make sure to check the website for holiday closings. Lastly, I should mention that Doug and his staff are incredibly welcoming people. If you go there enough Doug might even remember your name. This place is top notch and I hope it never leaves us again, like it did temporarily after its old location was closed due to problems with the building. Bon appetite!
