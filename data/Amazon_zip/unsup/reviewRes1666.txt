The foie gras dog changed my life. I could think of many ways I'd rather spend a Saturday morning in December other than standing in a 2-hour line outside.... Writing a thesis perhaps? Or maybe sitting in front of a small child on an airplane? But, let me tell you, that wait for those morsels of encased meaty goodness were worth every blistering cold moment. Doug is a trip, and even after dealing with hoards of people for hours, was still really funny and patient as we tried to ramble off the 9 dogs we had chosen. The only thing that didn't fulfill my needs completely were the duckfat fries. I was expecting something that would dazzle my tastebuds, but they were just fries. Good ones, but nothing spectacular. So if you're looking for a foodgasm, Hot Dougs will make you come again and again.
