Recently I stopped in to Milk & Honey for a weekday lunch. I had the special which was a wrap with hummus, roasted eggplant, roasted red peppers, and lettuce. It was pretty good! My only complaint was that the vegetables were in huge pieces that kept trying to escape the wrap- so it was very messy albeit tasty! I also took home a piece of coconut-carrot cake which was moist and delicious! The staff was friendly, the portions were big, the prices were reasonable...I will be back soon!
