Yes, there always a long wait for breakfast especially on weekends. And yes you have to get there real early to avoid that. But that's a very good sign that you've made a good choice for breakfast. The coffee was fresh, the omlettes were well-made and the toast was just perfect. And not to mention, the numerous choices for jams and juices. The service was quick and friendly and we were done with the entire meal in less than 20 mins on a busy Sunday morning. Again, if long lines are like a plague to you then get there early. Ideally before 9:30.
