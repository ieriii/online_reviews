For gourmet finds this place is the best in the city so far. It's got all the fun stuff you could thinks of. I wouldn't be able to shop here on a regular basis, I wish! But they have all sorts of fun baking things, bulk chocolates, sauces, ice creams...just great great stuff to cook all the things in the cookbooks you never use cause you dont know where to get the ingredients!
