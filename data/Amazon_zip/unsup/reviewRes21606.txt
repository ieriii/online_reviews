Loved this busy fun hot dog joint. You don't even have to get out of your car! Just drive-in, order and a car hop brings the order out to you in your car. I had the all beef juicy superdawg with all of the fixins and it knocked my socks off. I would go back here in a heartbeat if it wasn't so far away. Also, tried the chocolate malt and it was sooooo thick that I could hardly suck it up the straw. YUM! Best of all they are open late night so if you are in the mood for a late night snack this is the place to go. HOURS: Sunday-Thursday 11am-1am, Friday-Saturday 11am-2am
