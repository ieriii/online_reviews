Back for my second visit last night, and while the food is still pretty amazing and well priced (though the signature pork blade steak wasn't nearly as good this time - missing some flavor and pretty overcooked), the wine list is fun and adventurous, I'm still not impressed with the service.  We put our name in before 6:00 with a quote of an hour and half, but it was about 2.5 hours before we were seated. Not terrible, as we were able to go around the corner for a drink, and they will call you when you're table's ready. When we were seated, our server wasn't very enthusiastic or helpful and didn't provide any suggestions. The worst part was the speed with which all the dishes came out - there was not room on table and things got cold before we were able to try them.  After waiting patiently for hours to be seated, we wanted a relaxed leisurely Mediterranean-paced dinner with a few bottles of wine but instead we were rushed out of there in about an hour without a real opportunity to order more wine, a second round of dishes, or coffee and dessert. The check came without us asking for it. We didn't feel welcomed or appreciated. My impression of this place is now confirmed as as a culinary standout that will keep drawing new people in, particularly visitors to the city, as a destination. But they are doing nothing to set themselves apart as a friendly restaurant that I would visit on a regular basis.  Sad, since the food's so good.
