I've been to Purple Pig twice - the first visit was fun and delicious after one initial hiccup with an overly crabby server...She ended up being quite helpful and accomodating after I shot her a dirty look upon her withering reply to my request for silverware. On that visit, we enjoyed a great bottle of wine that the server recommended, we loved the beets, the fava bean dish, and the octopus.  I returned to Purple Pig on Friday and was completely underwhelmed from the second we walked through the door. We were able to sit down immediately, but our table was hardly enjoyable as it was crammed into a corner and the home to a colony of fruit flies. I'm not kidding. Fruit files. Inside. Buzzing around our table. Totally unappetizing. I didn't say anything until the end of the meal. I should have. By the time dessert (the totally thick, gloppy, and almost flavorless Iris Rose) arrived, I had already talked to one server about the problem and I ended up just walking to the hostess stand and requesting to eat the dessert at the bar. A woman who I presume to be the manager talked to us about the problem, apologized, comped our dessert, and told us that they "would try to figure out that problem" before seating the table again. Less than 5 minutes later, it was re-sat.  This lack of attention to detail was in close accordance with the bumbling and uninformed server who took care of us that night - she seemed to know very little about wine (or waiting tables, for that matter). Here is an exchange we had with her: My sister: "I don't really like oaky wines."  Server: "Do you like chardonnay?" Sister: "No."  Server: "Well, this one is a chardonnay, but it doesn't really taste like one."  There are too many really good, inviting wine bars with excellent service in the city of Chicago to bother with Purple Pig ever again.  The only redeeming part of this whole botched visit was that the entire bill, complete with a 20% tip, was $90.
