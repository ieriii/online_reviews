3.5 stars on this one. I had seen several reviews and even had family reccomend this place to me so I was super excited to try this one out.  Menu is impressive, the photos make your mouth water, but I have had better quality Vietnamese in Chinatown. I ordered the vermacelli with grilled beef and shrimp, the beef and shrimp did not taste super fresh, so I mainly ate the noodles with fish sauce. Spring rolls were okay, I really though for the volume of business the ingredients would be of higher quality. Service is really attentive and polite.
