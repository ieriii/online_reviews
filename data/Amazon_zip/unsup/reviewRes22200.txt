If I could make this notorious oatmeal shake then I would never leave the house... First off I have been here twice to dine in and I have ordered delivery from here as well. All three times we a success. We got two cheese and spinach empanadas, but this was a BIG mistake, because we should have order about 10 (you know some to take home possibly?) Next we got two steak pepito sandwhiches with cheese and peppers. However, the waitor thought we only ordered one pepito sandwhich for me and my friend to share, and while I do appreciate him trying to help me watch my 5'3 figure... but I came here for a cheat day. But all went well when booboo (our waitor) brought me this magical drink called an oatmeal shake. He told us how he tried to reinvent this drink at home and failed miserably. wahh!? I can see why because that thing was amazing and coming from a lacto&tolerant individual this is a HUGE compliment! Meow, I will be back for my kitty oatmeal shake! =)
