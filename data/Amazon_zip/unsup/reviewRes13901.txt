Packed on a Monday night. Must be good. Packed before 6:30p.m. away from the loop. Must be really good. Strolled in here yesterday evening when we found out El Nandu was not BYOB. Reviews of everything consumed are as follows: Cross of Gold: A lover of IPAs (Dreadnaught and Two Hearted, to name a few) this didn't quite cut it. It lacked the finish of a strong hoppy IPA, but was still quite strong. Not bad for $5. Workingman Mild: More refined that Blue Moon, and deeper than Hacker Pschorr. This was a great in between and was a very refreshing drink after a long and dreary Monday. Bacon Fat Popcorn-WHAT? REALLY? THIS EXISTS? Walking in not liking popcorn (not even garretts), this completely changed my whole outlook on the comforts of popcorn. Bacon fat drizzled over white popcorn interlaced with lightly fried sage, freshly shaved parmesan, and truffle oil. Umami heaven. Woodfire Pizza with Cremini Mushrooms, Thyme, Goat Cheese and Sausage-We added the Sausage to the existing mushroom pizza to give it a bit more complexity and substance. Paired with the Workingman Mild, this was one of the best woodfire pizza's I have had. All ingredients were fresh and the fennel was not overpowering and complimented the sausage and overall dish very well.  Wisconsin Beer Cheddar Soup with Sour Cream-Good, but not great. Too much cheese with the pizza and my lack of love may have been due to the overkill of dairy products. Like General McArthur said as he departed Corregidor. "I Shall Return."
