I learned about Crisp from a good friend who swears by their wings. Everytime I have gone there I have gotten the baby buddha bowl, it is definitely not baby in size by any means and I always have leftovers. I always make sure to order it with extra red sauce on the side. I finally decided to introduce my boyfriend to the wonder that Crisp is. This time (and I am not a big fan of chicken wings) we ordered the wings based on my good friends recommendation. My boyfriend ordered the Seoul steak sandwich which was cheesy gloriousness with all its fixins. Needless to say when we opened the wings (we ordered 5) we were both expecting the average sized wing. No, these were the full on huge chicken wing. The sauce was literally the best thing ever. We ordered the spicy bbq sauce. I dont know what it was but I went on the recommendation of the man that took our order. As my boyfriend said its "hot sweet sesame seed deliciousness." It was a match made in heaven. Amazing. I give 4 starts for the size of the wing but Crisp is great try it out if you get the chance. Def not your typical Korean joint but it is its own breed!!!
