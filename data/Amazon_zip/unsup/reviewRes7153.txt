I stumbled upon q while walking around in the Gold Coast recently. Intrigued by the exterior, I went inside to grab a menu. I returned tonight for dinner and now sit here, stuffed to the brim, with a smile on my face, while writing this review. The atmosphere and ambiance is cool - modern rustic. Staff in khakis and checkered dress shirts. They start the meal off with complimentary pickles and potato chips - just delicious, especially paired together. I had the pulled pork shoulder with cornbread and my BF had the q2, which consisted of brisket and a half rack of ribs. We also ordered the kobe beans and seasonal squash for sides. They bring you three different sauces for the table. I was blown away by the pulled pork, tender and succulent. The cornbread was also tasty. Even though I knew I should have stopped, it was just too good not to finish. I had a taste of the brisket and ribs, which were also delish. Those beans can't be beat. We did (embarrassingly) have dessert too and went with an espresso ice cream topped with peanut brittle, yum. The staff was VERY attentive. Our water glasses were refilled as soon as we took a few sips. The server was always "present." A manager even stopped by to ensure everything was ok. Yes, I will agree with others that the price will keep us from being regulars ($80 for all of the above plus three beers). We did expect this going into it though... But, it's a place we'll come back to some Friday night and bring family or visitors to. I hope this one sticks around!
