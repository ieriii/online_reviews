I can't wait until January when the smoking ban in Chicago goes into effect. Chicago, you'll catch on after a while that it is a good thing. I love Hopleaf. It is our favorite restaurant so far since moving to Chicago from Oakland. While we haven't love everything that we've tried on the menu, the food is consistently good. The mussels are always succulent and yummy (go for the wine sauce always...the beer is a let-down). One complaint is that the food is a little heavy and rich. One suggestion might be to order a salad with whatever you get, but who can get excited about that when there is the brisket sandwich and onion rings (oh so delicate, crunch, salty, and tasty) after you share mussels (for one is plenty) with pommes frites. The CB and J sandwich sounded just too tempting (cashew butter with fig jam and morbier cheese, fired like a grilled cheese, and served with stilton mac and cheese and home-made potato chips. I dare say that is just too much richness and cheese (and I am a cheese FANATIC...there is no such thing as too much. Until now). And the beer menu: What can I say? It is second to none so far that I've seen here. I keep trying new things, and I always come back to ones that I love: Kwak, Fin du Monde, Delerium Tremens, but it is fun to try the others! We now have a standing date night every Friday because it is so consistently good. My one complaint is the cigarette smoke from the bar in front. I leave reeking like an ash tray, and I can't state strongly enough how disgusting this is. Though they don't allow smoking where they serve food, the smoke from the fronts wafts to the back, and I really dislike that smell while I am eating. I cannot wait until the ban in solidly in place and Chicagoans will realize just how lovely it is to be relieved of smoke in public places.
