Having recently used Rick Bayless as a guide for a trip to Guadalajara (OK, he wasn't a personal guide, but we did use his recent PBS show on Guadalajara to help guide us through town), I decided it was time to see just how good of a chef he really was. Having a group of four, we were unable to get a reservation for Frontera Grill, so my group arrived at 4:45 to try and get a table on a Saturday for dinner. I was suprised (well not too suprised) to see that there were already 15-20 people in line using the same strategy. After a short wait our line was herded into the bar area for a couple pre-dinner cocktails. It was a rush to find somewhere to sit, which detracted from the notion of this being a nice restaurant (yes, I know it isn't as fancy as Topolobampo). The bartender was friendly, but too busy to really give great service. The margaritas were great. We got a table in the basement, which had no windows. We ordered a couple of the ceviches and the queso fundido for an appetizer, which were excellent. For dinner I had the carne asada brava which was cooked perfectly. After ordering I heard another waiter tell his table that they had a few chile rellenos that weren't on the menu. I wish our waiter had clued me in on that, I felt a little left out. Overall the food was worthy of 5 stars (even the spicy nut bowl was good), but the notion of having to wait outside for 30-40 minutes for a table and the herding of the line into the bar detracted from the overall experience.
