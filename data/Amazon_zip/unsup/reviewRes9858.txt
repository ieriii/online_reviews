We went for a late night dinner and we were very impressed. The restaurant consists of a more formal lower dining area and then a more relaxed, intimate dining area upstairs along with a comfortable lounge and bar. Wait staff was very well trained and incredibly knowledgeable. The food was very tasty and we had a great overall experience. Definitely try to eat upstairs if possible.
