Huge brunch place with an even bigger menu. My friend & I split the banana bread french toast and made our own skillet with turkey sausage, spinach, and mushrooms. We forked over an extra $1.50 and upgraded for some chocolate strawberry pancakes. The banana bread french toast really had too much stuff going on. Firstly, the bread was sweet and dense and though they thoughtfully served it with peanut butter, it didn't sufficiently cut the sweetness. It was a little too dry to eat french toast without syrup, but pouring syrup on it magnified the first problem. I'll try something else next time. The skillet was tasty - hot well-seasoned potatoes, slightly spicy turkey sausage, and just the right amount of cheese to make the dish cohesive. The savoriness was also a welcome reprieve from the french toast and the pancakes. The pancakes were also too sweet - covered in chocolate sauce and without enough tart strawberries to balance it out. I'm giving this joint 4 stars because I see lots of potential in their breakfast menu. Service was good and ultra-fast. We were in and out of there within 45 minutes. Go early to avoid waiting.
