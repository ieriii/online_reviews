yum yum yum. came here with a group of 4 to hang out and the food was delicious. one of the girls' friends is quite the foodie and recommended these two appetizers and four entrees, so we went ahead and ordered everything she suggested. all were DELISH! my favorite was the ricotta + honeycomb that was served with some toasted rustic bread. The ricotta was whipped, super smooth and creamy, and the honey added a perfect balance of sweetness. We also ordered the pizza con prosciutto e rucola which was in true italian style of thin crust, minimal sauce, and fresh ingredients. And I enjoyed slathering the extra ricotta and honey on the crust since we ran out of bread (although I'm sure you could've asked for more). the truffle egg toast + fontina + asparagus we ordered was a very close second to the ricotta. the fontina was melted perfectly over the warm bread, and the egg yolk gave a creaminess and was in wonderful contrast to the crunchy asparagus. i'm just sad i had to split it four ways. honestly, although they weren't my favorites, we also ordered the risotto carbonara riccio di mare + granchio, and the paccheri con salsiccia e pomadori al forni which were still all very good.  i left feeling satisfied, but not over stuffed. the prices were a little high given the relatively small portion sizes, so i not a place i will be visiting regularly, but definitely a place i would take friends visiting from out of town.
