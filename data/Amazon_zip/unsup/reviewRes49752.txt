I came here as a date, willing to try something new, and the skirt steak was the house special and highly recommended... ok, i'll try it.... can i say WOW! ... that skirt steak blew me away!!! for real. i think everyone had the skirt steak and no one had anything bad to say about it.  The steak was a good price and was HUGE, it came with some yuca and potatoes and plantains.  the yuca and potatoes were ok, the plantains was a nice sweet dessert, more or less. but the steak was cooked perfectly and was soo damn good that it's got me thinking about it ever since.. one of my top 5 steaks of all time! i'm going back for sure... and going back soon!
