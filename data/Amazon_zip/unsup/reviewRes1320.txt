Never, ever, ever again! The hot dog was good, but not fantastic. The other monstrosity that I ordered was utterly disgusting. I only ate 1/4 of it and threw the rest in the garbage where it should have been served in the first place. Now, I understand that it's a gamble when you order something new. But, at $9 or $10 a pop, it's like throwing money away in a recession. It just doesn't make sense. YUCK!
