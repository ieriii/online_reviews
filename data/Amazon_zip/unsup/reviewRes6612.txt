I was so impressed with Davanti Enoteca! We loved everything we had from the truffle toast to the sea urchin linguini to the chocolate mousse--omg, the chocolate mousse! The food is really different from traditional Italian, which made it a fun experience. The atmosphere is comfortable and the service is friendly and casual. Wine is great too!
