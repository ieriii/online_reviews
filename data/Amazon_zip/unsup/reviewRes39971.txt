The food is definitely five star worthy, but I give it a 4 star because of the hostess and lack of reservations. The dinner menu is out of this world and worth every penny. Delish! I have been to Longman & Eagle about 12 plus times and the brunch and dinner menu never disappoint. Quality food. I have a major sweet tooth and have the dessert every time, but for some reason the desserts don't impress me. The main courses on the other hand make up for the desserts. RESERVATIONS. They don't take any. This is problematic. The reason it is problematic is because the hostess is unable to give an accurate estimate of the wait time. I get that it is hard to estimate table turnover times, but when you are told 45 minutes and it turns into 2 hours I have a problem. One of these times the hostess sent over a complimentary cheese plate and frog legs for us to enjoy when we were seated at our table, but this would have been a nice gesture to do when we were waiting for our table for 2+ hours. This has not stopped me from coming back because I haven't dined when they have been swamped, but it is a huge turn off. I would recommend that they make the 'back room' a reservation room and keep the front and outside for walk-ins.
