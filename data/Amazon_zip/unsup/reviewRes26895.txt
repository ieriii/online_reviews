Came here with my husband, his brother and mother. It was SO good!!! We started with the guacamole, chips, salsa, then had the Frontera ceviche, some agua frescas (pineapple-mint-lime), then our entrees. My husband and I split the carne asada, and had the duck taquitos and also a side order of the wild greens. Everything was perfect. No complaints whatsoever. Dessert was fantastic, but I was so stuffed from our lunch (which felt more like dinner) that I couldn't finish my flan!!!  Will totally be coming back the next time we are in Chicago!!! PS - If the girl with the mustard yellow shirt and awesome stained glass style tattoo sees this, please get in touch with me to tell me who did your tattoo! I didn't want to interrupt your meal to ask!
