Alright, this place already has plenty of good reviews, but I will would like to take some time and recommend this joint. I love Chinese food, and I love spice food. Lao Sze Chuan is the most authentic Sze Chuan restaurant I have ever been to here in U.S. Now days, food alone is not the only indicator of a great dining experience. Service and cleanness are just as important. The service at this place is great. People are very friendly and your food comes out really fast! I have been there many times, and have always been satisfied with the food and service, and have overtipped every time.
