On a last minute mission to bring home some yummy cupcakes from Chicago back to California, our concierge at The Fairmont recommended Fox & Obel's cupcakes, claiming they were better than Molly's. We were skeptical -- this is a grocery store, not a stand alone bakery. How good can their cupcakes be? On a Tuesday afternoon, I was a bit disappointed in their small selection of individually boxed/wrapped bakery items. There were just 4 types of cupcakes: red velvet, carrot, butter cake and chocolate. No vanilla? The cupcakes themselves are quite large and cheaper than Sprinkles or Molly's, but we found the cake to be not dense enough and the frosting only had barely a hint of cream cheese flavor. The upside was that the frosting was not overly sweet and there was the perfect ratio of cake to frosting. Their other baked goods looked scrumptious though. The muffins were huge and some looked like they were made out of angel food cake. The breakfast pastries looked the best, like the almond croissant and brioche tart. Speaking of which, the brioche breakfast pastry was DELICIOUS. Highly recommend this. It is brioche with creme fraiche topped with a dusting of sugar. Fox & Obel's brioche pastry was better than their red velvet cupcake, by far. We didn't have time to look around the rest of the store but it seems like you can find some nice products, and there is a separate eating area that is nicely decorated. I probably wouldn't make a specific trek to Fox & Obel but would hop in if I were in the area again and had time.
