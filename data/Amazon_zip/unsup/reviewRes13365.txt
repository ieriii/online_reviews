The husband and I had dinner at Glenn's Diner last night and I'm a little mixed about the experience. My dinner was really excellent - enormous pan fried sea scallops in a bacon, mushroom, dijon and sherry sauce with roasted red potatoes and asparagus. Seriously fabulous. My husband's dinner was kinda blah - grilled swordfish also with red potatoes and asparagus. The fish was bland and way under seasoned with no sauce or flavored butter or anything to give it a little zing. The crab cakes we had for an appetizer were nice and flavorful but not spectacular. My real issue with the place though is in the concept. It's Glenn's Diner, but it's not a diner because it's really a nice fish place, but it has a diner menu jam packed with everything under the sun and it has a wall decorated with cereal boxes but two blackboard walls in fish specials. What is it? Our dinners didn't taste like a diner and the bill was certainly quadruple [at least] that of a diner meal  But the ambiance, decor and the vast majority of the menu said diner. And I just don't like plastic cups for my drinks and my husband ordered a Guinness which arrived without a glass, which is just bad form. It just seems poorly thought out. The service was top notch. My dinner was excellent, my husband's was much less than excellent. The place just doesn't seem to know what it wants to be. It cost us more than we expected and for that coin I know of plenty of other places that I would have been much happier. And yet, part of me thinks I'm just being crabby pregnant lady and judging it too harshly, so I'll probably give it another try. And damn, those scallops truly were spectacular.
