I used to come here all the time when I was vegan and I HATED it. My vegetables were never all that fresh and crispy and the tofu was pretty mushy. After reading reviews on Yelp I decided to give Opart another chance, especially since I eat dairy again. It was better, I have to say. My rama was pretty good, the rice was perfect and the tofu was cooked well. It's still not as good as Cozy, so I can't give too many stars. But it's good and it's really close to my house, so I'll be back.
