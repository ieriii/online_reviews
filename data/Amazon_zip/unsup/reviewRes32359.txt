I've been to several Ethiopian restaurants in Chicago, and Demera is constantly among the best. The menu is vast and offers many authentic Ethiopian choices. The drink menu also includes several Ethiopian imported wines and beers. The service and wait staff is extremely knowledgeable and and always willing to provide advice on ordering - they are always genuinely warm and kind people. I will certainly look forward to my next visit. An added bonus, you will fall in love with the smell, the second you open the door.
