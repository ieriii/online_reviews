So I won't lie, I partially chose to go here after seeing him on Top Chef Masters, but I was intrigued by what he made so I had to taste it in person. This was part of my birthday weekend celebration and I'm glad I went. The ambiance is great, a toned down Carnivale-like look with lots of dark wood and color but without it being a color explosion. The seats are very comfortable and the service was really great. I had the "gin blossom" drink, which was tasty and for food the wagyu beef tartare, fois gras lollipop (with Pop Rocks) and crispy buffalo chicken, which had some nice heat and lovely celery salad. I won't lie, portions are definitely small but they are tasty and very nicely presented. My friends had the dark chocolate cake for dessert, which was nice but I really loved the untraditional strawberry shortcake, which had some of the tastiest berries, pound cake and strawberry gelato. That gelato was my favorite part of the dish. Overall, I liked it and I would go back, but I wouldn't rush for it.
