Checked this place out yesterday based upon a recommendation in Yelp Talk. We've been looking for a new "breakfast for lunch" place in the West Loop, and I think this might be our new one. Went back again today - two days in a row for lunch in the same place is a pretty high recommendation, I'd say. First time there, I had their special, which was a "savory waffle" - a Belgian waffle filled with bacon. Sounds odd, but it was really good. REALLY good. Today I had the steak sandwich, which was exceptional. Very flavorful steak, not tough at all, cooked perfectly. The bun was nicely toasted but soft inside, and the baby red potato fries were fantastic. Prices are very reasonable, and service is quick if impersonal. Seating is spacious, although both days we were there at 11 am, but even when we left at noon there were places to sit.
