My dinner here was okay, had this quiontta? dish, it was a vegetarian dish, I should have just gotten the fish tacos in the appetizer section! We did have the shrimp ceviche appetizer, which was really good and the raspberry mohitos were really good! I guess I would stick with the apps and drinks! My husband had the dish that was like paella, but I felt like the creole seasoning was way to strong..so did he! oh yeah forgot it was my b-day so the waitress did bring out a dessert, it was a brownie with some pineapple, it was okay, the dulce de leche ice cream was more enjoyable than the brownie... the waitress was nice and the service was good...
