Been here twice. and I shouldn't have because the second time was just like the first. Not good in any way. I guess the service was not so bad, but it could have been a little better knowing that there were not many diners at the restaurant. The food was nothing special. I don't remember what appetizers, maybe because it wasn't good. I had the braised short ribs and they were not moist and if they pretended to be, it was only because of the salty over reduced sauce they glazed on top. The vegetables that were served were the only thing i guess worth eating.The second time was the same, if not worse. I can't even remember what I tried that time around, except for a coffee. This place is lucky it's on Mich Ave for business.
