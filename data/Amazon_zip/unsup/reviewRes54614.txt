I was one step from giving Sultan's 5 stars! The only thing holding me back is that I know what it was like before they opened thier second store! The falafel sandwich is still the tastiest in the city but before the franchise it felt like the employees making the sandwiches took much more care in listening to your order and gently making the sandwiches.I never had a falafel sandwich burst open or fall apart until that change over when some of the folks from the Wicker Park location were moved to Lincoln park. Customer service is down two points but, the tasty factor is still there!Also, new smoothies not so good! Stick with getting the Naked juices!BUT OH BABY THE LENTIL SOUP! That's off the hook! So really...Sultan's still comes out as a winner in my book. I just wish they'd take care of that customer service issue right quick!
