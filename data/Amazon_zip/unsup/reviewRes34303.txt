I love Sultan's Market, the only reason I'm only giving it four stars is because I'm so in love with the falafel that I haven't tried much else on the menu. The service is super fast, its great to pick up for a quick bite on the go. Eating in is really nice too though. There's a decent amount of seating and the way the booths are set there's a feel of privacy, kinda. There's also outdoor seating when the weather allows. The food is really tasty and cheap. I wouldn't recommend the delivery unless you live really close, I've had it turn up very late, cold, and jostled.
