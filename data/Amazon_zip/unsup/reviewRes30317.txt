Awesome. The staff is nice and the pricing is decent. Seating is rather tight and getting to the restroom is a feat. The food and desserts are fantastic! Tons of veggie/vegan options!  I don't recommend the mango margarita though. Mine was too chunky and felt chalky in my mouth. Parking is limited.
