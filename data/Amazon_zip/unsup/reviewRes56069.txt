Mmmmmm. I love a good hotdog, but a hotdog is not a Superdawg and the word great is saved for a Superdawg. By far the best dawg in Chicago, I highly recommend to anyone who has not been to this Chicago landmark. When you see the huge dawgs on the roof, you have made it.Superdawg offers the rare experience of a drive-in, food brought to you by carhops, and a way to keep unruly kids distracted by a dvd and out of the public eye. The Superburger/Supercheesies make it as much a burger as a dawg place, and the fries are the best I have ever had. Luckily for all of us, they come with every meal ordered. The shakes and malts are amazing as well, but amazing describes everything i have had there. It is really no suprise to me when I regularly see Superdawg on the Travel Channel and Food Network or written up around Chicago.It truly is one of the thousand places you must go before you die and I challenge you to go there and enjoy the experience as soon as possible.
