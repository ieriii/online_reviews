Really enjoyed the meal at Lao Sze Chuan. We started with some pot-stickers, and they were among the best I have had (in Chicago or elsewhere). The three-chili chicken was excellent and the double-fried pork was also very good. The only not so good dish was a fried shrimp dish, it seemed like something that you would get at panda express, and they were a bit mushy. I will say that it was a fairly greasy meal, but with a rediculously extensive menu (hundreds of items), I am sure that it is possible to tone down the grease if desired. I have read a number of reviews which mentioned poor service, but it was not an issue for us. Granted, we were there on the later side, and the restaurant was not full, but service was reasonbly quick and pleasant. I think this is my new go-to chinese spot in Chicago.
