YUM. It took me wayyyy too long to get to this place, and it definitely lived up to my expectations. I had the Woodland Mushroom, and AHHHH, it was so freaking good. Like so good. I can't wait to get back and try more. Maybe one day I can find my way out there for breakfast, cause I bet that would be fabulous. Do be warned, there is still a long line sometimes. Sounds like it's kind of hit or miss, but the day I was there, it was well over an hour lunch start to finish, and that was a weekday.
