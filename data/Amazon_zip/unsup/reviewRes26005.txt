The third star is for the manager noticing that the crust was so burned we could barely eat the pizza and giving us a discount.  This was definitely a 2 star pizza aside from that.  The sauce has a great taste but the cheese was lacking and the sausage was sparse. We had fantastic service and the place was fairly packed with patrons but at the end of the day, I am there for the food and it was a little off the mark.
