Took another friend back during the labor day weekend. We were told the wait was about 2 hours so we hovered around the bar area and were able to get seats within 20 minutes. Salt-roasted beets - not really a fan, tried to give it a chance but it just wasn't for me Roasted bone marrow - much better the second time around...not really sure why Octopus with green beans - one of my favorites of the night, really a must-try Scallops spiedni - also one of my favorites, the chickpea aioli really made the dish even better Affogato - I forgot what flavor soft-serve we had, but it was really good. The dessert redeemed itself since my last visit.
