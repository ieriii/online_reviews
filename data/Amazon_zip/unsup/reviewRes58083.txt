The best Chinese food in the region, if not the country. Order the beef hot chili, rice noodle with ground pork, and the Szechuan wonton. Order the spicy cabbage if they don't automatically bring it. And the hot pot is one of the greatest culinary experiences you can have in the city. Do the hot pot. The table will be trashed when you're done, but in a good way. Do not, under any circumstances, ever order any Chinese-American style dishes. That is not what this place is about. This is the real deal.
