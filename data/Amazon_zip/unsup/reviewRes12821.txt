I was hungry the 2 times I came. DELICIOUS! BEST salad bar or side-dish bar, as they have a fresh sushi, smoked salmon, seared tuna, lobster bisque etc... GREAT chimichurri sauce for the already flavorful meats. I personally just come for dinner, no drinks no dessert. The mojito I once had, tasted like sprite, and when i ordered water i got sparkling water (yuck). I should of requested to sit by the clerestory wine display to see the acrobatic lady... but i forgot. I always come dressy but i wouldnt know why a person coming from navy pier wouldnt be allowed in or snickered at.. it is downtown Chicago afterall.
