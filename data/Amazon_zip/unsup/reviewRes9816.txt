Before you begin reading this, go to phone & dial 773-348-0706 & make a reservation at Sprout. Okay, now that is done: relax because you have a dinner reservation at a very fabulous restaurant. Sprout is unassuming with a neighborhood vibe. Be prepared, it is small & this makes it all the better because you can see what everyone is eating & also hear what they are talking about, ha! The menu will look sparse but that is okay because whatever you order will be great so don't worry. Personally, I don't like a huge menu because no one can do that many things well. If you aren't sure about anything, ask your waiter. Our waiter was Barry & he was fabulous. We had the tasting menu & for once, after a tasting menu, I did not walk out hungry. Honestly, I've had smaller portions as an entree at other places. Appetizers of (1) veal and (2) foie gras were perfect. Entrees were My friend had the fish & I had the short ribs. Both were amazing & complex flavors. The wine list is very good & Barry chose an amazing Zin that complimented my short ribs. Desserts were perfect in taste & size: doughnuts (hot, yummy) & chocolate (the cup of hot choco drink was deadly). Between course flavored ice & cheese "sandwich" made me want to come for lunch & have cheese sandwich alone! Dale Levitski stopped by tables & chatted, which is something every chef should do because it makes guests feel special. Run, don't walk, to Sprout.
