Disclaimer: I am not a vegetarian. I don't eat nearly enough veggies and fruits and I'm extremely picky. I didn't think it'd be easy for me to find something here. The layout is very classic diner, which is nice and comfy. Somehow they've air conditioned the entire place with a window unit, which kept it nice and cool.  The boy had a mushroom burger special that he practically inhaled. I had the sweet potato quesadillas, which were so tasty. Mmmm, spinach, sweet potato, black beans..... so so so tasty. And the seitan meat substitute was really good (possibly marinated in something? Mmmm).  Now the best part: we got a chai vegan shake to share. Holey moley it was SCRUMPTIOUS! And was it tofu? Or rice-based? Who knows, but it tasted creamy and flavorful to me. We will DEFINITELY be back.
