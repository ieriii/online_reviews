Calo is always in our realm of options when we are trying to decide where to go for dinner because we never leave disappointed. It is a safe bet in Andersonville when visitors are in town as well - who doesn't love good, quality, consistent Italian food? The restaurant space is big and cozy, the bar is warm and inviting. The only reason I can't give it 5-stars is because it feels a little un-original at times, especially compared to the trendy & eclectic neighborhood in which it resides.
