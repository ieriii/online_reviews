Trio, trio, trio. Just get like 5 of them. SOOOOOO good!!!!! We knew the consequences of just walking in, so we went late around 10:00 pm. We still waited for about 30 minutes, but after we ordered, everything came fairly quickly.  Hubby had the rib steak which he loved, I had the cochinita and a tamale and to start we had the trio appetizer which was the best appetizer I've ever had. And we love our ceviche's and poke's!  Not sure why, but we were sooooooo full after dinner. Like uncomfortably full, but we blame the margaritas. So really, maybe one appetizer, and one entree to split may be just enough for us.  Cannot wait to go back-a trip back to Chicago just for Frontera would be well worth our money and time!
