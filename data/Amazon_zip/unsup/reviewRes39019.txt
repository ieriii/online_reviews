I had heard about Longman and Eagle from a waiter at a fancy downtown establishment who said that this was the place waitstaff and chefs visited after their shifts. It did not disappoint. I have been looking for a new whiskey bar where I can drown my sorrows over losing In Fine Spirits in Andersonville. I may have found it in Longman and Eagle. What's more, they fry their fries in beef fat, have an outdoor bar, and serve the potentially pretentious duck testicle tapas dish, unpretentiously. This four stars in only based on one lovely visit, which took place on a hot summer night, where we were warned of a 15 minute wait that turned in 3 minutes. My only complaint about the whole evening is that the outdoor bar (which is lovely) does not sell the yummy concoctions that they offer indoors or in the outdoor dining area-- this makes no sense to me.  I'll be back again and willing to give five stars! I hope it does not disappoint.
