To be honest, I wasn't exactly jumping for joy about going here, my husband really wanted to go though so I thought I'd suck it up and go. I was pleasantly surprised and happy to say I was all wrong about this place. First of all, I was thinking typical salad bar- won't be anything special- WRONG! The salad toppings were delicious, fresh artichoke hearts (the whole heart, not just a sliver!), hearts of palm, fresh parmesean, sliced meats, they had a basil sauce for dressing that was great, and many other great toppings. Next was the meat- it was so well flavored and cooked to perfection. My favorite was the filet wrapped in bacon. The leg of lamb and the chicken sausages were also very good. We decided to get the specialty drink too which was also strong and delicious- no light pours on this bad boy. My husband had the lime/rum one and I have the strawberry/vodka one-very good. The service was also great, the second you turn your card back to green they're right there and one of the guys literally ran to get my plate for me when he saw me walking towards them.
