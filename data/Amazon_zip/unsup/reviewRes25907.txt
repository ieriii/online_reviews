After reading a TON of deep-dish pizza reviews, we decided on Pequod's because it was slightly out of the way and seemed to be one of the least likely spots to be invaded by crowds of tourists with Navy Pier bags. And GODDAMN! So incredibly tasty. You might argue that it's "pan pizza," not actually "deep dish," but to be completely honest, I don't really care. The sausage was out of this world (big chunks, very flavorful, hints of fennel), and we loved the caramelized cheese around the edge. Plus, a pretty nice beer selection. The place was half empty on the Tuesday night that we were there (8-9ish), which was also awesome.
