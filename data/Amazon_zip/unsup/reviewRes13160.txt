Best scrambled eggs I've ever had. The potato pancake was very original too. Staff was super friendly, and while simple, I really enjoyed looking at the shelves of cereal behind the counter. They have an amazing array of fish options posted on the walls, but it was too early for fish for me - maybe next time!
