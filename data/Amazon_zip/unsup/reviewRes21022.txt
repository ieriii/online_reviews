i usually come here just for drinks but the one time i did order an appetizer i loved it. i ordered the fries with curry gravy. sounds weird but it went really well with the beer i had.  i'm not much of a beer drinker and if i do drink it i usually just order some pbr. i know. so classy. i asked the bartender to recommend something and it was like he knew me all my life. he gave me some lagunitas pilsner beer that was great. the staff here is really friendly and it's probably the only restaurant/bar opened late in this area. i could be wrong but i didn't really see anything else opened. it's really close to millennium park so it's a convenient place to stop by for a drink or two or three. the food is a mixture of pubby or gourmety. the menu has fish and chips under roasted elk.  i wouldn't bring anyone who is a picky eater unless there is something on the menu you know they'll like. i only say that because the dinner menu seems so gourmety. check out their menu before you decide to eat there.
