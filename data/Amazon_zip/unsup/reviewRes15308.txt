Came here on a Thursday night around midnight and there was basically no wait for our party of 4. Location is a bit difficult to find, as there is no actual storefront to this establishment - just a door with the street number on the top right corner of the wall. However, it is right across the street from Big Star, so you can use that as your reference point. Drinks are the main reason to come here - they have a huge selection of cocktails and liquors, all mixed to perfection depending on what you are in the mood for. I didn't find the food to be great - we just had the popcorn and mixed nuts, and neither was very good. Decor is really nice and this would be a great date spot or a place to bring a few friends for drinks and conversation.
