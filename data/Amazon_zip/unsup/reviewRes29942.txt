Bought our bottles of wine and went walking in search of a BYOB. Ended up at Opart. Had to call to see if it was actually BYOB since there was no indications from the outside, but figured it was worth a shot for a Thai place. Ordered fried wonton stuffed with fresh ground chicken and crab rangoon. Ground chicken wonton was what it was, but crab rangoon was about as good as I've had anywhere else. For entrees we ordered pad thai, peanut sauce lover and panang curry. We like it hot & spicy and they got it just right.  The server presented us with a bottle opener right away and the appetizers came out quickly. I'm glad we waited a few minutes before ordering the entrees or they would have come out while we were still enjoying the apps. Summary: solid Thai food. We'll definitely go back again.
