Maybe key to happiness is low expectations... If so, I plan on having low expectations at 1359 W. Taylor street everyday of the week.  I sort of thought that Italian tapas is a thing of the past and I wouldn't be impressed. I will be the first person to admit that I was wrong and will have to make it there many times in the near future to keep proving it to myself... We started out with their cheese selections, let the chef choose some great cheeses for us to eat with the fig jam - perfect. Then moved up to the ricotta with honey (to die for) and their grilled pear salad (so simple, yet SO delicious). Ended the dinner with the ragu over mascarpone polenta ( I think we licked the board), sea urchin linguine (this was the only thing that was not 5 stars, even though I LOVE urchin) and the burger (crazy good). At all the points throughout dinner, I was disappointed that I had to share with my 2 girlfriends, wanted to eat it all!  And, don't forget about the wine... I love their wine concept, because who really wants to pay 3 times the price of what you can find in the store??? We shared 2 bottles of fantastic chianti's between the 3 of us and left as happy as could be :) Worth the wait, since there are no reservations.
