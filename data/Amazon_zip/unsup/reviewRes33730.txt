Update--since I moved to Chicago, this place has undergone many changes and unfortunately it's reflected in their service. I mean, I'm not high maintenance and I don't particularly care if I get service with a smile from a place with delicious food and equally amazing prices but dang, at least get my order right.  Perhaps it was a hint to get off my lazy booty and pick it up myself. They have gotten my order wrong the past several times and when I finally spoke up, I didn't even get so much as an eat shit smile. There's not a whole lot a vegetarian can do with chicken soup. I ordered a falafel sandwich and lentil soup- that's tough to screw up and they manage to do it just about every time.
