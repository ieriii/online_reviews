Yessssssssss. I now have another place between my brother and me that's easy to access from my area and his. $40 including tip got us: Grilled eggplant - Dish of the month. Delightfully sweet and spicy and, of course, made my nose run. Hadn't really had eggplant in this capacity but it was really tasty. Lemongrass chicken - I didn't try it. Not a fan of chicken unless it's fried or on top of a salad. Stir fried noodles with vegetables - So good and just what I wanted after my 2 hour work out. Since it was light, I didn't feel (totally) guilty eating every mouthful on my plate (with a little help from my dinner companion). Great, crunchy veggies too. Complimentary strawberries...looks so classy served in little tea cups with ice....great idea for a dinner party. Cute atmosphere. Attentive service. So worth the $. BYOB. Vietnamese food. Yes, I have now found my new family night place when I don't feel like going to DMK. :)
