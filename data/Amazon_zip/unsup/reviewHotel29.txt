So get this yelpers....I had the WORSE flying experience this past October(09) from SFO to Ohare...I'll yelp that botchjob in a sec, but anywhoo, I called the hotel after landing and mentioned that I was just making sure all was well, due to EVERYTHING ELSE going wrong that day. And when I get to the Tremont, ya wanna know what happened? " You sounded so stressed out on the phone earlier we upgraded your room" Pimp. Nice. I didn't even know they had rooms that large..and they got Ditka's to take our order at closing, and the hotel delivered our food to our door.In fact they pretty much spoiled us our whole visit(they even played gatekeeper for an annoying relative of mine..we of course tipped them for it) I love these bitches.See you in october 2010!
