I could eat here everyday. I am a huge fried chicken addict but the Seoul Steak bowl is my personal fave here. I wish I knew the recipe...the taste is just amazing. I wouldn't know how to classify this food, whether or not it's authentic Korean, but I'll classify it as damn good food. Just thinking about it makes me hungry. Their lunch specials are great too! Give this little place a try and you won't regret it!
