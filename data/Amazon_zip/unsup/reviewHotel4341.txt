Ok, so I'm admittedly an architecture and history freak. This place had me sensory functions hitting all cylinders! The lobby has an incredible ceilings that words really can't describe. Every nook and cranny of this place had such great architectural detail it was just overload for me. Freaking OVERLOAD! It wasn't just old school stuff either, there was a mix of touchscreen monitors for flight schedules (how cool is that?) and updated elevators so they weren't slow as molasses. Nothing worse than a slow elevator in an old building.  The Lockwood Restaurant provides a nice bar on the main lobby area and you can catch a great cup of coffee at Starbucks downstairs at the street level. The most amazing thing was every time I would ride the elevator and people would get off on their floor I would notice that every elevator lobby on each level was different and had it's own design. Whether it was a piano as the main piece or a circular couch, each lobby had a unique flair. On top of all this, this hotel has been privileged enough to have guests such as Mark Twain and many great presidents and one stay and you will realize why. Simply amazing!
