I'll keep it short and sweet I walked in to Hopleaf with my girlfriend last night to be greeted by what I eventually concluded was a host with a full mouth and plate of food in his hands, but was told that the hostess would seat us in the back if we wished to sit there. We did, so away we went towards the back. There was a sign that wrote, "Please wait to be seated" So we did............... I peeked around the corner further as the hostess scurried out unable to openly greet us, as she too had a mouthful of food. However she was able to stress through the meat that the kitchen was only open for another 30 minutes. After we sat down I noticed 3+ plates on the server station that were in the process of being devoured by each and every individual server. One had the decency to sit in the corner and take up a table that could have been given to a customer had the opportunity presented itself. (Please don't make the customers feel like they're interrupting the servers dinner). The server came over and confidently screamed the specials at us while we waited to order what we had already decided on. And within 2 minutes after we were told by the hostess that the kitchen was closing in 30 minutes, the server reminded us that the kitchen was closing in 20 minutes. The food came out, it was good. The restaurant has a warm and clean feel. The menu is simple and I've seen most of the beers on the menu in most other places. My friend, his date. Me, my girlfriend. 74$ We tipped 20+ percent and said goodbye... A goodbye which was not verbally returned by the host.
