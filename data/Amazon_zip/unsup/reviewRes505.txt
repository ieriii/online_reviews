Meal of a lifetime? Definitely. This meal is absolutely everything the other reviewers say. We were lucky enough to have Grant Achatz in the kitchen the night we were there, and also come around to make the desserts on the table. My friend and I had wanted to try Alinea for some time and made our reservations about 3 months in advance. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful, and gives very thorough overviews of all of the food and wine. The ambiance is beautiful without taking the attention from the food.  There are enough reviews that highlight the food in a way I could not do it justice, so instead of reviewing that again, I will use my review to recommend reading Grant Achatz's book, "Life, on the line" before going, as it tells the story of how the concept of Alinea came about, the history behind the space and the menu, his battle with cancer while he ran the restaurant, and of course, his love of food. It is a quick read, and really helps to make a dinner at Alinea all the more special. Yes, it's an expensive meal, but it is worth it.
