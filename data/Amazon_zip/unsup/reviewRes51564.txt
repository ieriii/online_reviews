So cheap. So delicious. And you know what else? As someone who always-and I mean always- gets the taco dinner at every Mexican restaurant, I thought it was really great how they give you the 2-taco or 3-taco option! The salsa is a tad soupy, but the chips are nice and crunchy. Everyone there was so nice and the service has been friendly whether it's 7pm or 2am! It's a new favorite!
