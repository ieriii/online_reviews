If I could give ZERO I would. But read on, mostly for people with nut allergies! STAY AWAY! The waiter rudely told me everything had nuts in it, but then did say some dishes were ok to eat. Still, there must have been cross contamination issues, as I had a severe allergic reaction. While the food was good, am sorry to say I will never recommend this restaurant to anyone, even though I am Indian.
