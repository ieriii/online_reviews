I went to Le Colonial with my girlfriend last Saturday. We went on a last-minute whim and the restaurant had no problem seating us. Overall the service was great, the food was good, but the price point was too high. I expected Le Colonial to have much more of a twist on Vietnamese classics (which already have some French Influence), however what I found was that although the flavors were spot on, they weren't any better than I would find at a standard Vietnamese restaurant on Argyle. The one memorable dish was the Bouillabaisse (a French Shellfish stew). It brought a good amount of seafood and the flavors were great. However, this was a standard French dish in my opinion and was missing any fusion factor. We had some other items on the menu such at the Spring rolls and the Vietnamese ravioli. Again the food was good, but missing the extra "uumph" to justify the price. All in all the restaurant was good. My expectations may have been skewed because I was expecting more of a fusion factor, however what I found was an offering of standard Vietnamese fare at a premium. Summary: if you have never had Vietnamese food before, and want to start at a place where you can feel comfortable with the menu and guarantee consistency I would recommend Le Colonial. However, if you are more adventurous, venture down to Argyle (thinking Tank Noodle specifically) or even Chinatown (Cafe Huang) for some quality authentic Vietnamese food at a MUCH MORE AFFORDABLE price point.
