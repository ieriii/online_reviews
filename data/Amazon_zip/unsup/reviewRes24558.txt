This place is the love of my life...the apple of my eye... the peanut butter to my jelly...the cheese to my fondu?? If you ever (and I mean ever) want to impress a girl on a first date, special occasion/anniverary this restaurant is a must! Im not easily impressed (and my boyfriend unfortunatley is all to aware of this) but he tried his luck with this place and it won my heart. The atmosphere is very romantic with candel light and in-closed booths and the fondu is delicious....I could gush and gush about this place for hours but I will spare you. You must see it to believe it. Its that good :)
