A warm, friendly place perfect for a private function, a date or even take out. A real find. This place is busy, even on a Monday night, and I see why. It has wonderful family vibe (without the family bickering). The food is really good, and although I find the portions - especially the desserts - WAAAY too big, I know lots of folks like that. I'd recommend trying their margarita made with honey. An unexpected ingredient that creates a great flavor. The service is also on point; from the bartender to the bus boys, everyone worked to make our event in their private room a success. They have a few wonderful private dining rooms for special events. The Coach House has real character but with some creative table arranging and candles, the larger space can be transformed into something special too. This second space is large and has its own private entrance so that's pretty cool. Dining room can get loud, especially when it's full (as it was when I was there). They can do family style meals upon request and their wine list is Italian. Look forward to going back.
