I used to live at Division and Winchester and M&H turned many days around for me. I literally dream of their breakfast panini and kettle chips. So delicious. SO DELICIOUS. and the Crab Cake sandwich! I almost forgot! Just writing about it is making me hungry. God i'm going there today. i have to. My biggest regret when my wallet was stolen was not the cash and $400 charged onto my credit cards, but the fact that my Milk & Honey Coffee Club punch card was in my wallet made me saddest. :( I wish they would do regular table service instead of order and then sit, but I guess thats how they turn tables. This place deserves table service. also, Cupcakes are great.
