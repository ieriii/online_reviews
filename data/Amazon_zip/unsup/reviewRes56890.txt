I haven't been to Chicago in years, and so it was great to be able to dine on a thin-crust pizza a la Sally's of New Haven, CT. It brought back many old memories of great times. The pizza was piping hot and spectacular. Wish I could bring a pie home with me to San Francisco. And, of course, what goes better with pizza than a nice cold beer - the IPA from their micro-brewery was the perfect thirst quencher. Finally, the service was top-shelf. The servers enjoy what they do and the owner/founder, Billy Jacobs, after 11 years with the business, was still greeting customers and asking them how things were. Everything at this establishment was just first-rate.
