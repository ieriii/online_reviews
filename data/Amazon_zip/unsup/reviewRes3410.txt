Talk about flavor...this place packs in the spices for an affordable, filling meal. We had the soon to be legendary Crisp BBQ sauced Funke Chicken and a Seoul Steak Bowl. The sweetness of the BBQ sauce smothered over tender fried chicken makes me think that old Colonel Sanders might want to start revinventing his original recipe! A slight dusting of sesame seeds also added a nice textural element to the dish.  The Seoul Bowl was almost as good, especially with the atomic sauce on the side. The rice was cooked perfectly, but don't expect slices of steak. Rather, it's more of a chopped steak dish. A few pieces were a bit fatty, but overall the dish works pretty well. Again, a slight sweetness to the sauce balanced nicely with the savory steak.  The dining room is simple, long wood "picnic" tables that you will probably end up sharing if you go at a busy time.
