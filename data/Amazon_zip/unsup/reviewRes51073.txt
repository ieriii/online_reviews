I'm sure, from the other reviews that this place is spectacular.  BUT, when I order a chicken salad and it comes out with grilled dark meat on top (slimy, meager and pitiful-looking), I question the cooks and the waiters sense of quality. It was vile looking and even worse on the palate. I know I subbed grilled meat for fried, but that was ridiculous. So I would say that attentiveness to guest satisfaction and quality control in kitchen are not quite up to par.
