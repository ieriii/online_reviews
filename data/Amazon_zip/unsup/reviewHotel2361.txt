This place is mega gigantor. It's like a city within chicago. Some towns dont hold this many people. For the price performance value it's hard to beat for a large city. $125/night with weekend stay is pretty solid. The location is another plus. Being near the lake on Michigan ave within walking distance to a ton of things and near public transit. Im sure that's why they are popular with the conference crowd. For me a decent bed and clean bathroom is the gist of what I need and this hotel delivered that. There's tons of shops and eating joints within the hotel too so if you really want to just hole up and not go anywhere that's also a choice. No free internet is a bummer though.
