We had to wait for a table even though we had a reservation on a Tues night, but it was well worth the wait! The food was delish! We had a bit of everything, sushi for an app, and two different meat dishes. I would have had more sushi rolls if I could do it again. Service was great and fast espcially since it was packed. Can't wait to go back!
