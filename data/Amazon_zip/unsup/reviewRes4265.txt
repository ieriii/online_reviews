What do Al Capone, Jack McGurn, Helen Morgan, Anita O'Day, Billie Holliday and Charlie Chaplin have in common? The Green Mill... This place is the real deal!  If these walls could talk, they'd have to kill ya.  I can't make it to the Green Mill often enough! This is a fantastic place for true music lovers and history lovers too. Go early if you want a table. You can stumble in here just about anytime and enjoy some great music standing or stting at the bar too.  "Is this where you go when you die? ...only if you're good!"
