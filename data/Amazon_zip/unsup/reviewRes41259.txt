I am not a steak eater. I know that being a native Nebraskan that this is blasphemous. But it is true. I rarely eat steak so when someone wants to take me to a steakhouse, almost always I am not eager to go. But being the cordial, sweet person that I am, I agree. This time things were different. My companion and I were just swinging through on our way out for the evening so we sat at the bar for a quick dinner. We decided to share a large filet, medium. I cant stand bloody meat so I was a bit weary. But when our server brought out two sizzling plates of melted butter and split our steak onto them my fear went out the window. Anything is excellent when swimming in melted butter. I mean to tell you that this steak was amazing. Tender, juicy, full of flavor and I didnt even notice it was still pink. That, my friends, says something. I think I may even crave steak now..it was that good. We had some good times chatting up the bartenders/barbacks, our drinks were strong and of course, that amazing steak. Im not an expert on steakhouses but I would go back here for sure.
