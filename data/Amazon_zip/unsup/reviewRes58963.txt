Just tried Sunda for the first time tonight. I am new to the sushi thing and was a bit nervous to go to such a posh place. WOW! Everything was wonderful and it was due to a great server.  Her name is Melissa if I remember correctly and she was the best from start to finish. We explained that we were newbies and she offered to order for us! She asked some questions about our likes and dislikes and did her thing. It was such a fun and interesting experience to have someone do this for us. She hit the nail on the head. She made us feel comfortable and taken care of. I highly recommend giving this place a try. I might not go in on a weekend because of the apparent crowds but will definitely go back on a weeknight for more experimenting!
