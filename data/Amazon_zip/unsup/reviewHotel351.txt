Hubby and I arrived by Greyhound and had 8 hours before we had to be at the airport. We decided that a shower and a nap would be the ideal way to spend those 8 hours. The Holiday Inn Express was closed so we were directed to the Travelodge. It was going to cost us $120 to stay there for a total of 6 hours. When we were told the amount, we actually left and checked out the two nearest youth hostels to see if they had any availability. Sadly, they were all booked up and we were running on zero hours of sleep and the vicious flashbacks of whining babies on the Greyhound. We actually returned to this place and paid. The next two weeks we spent backpacking in Europe (Germany & Czech Republic) and every single night we stayed in hostels that were LARGER, CLEANER, NEWER, and CHEAPER. This is taking into the account our incredibly weak dollar in the face of the euro. I still cant believe we caved in. :(
