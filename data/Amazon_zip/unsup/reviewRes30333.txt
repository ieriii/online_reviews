Sunda offers more ambiance and a happening scene than it does food so go in with this expectation and you'll have a great time. The food is quality. The menu is pan-Asian with singular dishes that hail from specific countries like lumpia from the Philippines to Asian fusion dishes that borrowed flavors and ingredients from a variety of Asian cuisines. Our favorites were the seared tuna sashimi, lumpia, duck hash, and kobe beef sushi bites. Many of the dishes like the rolls and sashimi were just ok on the other hand. I would suggest staying away from the more classic type of Asian dishes and trying more of the unique Asian fusion type of dishes. Most of the dishes are intended for sharing so it is great for larger parties and groups. On a Saturday night, this place was brimming with a unique mix of young-ish couples to older parties in their 50's to families with kids to gaggles of girls out for a night on the town. The sound level is not quite stratospheric, but don't expect to be having a quiet conversation with your boo unless you're going to be sitting on his lap and whispering things in his ear. Our server was helpful and patient and we even had to give props to the management team for taking care of us when there was an issue at the table. Fine dining Sunda is not, but for a fun atmosphere with good food Sunda is a great find in Chicago.
