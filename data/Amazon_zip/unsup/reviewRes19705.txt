Not as newsy as some other reviewers, but my experiences with Coast have been decent: delivery is fast (especially for a Friday night) and the sushi is good. But seriously, why is this place so damn expensive? UPDATE: After getting Coast delivered a few times, I finally tried eating at the restaurant. I definitely think its better than most places and they do have some good specials, but that is some seriously pricey sushi!
