A solid four stars for TdB. The "salad bar" was much more extensive than Brazzaz and the decor was more what I expected. The acrobatic woman in the glass encased wine room was a treat.  The only reason I didn't give TdB five stars is due to the beef being really salty. The waitress (or gaucho) informed us they use rock salt but you can request less salt on your pieces if you choose.  Overall it was a great experience and the food was really good.
