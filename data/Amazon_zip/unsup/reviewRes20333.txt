This place is unbelievable! This is one of the best sushi places in the city. Every roll I tried there was amazing but I have to recommend the Volcano Roll. I went on a Saturday night and the place was packed, so call ahead. Besides the great food, and fun atmosphere this place is BYOB, so bring the sake and Sapporo.
