I love this place. I have been several times now. The steak is good. The seafood risotto is good, as well as the fish dish that I had there. One particular night I went there was for a girls night and the service was excellent. They were very accommodating. The food quality and portions are great for the price, especially compared to may other nice restaurants around here.
