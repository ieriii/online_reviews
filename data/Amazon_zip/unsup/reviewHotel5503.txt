This is a really sweet little hotel. There isn't anything flashy or fancy about it, but its in good condition and the people are very friendly. Since my family lives a plane ride away, and my apartment is very small, they end up staying in this hotel whenever they come to visit because its amazingly close to where I live. The hotel books up really far in advance in baseball season because it is the closes hotel to Wrigley (about a mile), and good luck getting a room whenever there are Pride events or Lakeview/Lincoln Park festivals. But, they are very accomodating of special situations (like my graduation from grad school). For people visiting Chicago, I would really recommend this hotel. Its far enough away from the touristy areas that you get a good feel for a Chicago neighborhood and its a block from the express buses that run down LSD, as well as a mile from the red line. Definitely the nicest Best Western (Bestest Western?) I've seen.
