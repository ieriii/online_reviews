Dammit Hot Doug's, open up a bigger place!!  The hope and promise of meaty goodness is what kept us alive (albeit half frozen) after that 1+hr wait on a weekday afternoon in the damp and cold in the middle of January... (So much for going on an "off time" on a Monday!!) We ordered the foie gras topped duck sausage. For good measure we also ordered a dog spiced with curry and cranberry chutney, another duck filled dog and a pork dog with a mustard sauce. And a small (giant) order of cheese fries. We inhaled everything on our table and most of the items were tasty, but the pork dog with the mustard was my least fave. The mustard was really strong. Like I'm cringing now just thinking about how strong that mustard was.  I'd go back. In the summer. On a weekday. Early as hell.
