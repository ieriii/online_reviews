I went to Simply It with some friends to celebrate someone's birthday. The service was excellent. We brought a couple bottles of wine and they chilled the extras until we were ready. I thought the menu was creative and we ordered 2 dishes off the specials menu. Everything tasted delicious - we especially enjoyed the Avocado-Wrapped Chicken and the Fried Rice bowl. For my friend's birthday, they brought out cake, and gave us fancy chopsticks and cute little Vietnamese incense burners. The atmosphere is cute and cozy and the prices were incredibly reasonable. I will definitely be going back.
