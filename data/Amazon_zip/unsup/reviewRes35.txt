The most unique dining experience I've had in awhile. Been anxiously waiting to try the best restaurant in America. It didn't disappoint. The food was perhaps a four but the presentation and creativity of the dining experience was a six. Just a few highlights.... Hot and cold potato - a modern interpretation of deliciousness A black truffle ravioli - wow just an explosive of tastiness Lamb - served three ways with an accompiament of 86 different flavor tastes. Like a mad scientist workshop on a plate Taffy balloon - seriously, filled with helium on an apple cord string. Unbelievably inventive and mind blowing As expected, great service. A few dishes were a miss on flavor profile but all were exciting and truly unexpectedly unique. Worth the trip and expense.
