Q was pretty damn awesome - the kobe brisket was incredible - the corn bread was great - hush puppies were perfect - st. louis style ribs - perfect and with 4 sauces. mac cheese was good not great - greens were excellent.... and on and on and on.... place was packed out. i'm not a huge bbq lover but man, they got it right...
