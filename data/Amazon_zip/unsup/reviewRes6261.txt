I enjoyed a sumptuous dinner here with good company. We started happy hour at the Tasting room before having dinner here so our appetites were plentiful. For an appetizer, we had the spinach and artichoke fondue. This is by far the best spinach dip I've had in a restaurant.  For dinner I ordered the filet medallions "diane style", which were made perfect to order. They pretty much melted in my mouth. The atmosphere is lively, but still able to carry on a conversation. Seating is very comfortable in the elongated booth sections. However, I had to take away one star because our server offered poor manners, and lack of help. Otherwise, I'm definitely looking forward to another enjoyable meal here.
