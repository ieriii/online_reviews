great cubano sandwich. I had the media noche (sweet bread), fried yucca w/ garlic topping. For dessert I had bread pudding and a cafe con leche. it was all terrific! homemade and delicious. would recommend. only drawback was that it was small inside but cozy. felt like i was in cuba for 30min. parking too!
