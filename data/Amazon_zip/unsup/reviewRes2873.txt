This is a 4 1/2 star rating. Not as memorably or delicious as Charlie Trotter's, but a foodie's dream come true nonetheless. If you order the chef's menu, get ready for a never-ending event. By the time the dessert cart and then the candy cart came around I was about to bust out of my pants; portions throughout are generous, if not delicious and creative. The room is decidedly minimalist almost to the point of being austere. I did feel like maybe we were being rushed through such a big meal and the service was a bit staid, but this is a recommendation for Tru.
