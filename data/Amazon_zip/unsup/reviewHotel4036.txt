It seems I always have a problems with elevators. This time, HEARING them. Constantly. That, combined with the airplane noise, made me wonder why they didn't spend some renovation money on better soundproofing the rooms. In fact, if you stand long enough in the bathroom, you can actually HEAR conversations from within the elevator. So, note: if you receive a room near the elevator lobby, I suggest you change it. As for that airplane noise, I stayed in the hotel next door last year, and didn't hear a thing from the outdoors. Moving on, we were given a room in the newly renovated tower, which still had that "new carpet" scent. The room was huge and spacious, with a nice view of the city. The beds at the Hyatt are ALWAYS comfortable -- I love them so much, I want to buy one. But the pillows? Suck hard core. Every Hyatt now seems to stock these tiny, almost square head pillows. If I'm in a King bed, I kind of want matching King pillows, you know what I'm saying? The people who work here are amazing -- everyone from the luggage guy to the concierge to the check-in/out staff, and even the guy who hails the cabs for you. I like that the hotel has a mini store on the lower level, where I was able to purchase coffee, milk and cereal, a banana and a variety of other snacks for the room. That said, you know it costs like 3x more than if you bought it in a store yourself ($8 for said bowl of cereal, big chug milk & banana). Oh, the sake of convenience, right? Also, we had "no smoking" signs in our room, which made me believe that some rooms DO allow smoking, which I smelled quite frequently throughout our weekend stay. I'd stay at the Hyatt Regency again simply because of its location and value for the room price.
