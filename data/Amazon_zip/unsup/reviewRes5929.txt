I always make a reservation and I've never had better service anywhere else. My favorite routine is to show up half an hour early. Let the host know we're here and get one of those hockey pucks that lights up when your table is ready. Then get a martini at the bar and enjoy the ambiance. In my opinion, the best fillet mignon in the city. Not huge, but flavorful, and I almost always get the sauteed mushrooms as an extra side but it's not necessary. The steaks here stand on their own without embellishment. I also enjoy the coconut crusted shrimp. And the salads are large enough for two or more people, so plan on sharing one. And the desserts, especially anything chocolate, are to die for and a must-have if you're on a date, so save room. Prices are reasonable considering the warm, old school atmosphere, ritzy clientele and quality entrees. I only dine here two or three times a year for special occasions and I've never been dissatisfied.
