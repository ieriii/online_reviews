Went tonight for some steak tacos. Normally I would order a burrito, but I remembered on check please they were all about the tacos. I would say it was definitely better than average (Flash Taco). Was it the best late night Mexican ever? No. The best late night Mexican ever WAS at Taco and Burrito Palace #2 on Halsted. I haven't been in years, but the memories don't fade.
