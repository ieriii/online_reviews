This place may become a new favorite of mine. I grabbed a seat here for a late brunch, despite the decent crowd, and settled in for a superb meal. We started with drinks -- Hot Buttered Rum and Mimosas -- which definitely exceeded the bar set by the etching in the front window, "Eat Sleep Whiskey." From the looks of the full bar drink menu, every Bourbon and Rye you could dream of is ready at hand. 5 stars to the bar. I ordered the duck confit hash and eggs -- semi-exotic, but hearty and savory. Very good. I sampled a bite of the cheese burger which was topped with Nueske bacon and a well-paired cheddar. 4 stars to the cuisine. The staff was friendly enough, but I cannot say they were attentive. Given that it was brunch, they probably should have had more people scheduled. I had to flag down my waiter a number of times. 3 stars to the service. Bottom line: if you're looking for a great brunch with morning beverages to match, Longman & Eagle is the place to be.
