I was not able to order the Mac n Cheese because my ol lady ordered it and wouldn't let me :( So i decided to order the Meatloaf...not one of my typical choices when dining out, but this is an Irish Pub/Restaurant so I had to get something in their realm of expertise. The meatloaf was a MEATLOAD, holy jeebus was it a healthy portion and the mashed potats were deeeeelish. I was able to try the lobster mac and it was as good as everyone says that it is!!! They also had a fairly decent selection of craft brews as well as a great selection of scotches and irish whiskeys (this would be expected at an authentic Irish pub). We came in with a group of 20 or so and as a service industry employee I understand what a nightmare this could be, splitting checks and all. Our server handle us especially well along with a few other tables, my glass was never empty and she did a great just keeping us all inline and not making any mistakes, kudos to Wilde for having a staff that is on top of things and very very nice.
