Pizza and beer. What else do you need to know? The pizza is delicious. There are enough varieties of beer to keep you busy for a while. The place is loud. No wait when I went on a Saturday afternoon, which was surprising because there were a ton of people but excellent because this waiting an hour for food trend is unacceptable. Would go here more often but it's kind of far for me.
