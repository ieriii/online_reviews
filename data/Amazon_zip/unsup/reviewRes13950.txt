No matter if it was named after the mileage from Cuba to the coast of Florida, this cafe has a major problem it will need to figure out. How the heck are they going to keep themselves off the American embargo of Cuba? So authentic that they must have found a way to flash freeze the food and have it illegally shipped to this place. Coming off my high of cemitas, 90 miles Cuban sandwiches are equally delightful. The minute I stepped into this place I wanted to see if my mom was back in the kitchen working. I mean just the aroma I smelled opening the door was instantly reminiscent of her cooking. I had the Cuban sandwich, a guava and cheese pastelito and a cafe Cubano. All of that was spot on to what I used to have frequently when I lived in South Florida. So there goes one thing I used to miss from living down there ... now what to do about the year long hot weather? The only knock I can give this place is that it is small and if you go when it is busy, you may end up having to take your food to go. Small price to pay when great quality food is available for less than what those fancy Cuban restaurants charge. Co-owner Alberto was at the counter the night I came in and was kind enough to chat up a storm with me. Very gracious and very consistent as he seem to be the same way with everyone that walked in. Not too bad for a first time restaurant owner. Check out the website too as he checks it regularly for comments.
