Came on a Saturday for an overnight stay. The hotel was clean and room was spacious. The staff is friendly and accommodating. This location is located right next to a Walgreens, pnc, jimmy johns and a few other places. It's in a great location! Also by the Washington/wells loop subway stop. Went into the jacuzzi in the evening and it's super small! Not too many people in the pool area anyways. They offer complimentary breakfast which includes DIY waffles, muffins, breads, yogurt, cereal, hard boiled eggs, etc. Cons: - the next morning the complimentary breakfast was PACKED. barely no place to sit. line to make waffles - there might've been some sort of partying going on because we saw remnants of puke in the hallway early next morning...SO GROSS.
