We had such high expectations, and we were so hungry! Sunday morning, tight corner table, screaming kids that were so close to us you could almost say they sat with us, and the Huevos Rancheros everyone raves about? Picture this, a giant soup looking dish where the cheese was melted at one time and is now luke warm and hard - the first layer on top is also luke warm, the beans have created a water layer - yum, do I have you hungry now? Not to mention the bean layer is cold, that's right, cold. Thinking this must have been a mistake, we nicely asked them to heat it up. 15 minutes later, and at this point I thought they made a fresh one, the same one came back to us, and nothing changed. Still cold, still hard cheese on top. We politely left, can't say we will ever return. Cute place, but that was about it.
