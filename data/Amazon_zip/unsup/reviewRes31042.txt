Actually a NEGATIVE star. Goodness, how BAD can vegetarian/vegan food get? oh yeah, as bad as this spot - this place still doesn't know how to use seasonings & yet they're still in business? so many other places are well worth the ride out (Karyn's, Amitabul, Blind Faith Cafe, Soul Vegetarian, Veggies to Go, etc)
