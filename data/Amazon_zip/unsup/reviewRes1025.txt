Oh Hot Doug's. You are fantastic. I love you. The only thing I hate is the wait and the fact that you close early. Come on, dudes! They seem to purposely slow down the line by taking orders very, very slowly. I get it, since there aren't that many places to sit, but still. Everything I've ever had there is fantastic, but I will go out on a limb and say the duck fat fries aren't really that much better than normal fries. They're tasty, but not like, "Oh my god I must eat these every day of my life" tasty. The interior of the place is hilarious, and they are super friendly. SAUSAGE RULES.
