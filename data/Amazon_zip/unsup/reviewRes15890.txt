I had heard many amazing reviews of Carnivale, but my experience did not live up to my expectations. I want to start by saying that the ambiance of Carnivale is amazing!! The colors on the walls are beautiful along with the art/photographs on the wall. The service was also top notch. My water was never empty, and I loved that the waitress was very attentive and also offered suggestions. I ordered the black currant mojito (one of the waitress's suggestions), which was delicious. I thought it was a perfect balance of sour and sweet, yet I could still taste the mojito flavor coming through. For an appetizer my friend and I shared a bowl of guacamole and chips. The chips were freshly made but were a little oily. The guacamole was fresh but was a little bland and did not have a kick that I think guacamole should have. My friend and I went during restaurant week, so we chose from a prix fixe menu. We both started with the manchego cheese, apple, and walnut salad. The salad had the right amount of dressing, but overall it was nothing special. Next, I had the pork adobo, which was shredded pork over coconut rice. Again I thought the dish was just ok. The food came out warm but not hot, which is a turn off to me. The rice was lukewarm, not very sticky, and actually tasted a little oily. The shredded pork was also pretty oily and too salty for me. Last I had the tres leches cake, which again I thought was just ok. The coffee flavored whipped cream and candied almonds were delicious but the actual cake was so-so. I usually eat up all of my dessert no matter how full I am, but I did not finish this dessert. Overall I am so glad I went to Carnivale because I think it is a gorgeous restaurant with a fun atmosphere, and despite the huge size of the restaurant the service was exceptional. However, I did not think that the food was as good as other people have said, and this may have been due to the fact that it was restaurant week.
