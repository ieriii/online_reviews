Love everything about this place, except that it's too small!  This is my favorite style of crispy chicken, barely any breading and surprisingly very light tasting. The seoul sassy sauce is amazing and I think if it were up to me, I'd put it on almost anything I ate. The $19.99 deal for the whole chicken, 2 sides, and 2 drinks is a great deal and definitely gives you a lot of food to eat; 3 of us split it and were perfectly full and satisfied.  My only suggestion to anyone about this place is don't come with a crowd, hoard, or even group larger than 3 people, you just simply won't have enough seats unless your timing is perfect.  On a side note, living near Crisp was a very big incentive to live in the location I do... just go to Crisp already!
