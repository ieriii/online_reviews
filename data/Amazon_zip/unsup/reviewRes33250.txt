I debated with myself whether to give Yolk a 2 star or a 3 star. Well maybe its a 2 and a half. I have been here twice, and have been underwhelmed both times. There are wayyy better brunch places in Chicago. I am not saying its a bad experience, but the food is strictly ok. It is overtly greasy, and I am not a fan of that. I don't get the hour long waits on weekends for this place. It's definitely overrated.
