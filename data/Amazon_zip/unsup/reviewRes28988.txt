I've both dined in and carried out from the pasta bowl. Delivery is pretty fast, although I do just live right down the street. The food isn't bad, but I prefer to eat it. It's fresher, obviously. I really like to get the fettuccine alfredo. I've had it with both chicken and shrimp and I still prefer just the pasta. I've also had the farfelle pasta and I pretty much licked the bowl clean. I've never had to wait more than 15-20 minutes for a table and the place is incredibly affordable. I went here on a (bad) date once and I think the bill was like $20 for drinks and dinner. Oh, I almost forgot...the mixed greens salad is so good. The dressing is really good, kind of sweet. And they take the pits out of the olives. yesssss.
