This place is kind of the worst. Maybe I'm a little too posh, but, here goes: 1 - Ambiance: Lobby was playing Fox News when I checked in. What kind of hip hotel plays Fox News? 2 - Poor Reservation system: The room for which I had to **pre-pay** was sold out, so I had a choice of either downgrading at "no additional charge" or upgrading for $30 a night extra. Oh yeah and I went from a river view to the view of an alleyway, and a room next to the elevators. 3 - Ambiance, again: Pretty beat-up hallway, terrible insulation between rooms and halls 4 - Amenities: No bottled water in the rooms, either for free or via mini-bar. If you need water, you need to drink tap. 5 - Amenities: No bathtubs. 6 - Amenities: Linens are 100% polyester. 7 - Amenities: No blankets or duvets. Even in the summer, offer a duvet. (PS I can't believe I am considering warmth, kind of at the base of my hierarchy of needs, an "amenity") 8 - Ambiance: Poor-fitting bathroom fixtures (with an inch gape between the shower faucet and the tile, you can just imagine all the water damage and toxic mold waiting to grow. 9 - Amenities: No wireless. In other words, don't let the website fool you. Not in the same league as W or Kimpton.
