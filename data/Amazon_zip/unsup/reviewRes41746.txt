I usually avoid chain places on principal, but Ruth's Chris is so good that I make an exception. They really do have amazing steaks. Much better than Gibsons, for sure. We went for restaurant week, which was an amazing deal. The full price menu is a little pricey, but I think it's totally worth it. The steaks are cooked perfectly and the butter on top is a nice touch. The sides are delicious and they have a great wine selection. Worthy of a special occassion.
