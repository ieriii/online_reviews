I was in Chicago for the weekend, and what was on my list of to-do? HOT DOUG'S! We arrived at about 10:30 am on a Saturday and we were stoked to see how short the line was! While waiting in line, we were anxious to try what we have heard so much about. While waiting, we were deciding what to get. So many different choices, and if it were up to me, I would've wanted to order everything off the menu and have a bite of each. However, that didn't happen! Doug took our order, and something about having the owner of the establishment working the counter every day the place is open makes the place even better! We ordered the Salma Hayek, the Marty Allen, Foie Gras, the Steak Hot Dog, the Keira Knightley, 2 corn dogs, and an order of duck fat fries to share amongst 4 people. Yes! It was a lot of weiners! All of them had great distinct flavors as described on the menu, and they were all good in their own ways. I am a fan of Foie Gras, but I personally did not like the Foie Gras hot dog. It was loaded with Foie Gras, but something about paying $6 for so much foie gras really turned me off. Weird to say, but my favorite thing out of everything we ordered would have to be the CORN DOGS! They were sooo good! Everything from the batter to the hot dog. It was the best corn dog I have ever had! Hot Doug's lived up to the hype!
