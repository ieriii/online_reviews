Similar review as many posters, torn between 3.5-4 stars. The food was all very interesting and executed perfectly. Our waiter was knowledgeable and attentive as were the rest of the wait staff. I liked the music/ambience and did not find it too loud. However, for the price they charge, I would like to see a little larger portions. Luckily we all had a snack prior to coming here, but everyone at the table was barely satiated when we left and we all had the 5 course tasting menu. The wine list is really hard to follow with all their "rock" jargon. I gave the waiter a hint on the range that I was looking to be in for the wines ($60) and he didn't take it. He kept recommending $100+ bottles and offering to drop the price a little. I asked about getting one of the bottles that they sell by the glass and he said, just multiply it by five... How is that a good value? I'm glad I came here, but even if I lived in Chicago, I don't think I would return very often.
