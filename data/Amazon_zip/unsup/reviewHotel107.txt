My husband and I stayed at this hotel for four nights in June 2011. If you are looking for huge space and luxurious amenities, this hotel is not for you. If you have kids, this hotel is not for you. If you are looking for a place to sleep and shower, this is for you. Great location and great value. Short walk to CTA red line and within walking distance to many fun bars, restaurants, shops, and the lakefront. There were a few small problems: our intial room lacked air conditioning, so we were transferred to a second floor room that was probably arranged for handicapped persons so there was an open shower, no fan, etc. I am sure the free breakfast was great, bit we never awoke early enough to enjoy it! I would definitely stay here again!
