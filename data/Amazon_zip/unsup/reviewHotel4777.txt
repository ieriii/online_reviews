Positives for the Palmer House include the incredible lobby and a wonderful location - a block from Michigan Avenue, the Art Institute and Millennium Park. Kudos to the concierge staff, all were friendly and helpful.Negatives - well our rooms sure didn't look like the rooms touted in their marketing material. Peeling wallpaper and scuffed up paint, low ceilings in the halls that a 6'5" person would find daunting. No coffee service in the room. For $13 extra, they'll provide you with a coffee maker and 4 packs of coffee. They'll provide additional coffee at a considerable upcharge, and they won't clean up around the coffee maker. And no matter what time of day it was, the room service attendants were blocking the hallways with service carts. Weird service all around.Lockwood's, the hotel restaurant was very expensive for both breakfast and dinner. Breakfast was mediocre as was the service. We'd been comped breakfast in exchange for an awful dinner the night before, other wise we'd never have gone back. Dinner was extremely expensive and the service was abysmal. I'd thought that maybe our waiter wasn't feeling well because he kept wiping his forehead, and he seemed completely disinterested in his work. We'd tried to ask questions about the menu and the wines, but he mumbled so, that even upon asking him again, we still couldn't understand him. The menu was ambitious, with claims of using local farms for meats and produce. I give them credit for that. But, that's it. The flavors were completely nondescript. If you want to spend $165 for dinner for two, there are much better alternatives.
