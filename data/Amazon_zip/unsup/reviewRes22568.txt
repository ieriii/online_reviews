In the southwest most corner of Chinatown square, there lies a small but elegant Chinese restaurant known as Lao Sze Chuan. It's great for groups as they happily accommodated my family and I at a large round table. Like most Chinese restaurants, you are served free tea upon sitting. I found this tea to be especially delicious, and also felt like it stimulated my appetite. The vegetable egg rolls are skippable. They tasted clean and fresh, but I didn't desire to eat more than half of one as they were underseasoned. The highlight of the evening was the Ma Po Tofu. Possibly the best tofu, I've had at a restaurant, this huge bowl of spicy, melt-in-your-mouth goodness had us all sweating and craving more. It is served in a large family style bowl and pairs well with some plain white rice and some solid Szechuan mixed vegetables. To round off the experience, the service was great. We were given a plate of delicious spicy cabbage on the house and were accommodated nicely for the two kids in our group. The food is all great and comes to the table relatively quickly even though the restaurant was packed. I definitely wish I knew about Lao Sze Chuan sooner!
