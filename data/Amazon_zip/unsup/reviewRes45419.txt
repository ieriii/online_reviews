Great service, cozy atmosphere, fantastic tunes, beautiful bar and delicious food. I had been wanting to go to Wilde for about a year, and finally did. We went on Halloween night. The entire staff was in costume and ready for the holiday!  We had a group of 15 people at our table. Everyone enjoyed their meals, from the mac and cheese (outstanding), pumpkin bisque, chopped chicken salad, Ruben, blue cheese burger and more. The food was hot, fresh and tasty. They have a variety of unique drinks that were fun to try.  The atmosphere at Wilde is perfect for the cozy fall weather. The deep colored wood and warm tones used throughout Wilde make it inviting and comfortable. The library and bar area are beautiful. Check out the ceiling and bathrooms as well!
