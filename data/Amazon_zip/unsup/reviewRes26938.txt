This is my go-to deep dish place when out-of-towners come to visit. I have yet to find a better deep dish pizza in the city. App's leave something to be desired for sure, but the pizza is filling enough. Try to hit it up for their ridiculous lunch special if you're in the area ($5 for a single pan and a drink (can be a pint of Miller Lite if you'd like)).
