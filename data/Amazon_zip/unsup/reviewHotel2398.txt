I stayed here for a staycation and was really disappointing. We were on the executive level so we had access to refreshments and a continental breakfast. The executive floor is crawling with kids who are un-supervised. I'm fine with kids but there were no adults to be found to supervise them and then no one was staffing the executive room on the Hilton side. It was rather frustrating.  The beds were worn down and the bathrooms were pretty small. Ours only had one bathroom, but I've heard some have two. The room itself was also small.  There was a stain on our sheets so we ended up sleeping on the to sheet because by the time we realized the stain it was midnight and we were exhausted. I guess I just think for the cost of this hotel there are better options in this city.
