This Pho place is Good. You can make better at home. If you can't make it. This is the place to go that is conveniently located in the corner across from Ba Le French Sandwich. This place should play more Quang Le music.Better than all the pho places. I still have to go to lily.Bun Dac Biet is my favorite. They do a good job.
