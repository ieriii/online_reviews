I LOVE THIS PLACE!!! Great Vietnamese food, amazing prices, super fresh, and the owners are so generous with giving you a little extra something with your order. I am Taiwanese so I love Asian food, and don't get me wrong, I go up to Argyle too--but the food here is just consistently better quality, fresher, and CLOSER to where I live. Plus, they deliver! What more can you ask for? My favorite dishes are the pho, the shrimp salad, and the pumpkin and shrimp soup. All so yummy. Try to avocado wontons too! We got them for the first time tonight and they are delicious! Yay for Simply It!
