Ahhh Fox&Obel! My first crush and my last disappointment too! I can start with good food, unpredictable service and high prices.. I used to love the place: chef's omelet and coffee; sometime a glorious muffin and coffee..or just the fresh squeezed..Until I saw one of the servers using the washroom and getting back to work without cleaning her hands.!
