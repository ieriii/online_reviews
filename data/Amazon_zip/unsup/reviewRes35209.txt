Holy cow - the peking duck at Sun Wah is amazing! My husband's family friend learned that we had never had peking duck before, so they made a reservation at Sun Wah immediately to introduce us to this delicious meal. Bear in mind that they live in Hawthorn Woods so it's a bit of a trek for them, but this is THE place in Chicago to get peking duck. We were told that they pre-ordered the peking duck when they made the reservation - I guess the restaurant can run out if you don't pre-order? So the next time we visit, we will make sure to pre-order. The place was packed so we were especially glad that we had secured our 2 ducks beforehand. The ducks are carved tableside and then served with little bao buns/hoisin sauce/veggies/pickled radish so you can make heavenly duck sandwiches. I don't even usually like duck, but this duck is frankly amazing. Then the waiter takes the duck back to the kitchen and out comes soup, rice, and noodles all made with the rest of the duck. Of the three, my husband and I liked the noodles the best because they were the most flavorful. I didn't love the soup and the rice was just so so. But it doesn't matter. You come here for the little amazing do-it-yourself duck sandwiches. And they are definitely amazing!
