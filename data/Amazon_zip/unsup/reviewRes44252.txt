Okay, true about the loud music in the bathroom, but that is offset by their great hand soap. They have the pink soap that they may use in hospitals, or at least they should use in hospitals because it makes your hands feel and smell very clean. As for the food, it is also very good from the miso soup to the rolls (the peter parker spider roll is the best, followed by the tempura shitaki roll). The wait staff is pretty good, but I am not going to brag about the service, it was just average. The best part is that it is a BYOB, not that I have to drink bottles and bottles of wine with dinner, but sometimes it is nice to have that option. Or even a BOX of wine if I choose.
