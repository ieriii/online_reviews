I'm not going to beat around the bush, get really flowery and emotional, or do any of that unnecessary stuff. suffice it to say that Longman & Eagle is the be all and end all of gastro-pubbery; a scenester, whisky drinkin, foodie bliss. It's hip, inventive, has a good crowd (sometimes a huge crowd), and everything they do, they do well. I was here for dinner and everything I ate was amazing, from hand-rolled pasta, to home-made spreads. I also drank a fair amount from their extensive whisky and wine selections. Drinks were reasonably priced and great as well. There's a reason this place is recommended by the Chicago Michelin Guide. But don't take my word for it, go do yourself a favor and find out.
