The pasta here is fantastic. Its all handmade, and you can tell. I've had the Chicken Tortellini and the Lobster Ravoli - both were cooked perfectly. The menu is always changing, but the ingredients stay constant. Service is great (all four times I have visited)  I would have given it five stars except for the weak wine menu by the glass (bottle menu is extensive). Also, its a bit of tight squeeze in there. All in all, this place is a great italian restaurant and I would highly recommend it...enjoy.
