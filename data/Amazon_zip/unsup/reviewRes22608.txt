We made a reservation, but waited as long or longer than people who didn't. That was really frustrating! If you don't actually take reservations, then say so-- don't agree to take a reservation and then make me wait almost an hour for my table. We did go on a Friday night, which was incredibly busy. Once we got seated, though, everything was great. The service was good if not exemplary, and our food was right and ready quickly. But best of all, everyone was so grumpy after all the waiting... until the first bite. Everyone agreed that the food was fantastic and we'd all come back again, even after the wait. Plus, it is very easy to eat gluten free here. Most things on the menu are naturally GF! Their wine list is not great, though, so you know. Oh, and get the saganaki. Can't go wrong with flaming cheese.
