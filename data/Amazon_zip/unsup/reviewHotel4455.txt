The hotel in general is a bit of a mixed bag. On the plus side as other reviewers have stated the hotel is absolutely gorgeous and truly reflects the early gilded age luxury it was built for. The staff are friendly and helpful, and the bartenders are more than willing to get a little creative if need be. Unfortunately the luxury aesthetics of the hotel are reflected by its price tag, the rooms start at $200 a night and go up, the food in the restaurant is top-notch but also top-tier, same for the bar and other amenities such as $18/stay internet. Unfortunately there is also no wireless within the rooms and cell phone signal is non-existant within most of the building, both of these are probably factored in by the fact that the building has quite a bit of marble in the interior which will block both of these signals. Staying in downtown chicago I thought there would be a good variety of selection for food, however outside of a pizza place one block away, and a hot dog place 5 blocks away everything consisted of the same recurrent chains every block - you will see at least one of these every 2 blocks: subway, mcdonalds, 7/11, cvs, starbucks - outside of that and the two independently run places i mentioned earlier the closest thing is a trip to the greek section which is about 2 miles away.
