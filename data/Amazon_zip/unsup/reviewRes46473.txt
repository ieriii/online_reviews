Best restaurant in Lincoln Park! My husband and I used to live down the block and we ate here EVERY week! :) Our staple meal was the buffalo chicken nachos, buffalo chicken wraps & pitcher of Blue Moon. We hadn't been back in years, and upon recently traveling to Chicago, we decided to revisit our favorite restaurant! My husband and I are both vegetarians now.. so they made a "veggie" version of the buffalo chicken nachos/wraps - and it was delicious! I'd also like to give a shout out to our waiter, Sean, who surprised us with their decadent chocolate chip cookie/icecream dessert. Mmmmm! Thanks so much! We can't wait to return during our next trip to Chicago!
