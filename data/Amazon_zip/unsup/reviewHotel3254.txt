Great place to stay in Chicago. Right on Michigan Avenue right near the Chicago River. Walking distance to many of Chicago's downtown attractions. Easy public transportation near by with the train and bus system. Cabs everywhere you turn around. We had a king bed room with a view. It was a corner room so I am not sure if they are bigger than the other rooms. Noise was not a problem. Housekeeping service was great with room cleaned and bed made daily. Didn't use any of the hotel restaurants or room service so can't comment on that. The front desk was great at customer service and Scott the concierge was A+. If you can get a good rate then I would highly recommend The Hard Rock in Chicago. We also got free wi-fi thru an online booking promo.
