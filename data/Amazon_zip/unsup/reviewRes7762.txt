In my opinion, this is the best italian place I have been to in the city(and I have been to a fair amount of them). Portions are big, but not ridiculous and the servce is very good. Outside seating area is great. The halibut and the salmon are awesome as is the Fruita de mare (99% sure I spelled that wrong). Its a pretty solid crowd and would highly reccomend it for a date or dinner with friends or parents in town.
