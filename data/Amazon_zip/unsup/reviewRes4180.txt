This is my first ever yelp review and it couldn't be more fitting that it belongs to Schwa. Had dinner there last night. First off, a huge thanks to Michael Carlson and his chefs. The guys are brilliant and it was some of the best service I have ever had. They never missed marking silver or filling a glass. We were in a party of 6 too and we never had to ask for anything or pour ourselves wine. The food was spot on. Extremely technically sound and brilliantly presented. You are missing out tremendously if you don't dine there soon.
