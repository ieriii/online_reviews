Delicious portobello eggs benedict. I was very impressed by their eggs benedict selection, they probably have 6-8 kinds on their menu. Got here around 1:30 on a Sunday and only had to wait about 25 minutes which isn't bad for a brunch place. I think I'll definitely be back to try more menu options. Only downside to this place I found was that they didn't have any quarters to give us for the meters. Businesses should really plan ahead for this thing especially with the huge meter price hike.
