This review is for pizza that was delivered to Los Angeles. Pepperoni & Spinach 11" deep dish pizzas. I'm not sure if the crust got funky after being in transit on dry ice, but after we baked them, the crust was super crunchy. Now, before you go on and say I overcooked it, I followed instructions. 375 for 40 minutes. They said 35-45, so I went over/under. When the pizzas were removed, they looked good, but when my pizza cutter hit the crust, it was like WTF. The pepperoni was weak. Barely any pepperoni and it could've really used a lot more cheese and sauce. Spinach was better, but again, the crusts were so dang crunchy. It was like biting into an old biscuit or something. I have no idea what went wrong. I have had pizza delivered from Lou Malnati's and that was bomb dizzle. In fact, I will go write a review for them now.
