Just read the other reviews, and agree with them - you may as well, since you won't find a better burger, a better wait staff, a more competent management. I'm telling you: there's stuff happening at this place that you'll never know about, but you will love throwing a fantasy here and there as you watch exotic, beautiful women talking to men less attractive but probably employed. Assignations? I'd bet. Ah... to be younger and have more teeth.... When was the last time a waiter told you to take the less expensive burger - and the reasons were cogent, thoughtful? Oh... that Scotch egg thing - fabulous. The dessert menu? So good you could chant it and get donations. Try it.
