This is my favorite place to go in Chicago. I am an oyster fanatic, and in my opinion they have the freshest and largest selection of oysters in the city. I try and go as much as I can. I recommend the oyster bar over the actual restaurant, but thats just me. It is a very laid back atmosphere in there. They have live music some nights, and the bartenders are remarkably friendly and professional. If you like oysters you have to go here!
