The beer list at this place is among the most impressive that I've ever seen. Being a bit overwhelmed by the sheer quantity available (and the quantity that sounded good), I asked my server for a recommendation. What I got was the most delicious beer I've ever drank, I forget the name, but it was one of the Belgian drafts. The food was also top notch. I'm always a big fan of a place that has different options, apart from your typical burger, pizza, chicken tenders selection. I started with the butternut squash soup (which I can never resist when it's offered), and it was quite good, the flavor was incredible, although it was a bit thicker than what I've had in the past. I ordered the monkfish for my entree, a super delicious dish, which actually got better with each bite. If you are a good, unique dinner, or just a few beers after work, come to Hopleaf, you won't regret it!
