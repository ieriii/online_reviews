A new favorite for brunch stops! Great location, nice decor, awesome menu. Bright and airy without being offensive. Rarely do I find a restaurant where I can't decide between three different entrees for breakfast! And it was quick service without wanting to push us out the door, no more than 5-10 minutes after we ordered were we looking at our dishes in front of us. The menu in the restaurant was better than what was listed on line. Both choices of healthy or comfort food were available and sounded great. Even an "Iron Man" egg plate. I had the corn beef and hash with eggs and my friend had the fitatta. I cleaned my plate and was eyeing my friends skillet. I will definitely keep this on my short list of brunch spots and try to see my friends in the south loop more for brunch just to go here.
