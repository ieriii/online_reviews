When Big Jones opened, I was really excited to see something different in the neighborhood. However, when I actually ate there, I was a little disappointed - granted they had just opened, so the owners were working through the typical new restaurant kinks.  Anyhow, I had the Fried Green Tomato BLT and it wasn't very good. The tomatoes were mushy and the breading was too salty. I will say that my dinner companion had the burger and it was very good - the meat was flavorful and juicy.  I am not sure if I will go back to Big Jones anytime soon, but if I was looking for a great place to have an upscale burger, Big Jones might hit my radar.
