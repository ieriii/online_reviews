We stayed at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel & Towers from Thurs 10/23-Sun 10/25/09. It looks nice on the outside & lobby. We had a room on the 26th Floor - I thought was ok, kinda old. Room has a king size bed, single cup coffee maker to make Starbuck's ground coffee or Earl Grey or Herbal tea (from bag), alarm clock, 1 TV, 3 chairs & 1 small couch. Bathroom: Shower/tub, 1 sink, hair dryer, tiny bottles of Shine by Bliss Mandarin & Mint Shampoo, Conditioner, Lotion exclusively for Sheraton. Nice view of the Chicago River & Lake Michigan. There's several places to eat in the Sheraton. We didn't look around. Something about a Burger Bar, Bar for drinks, Steak place, Cafe. Evil: Local call were $1.75 ea. On our bill before leaving it said $2! Walking distance to Magnificent Mile, grocery stores: Fox & Obel, & Dominicks.
