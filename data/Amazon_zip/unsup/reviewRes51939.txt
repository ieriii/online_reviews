A little better than Lou Malnati's, not as good as Uno's. I'm very particular about the integrity of the crust and this one was just a little too hard/crunchy for me. I like more flaky, butter crusts better. Got spinach and cheese (I don't eat meat) and those were both great. Sauce was good. Atmosphere was casual with graffiti all over the walls -- good for hanging out with friends, drinking at the bar, etc. Good, but not the best.
