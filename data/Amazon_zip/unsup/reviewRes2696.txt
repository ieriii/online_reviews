My husband and I decided to make reservations at Tru to use our Let Us Entertain You points for a nice fine dining experience. The food was great and the service was EXCELLENT. The decor is modern and sleek, however the scene is a bit older though thankfully not super stuffy (except for the terrible couple a few tables away from us who complained loudly about EVERYTHING attempting to ruin the experience for everyone around them.) We chose to go with the 6 course meal and added the cheese course and wine pairing. I was really impressed with the pairing - some excellent wines! The food was very good though not overly imaginative. I enjoyed every course though there wasn't a clear stand out. I recommend adding the cheese course for any cheese lover out there like me. They bring out a cart of cheese and let you pick out as much as you want to sample. They do the same thing for dessert which is kind of fun. I would recommend this place if you are looking for a nice, romantic meal and won't have sticker shock with $500+ dinner bill.
