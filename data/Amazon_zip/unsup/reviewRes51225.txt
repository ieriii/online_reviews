here's what makes wishbones so great: best corn muffins, best sides all-around, best bloody mary's in chicago, (really!!) and best seafood chowder. also, i love their blackened chicken. have it with their special greens salad with the lemon tahini dressing. ok i see all the mixed reviews about their service. service is sometimes slow or spotty, most times it's great. prices are great for the quality of food.
