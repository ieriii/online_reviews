This place is so unique and refreshing.  I went on a Friday night and the place was packed. You wait in a line to order your food and by the time you order they have a table ready for you. I got a pork belly meal-in-a-bowl which was absolutely fabulous. A really rich broth with a ton of noodles and a good portion of fried pork belly on top.They have a great variety of drinks to go with your meal(beer, tea, melted chocolate).  The prices aren't cheap, but worth it for the food you get. Meals are about $13-15. For the quality of the meal, I think it's totally worth it. However, it's not a formal sit-down meal. It's definitely a more casual dining experience.
