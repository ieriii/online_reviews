I cheated on my favorite breakfast restaurant, and I liked it. I know I should feel bad, but I just don't. I went to Meli Cafe, and well, I fell in love. Despite the 20 minute wait, and the fact that they didn't have any hot coffee ready when we sat down because it was still brewing, I love this place. The food was AMAZING.  This is by far the best breakfast place that I've eaten at in Chicago. And the gift of amazing food kept on giving after I left. See I normally don't take breakfast food home, but it was too good to leave on the plate just to be thrown away, so I took it home. And I'm glad I did, because it made a lovely late afternoon snack. And I also bought a jar of their marmalade, and the next morning I had the best toast I've ever had in life. I will be back again, and again, and again. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because they ran out of coffee which I thought was impossible at a breakfast joint, and the table we were seated at was between 2 aisles, so I felt like I was sitting in the middle of a airport runway. But I will go back and I am confident I will have a perfect experience next time.
