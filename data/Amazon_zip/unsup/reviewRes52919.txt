Making my way downtown (err...Logan Square) Walking fast (since they don't take reservations) Faces passed And I'm home bound Staring blankly ahead Just making my way Making my way Through the crowd And I need you And I miss you And now I wonder.... If I could fall Into the sky Do you think time Would pass me by 'Cause you know I'd walk (90) miles If I could Just see you Tonight lyrics to Thousand Miles by Vanessa Carlton...no one else could have sung it better=) ***************************************************************** 90 Miles has officially wooed me. The cool sounds of Cuban music send good vibrations my way as I walk into this intimate cafe. How could I not swoon over the beautiful heated outdoor patio (tastefully tented) complete with strung up lights, hanging topiaries, working fireplace, and plush white love seat in the corner. Perfect setting for a hot date or a get together with a handful of spicy ladies. The latter was the case that night for me. 4 ladies dining. 2 coming from the burbs. So the other two did some waiting around for about half an hour without feeling rushed to order or rushed out when the rest of our party finally arrived.   Food was haaaaa-mazing and, be warned, a bit gas inducing as well (TMI, I know and I apologize) but deliciously worth it. The last time I had rice & beans this good was in Puerto Rico. I ordered the Ropa Vieja ($11.95) which came with rice, black beans & sweet fried plantains. My shredded pork was bursting with flavor and I could not believe how tender they cooked it. Portions here are more than generous so expect to take a doggy bag home too. Service here really blew my mind. Every server was coming around asking if we needed anything, how our food was, etc. So it was actually hard to tell which one was our waiter! At the end of our meal, Harry, owner/manager?, came by to chat & we found out that they'll be expanding to the house next door.  This is a great BYOB joint. There's a CVS on Armitage & Milwaukee (a block away) for liquor needs. Will definitely bring in a bottle of rum next time to try their mojitos!
