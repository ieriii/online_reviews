That is the longest I've ever waited and the most I've ever paid for a hot dog, but it was well worth it.  The elk and cheddar was nothing really special, besides the novelty of eating elk. Foie Gras Duck Dog (sounds like a science experiment gone wrong) was better. While the crayfish and pork sausage w/ cajun remoulade and creamy goat cheese was phenomenal!!!!  It has to be the best dog I've ever eaten in my life! Food was amazing, just hate the long lines and short business hours.
