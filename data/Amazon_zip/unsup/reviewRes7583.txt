It is definitely a good place for meat lovers. I went there during lunch time so it is cheaper than dinner. I'm not sure the lunch menu is the same as dinner. The salad bar was good. They even provided smoked salmon and it was delicious. Also, there were different veggies there you can go with. There is a paper coaster for each person and you just need to flip over to the green side and the waiters wil come to you and cut different kinds of meat for you. Honestly, these meat are a little bit salty, so it is easy to get tired with. Don't drink water too much otherwise your stomach will be filled quickly. If they can provide fruit or dessert on salad bar, that would be much better. But overall, it is a still a good restaurant and an interesting place to go.
