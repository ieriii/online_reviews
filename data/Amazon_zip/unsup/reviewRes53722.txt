An actually ode to marketing rather than food. About 45-60 people an hour move at a glacial pace creating a line for -- a hot dog and fries? Hmmm, and I bet you all wouldn't even be talking about this place if they moved people faster and had let's say 5 people in line. The story is the line and if this place is so popular why don't they address the ridiculously slow pace. Years in the restaurant business has taught me that hype is king. Too bad I really wanted to like this place. Tourists and people taking pictures of themselves standing in line. What's next bread lines?
