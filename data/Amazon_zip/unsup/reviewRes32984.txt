We ordered some hummus, chicken soup, lentil soup and 2 chicken shawarma sandwiches. The hummus tasted horrible. It may have actually been bad and soured. We had one bit and didn't eat anymore. The chicken soup was so salty it was not edible. The lentil soup was pretty good. The shawarma sandwiches were on par with some of the other shawarma sandwiches I've had here in Chicago. They were mediocre at best. Suggestion #1 for Sultan's Market: TASTE THE FOOD BEFORE YOU SERVE IT Suggestion #2 for the chef at Sultan's Market (and every other chef in Chicago that is cooking middle eastern food). Drive over to Dearborn MI and check out the middle eastern restaurants in Dearborn. Dearborn boasts the largest middle eastern population in the world, outside of the Middle East. You will find the best middle eastern food in the country in Dearborn. LaShish is considered one of the best of the best. Go check out their shawarma sandwich. If you can come close to what they are doing, you will be serving the best shawarma sandwiches in all of Chicago.
