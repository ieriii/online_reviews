Yes, you will probably have to wait. This is what happens when somewhere special also happens to be on the busiest shopping/tourist street in the city. They're happy to serve you wine while you wait outside, which is probably a more pleasant experience during a warm summer evening than it would be in cold weather. Have you ever eaten balsamic braised pig's tail? The flavor is similar to oxtail, and the texture close to short rib. Ever had to spit out a whole tail vertebrae when you didn't realize it still had bones in it? Have you ever spooned bone marrow from the center of a roasted bone, spread it on toast and sprinkled it with salt? Have you ever devoured half a pound or so of incredible pork liver pate? If not, you should. You must. Just don't do it the day before you have a cholesterol test. This is a place for new food experiences, but it's not just about the meat. They have some great vegetable/cheese-based dishes too (beets, corn etc.). The menu is mainly small plates, idea for sharing, which makes it a perfect place to try things you haven't had before.
