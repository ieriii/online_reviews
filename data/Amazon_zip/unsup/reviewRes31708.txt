Nothing fantastic. Pretty bland. Considering it was organic, I expected something more (taste wise). We were the first ones there in the morning. Our waitress was not too bright (at 8:00am she's telling me the lunch special). Wha? Bussers were pushy. I can't understand why, we were the only ones there (they weren't busy). Ordered one of breakfast specials, biscuit's and gravy, more like gross and gravy. Easy over eggs on top of biscuits and gravy w/some sort of mushroom and peas sautd concoction. It tasted like Thanksgiving dinner rolling around in your mouth, ewe! No thank you. Would I ever go back? No way Jose! Clark's Diner is way better (taste wise)(and cheaper). Lot's more variety and flavor. Although, I still enjoy Maple Leaf Cafe on Taylor street.
