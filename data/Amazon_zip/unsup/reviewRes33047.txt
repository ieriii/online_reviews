The food was delicious, the the service was excellent! The owner, Branko (sorry if I misspelled) greeted us warmly and seated us himself. The menu was well laid out and not overwhelming. We went on a Tuesday night so it wasn't very busy. Service was timely, and the staff was knowledgable. The only draw back was that it was clear that someone had smoked in both bathrooms.
