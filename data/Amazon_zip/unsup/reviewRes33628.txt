come on people!!! This is average middle eastern food. Everything is pre-made in large quantities and it lacks flavor. The lentil soup is okay, tastes bland. The meat is not very seasoned. I want to like this place, I live down the street. I've eaten here ten times in the past 18months, but this spot is just AVERAGE. For much better middle eastern you are better off going to Babylon. My wife and I just discovered Babylon and it blows this place away. The food tastes made to order and the ingredients are fresh. Maybe it was okay to rave about Sultans when there was no other option, but check out Babylon after you try this place and I bet my life you wont eat here again.
