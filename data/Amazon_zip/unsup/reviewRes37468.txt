I must admit, when I first looked at the menu here I was a little taken aback. There were some things that just sounded weird. A duck reuben, CB&J, Octopus? I played it safe and got the soup, which was split pea and ham. Very tasty, but not as good as my moms. Since those that were with me were more adventurous than I was, I got to sample some different things though. The duck reuben is indeed delicious. While I love duck, I had my doubts about its pairing with sauerkraut. They blended very well though. It's something I would order in the future. I was also a fan of their mac and cheese, although I think you either like it or really hate it. They use some weird type of cheese that was described to me as "very strong, english blue cheese." If that's not your cup of tea, I would avoid it. Their selection of beers is amazing. Since I had just spent about 4 hours drinking mimosas though I didn't feel the need to have any beer at that point. Since I like this place and plan on returning, I'm sure I'll sample their beers then.
