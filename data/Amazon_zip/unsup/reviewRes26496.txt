After looking on Yelp for a good Mexican spot in Chicago, I was instantly drawn to Nuevo Leon's high ratings and decided to check it out. I came with my brother for lunch and loved it! First, our waiter brought us chips with two types of salsa and this free appetizer which consisted of a soft tortilla wrapped around potatoes and I think beef? My brother then had the burrito and I had the combinacion, each of which only cost $6. My brother liked his burrito, which was massive, and I especially liked the taco and tostada on my plate. The enchilada wasn't my favorite and the tamale was okay, but all in all, the food was great. And you really can't beat the prices. The food came quickly and our waiter was super smiley and nice. Although you just pay at the counter and most people weren't tipping, we made sure to tip him. All in all, a great experience. I'll be sure to return next time I'm in Chicago.
