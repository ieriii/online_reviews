Have been meaning to go to Irazu forever and kept on putting it off. The food igoth my. We had chifrijtos and pipitos with avocado, both were good. The only downfall was that the steak on our sandwiches was considerably over cooked. The wait for the food was beyond long and the service left us feeling ignored. My rating is an overall review but, the oatmeal banana milkshake is 5-star all the way.
