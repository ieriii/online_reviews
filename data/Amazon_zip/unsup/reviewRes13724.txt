RBC could well be my new happy place. Yummy food (for cheeeeap!) and delightful beers served by the sweetest server in a lovely, low-key dining room all makes this girl positively beam. Beers I tried: --Bottom Up Belgian Wit: Orange-y and marvelous. Like a Blue Moon done all growed up. --Iron Fist Pale Ale: Hoppy and lovely. --The Whip: Even hoppier and yummier. This was my favorite. The menu swore it'd lash my tongue. Consider my tongue lashed. YUM. Couldn't resist the bacon popcorn, so we started with that. Y.U.M. Pulled pork for me was quite tasty with its jalapano-laced slaw all crammed in a delicious roll. The highlight of my meal was certainly the cream cheesy garlic mashed potatoes. So. Amazing. Really. A bite of the goat cheese croquette salad assured me they can style up greens and the Smokehouse burger (beef AND pulled pork...YUM) was pretty much marvelous. So, yeah, I ate like a fat kid, but if you're gonna do it, do it big. Here you can do it big. Prices are very reasonable for the quality of food, too. And beers aren't too bad either. I definitely look forward to a return trip...the mussels are calling my name! More beer too, of course. (Would it be gross if I ordered those mashed potatoes, mussels and lots of beer? Never mind. Forget I asked that. I don't care what anyone thinks. Doing it.)
