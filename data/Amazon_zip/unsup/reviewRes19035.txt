A very extensive beer menu. I wish I hadn't eaten before going here so I could try the burgers. I did order some fries which were good. The atmosphere is nice and clean with some cool pieces of art. I was here on a Monday for a friends birthday. It was nice and empty and service was good, even when we knocked a full glass of water all over the place. I would go back because of the beer selection.
