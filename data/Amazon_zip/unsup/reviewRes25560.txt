I thought I was a foodie, but maybe I'm not. Sure being a foodie is about the food. But its also about the culture, its about the restaurants, its about the locales and its about the Chefs and the restauranteurs -- Essentially too much obsessive info for my ADD brain. Enter Jose Garces, this guy is huge in the food world. Classically trained, latin-global cuisine perspectives; 4 successful restaurants in philly. Iron-Chef winner and has a restaurant 4 blocks away from me! Sweet. So without even tasting the food, I root for this guy already. Just had brunch but was very pleased. I opted for yet another eggs benedict variation (Such a sucker for these) - Tuffle hollandaise (list truffle as an ingredient and I'm a sucker for that too), over poached eggs, chorizo and a perfect rectangle of chiabatta toast - Simple, sophisticated twist, great balance and delicious. The sea bass tapa was very delicate and compex - intentionally unsubstanial and the french toast i sampled was made unique by a fresh berry compote and cheese. Some things you should note when you go here that the portions are small and the prices are up there, tapas or entrees. This is the kinda place where I want to sample a lot so unfortunately I must save up to eat here again.  The locale - its well, in the middle of nowhere. It is by me after all. Ok, if I'm being honest its on the south part of michigan right next to grant park, a few blocks away from the lake, a few blocks south of the art museum, millennium park and the rest of commerical michigan ave as we know it. Its a good food stop for the sophisticated day planner and/or tourist. So now i just gotta get my food & wine subscription mailed, keep watching (more) bravo/foot network/travel channel until I inevitably get bored and refocus on the pure simplicity of just getting food into my belly~ south siiide!
