Went into Milk and Honey last Sunday with friends and it was PACKED. Now, the space isn't exactly the biggest, but every table was taken nonetheless. That's always a good sign.Onto the food -- my friend and I split the Bagel with lox and cream cheese and it was really great. The cream cheese looked like it was homemade with chives and came with red onions, tomatoes, cucumbers and capers -- all of my favorite things! My friend got the huevos rancheros and we both really thought it left A LOT to be desired. It generally lacked seasoning and flavor which was shocking from such a would-be flavorful dish!We would definitely return for coffee and the bagel and lox but, although the waitstaff was friendly, we felt service could be improved.
