I went here with the impression that this was some sort of "gastro pub", which is exciting since it is kinda the new restaurant trend especially in the UK.  The beer was amazing, but they are not brewing it, so how can you rate that? I mean, they do a good job of sourcing the stuff and serving it to you. The food was poor though. The menu sounded daring and actually pretty impressive, but the execution and final flavor was lacking.  Mussels were pretty good. Nothing too insanely great though. And quite a few unopened shells, which means, dead when cooked, not fun. This is something that should not be happening when they are rather expensive.  Our entrees were bordering on not good. I was just so hungry! I got a brisket sandwich, which had SO much dense fat on it. I had to pull off about a third of the total volume of "animal product" which was actually fat. I know how to make a brisket and the fat should dissolve, or be cut out. The bread was hard and abrasive to eat. The spread was boring and just mustard. The frittes and the aioli was super YUM though.  My bf and friend both were under-impressed with their CBJ and spinach feta fritter. I tasted both and they were kinda not good. The CBJ was super heavy, especially given that you got fries and mac and cheese as well. Too much fatty fat. But not good flavor either, because if there is a lot of fat in something that tastes delish then who wouldn't want to chow on it?? The fritter def needed some more flavor and something fresh to counteract the super heaviness of it. I really wanted to like this place. I gives me hope that my resto that I will open soon....will be the bomb!
