1 1/2 hour wait on a Saturday night. Highlights were Juliet & Romeo and the Part & Parcel. Low lights were some whiskey drink and the golden cage. Discovered I'm not a fan of egg whites in drinks, makes them too foamy for my taste. Also they accidentally sent our donuts to another table and we had to wait another 30 minutes for 3 puny donuts. The atmosphere inside is classy and nice but guess overall it just wasn't my style. I've had better cocktail at other places, especially Lynn House' when she was at GE. Super Highlight of the Night: a girl and a guy getting naked in a super bright room above Damen Ave with the shades up. There was a group of us watching them and commenting. Pretty hilarious. SUPER low point: spending well over an hour in the tiny claustrophobic holding cell.
