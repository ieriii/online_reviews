Meh... Maybe I'm just not that big a fan of deep dish pizza, but I was pretty underwhelmed by this place. I think part of it was I asked for a to go order and for reasons that are a mystery to me, they don't call your number when your order is ready. They just tell you to come back at a certain time - which for me, was 45 minutes. So after 45 minutes of sitting in the waiting area, I went to check on my order and it was ready - and apparently had been for some time. I ended up with a luke warm pizza. Not very exciting. Why on earth they don't just call your order number when your pizza is up is beyond me.  In any case, beyond the lukewarm pizza, there were also the less than friendly cashiers. They seemed like they wanted to be anywhere else rather than there.  All in all, I wouldn't go back.......
