First and foremost you need to realize that Gino's East is known for their DEEP DISH PIZZA, and NOT THEIR PASTA. Don't let the staff/waiter(ess) discourage you with the 45 minute cooking time for the pizza. If you waited 40+ minutes in line to get a table, you better make sure it is for something that is worthwhile. I was with friends who came to visit Chicago and heard about the pizza. I was unable to stand with them in line because I was at work, but told them I would meet them as soon as I got out. Unfortunately, I was not there to offer them some "local" advice because when I arrive they were seated and told me they were really hungary and couldn't wait and so they ordered the pasta. Well I never had their pasta because I always came for the deep dish. And so I joined along and ordered their angel hair pasta, which sad to say, I was deeply disappointed, and so were my friends and their pasta dishes. Oh well, lesson learned. My advice: If you are going to any restaurant that are known for a particular dish or specialty, go for what they are known for, otherwise, you miss out. And oh, YES to their DEEP DISH PIZZA.....NO to their PASTA.
