I must say, I don't know WHERE all these poor reviews are coming from, fellow Yelpers! I took my fiance here last night for his birthday, and we both had GREAT food and GREAT service. This is what you all have to do: order from the special "Fall Back" price fixed menu. It is an amazing deal, and I'm serious - seriously awesome food. We had 5:30pm reservations on a Friday night, which I recommend, because though it wasn't crowded, I got the impression most of the tables were reserved. We were seated promptly, and our waiter came right over. After the fancy steak presentation, we asked for the special menu (you have to be "in the know" and ask for it, so thanks for the tip, Yelpers). The food was amazing, everything from salad and soup to dessert. My steak was like heaven. But I must say, my favorite part was either the mac and cheese that they serve as a side, or the PHENOMENAL DESSERTS. Pumpkin cheesecake? It was like NOTHING I've ever sampled before in my life. Seriously, for $20 each for a three course dinner in a fancy place, Kinzie's Chop House cannot be beat! Get your ass their pronto if you have something to celebrate!
