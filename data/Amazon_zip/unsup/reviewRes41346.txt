Came here for the no-menu Sunday, Groupon in hand. Consensus: Definitely five-star even considering the fact that I could have gotten 9 burritos for the cost of my meal. And considering how much I love Chipotle, THAT is a compliment indeed. Let's break it down: 1) Ample street parking about a minute away from the restaurant: YES. 2) Small, homey little place where there's a coat rack instead of a coat check? Sign me up. 3) Sit anywhere? Don't mind if I do. 4) Wonderfully soft-spoken server who magically appears whenever our wine glasses dip low, and who describes all of our dishes like she's reciting poetry. 5) SALAD: Eggs benedict over the most delicious crouton I have ever had in my life. And oh God, that gnocchi. I swear I can inhale that and make Bonsoiree my dealer. 6) SOUP: Mushroom soup with truffle oil 7) ENTREE: A trifecta of carnivorous delights: scallops, barramundi, and a ravioli stuffed with short ribs. 8) DESSERT: Banana bread pudding. Discovered that I really don't do salty ice cream, but that pudding/bread was heavenly. 9) Lastly, got the check. Pleasantly surprised, as had forgotten how much alcohol at a normal restaurant would ratchet up the final bill. Love the BYOB aspect of this place. All in all, the meal took about two hours. The food came out a little slower than some of the other restaurants I've been to, but it was well worth the time. The cozy nature of the place, plus the fact that you can see straight into the kitchen, made me feel like I was at a nice dinner party in my own apartment. Very romantic. Finally, something I realized I really liked about the no-menu Sunday is that you and the person you're with all get the same food, so there's no envious can-I-try-some-of-that. Plus, it gives you an obvious topic of conversation.
