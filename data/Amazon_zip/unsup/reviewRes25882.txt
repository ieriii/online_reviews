By far the BEST in town! This is NOT only the ONLY good Chicago Style Pizza in we had while in Chicago it was sooooooo good we went back again before leaving town. Never have been a deep styled pizza lover and BOY do I LOVE ME SOME PIZZA! Went to Pequod's on the recommendation of a friend who used to live there and I must say he was right! We sampled as all of the USUAL PEOPLE DO both the UNO & LOU whomever he is chain and they didn't even come close. This place made a believer in deep dish out of me! SERVICE was great and a bit of a wait but well worth it!
