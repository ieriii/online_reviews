Greek Islands has the best food in Greek town, hands down. Everyone who has been to Greece knows that while Athens has its undiscovered treasures, it is the Islands such as Paros, Naxos and Aegina that have the very best food. Greek Islands takes after their lead. Their waitstaff is Greek and many of them speak Greek as well. The food is authentic in many areas, but particularly their seafood. The Gyros dish is predictably Americanized, but getting a good Souvlaki in America is almost impossible anyway! Their calamari is crisp and fresh, perfect with just a squeeze of lemon. I would highly recommend any of their fish dishes for someone wishing to have an excellent meal and a taste of Greece. They make strike some less adventurous palates as "odd" or even unappealing though, as they are more traditionally Greek. They cater very will to large parties and their Kolokithakia (fried Zucchini) with Scorldia (garlic paste) is AMAZING.
