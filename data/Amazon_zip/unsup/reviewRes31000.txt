We ate at Mastro's on Friday night. Nice looking place, jammed with people! Was hoping that it was because of great food that everyone was there and not just because it's new.  Well, that wasn't the case. The service was upsell, upsell, upsell and the food was not very good, especially for the prices. The drinks and wine were very expensive. (Compared to other restaurants in a similar price point, they were HIGH!) The food definitely doesn't warrant the price tag. As for the wine, I say if it's so much less expensive in a similar atmosphere, why go to Mastro's? Our food was pedestrian, comparable to Gibsons, nothing special. The two items that were a huge disappointment were the mashed potatoes and the creamed corn. The creamed corn was frozen corn! It had huge kernels and was just awful! The mashed potatoes were dry as can be. We tried two different ones (wasabi and garlic) and both were so dry I had to drink water just to swallow. I won't be going back, and know there are much better options out there!
