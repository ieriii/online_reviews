I am Korean, and love our way to cook meats with charcoal and table grills, went there with my Korean frd, we both agreed the meat is so tender, the BBQ sauce was great, the marinated Kalbi served with little side dishes & veggies( think more than 10 different kinds) is most recommended, service is not as good as the food, but always nice to ask refill the little dishes as much as you want, that's the best thing in Korean culture, too! but don't forget good tips...the Korean little-old ladies were little scary....
