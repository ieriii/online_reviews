I have been on a quest searching for my favorite deep dish pizza since I moved to the city last month. So far, I have been to Pequod's, Lou Malnati's, Uno, Due, Homemade Pizza, Piece, and My Pie. And I must say that Giordano's with it's stuffed cheese filling has won my vote for the best pizza that I have had in the city (so far). This is definitely one of the spots I will be taking visiting friends and family. One bit of advice, don't order anything larger than medium for two since these slices will fill you up quick.
