I read someone else's review and she said that when you come into the dining room, you feel like you want to say "TAHDAH". She's right. That's exactly how that room makes you feel. A friend and I came in for lunch, but if I remember correctly, this was the last thing I ate that day.  We ordered the chips and guac as an appitizer, and, WOW. They were the best chips and guac I've had in my life. The chips were fresh, and deep fried deliciousness and the guac was pretty limey, but perfect. Man I've been thinking about this combo since I've been there.  For lunch we both had the Arrachera, as it was recommended by the server. It was amazing! The skirt steak was tender and the chimichurri was very flavorful. The bed of rice and beans the steak was on wasn't so great; the beans could have been cooked a little more and there wasn't too much flavor to it. We ordered dessert too, I got the ice cream with chocolate cake, and he ordered the ice cream cake-a huge tower of raspberry, pistachio, and mango ice cream, which the server made a production of pouring caramel all over it. Both we equally delicious. The bill came out to $115, with all that and 5 glasses of wine between us. If someone else was buying, I'd definitely go back.
