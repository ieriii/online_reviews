Sorry.........apparently I don't get it. So I wont b mean as obviously pizza as we all know- comes in a variety of types, sizes, styles etc. I ordered the stuffed pizza w/mozzarella & spinach/sauce. It actually looks like a pie- like a dessert pie but with savory filling rather than fruit. Strange! I couldn't even get thru the 1st piece. I am a Neapolitan east coast pizza freak- thin, wood fired, no frozen ingredients, made to order. Period. But, the service was excellent, nice beer choices, OK salad.
