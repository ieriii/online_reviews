Went here for lunch today since we have lived here 3 years now and have not gone to any of the Greek restaurants. We wanted to do something different. I like Geek food. We walked in and got seated right away. Waiters and bus boys all over the place that we got our water and bread fast! I already knew what i wanted, but we had to wait for the old curmudgeon to finish talking to the other curmudgeons, before he came over to get our order. We ordered Saganaki, split the greek salad, and 2 lunch specials. The chicken roll was like spanakoptia with the addition of chicken rolled in phylo. The hubby ordered a lamb sandwich which was similar to a french dip only greek style. The food was ok. The service was blah. The waiters hovered, but never asked how things were, they just hovered. It was annoying. Back and forth, looking at the table with frowns on their faces. It made me want to get out of the ASAP after we finished eating, which was good since i spent the rest of the day running to the bathroom. ugh The Greek Festival the Church pust on behind my house once a year served better happier food.
