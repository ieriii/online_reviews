I really wish I could offer a good review, especially after reading past reviews. However, when they call you on a Saturday afternoon to essentially say they don't feel like opening up that night, they should expect some knocks. Schwa, be quirky all you want - don't pick up your phone and only open when you feel like it - just don't expect that I'll ever be a customer.
