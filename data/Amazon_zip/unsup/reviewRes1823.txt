It just doesn't get better than this as far as hot dog/fries type places go. Sure you'll probably have to wait in line and rush to get there before it closes mid day, but it is all worth it. Oh, and much like others have said, Doug is a really nice guy. Just be sure to check if he's on vacation/open before you make the trek over there. Doug has to be feeling pretty good about all the free publicity he got from the Foie gras scandal. The ticket was well worth it, I'm sure.
