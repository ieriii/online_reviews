So where to begin? Great pizza, i mean great! sometimes the people working are shitty, i should say only one girl. The brunette girl has an attitude and doesn't tell you about the buy two slices get a free drink deal either which makes you feel like crap later. the owner one day literally chased me and my friend down the street, now i mean we had been walking for a good block by this point. And the reason was i asked for parm on the side and they forgot to give it to me. I mean a free condiment he chased us down for, now if that isn't passion for what you do then i don't know what is!! Fogo YOU HAVE A CUSTOMER FOR LIFE!
