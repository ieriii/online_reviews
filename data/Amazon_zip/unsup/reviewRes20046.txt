Love this place! The sushi is soooo good, especially for the price. It's a great place to go with friends or take a date, because it's BYOB and last time I went we didn't get charged for uncorking. You should definitely go and make sure you share with everyone as if you're at a tapas restaurant! Favorites: Philly, Alaska, Dragon and Po'Boy.
