the 15 course dinner tasting at graham elliot is an amazing four hour extravaganza that will stimulate your senses and test the boundaries of your propensity for gluttony like nothing else! yes, you could order a la carte, or you could opt for the more modest and pared down tasting menu options. But we were all celebrating our graduation and were moving out of chicago, so we decided it was either go big or go home! and we certainly went big! 15 courses is a LOT. The portions are very small but the whole tasting took about 4.5 hours (we were seated at 5:30 and left at 10:00 pm!) and the combination of multiple small plates and the effects of time left us extremely full by course 12. I was delirious by the dessert stage and was having a hard time getting through them, delicious as they were. everything was so inventive in terms of plating and taste. My favorites were the seafood dishes--the deconstructed crab cake, the swordfish and the salmon--amazing. if i ever came back here and ordered a la carte, i would definitely stick to the seafood. the meat dishes were just not memorable, merely acceptable. i loved the onion soup as well--if you like the rich, creamy soups at jean georges you will love the soups here! the desserts have extremely explosive and powerful flavors--ancho chili chocolate?? lavendar creme brulee?? wow. these unusual combinations were a little much for me, i preferred the safer but still delicious lemon dessert of poppy ribbon, shortcake and DELICIOUS blueberry gelato. and did I tell you that even the playlist was amazing?? exploring a new food frontier with death cab, arcade fire and grizzly bear in the background is so perfect. i want not only their food but their ipods!! if you have a special event to celebrate and are willing to shell out $200+ for food and drink, then this is the place for you. the money and time spent will result in timeless, unforgettable memories of a food journey like no other.
