Somewhere between 3 and 4 stars really. Tank is definitely a great place. The menu selection is huge and the food is pretty good and cheap. It seems to be the biggest, busiest, and most well known restaurant on the Argyle strip, but I don't think it's the best. I think the food (at least the pho and spring rolls) is better at some of the other little places further down the street. The service is usually better at the smaller places too, because they don't get quite as busy. Bottom line. Tank is a cool place to go. It's especially a good option if you're looking for something other than pho, because their menu is huge. However, if you're going for pho, I would recommend walking a little further down Argyle and trying out one of the other smaller restaurants.
