Big Jones: you make me happy. I like your contemporary style, your accommodating service, your organic grapefruit juice and your Southern food. Corn cakes with black beans and eggs? Yes please. Carolina pulled pork sandwich served with perfectly cooked fries? Don't mind if I do. Spicy Andouille sausage? Make that a double order. This isn't a place I could go to more than once or twice a month, simply because the novelty would wear thin. However, the next time you have friends or family in town, or someone who doesn't normally venture north, take them here for brunch. They'll enjoy it.
