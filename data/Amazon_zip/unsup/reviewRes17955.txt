This place is always packed. Theres usually one of two reasons for that. 1.) the food is excellent 2.) its Byob, you're cheap and you have a party of 8. Caro Mio is #2. My food was ample, but it wasnt good. The caccitore was butchered in a way that made it seem the chicken had fought for its life. The arrabiata dish i ordered had jalapenos in it......italian food doesnt have jalapenos. (red pepper flakes, sure). Its a kitschy place, but i wouldnt say its romantic. Or maybe it is if your date just wants to get hammered on 3-4 bottles of wine for less than it would cost on a wine list. Also, there is no main course less than 15$ in the menu......this aint Alinea. Sountrack wise on the particular night i was there, elliott smith gave way to what sounded like 105.9 "La Ley" as the bumpersticker says.
