I missed Korean BBQ so much these days and searched reviews on Yelp and found this restaurant. My fiance and I wanted to give a shot, so we drove on Saturday with too much traffic on Western Ave, (for us, it took for 55 min to get there from downtown) IT IS REALLY WORTH TO GO THIS RESTAURANT!!!Some of reviews here said, if not Korean, they don't serve good?! I think that is because many Asian restaurants (especially authentic ones), servers mostly speak their own language, and a little English, so it's difficult them to explain a lot about the food at restaurant in English... I assume. Mostly, if you ask what they recommend, they'll tell you what is popular or not. Smell, probably is going to be a problem if you want to go out after the meal here. They use charcoal to BBQ, and you do that on your own. Food itself is I think very good!! Even though some people think it's a bit pricey to have Kalbi for $17.95, you will get at least 20 pan chans so that you can have other taste than meat.  So I think it's reasonable. Overall, we will definitely go back this place and I loved their lots of pan chans!!
