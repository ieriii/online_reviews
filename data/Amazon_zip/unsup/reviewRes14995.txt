I went here with three other people on a Thursday night around 9:30 p.m. and there was no wait. The space is warm and interesting. The bar is the centerpiece of the room - It is intricately carved and the beer taps are different color fists. (It is possible we made a few jokes about this.) We started with the bacon popcorn which was rich, salty and delicious. We also had the wings, which were spicy and tasty, but didn't blow me away - good wings, not life changing. (As I typed that, I began to wonder if maybe I expect too much from my wings.) Between the four of us we had: Chicken Sandwich - I didn't try it as I'm not a big chicken sandwich fan, but others at the table really seemed to enjoy it. Hombre Burger - really delicious, the tortilla strips and cheese added great flavor and the burger was well cooked. Farm Burger - Good, solid burger, really well cooked with an egg on top. Hard not to like. Roast Beet Pizza - I should preface this with saying that beets are one of my favorite things, I know they aren't for all people, but I love the sweet little ruby orbs. With that said, the pizza was delicious. Crust was crispy and thin. It had beets, spinach, goat cheese and horseradish cream - which really added a nice punch of flavor. Looking forward to eating my leftovers today. One of the best things about this place is the beer list. Tons of on-site brewed beers and they offer 5 ounce samples for $2 each.
