I never tend to critique food I get when I'm drunk on a Friday night too much but La Pasadita was terrible. I got a burrito and the steak was so tough I got through about two bites before my jaw gave out. I chewed each bite about 100 times and could still barely swollow it. I threw it out. Why do you open up three of the same restaurant in one block? To trick people into buying the same crap food three times.
