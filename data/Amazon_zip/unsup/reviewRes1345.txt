This is based on multiple trips there. Every time has been wonderful. The most recent time we split four sausages, including the foie gras duck sausage, the spicy wild boar sausage, the mozzarella and bell pepper chicken sausage, and the buffalo blue cheese pork sausage. We've had at least ten different sausages and hot dogs there, and every one of them has been quality. The service is of course awesome. Doug Sohn, the demi-god of encased meat, is always behind the counter ready to take your order and guide you through the menu. Not sure why they even sell a large soda since he will do his best to get you to order a medium and take free refills. The folks brining out your food are efficient. Despite the sometimes insane lines you never feel rushed once you enter into this sausage shangri-la. The one thing to be careful of when you enter there is not to have the "mismatched buffet food" effect hit you. Think about when people eat at a huge all-you-can-eat buffet. They come back to their table with a plate loaded with pizza, prime rib, sushi, and chocolate cake. All good on their own, but not the right things to have together. The choices here can cause a small version of that. The spicy boar sausage for instance was so powerful that it overwhelmed the more subtly spiced or sweet-topping covered ones we had ordered. Be careful with the order in which you eat the sausages, or just plan multiple trips, with a theme for each order! Waiting in line in the blowing snow on a winter's day with other people anxiously waiting to get inside felt like a bonding experience, something uniquely Chicago. This place is worth waiting in the snow. It is worth spending 2 hours in line on a pleasant summer day. It is worth crawling on hands and knees over broken glass through the desert. Anything to get to the counter and place an order for a Foie Gras dog with Duck Fat fries.
