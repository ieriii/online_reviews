This hotel did not have what they promised!! They did NOT have wi-fi, microwave, fridge and the paint was peeling off the walls. The room doors were scuffed up. Oh the entrance looks fancy but the rooms ARE NOT up to par. Our rooms were suppose to have these things and they did NOT!! The beds were not that clean OR comfortable. The walls are thin & you can hear the people in the room next you! I paid high dollar for two rooms and I would of been better off in a Budget Motel!!! Worst stay ever!! I believe they should pay back my money!!
