I've got nothing bad to say about this hotel. Stayed here on Sunday for just 1 night, the bed was very comfy and the view from the 30 Fl was pretty sweet. I'd agree with some comments about the check-in, not the easiest process, they seem to ignore you and then have some dude come up to you (kinda creepy) from behind and ask if everything is cool. Other than that, the stay was fine, the Big Bar downstairs is not a bad place to get some drinks at the end of the night as well.
