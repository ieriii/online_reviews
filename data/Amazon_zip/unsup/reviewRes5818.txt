Can't say enough good things about Wildfire If you want steak in downtown Chicago, THIS IS THE PLACE. You can go here for a fancy dinner, or if you and your friends want to get something tasty when you are in the area. The waitstaff is fantastic, and I have tried pretty much everything on the menu, and it is all great. You can't miss with this place, and even if there is a wait, you can hang in the bar area, watch some sports on their multiple TV's, and the next thing, you are sitting down.
