My stay at the W Lakeshore was my first W experience, and overall it was really good. I liked the minimalist decor in the room, and thought the wood paneled wall was a nice touch. The bathroom was definitely nice, and the bath products were better than most hotel chains. The lobby bar seemed pretty cool, although I didn't get a chance to check it out. And the location was pretty good for where I needed to be in the River North area. The only area where the W Lakeshore fell short was the frat boy clientele that invaded the place on Friday night. In San Francisco we would call them the Bridge and Tunnel crowd, but in Chicago they were just a bunch of loud fuckin idiots who think a hotel is their personal playground at 4 in the morning. Kind of ruined the whole "urban sophisticate" vibe the W is trying to go for.
