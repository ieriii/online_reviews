The fish was AWESOME. Seriously. The rice ball was perfect (after our weird experience with giant, dense rice balls at Sushi Wabi). The rolls were on the smaller side, not only in circumference, but in number of pieces as well. We got the ceviche roll and I wasn't that impressed. It was just a bunch of stuff rolled together. I was expecting a little more...substance and creativity. The super white tuna is really good too!
