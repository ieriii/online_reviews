Meh. I've been to Spacca three times, and each time it is simply OK. On the most recent visit, our pizza came out straight up burned (and still soggy in the middle).  The owner gave us a lecture about how all pizza will have "some scorch on it." That's nice, but our entire crust and bottom was BLACK. That's not "some scorch." We did get another pizza, but it was only half-baked and extremely soggy. It was also very bland. Wine list is decent, but overall this place is overhyped and overpriced. I'll save my pizza eating for Sapori di Napoli and Pizza DOC.
