Most people will say anything less than a 6 is heresy. I'll probably be looking over my shoulder for a while after posting this, but it has to be said. Hot dougs is a 5 in the same way in-and-out burger is a 5. It's popular because it has a cult following and it has a cult following because its popular. The food is average, and at some point, I'm sure it was edgy and innovative (oh my! unconventional meats in a casing!) but its nothing special. People rave about the duck fat fries, but I'll take McDonald fries before those any day.
