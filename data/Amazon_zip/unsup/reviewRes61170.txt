best pizza in the world! i live in SF. we have the worst pizza in SF. i've been craving gino's east for over a year now. it's crowded, expensive and you'll have to wait 45 min for your pizza. i say so what! i'll wait all day for the best deep dish chicago has to offer! the staff is super friendly and even though i was sitting at the bar (fastest way to get the food), a nice female server came up to me to make sure everything was going well. drinks are over priced and don't order any shots there. actually, don't order any shots in chicago in any place. they are small and nothing like what we do here in cali. best pizza in the world! i miss you gino's east!
