My best friend was in town and, having heard good things about the food and having had a few beers here, I thought it would be a good place to take her (and a handful of our friends). The Great: The beer selection on tap was glorious. I'd love to just sit in Hopleaf all day and try each beer choice. I had the Barbar and it was sweet but not obnoxious. My boyfriend ordered mussels and they were perfectly flavored and the surprisingly light coconut curry broth made for delicious bread dippings. The exposed brick of the back room lent itself to a lovely atmosphere. The service was just right - not cheesily chatty while managing not to feel cold. The Not-so-Great: We were seated only after our whole group got there even though 5 out of our group of 7 was there. While the appetizers came out really quickly, the food itself took about 45 minutes. This wouldn't have been an issue if we weren't ravenous by the time we'd arrived. Overall, the beer selection rocked my world and Hopleaf made for a really nice place to enjoy a quality meal with some friends.
