Art.....I promise you, I will never stray again.... Last week, my curiosity got the best of me, so I ordered from Apart Pizza After terrible phone call with a guy who can't take an order for sh%$t The pizza arrived, and I was bummed. WTF have I done? So sorry Art, but I will never do that again. So last night, I'm tired, I'm hungry, I need food and pizza is what I need So I called the Art of Pizza............. The guy knew how to take the order, not only that but he was nice on the phone Pizza arrived on time, Pizza was amazing, just perfect for crappy, cold and windy day It was worth the wait.....for you Art...I will wait
