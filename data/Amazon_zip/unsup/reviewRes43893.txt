I don't think this place is worth all of the hype and lines, but I live around the corner and depend on it for fresh, yummy food when my belly is empty on the weekends. I'm normally an adventurous eater but stick to my faves at Milk & Honey. I can't get enough of the avocado sandwich, and I'm not even a vegetarian. Whatever sandwich you get, make sure it involves their cracked mustard. I'm not a mustard person but seriously it's the best. If I'm starving, I'll get the crab-cake sandwich. It's pretty heavy and greasy, but it hits the spot! I'm not a huge sweet breakfast person, but on my birthday I treated myself to some banana toffee pancakes and they were as decadent and awesome as they sound. Try the granola bars!
