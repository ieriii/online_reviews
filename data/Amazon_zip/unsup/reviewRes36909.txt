We were wandering around Greektown and stumbled into Meli's Cafe and Juice bar. The place was packed at 1pm on a Saturday but it didn't take long for us to get a table. We immediately liked the place. It had a European feel to it, very quaint and the fresh coffee aroma that filled the room made it feel like home. The staff were friendly and very helpful. The food was great. My daughter ordered the pancakes with apples and cinnamon and the pancakes were fluffy and as my daughter described it - "it's like pumpkin pie"! I had to have a taste and she was right. It's not a typical fluffy pancake flavor. It had a very slight hint of pumpkin and cinnamon. Different, I must say but very good. My husband ordered the corned beef panini with pasta salad on the side. Portions were large but we're not complaining. My husband did not have a problem finishing his meal. I had the angus beef burger with blue cheese and though the $2 extra charge for blue cheese seemed a lot, when it came out - I was pleasantly surprised that they used real blue cheese and not those crumbles or blue cheese dressing that they usually put in other places. My burger came with fries of very generous portions. I could not even finish it. Overall, it was a good experience and it would definitely be a "go to" for me and my family whenever we're in the area.
