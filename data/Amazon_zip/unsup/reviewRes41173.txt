There's really not a single bad thing I can say about this place. The location is great - about a 2 minute walk from the Argyle 'El' stop. My friends and I have been coming here for about 4 years to get our pho fix. The last time we came, we walked from the Riviera on a chilly, somewhat rainy night. Perfect pho weather! The noodles are delicious, the beef is super yummy, the broth is so, so savoury. Even when I became full, I could not stop sneaking sips every minute or so while I waited for my friends to finish. The service is ridiculously fast (mmm, instant gratification!) and the food is pretty damn cheap. With tip and tax, a bowl of pho will come out roughly to $10. Can't beat that!
