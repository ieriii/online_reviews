There's a good reason this place draws a big crowd. It's very well run and the service is fantastic.  On my visit the wait at the bar was great. The people watching was almost as entertaining as trying the beers they brew on site at Revolution Brewing. And not to take anything away from their brews at all, it is fantastic that they still have all the beer and booze you could want. Whether you're a PBR guy/gal or a brewing aficionado, there is a beverage that will put a smile on your face here.  Most breweries only sell their own beers so it is nice to have a full selection in addition to the Revolution brews. The menu is fantastic! There is truly something for everyone on here from heavy meat eaters to vegan naturalists. Unless you're bio-dynamic only I think there's something on the menu for you that will be served by a very nice, attentive and knowledgeable wait staff. After a meal here there is no better place to go than two blocks up the road to The Whistler at 2421 N. Milwaukee. They have great drinks there, some musical and theatrical entertainment and a back yard area for smokers and people who like to be outside (if you can deal with the smoke).  Overall I have to say Revolution delivers a clean, very well run restaurant with an open feel. I have to highly recommend it.
