Upon walking in Iron Maiden in concert was on all the flat screens. I knew I was going to like this place. Being that it was a Monday night it wasn't crowded. I was there for a friend's birthday and our small group was able to relax and have a good time in the upstairs area. I do like the location of this place. There is plenty of street parking and its easy to get to from where I live in noble square. It is also across the street from Empty bottle where this could be a good pre or post show hangout.I think these places will compliment each other well. I like that they show the concerts in their entirety. You can see on their website what they are going to show that night. I ordered a very tasty burger called cruelty to animals which was over a half pound topped with bacon, prosciutto , and chorizo. It was very tasty and the fries were fresh cut. The best part was it was under $10. I like this place and will be back again. The owner was there and he seems to be a pretty nice guy. I do like the idea that he and his partner came up with. All the staff I dealt with were pleasant too which is nice to find these days.I have a feeling that in the months to come this place will become very popular. I forgot to ask but hope that in the future I can call ahead and get their burgers to go. I like that I have a place like this near my neighborhood
