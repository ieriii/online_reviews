Cant wait to go back! Found 4 new fav beers ON TAP (and that rarely happens for me). Burgers great and our waitress was so helpful and had great suggestions. A little unorganized at the front door and difficult to grab a beer from the bartenders but they are fairly new and hopefully will continue to work out those little glitches. Over all....yumm.
