Giordano's deserves zero stars!My husband and I visited Giordano's to experience their highly recommended pizza - were we disappointed! We visited at around 5:00pm on a Saturday, but were ready and willing for the anticipated wait. After giving our name at the host's stand and pre-ordering our pizza to reduce the wait after we got our table, we squeezed into the filled-to-capacity bar area. My husband went to the bar to order a beer but couldn't get the bartender's attention - because this bartender had his back to the customers more than he faced the multitudes of potential customers. After waiting for a while we thought we heard our name called and made our way to the host's stand. When we got there, we were rudely informed that it wasn't our name that was called. We continued to wait with the rest of the throng and finally our name was called. The host basically grunted and pointed to a table near the front door. We took our seats at the indicated table and waited...we waited over 15 minutes and never saw a server. At this point we had been abused enough and left. We are not high-maintenance customers; we understood that is was a Saturday evening at a popular restaurant and that we would have to be understanding of the situation. The rudeness and inattentiveness experienced was beyond the situation; any good restaurant with attentive management would be prepared to handle the crowd of customers and would hire a staff that could handle the situation. Giordano's isn't the only place serving pizza in Chicago!
