It was my birthday on May 26, 2011. I called 3 days prior to make a reservation. Spoke with a woman on the phone (ie. Not Open Table). We arrived and they did not have our reservation. The host/manager looking guy asked several times about how we made our reso but seated us right away (nice recovery)--BTW, never told them I was celebrating a birthday. What was off-putting to me, was that as our server (finally--longer than expected) came to the table, I was opening some birthday cards at the table and I told him "I'm opening some birthday cards", and he said, "are you telling me this so I'll give you a free dessert?" Awk moment. Natch we told him no. He struck up a convo with my husband about fishing that was unusually long (ok, I can over look this), but then when he gave us dessert menus and we declined to order dessert, he said, "Oh, is that because you expect a free dessert from the restaurant for your birthday?" We of course said no. I thought the food was great. The restaurant was loud (which we knew it would be). We don't go out a lot, so we were looking forward to having someone take care of us and to haveing some great food. I don't care about cake. I had had several pieces earlier that day from my work mates. It was what he said and how he handled it. I've told 15+ people so far about this. They all feel the same way that the server didn't handle this properly. So, I'll be writing about this on numerous sites so everyone knows. BTW, the server's name was Chris.
