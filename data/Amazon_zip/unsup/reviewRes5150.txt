Started out @ the Purple Pig for some wine and caved and got a smear after seeing Steve Dolinsky's blog http://bit.ly/9oOrk8. We went with the eggplant caponata and goat cheese. Stick with me while I dissect. My god was that spectacular. Slightly greasy and delicious. Every bite, creamy, yummy. We couldn't stop raving about it; even my friend who doesn't eat eggplant. Who knew you should mix goat cheese with eggplant? I'm sure you foodies did, but I did not and it was such a spectacular surprise. So spectacular that I went back to the Purple Pig the following day. I couldn't just give five stars after drinking one perfect glass of red wine and splitting an appetizer. So I brought two different individuals to the place the following evening. Wine again, was perfect (Rioja). Then we ordered - Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs (my boyfriend loved it, i thought it was a bit too fatty for my taste, but still unique, delicious and recommended). - Salt-roasted Beets with Whipped Goat Cheese & Pistachio Vinaigrette - Chicken Thigh Kebabs with Fried Smashed Potatoes & Tzatziki  - Mussels with Treviso, Serrano Chiles, Winter Citrus & Gaeta Olives I recommend getting a little something from every portion of the menu (a la plancha, salad, smear...etc). I just can't stop raving about the food. I'm literally going to this place again next week with a different friend, and I don't think I'm the only crazy addict out there. When the waiter asked if we'd been there and I said "yes, yesterday" he said that's common. :) Oh yes, wonderful wait staff and definitely worth the money (it's all about value, friends!) Go straight to Purple Pig, do not pass go, do not collect $200. You won't regret it.
