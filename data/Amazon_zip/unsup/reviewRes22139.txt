I saw this place of the food channel.....i had to try. Maybe I had high expectations? Maybe I expected too much? or maybe....it just wasn't that good...imma go with the third. Being in the drive-in, chillin out, enjoying the view was the best part for sure! Go for the drive in experience not the food
