Went there last night with a big group of people. We called ahead and the manager was nice enough to set aside some tables for us in the back. As you walk in it resembles a mini grocery store/deli. The food was amazing! I had the vegetarian combo which came with filafel, rice, salad, humus, and pita. I also couldn't resist the baklava which was sooo good! Few notes: Cash only! and BYOB!
