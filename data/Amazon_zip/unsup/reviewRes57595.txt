This is definitely the best fondue in the city. The food and the atmosphere is ten times better than The Melting Pot chain. I also love getting the coupons in the mail for birthdays/anniversaries. I wish I got the coupons all the time so I could eat here every week! Otherwise, it's a little too pricey.
