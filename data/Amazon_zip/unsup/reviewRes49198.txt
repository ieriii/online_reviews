Got the Bloomspot Chef's tasing - well worth it! The atmosphere is warm and welcoming; kinda Crate & Barrel/Ikea-ish. Gotta love the wines, though, complimented nicely with a great menu and available to go! Interestingly, I found the service to be good, competent - but a tad slow.  Shared a wine flight with four amazing sparkling wines! The cheese flight was good; not my favorite.  The shrimp bisque was flavorful, but bordering on harsh. The shrimp cocktail was delicious served on a bed of ice in a soup bowl - nice. The shrimp were cooked perfectly! The black pepper crusted swordfish served on a bed of mashed potatoes w/ bordelais was quite good! Simple, filling, delish. The fish was a little over-cooked and I loved it! The bordelais was spot on and worked well with this dish.  The red velvet cake was surprisingly nutty and the raspberry-cream cheese ice cream is worthy of a return trip! I'd go back; I am going back!
