Pros: Trendy bar; excellent cocktails; unique atmosphere; dark/dim lighting. Cons: Pretentious; expensive; long wait to get in. I waited in line almost an hour the first attempt at going to Violet Hour. I gave up and resolved to go back right at 6pm when they open. It's a dimly lit, but unique setting. The service was just so-so, but the drinks were expertly created. If you can mentally prepare yourself for the long wait and pretentiousness -- it's worth checking out at least once.
