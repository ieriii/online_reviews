I had a great time at brunch here. I had great company, so that might have helped a little bit. Anyway, we came for brunch a little later than normal, so our wait wasn't that bad. I ordered the Veggie Croissant Sandwich and we shared one pretzel pancake. The food was as good as you can imagine. The breakfast potatoes were littered with dill and other yummy seasonings. I got lots of fresh veggies and the portion was decent. The pancake was a very decadent dessert. I guess the only reasons I give it 4 stars and not 5 is because it was a little bit pricey for what it was, and because we felt like they were kicking us out the moment we got our food. We literally got the check along with our food--I just think that's bad manners. As soon as our plates were gone, but I was still finishing my bloody mary (which were really good here--interesting. really earthy.), someone came by to interrupt our conversation and ask us if we need anything else like every 60 seconds. It was weird.
