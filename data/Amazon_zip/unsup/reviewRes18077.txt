The beer list here is a freaking encyclopedia. Every type of craft beer you would want it seems. Going here will not get you regular pub food and pub beer. The tastes here are outside-the-norm. You can get a plain burger, but the 12 other burgers are of wide varieties. Someone drinking a Miller Lite instead of a Half Acre Brew would look out of place. The interior is very different and cool looking, though where I sat the past time it was almost too dark to read the menu.
