So good that even my picky eastern european grandmother liked it! It doesn't compete with food that we've had in Vietnam, but definitely a nice classy alternative. Their dumplings probably compare the most to the rose dumplings that we loved so much in HoiAn... Such a beautiful ambiance too!  But, don't expect a bowl of Pho the size of the table :) You have to go to Vietnam town for that.
