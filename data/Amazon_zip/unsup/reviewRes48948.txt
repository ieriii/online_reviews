the publican is currently my favorite restaurant in chicago. it looks awesome, the beer list is amazing and the menu is solid for meat eaters and those of us who only eat sea-related animals. the smoked fish- all of it- is ridiculous. the boiled crab with fingerling potatoes, spicy salsa and corn was practically a religious experience. black bass (the whole fish) was the best i have EVER had. mussels were super fresh but i wasn't inspired by the sauce, i thought it was a little on the watery side. yeah yeah yeah this place is expensive but i seriously put money aside so i can continue to go here. service sometimes is a little sketchy but every time there has been a mistake something free ends up on my table. can't complain!
