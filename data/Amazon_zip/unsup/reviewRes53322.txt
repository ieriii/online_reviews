Easily the best saussage i have ever eaten. and no matter what i order, i am always pleased!i tell all my friends that it is worth the 30 minute wait, but smarter people just wait until either almost closing or not friday or saturday. but when you crave it, i'd personally wait an hour.Doug is the hostess with the mostess and a very kind and friendly guy. the best part about hot dougs is that no matter how long the line is, there will always (typically) be a table for you!
