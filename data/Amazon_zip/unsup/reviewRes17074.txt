This place is pretty fancy, but pretending not to be fancy, but still fancy :-) Drinks are really impressive, but menu is confusing. I recommend just telling the server you like a certain type of alcohol [vodka, gin, scotch] and something will then magically appear. It's a nice crowd, and its rumored they hold the line in there ever so a small crowd around the bar.. only 2-3 deep.. if you are trying to have good drink and converse, this is the ideal spot.
