I tried Crisp for the first time last night. We had the plain jane, seoul sassy wings, and an original bad boy buddha. A+ for service! We had requested chicken on the bad boy buddha, but it came with beef. So, they topped it with chicken for free. I usually prefer my bi bim bap dol sot style (served in a hot stone bowl) bc it leaves a crispy layer of rice on the bottom, but the bad boy was delish. It was huge! I think I like the seoul sassy better than the plain jane. The plain jane did not satisfy my tong dok cravings even though I knew not to expect it from the reviews. Justin L. noted the missing white radishes traditionally served with Korean fried chicken. I totally agree! It makes the dish and I think it would be more popular than the kimchi.
