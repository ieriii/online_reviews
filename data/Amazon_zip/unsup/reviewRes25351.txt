Pizza was fabulous! I could've eaten 300 slices, but settled for the individual pie. Service was incredibly slow, but perhaps this was because we were the only party upstairs and they forgot about us? It's ok, I won't hold a grudge because the pizza is so damn good. I also enjoyed watching the Olympics on the several HD flat screens they have hanging throughout the joint.
