Really can't wait to go back to Gilt Bar. I have a feeling next time I will try more things and have to up my review to 5 stars. For my first visit I skipped on cocktails because it was a Tuesday (lame I know) but the food I had was simply incredible. We tried the bone marrow for the first time and it was even better than my high expectations for it! Also had some amazing cornbread and pork meatballs over grits that I was really disappointed I had to share. Love the atmosphere and the music. Next time, cocktails!
