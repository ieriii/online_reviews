The city of the deep dish has plenty of opinions about who makes the best deep dish pie, but my money is on Pequod's. There is one special part of this deep dish pizza that sets it above the rest, that is the crunchy and yummy caramelized crust. It is funny that a crust would be the best part of the pizza, some people don't even like the crust. This is not the usual hunk of dough that makes the crust of most pizzas........ It is special, delicious and makes me all giddy inside just thinking about it.While the crust is the best part of the pizza, please do not discount its other quality attributes. It is piled high with fresh toppings and gooey cheese while the dough rises moist and delicious. The sauce is tangy but sweet and compliments the flavor of the cheese.Pequod's also has a great delivery service that will get your pizza to you hot and fresh. If you just feel like having a slice, pop into their great location for one and possibly a beer.  Maybe you could catch a Bulls game at the same time on one of their numerous flat screens.Are you hungry yet? I am.............. Time to call Pequod's!
