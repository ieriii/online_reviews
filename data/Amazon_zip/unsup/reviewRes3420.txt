Sadly I have to admit, compared to other big cities Chicago is lacking when it comes to great Korean restaurants. Aside from Cho San Ok in Lincoln Square, this is the only other Korean (er Korean American) establishment I would recommend. My personal favorite is the Seoul sensation burrito. Unlike the typical rice burritos you find at Chipotle, this baby doesn't leave you feeling gross and heavy at the end of consumption. Filled with rice, marinated beef and a variety of vegetables, it not only tastes good but it's healthy too. The burrito also comes with a pink sauce which I will warn you, is very spicy. If you can handle it, i would strongly suggest you use it. But once again, especially to all the non Koreans out there, it's quite spicy. My second favorite dish is the Dakota steakhouse sandwich. Essentially, this is a Korean style cheese steak sandwich. If you're lactose and tolerant just ask the staff to customize this delicious sandwich. I think what makes this dish amazing is the bread they use. If I get too full, I forgo the meat and at LEAST try to finish the bread. The Fried Chicken is great too. The Seoul Sassy is the most popular and my personal favorite but in general all of them rock! On top of great tasting food the service here is superb. Employees are eager to serve often bringing your order TO you and offering to clear your table afterwords. They are a friendly bunch, always smiling and wanting to get to know more about you. If you stop by alone don't hesitate to eat in. With community sitting and an outgoing staff, dining alone here is def. not a problem.
