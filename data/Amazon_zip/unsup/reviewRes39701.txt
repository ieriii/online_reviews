Very unique menu, only for the semi-adventurous. If you are a cheeseburger and fries kind of person this is not the restaurant for you. Very busy place go early or late if you want a table. Amazing appetizers we tried the meatballs and polenta, very tasty and the cheese plate was quite nice. Our Pear and Aragula Salad was incredibly good and our Cavatappi with smoked cauliflower and a bunch of stuff I can't remember was interesting AND delicious. The service was amazing. We were sharing all items 3 ways and after each course, a server swooped in and scooped up all of our plates and silverware, replacing with new. I timed how long it took from the time we took our last bit til replacements came, 32 seconds! Thats what I call attentive.
