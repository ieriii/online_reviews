The best thing about this place is the byob policy. I went with a small group the polenta, which wasn't very good to be honest. I wouldn't recommend. My pasta dish was pretty good, altough it's loaded with heavy sauce (and the portions were huge). My friend ordered the gnochi and it was amazing. I would definitely get that again. All things considered we had a good time, the food was good, but not great. I'd probably go back and give it another shot.
