I take my compliment back on their mussels that smelled good: had their beer mussels for the first and last time on Tuesday, bitter, small, gritty...just awful. Would not recommend them to anyone. Do still like the ambiance and top beer selection. Hopleaf is still one of the top craft beer bars in Chicago.  I'll just say no way to this dish...
