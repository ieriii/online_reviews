Firstly - I hate crinkle cut fries, but Ill eat the fries here any day. Thats a huge deal to me. I'm stubborn with my disliking toward certain foods, and somehow this place won me over. Secondly - Its rare that I eat all the things that come on a true chicago dog. I dont like pickles or tomatoes...but here, I ate every crumb. I shocked myself with that. Third - I like the red hots a lot. The crispy outside/juicy inside concept always makes me happy. Lastly - I love drive-ins. The first time I went here was with friends in the middle of bitter winter and we still left all our windows open and ordered shakes. The bf is bitterly opposed to this places popularity. I agree that maybe the nostalgia factor is why its iconic moreso than the food, but I think its a place worth going to at least a few times. Oh, and the dogs on top of the building freak me out at night. I pass the place a lot and its reminiscent of the opening of a horror movie.
