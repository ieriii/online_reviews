Amazing Italian in a lovely, romantic setting. The antipasti selection is great, the meat and vegetables are delicious. The Spaghetti Frutti di Mare is delicious, they somehow manage to cook each type of seafood to perfection, then add it to (what must be) homemade squid ink pasta and a delicious red sauce. Please order this. The other dish we got was a special, but it was some sort of ricotta and spinach dumpling in a butter sauce. So great. I wish I had gone with a big group so I could have tried more. Will definitely be back. Great service too!
