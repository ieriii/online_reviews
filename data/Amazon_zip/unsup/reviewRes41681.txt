On my travels through the Midwest I knew I needed a good bowl of pho and I knew that Chicago would provide me some. So I used my handy dandy Yelp and found Tank Noodle. We choose Tank Noodle due to the outstanding reviews and number of reviews. So thank you fellow Yelpers for helping a phonatic out. One word. Yum. It was delicious. I don't remember which number I got but it had everything but the kitchen sink in it. I think that was the first bowl of pho I ever had that had so many different types of meat. It was so yummy I didn't want to stop eating but alas, sitting across my hubby, I knew it was time to stop sipping on the broth and head back out to our Uhaul. Moving to TN I don't know when the next time I will eat phonomenal pho again but knowing that my last bowl for the time being was amazing, makes me happy.
