I really enjoyed the food here. I wish I could recall everything we ordered but I'm writing this review a month after attending. lol. (I'm a wee-bit-late with my review) But what I can remember was how crowded it was. And then they have two doorways which makes making a waiting list a bit difficult. The portions were nice the soups had a good taste to it. I would definitely go again and maybe next time it won't be so packed like a sardine can.
