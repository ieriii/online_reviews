I stayed at the Silversmith for 4 days in July. The hotel lobby was pretty and the lounge/guest area was huge and comfortable. Our room was in an L-Shape. I had a King Size Bed (think it was California King), desk and couch in one part of the L Shape. The other side of the L was the half Kitchen (Miniature Fridge and wet bar) and HUGE bathroom. If anybody is curious, my room was 1012. My friend also stayed in 512, which had the same layout as mine. One of the great things about the hotel is that they have "Dessert" hour from 9pm - 10pm from Mondays thru Thursday. And their dessert was impressive. When we went, they served three types of cake (two cheesecakes and a Carrot Cake) with cookies and coffee/tea.  The weird thing that I found about the Concierge is that when you check in, they prefer that you have your Confirmation number instead of providing your name for some reason. I sensed that they were really persistent with getting the Confirmation number before searching for your name on the system for some reason.  But my stay was great, in the middle of the loop, two blocks away from the Blue Line, next to great Pubs and shopping area.
