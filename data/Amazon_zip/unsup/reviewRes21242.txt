This place is a great local Mexican restaurant, and in my opinion a step above larger places like Julio's Hacienda. The chips and salsa are great, and I find myself ordering and re-ordering the chicken flautas and pork tamales over and over again. I'd like to try other things on the menu, except I love my regular items so much! The service is extremely attentive, almost on the "too much attention" side. But I'd rather have too much service than not enough. They don't deliver but do accommodate carry-out orders (which I do often on the way home from work).
