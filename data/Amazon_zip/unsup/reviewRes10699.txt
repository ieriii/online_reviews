Perfect in every way for brunch. I eat gluten when I go here because it is worth getting a cloudy-headed gluten hangover for!! Get the spinach, feta, roasted red pepper eggs benedict and you will be amazed. Everything I've ever ordered here has been divine and it is the spot I take out of towners to ever time. The waitstaff is comprised of level-headed, smart, and very real people--a rare treat when dining out. You will wait at least 45 minutes to get in if you go after 9:30 on the weekend but it is worth it and once you are seated they have timely service.
