Billy Lawless strikes again! This proprietor is one of those guys that truly cares about service and quality and this is why I will follow him anywhere. His latest creation The Gage is a fine dining restaurant, a pub, and a social hot spot for those in the loop pun intended. The menu here is extremely creative for the adventurous and full of traditional fare for those just looking to indulge in comfort. If you work in the Loop this is a must stop for lunch or after work for a snack and a few drinks.  The downstairs lounge is for me the best. Do yourself a favor give The Gage a try, you'll love it. Great for parties, and in an awesome location! Awesome Pint of Guinness here!
