Only have been there for brunch thus far--I recommend the Eggs "Nanadict" or the lemon poundcake french toast. Coffee is amazing, but alcoholic drinks are overpriced and really bizarre. The bloody mary was gross, and my $14 drink with elderflower liqueur was served in what looked like a 1.5oz shot glass with a branch of some kind of herb...I like to be adventurous, but it was just weird. Skip the booze, but the food is delish!
