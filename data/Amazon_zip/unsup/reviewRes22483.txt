I have never had Greek Food... but my Boyfriend's family is in town, his uncle Mitch knows about all things food and has been dining at this fine establishment since before I was conceived! That is how I was seduced by the Greek Islands... I am told Greek Wine is a must, but I hadn't yet eaten, so I had coffee instead- it was delicious- petite and strong just like me! Sensing my unfamiliarity, Uncle Mitch ordered a smorgasbord: frothy pink confection that is spread on the fresh steamy slices of sesame-crusted bread, There was flaming cheese, There was this incredibly delicious calamari- not fried- in a spicy red sauce... just heavenly. i almost stole Uncle Mitch's plate- it was that yummy! I had the sea bass- it wasn't bad, but it wasn't unique either. Boyfriend had the biggest, most ridiculous slice of baklava I have ever seen- it was the mother of all baklava with ice cream- he was very, very happy. The servers moved so fast, they didn't have time to be personable but they were moving and shaking and cheery throughout (I don't know how they do it!) the crazy-busy packed tables, bar and overflowing wait area. Oh yeah, I nearly forgot, the valet who was old enough to be my grandfather marveled at my shoes, the Italian lace stockings, followed by "And check out those legs!" Boyfriend and I both thought it very funny, and an awesome end to a great meal!
