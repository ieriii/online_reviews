What can I say: I'm still stuffed! We went for the brunch on Saturday ($29/person). My three negative points are that even though we had reservations for noon, we still had to wait 20 min for them to set up a table for our party (a party of 7). Second, they charged an automatic 20% gratuity for our party. I think if you have a party of 10-20, I understand an automatic 20% but 7? 15 or 18% will do.  Third, there was a children's b-day party on the second floor. They had a magician and he was really loud.  The food is great!!! Every time a dish was brought out, you thought that was good, and the next dish was even better. You will certainly be pleased. We went to check out the roof top, which was nice. I would return again for brunch and for drinks on the roof. .
