We drive by this place on the way home from work and it seems like the minute they opened up they were packed. We tried them out yesterday with a to go order. The Cubano sandwich was so fricken good, not dry and chewy like at some places. The empanadas come in meat or veggie-we tried the meat and loved them. The crouquettes were tasty, the black beans were runny but good.  We loved the place so much we tried to go back today but they are closed on Sunday's. There's always tomorrow...
