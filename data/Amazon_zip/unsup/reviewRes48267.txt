I wanted to like the Publican (it's by the same people who brought us Blackbird!). I seriously, seriously did. But I take issue with 2 things: (i) For a restaurant that prominently displays old world art of pigs like alters to an ancient god, that same reverence should translate on the plate. Alas, my experience was disappointing. My porchetta - an italian roasted pork belly roll - was dry, chewy, and unappealing. If they had used one of the heirloom pork breeds from the pictures, this would not be the case. And at that price, they could certainly afford it. (ii) The prices are very steep for the portions that they give you. But I guess I would not have an issue with that if the food had been orgasmic. Maybe I expect too much. I actually enjoyed the booths that shut you in like a corral. But the rest of my party felt trapped & clausterphobic. The server took way too long before he took our order, but afterward the food runners were attentive enough and the bussers kept our waters refilled. 3 stars because the steak tartare was delicious. Unfortunately, I don't have much desire to return.
