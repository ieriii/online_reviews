overall: 2.5 stars. tried Wed. date night menu - impeccable service, but prefer the standard cuisine. of the tasting menu items, ca nuong (grilled salmon on mesclun greens) would probably have been a better choice than the wide rice noodles, which had great flavor but unappealing presentation. goi cuon (shrimp vermicelli rolls) were bland, redeemed only by the peanut plum sauce. friends enjoyed the sup ga (chicken cilantro soup). sparkling wine was harshly acidic. dessert was scoop of vanilla/chocolate ice cream or mango / coconut sorbet.
