To be honest, in hearing the name, I immediately thought of the 1975 song by Micheal Martin Murphy. I loved that song, and I still know all the words by heart. But, I digress. I met 3 other Yelpers for an quiet evening of carnivore-ic delights and conversation. Raise a glass! Garson! MEAT, all around! RAWR! I was taken by the decor. The restaurant is large, and open; not at all 'dark'.  Lovely vintage black and white images lined the walls. On particular favourite of mine was a side shot of a gentleman holding / looking at a Martini glass. Another, a very Lauren Hutton-type image, partially in shadow, holding a cigarette. (non pc in this day and age, but STILL a great photo!). We were shown to our tables, and began to peruse the menu. So much to choose from! Famished, I decided upon the Bleu Cheese encrusted Filet - Medium Rare & Mashed Potatoes on the side; and started off with the Lobster and Shrimp bisque. For a filet, my steak was, to my mind, enormous. I should note that Medium Rare, at Wildfire, is a bit more rare than I'm used to. I decided it was a regional difference, having come from the West Coast, after all. Needless to say, the steak was delicious. For dessert, I chose something light. They had a lovely berry crisp that consisted of blue berries, strawberries and black berries. Great evening, over all! I would recommend Wildfire for any reason you may have for dining out; Even for no reason at all - except to enjoy some incredibly good food, fantastic service and great ambiance.
