Mercat was a totally unexpected surprise on our visit to Chicago. The pimento were so good we ordered another, and the mushrooms were amazing. If you like garlic, pepper, and Spanish tapas, you will be really glad you gave this place a try! I hope you don't come in large numbers as we will be back before we leave Chicago. So-two days later. Even better. A special of squid, tomatoes, black beans. A wonderfully loud and friendly space with so many people talking and enjoying. A different tempranillo. I hope you enjoy as much as we and all these other people have.
