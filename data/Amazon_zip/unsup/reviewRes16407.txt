3 stars for the food, but 5 stars for the service we had during our last visit. I have always liked India House. Thought it was the best indian restaurants in downtown (unless i wanted to trek all the way up to devon), and the service was always pleasant. On the St Paddy saturday, a few of my friends and I went to the brunch buffet. We sat by the window, next to Grand ave, so we saw this drunk guy who was barely able to walk without collapsing, talking gibberish to two girls next to him. OK....St Paddy's day...before noon.... I saw him walking in, presumably wanting to eat with his friends he was talking to...not giving much thought, chatting and eating away with my friends....all at a sudden, he pulled up a chair next to our table wanting to sit down. SHOCKED! The server bravely intervened, then he yelled "you are going to make me sitting by myself"...eeeeek... Few min. later, my friend saw him going into the bathroom.....she immediately asked her bf, "you don't need to use the bathroom anymore, RIGHT?!" .....yeeeeew few more min later, he and the server were arguing over on the check. I looked over, his table was clean, I was like..did he even eat anything?! He claimed he paid $40 for a couple tables next to him, the server said they are going to call the police...then a few more min and some more argument later, I saw him wobbling out of the restaurant.....phew....But then I saw a server ran out chasing him, because he left his stupid backpack behind?! WOW! thumbs up on the service and bravery of the servers. I would have called the police when the whole "check dispute" started, or I would just have thrown away the backpack that he probably doesn't even remember he had with him....and imagine the cleanup they had to do in the men's restroom....YEW......
