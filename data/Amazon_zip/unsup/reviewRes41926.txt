I even considered giving this place 3 stars but it is extremely high quality. The fact is that there are many really good steakhouses in Chicago and therefore I hold this place to very high standards. I still identify Capital Grille as the best. Anyway, we ordered veal ravioli which was just okay. My fiance ordered the filet which was excellent. I ordered the special which was a kansas city ribeye and it was good but not excellent. For dessert, we ordered chocolate cake and it was good not excellent. So, everything was solid but not 5-star worthy.
