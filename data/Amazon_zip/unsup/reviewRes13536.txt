It probably doesn't matter what I say about this place as it is obv. a hot spot for locals. The staff was charming and delightful, although there were several people standing around doing nothing who could have refilled water, wine, etc. I am not really a big fan of those places that list a chunk of "fresh fish" etc. on a board for $20-25 each. The Cioppino (sp?) sounded good, which I like, but was warned it was spicy. Jambalaya as well was described as hot, which I was not in the mood for. So I had the mahi mahi, which was good, bathed in a gingery sweet glaze. The bottom line is I wouldn't go back. Just really wasn't satisfying for the effort. If I'm paying like $50+ each including some wine and a salad and dessert I'd like a more chill, upscale relaxed atmosphere with professional service. Maybe good bread, etc? You can get it all a la carte, but it adds up. It adds up to being a pretty expensive evening, and really not that pleasant of an experience. It's a crowded bar type place where you can't move and sprinkled with kids. That's just me, again. The food was first-rate. But I'd rather go elsewhere. Plus it's super confusing with food all over the map, I couldn't understand our server as he rattled off all these preparations/specials with this fish with that sauce and that fish with this sauce. And we offer brunch and cereal and well sorry, just didn't get it.
