I will definitely not eat here again. This restaurant claimed to have tortas and they sounded delicious on the menu. My companion ordered the pork torta and I had the milanese.  I can only say that there seemed to be nothing authentic about these tortas. They tasted and looked like glorified semi-Mexican paninis. The sauce was weird, the chicken tasted gross, and the texture was mush. Halfway through my sandwich I found a long, rubbery, blue vein. That was it for me. FAIL.
