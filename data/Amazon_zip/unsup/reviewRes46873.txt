Hostess not the friendliest in the world - seemed somewhere else as I was trying to speak with her. Service was ok - took a long while to get our food and they didn't bring a couple of the sides we ordered. They did have people running around filling coffee though and we didn't need to ask for more at any time. The hash was very good but the omelet lacked flavor, would be subpar if you don't throw se hot sauce on there. Great warm atmosphere for brunch and definitely good quality.
