By far the best Cuban food I have had!!!!!! The restaurant inside is small and the seating is diner style with stools along the wall and counter. They do however provide a small intimate patio. I love to come in here and order the Huajarito - Delicious steak sandwich with lettuce, tomato sandwiched by two pieces of crispy, sweet and salty plantain!!!!! No bread!!!!!!!!!!! It is so juicy, flavorful and soooooooooo delicious!!!! If you are looking for something more filling like a larger meal, I recommend the Ropa Vieja, which is pulled beef. You can order it with beans and rice and they are so tasty, yes - even better than Mexican beans and rice! If you want to taste something more eccentric try the Rabitos - Oxtail stew!!!!!!! OMG - SO tender and the meat almost melts off the bone!!!!! This place thinks of everything when making everything tasty for the customers that even the water is tasty with courtesy lemon water at the entrance. The Cuban espresso will provide the perfect jolt especially with it's paired with their sweet Guava pastry!!!! I often come here and have been pleased every time!!!!
