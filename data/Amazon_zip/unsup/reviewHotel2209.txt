Definitely one of the best locations on Michigan Avenue. While it's not the center of luxury, the prices certainly reflect the amenities. Rooms are cozy and clean. Elevators are relatively quick for a big city, boutique-style hotel. The credit card authorization amount for checking in (per day) is ridiculous. Management should really take note of that policy and re-think it. I'll definitely be back, over and again!
