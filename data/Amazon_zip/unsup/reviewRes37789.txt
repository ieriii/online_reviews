Funny I haven't reviewed Hopleaf yet...I've been going for years. The good years in fact: pre-Check, Please, pre-D-Bags ruining another bar, pre-amateur hour overly drunk girls filling up the place. Now, I can't say I frequent it because of aforementioned nonsense. The beer list is insanely great. This can not be disputed. The food used to be better, though they still have the best moules frites in the city. The sandwiches and brisket that really used to blow my skirt up have just gotten a little TOO greasy, a tad TOO salty. One used to leave Hopleaf after a long boozy night smelling like tons of cigarettes; now one leaves smelling like fryer grease. It's just too crowded and too small of a space to be making that much food. Grease central. I will still go on a weeknight for the perfect beers. Yes, the bartenders are arrogant dicks. But I live too far from the Map Room to frequent it, so what's a girl to do? As far as that Friday/Saturday night waiting for a table nonsense... just go to Andersonville Wine and Spirits on the corner, grab some bottles of equally delicious (and cheaper) beer, and put your jammies on.
