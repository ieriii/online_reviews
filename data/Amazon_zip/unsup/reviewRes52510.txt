I have never had Brazilian steak house before but my sister keeps getting these two for one coupons and I've always turned her down. I'm such a jerk that when someone raves about something I automatically think/say 'OVERBLOWN' and go 180 in the other direction. I can't believe I've denied myself for so long. The salad bar is really well stocked with a lot of different foods that should interest anyone. My favorite was the asparagus but the sushi is surprisingly okay. Onto the meat-there are whole bunch of different cuts/types of meat and I think I tried all of them but it's hard to tell because some of them look similar and are grouped together-like the bacon wrapped filet/chicken. During the busy times it's hard to tell who has what and if you have the little orange 'I want it!' button on you'll get overloaded with everything that I was flabbergasted. Everything I tasted was good though, all of it if you can see if you can get the pineapple guy to come by and then eat that with a piece of the strip or filet. Yum! The service is really good, you'd think that with a whole bunch of guys running around you'd be ignored but everyone was surprisingly attentive and friendly. It's hard to tell who's who but that's because they're always checking up on you. I think we had three different people come by that it was hard to tell who my waiter was, but again it's a sign of their attentive service. Looking forward to it again.
