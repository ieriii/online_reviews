Made reservations and still had to wait a very long time.30 minutes plus. I really liked the atmosphere, it was very dark and..sultry. I went with a group and that place isnt really good for a group. more one on one. i love food. i love fondue. i do not love oil. the main dishes are cooked in oil. (places like melting pot cook in a bullion and wine) the only thing that had BANG ! POW! flavor were the scallops..that alone was the saving factor for me. I think its possible that i could eat the scallops from this place for the rest of my life and never grow tired. Also, the bartenders in the back (whom i spent a good portion of my visit with during my wait) were fantastic...helped us choose the perfect wine etc...very knowledgeable. Great scallops, great bartenders, everything else was middle of the road.
