Never had Costa Rican food before so I'm not sure what was authentic or what was a trend. Is real Costa Rican food vegetarian friendly? Whether or not it is, I'm glad Irazu served vegetarian food. I got their "award winning" veggie burrito. Even as a vegetarian, I've never heard of an award-winning burrito. How can that be? Well, Irazu certainly impressed my taste buds with their veggie burrito. I don't know about award winning, but it was definitely winning over my hungry stomach. First of all, their veggie burrito is monstrous! My hand only wraps around half of the girth of this burrito! Their veggie burrito's tortilla has been grilled on the outside. Reminds me of Taco Bell when they tried to grill their burritos shut. It was good stuff! Thank you Irazu for grilling the exterior of your burritos. As for the stuffing, it was actually a lot of rice and not so much black beans (but this is a great thing for me as i'm not a big fan of black beans). The first half of my burrito that I ate tasted awesome because I think I got the bulk of the creamy avocado slices and not too many peppers. But my second half was mostly peppers and my mouth wanted to die!!!   My bf got their steak casado. It looked good on the plate, but the bf did say that the meat ended up being too dry and he wasn't too thrilled with his dish. Based on everyone's reviews, we knew we had to try their oatmeal shake. The waiter recommended us doing an oatmeal banana shake and it was woooonderful! Who knew an oatmeal shake could be so good?!  My bf and I went on a Monday night and it was pretty packed for dinner time. We got seated quickly and the service was great.
