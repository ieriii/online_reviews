This review is for their BRUNCH only:: First of all, so glad I could make reservations cuzzzz this place was packed... and I kinda know why now. The decor made me feel like I was at one of the beautiful Vegas hotels.. it was really really nice. From the hostess to our waitress to the servers bringing out all kinds of food to us--- everyone was so nice and went out of their way to make sure everything was perfect. I was really surprised by the amazing service here to be quite honest... definitely not what I expected for some reason.  The food was really good but there were a few things I didn't care for... the french toast tasted weird, the eggs benedict needed more hollandaise sauce, and the frittata was eh. But- I really did like everything else... and the fact that our waitress would ask if we tried certain things and if we said no, she would make sure she brought it to our table. She was really busy but never forgot about us. OH- and did I mention the $3 mimosas??? yes- pretty damn amazing. Make sure you try to chicken and waffles- those were yum. Soooo yeah to sum things up: lovvved the ambiance, loved the amazing service and people at Zed... half the food items were amazing, half not so much-- but overall Zed gets 4 stars for me.. Def a great place to take out of towners
