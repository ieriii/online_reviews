Violet Hour, where have you been all my life?!? I could live here. Floor to ceiling velvet drapes, Tiffany-esque chandeliers. French country meets Alice in Wonderland. Tall plush chairs and couches. Dark, dark, dark, sexy dark. Candles flickering throughout the rooms. Drinks are creative, original, tasty...Black River, Coffee Ay-Ay, Etiquette, delish, delish, delish. We got the best seat in the house by the fireplace in the back room. Absolutely perfect on a chilly autumn night. Our server was friendly and knowledgeable and they need to be to help you decipher all those weird-sounding drinks. No sign outside, no windows, just an inconspicuous silver door handle on a graffiti/art-filled wall. Crowd control is what makes this place outstanding. Everyone has a seat so the space remains serene and zen. Well worth the wait to get inside. Even the bathroom was cool. Casual, cozy, romantic, elegant, sexy, dark. Bring your bestest friends or bring your date, not just any date, but that special someone that you want to discreetly steal a kiss from.
