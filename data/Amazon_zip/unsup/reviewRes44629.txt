We opted for delivery and the driver was too much in a hurry to deliver to our apt. so rather than argue we went down and brought it up. The spicy chicken, which we ordered mildly spicy, had 1-1/2 cups of dried red peppers and hardly any chicken. It was so hot that it was inedible. I'm not a sissy when it comes to spicy food, but this was ridicules. The mushu pork was awful and tasteless and the crab rangoon limp and cold. We ordered vegetable soup and it was so bland that we probably should have put a couple of the red peppers in it. $57.00 down the garbage disposal; we had to toss the meal.
