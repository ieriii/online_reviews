I would agree with most postings. Food was good, assortment of sides was nice. Great kimchee! We ordered the short ribs, chicken, and korean seasoned short ribs. Service was sub-par, we were seated for 10 minutes before a waitress took an order (4pm seating). The dining room quickly filled towards 5:30.  We were ushered out a little sooner than we would have liked, when the waitress came over asking "...so what's next?" So we downed the rest of our beers and headed out to Hopleaf. I would take friends here if they specifically requested Korean, although would not be somewhere I would make a point to go again. (distance from 'burbs) Common response to going to Korean BBQ: "When I go out to eat, I don't want to have to cook my food myself..."
