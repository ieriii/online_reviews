Part of me wants to give this resto five stars and part of me wants to give it 1 star, I'll give it two. I've been here four times. The first time, shortly after they opened was my best experience. Every time since then, I've had condescending servers. It's too bad the front of the house doesn't have half the sense of the humor that the kitchen has. It's made the last three meals there unpleasant.  On a different note, this ticket system is for the birds and I won't bother even trying to go to any of these restaurants or joining facebook or trying to score tickets. It's a waste of time, confusing and to be honest, insulting. I'll go to Next or Alinea if someone invites me and that's it.
