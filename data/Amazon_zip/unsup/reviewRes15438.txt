well once again...something else popped up in logan square. big surprise...it's cool.  we have been here twice. both times it's been for drinking only so i won't talk about the food. it is a brewery after all. (but hey...they have bacon popcorn...enough reason to go back right?) we went later in the evening and the place wasn't too crowded but i hear there is a dinner crowd and quite the wait. the interior is super cool. reclaimed wood from beer barrels from goose island. anyway, i think you need to check out their beers. they usually have about six or so on tap. if you aren't a beer drinker...they have a full bar but they also have other beers too! the crowd is cool and diverse and not snoooty.  the bartenders are super cool...they even turned up a dre song for us...just because we liked it. good stuff.
