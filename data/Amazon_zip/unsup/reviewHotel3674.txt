The Drake is one of the classic hotels in Chicago. Nowadays people seem to like modern hotels with large rooms, but for a touch of old-fashioned class and elegance the Drake is where it's at. It is basically the northernmost point of the Magnificent Mile. It faces Oak Street Beach with its well-known signage. The interiors are very ornate so there is no mistaking this as an average place to stay. The banquet rooms are magnificent settings for dinner parties and receptions.
