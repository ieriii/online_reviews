Bi Bim YUM YUM Bop! Crisp is a cute little Korean joint in the busy Broadway street full of multiple restaurants. This is by far one of the best places to grab cheap dinner on a weeknight. They're mostly well known for the Korean fried chicken. But ATTENTION VEGANS n VEGETARIANS!! There's options for us too. Not many, but a few really good ones. I'm a die hard fan of their bi bim bop bowls and you will be too, when you try them. They're healthy, filling and a great value for the buck.
