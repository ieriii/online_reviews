At long last I had the full Revolution experience. I had attended the Beer Fistival (yes, Fistival) earlier this year and had a good first impression. Now I can say I'm definitely a fan. I started at the bar, which has a great assortment of rotating Revolution brews (I was 2 days too early for the Belgian Trippel, DAMN), as well as some other choice beers on tap. I noted you could bring in your own jug and get it filled for $12. There is also a great variety of bottles. The service at the bar wasn't stellar, but I got my beer so I was happy. We ate as a group of 8, which wasn't a problem on a Monday at 6:30 (they do not take reservations). Here are my food picks in order of tastiness: -pork jowl ragout - sounded intriguing, was delicious. It was a tie for first with my stew, below. The dish was creamy, a perfect blend of sweet & savory and just generally delicious. I highly recommend it. -flemish beef stew - I agonized over whether to order this or the fish n' chips, but I think I made the right decision. Not a stew so much as a hunk of perfectly roasted beef in a delectable beer and balsamic gravy with delicious garlic cream cheese(!) mashing potatoes and some veggies. It's a big portion too, so hello lunch! -cheddar ale soup - this was crazy rich and tasted like Velveeta (in a good way). I liked it, but didn't love it the way I loved a similar soup at Prix Fixe in Lincoln Square. -hard cider mussels - I'm so disappointed to report that I didn't like the mussels. They were highly recommended and I'm a huge fan of mussels, but they were just too slimy for me.  -I didn't try these, but here are some general notes about other dishes: the burgers are huge and looked delicious, the corned beef on the reuben was reportedly dry, the salmon was beautifully presented and was gobbled up quickly and the fish n' chips came in a big portion and looked good. I will definitely come back to Revolution!
