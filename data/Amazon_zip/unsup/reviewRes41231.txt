Enjoyed the eight course dinner here with more hits than misses. All fish and seafood items were beautifully plated and bursting with flavor. The rabbit was gamey and uninspiring. Lobster bisque was tasty but served lukewarm. Short ribs were reminiscent of overcooked brisket. Loved the chocolate dessert. BYOB is a huge advantage with pricey per person charge. Servers are friendly and accommodating.
