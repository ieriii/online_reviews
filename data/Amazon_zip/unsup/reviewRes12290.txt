I came here for Sunday brunch with two friends, I kept telling them I wanted to go here because I heard such great reviews so I did not want to let them down. Our meal was delicious and all of us were full and satisfied! I enjoyed my Honey Jalapeno Pork Chops, actually it was just one pork chop but it was the right serving size for brunch and cooked very well too. The sauce was nice and had a little bit of spice which went well with the dish. My friends ordered the stuffed french toast and french toast w/ berries. The berries were a little much and made the toast soggy but I tried the stuffed and loved it. The whip cream they serve is the best I've ever had, the consistency is a little bit thick but still light enough to use a lot for a topping. The restaurant was clean and our waiter was very attentive, I would like to come back here for dinner next time.
