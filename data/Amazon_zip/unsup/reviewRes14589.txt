This is probably my favorite restaurant. I have been going here since the late 1970's. They make you feel like family here. The veal marsala is the best I have ever had. The portions are generous. They give you pizza bread and loaf of what seems to be fresh baked italian bread, soup and salad with your entree. Fabulous is the only word to describe. If you are celebrating a special romantic occassion you can reserve a private, romantic booth that gives the feeling of your own private room. It is also one of the few area restaurants that serve a delicious Baked Alaska desert. Don't miss this neighborhood gem on the Northwest side of Chicago. Easily beats out some of the more publicized Italian restaurants in downtown Chicago.
