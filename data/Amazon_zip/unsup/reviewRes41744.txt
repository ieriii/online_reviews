Came back here with a couple friends on a Saturday night and had probably the best meal I've had in Chicago (at least top 3). The first time I came was with my parents who don't eat meat so it was slightly limiting. This time I went with my friend who's a chef and we ordered pretty much everything on the menu. I won't comment on decor or ambiance etc since it's been covered (and is awesome) but the food was insane this time around. Every dish was better than the last and with 8 of them coming, getting right on every one is a tall order. I will definitely be coming back here as often as I can. Not to mention their lounge downstairs that they're gonna re-do soon into a ramen noodle bar which should be really interesting. Also Bavette's next door has an amazing basement area as well.
