The place ROCKS!!! Went before the Cubs Phillies game and we were worried they would close the doors as the line was to the backyard alley.  Waited for 1hr15 minutes and had the DOGS of our LIFE. Well worth the wait... owner is genuine as they come an the dogs exotic and tasty! Get there with plenty of time so you are not turned away from hot dog heaven.
