I first went to this place for an office party and liked the food and decor. So i have decided to try again and visited a couple of times since then. I never tried their brunch but the food on their Harvest table is awesome. I like how the chef brings the food and explains how and with what the food and sauces are made. Also, i happened to try their rooftop bar with friends and like their small plates food selection. The sliders and chicken samosas are great. Pros - location and ambiance, small plates menu, free restaurant shuttle(which is a huge deal in Chicago). Cons - quantity of food, Beer selection.
