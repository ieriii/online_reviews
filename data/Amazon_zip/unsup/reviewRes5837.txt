Took my sister, niece, and brother-in-law here when we visited Chicago. Overall we were impressed with the restaurant. The meals for the table were the filet trio, the turkey dinner special, the pork chops, and the roasted chicken. The pork chops came with two very thick chops with a crust on top. They were very good, and really could have been served with just one. I ad the au gratin potatoes with this, but they were not good. Too salty and the potatoes were not cooked all the way through. The filet trio came with three different crusts, with the horseradish crust being picked the favorite. The turkey dinner was also very good, with the gravy being voted one of the best gravies ever. The only disappointing meal was the roasted chicken. It was a half chicken that didn't fit on the plate and made it very difficult to eat. Also shared a small salad for the whole table, which was plenty. Server did a good job with our table and the restaurant was great about holding our reservation when we called to let them know we were running late. Overall a very positive experience.
