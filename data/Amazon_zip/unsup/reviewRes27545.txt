The four- and five-star reviews are correct. Most of the others are incorrect. The food is outstanding. I had a Gunthorp Farms duck breast in mole sauce with black bean cakes. The corn on the cob special is fun. The cocktails are really quite good too. Mezcal- or tequila-based for the most part. I don't see why anyone would complain about the food. Service is perfectly fine, informative, friendly, fast. I would suggest getting there 30 minutes before it opens or calling for one of its small number of reservations to ensure a seating. The line develops quickly.
