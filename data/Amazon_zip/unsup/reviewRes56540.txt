First Impression:I had heard a lot about this place and had big expectations but the decor was not what I expected. Fun and not stuffing. Outside had several nice table but the street was sort of loud. Drinks:Limeade- yummy!Food:We had lunch and it was great. We started with the cheese and chorizo dish was good but not good for you. This was followed by entrees. I had the Pescado en Mole Verde de Pepita. This was served with swordfish which I am not a big fan of. The waiter said he would see if they could substitute Maui Maui but when it came out it was swordfish. It was good but I was a little disappointed. My husband had the Puerco Oaxaqueno which was very good but simpler in flavor then expected. We finished with the flan duo which was yummy.I wished we had ordered the Cerviche trio because the people next to us did and seemed very pleased.Service:Spotty- we had several people waiting on us. My water glass was always full which was nice. I am not sure if we had a dedicated waiter but two different people took our dessert order while other times we could not get anyone to the table.BTW- we went for an early lunch on a Thursday and sat outside.
