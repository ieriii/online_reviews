I went there last night for an impromptu night out and was very impressed indeed. I'll admit, it was my second time at Shaw's, but my first time really letting loose and eating what this place is famous for - seafood! On my first trip over a year ago I think I ate chicken or something boring. Since discovering sushi (on a separate occasion at a different restaurant) my days of only eating land-lubbing cuisine are over. So I had the fresh crab combo and my first oysters ever. The food is awesome and they even keep some their crabs live so they are very fresh. The chopped salad was surprisingly memorable for a salad as well. I recommend eating in the oyster bar as it seems much more fun than the dining room. We had live music, a lively atmosphere and Arturo the fantastic bartender - it was great! The restaurant is very pricey, but definitely worth it if you want to treat yourself. Don't waste your stomach's space on anything but their seafood!
