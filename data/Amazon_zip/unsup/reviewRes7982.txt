This was, by far, the best dinner of the road trip. Though I was roadtripping on a shoe string budget, I decided to splurge for one night; This was well worth it. They had a wide variety of meats and many different cuts. The service was excellent. The salad bar was pretty tasty too.  However, I have to disagree with Jonathan C's helpful hint. I'm in the Joey Tribiani a la "Friends" camp here - your stomach needs to be warmed up before a big meal. Don't starve yourself before hand - you'll just get fuller more quickly. My friend and I, on the other hand, actually had a Vietnamese banh mi before we went, and we ate Fogo de Chao goodness until we were the last ones in the restaurant.
