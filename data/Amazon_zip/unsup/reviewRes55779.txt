We made reservations...good idea. They were very accomodating and it was pretty busy on Friday evening. We got there and sat down immediately. I read some of the other reviews...to be honest...i didnt even see pizza on the menu, i went right to the entrees and had the lasagna bolonese...delicious. Another of our party had the carbonara...also great. Prices were very moderate. Sadly we were not staying longer in Chicago or we would have taken the leftovers with us. We will definitely have to go back when in Chicago again.
