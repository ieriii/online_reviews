My boyfriend took me here for my bday. This place is awesome. It is a bit dark, but it sets the mood for a romantic place for two. Our waiter was very friendly and the food was amazing. I've had cheese fondu at other places before, but I've never actually got to cook the meat myself. That was fun. .  and the dessert was sooo good. I was definitely full when I left, i didnt expect so much food. If you havent been here yet, you gotta eat here!!!
