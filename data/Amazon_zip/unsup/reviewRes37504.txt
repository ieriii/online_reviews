My family and I were on vacation and were looking for a place to eat near Navy Pier and decided on this place based on other reviews on Yelp. Basically Fox & Obel is an upscale grocery store with a deli/restaurant in the back. The food, however, was good. I had the Turkey & Brie sandwich with Tomato Basil Soup. Both were better than what you normally get from a sandwich shop and I would order again. The seating area was decently sized, but it's not laid out well for navigating with a stroller. Other than that everything was good.
