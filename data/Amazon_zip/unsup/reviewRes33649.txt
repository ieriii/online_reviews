Every time I order from here I get myself a falafel (with Jerusalem salad), rice, and Vimto! (If you haven't tried this soda you absolutely must- it's raspberry, grape, and blackcurrant flavored, and it's to die for- I drank it growing up in England and this is the only restaurant I've found it in). Everything I've eaten here has been very tasty, the staff are friendly enough, and the portion sizes are generous. I like eating here, it makes me feel relatively healthy, and there's a great amount of vegan options. Edit: Have dropped it down to three stars, because they no longer seem to have Vimto, and the last couple times we've ordered delivery the service and food quality have been pretty sub-par. If you're up for a trip, check out Taste of Lebanon instead.
