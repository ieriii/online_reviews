This is a 3.5 star rating. I went there with my boyfriend two days ago on New Year Eve to celebrate the new year as well as our anniversary for dinner and dance. The restaurant was nice and fancy enough for the occasion. We had prefix dinner and the food was pretty good. I had lamb shank and my boyfriend had steak. They both came out perfect just as we ordered, medium, pink in the middle, tasty and savory. However, the dessert was rather disappointing. They has chocolate bar, but everything on there was just soso, and the chocolate wasn't even as good as the ones I got from Trader Joe's--that's pretty sad.  They had a DJ for the night, but for some strange reason that he didn't play the new year song Aud lang syne at midnight, and we were waiting for that song so we could dance to it to welcome the new year and finish our night in a perfect romantic dance. But that didn't happen.  Overall, it was a pretty good experience. I just wish they had one or two really good desserts on the menu instead of the chocolate bar, and they had played that song. I think the bottom line is that I would go back again, but it's not on my priority list.
