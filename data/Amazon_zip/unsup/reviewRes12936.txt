I've been to Cafe 28 countless times, and I've never had anything that I didn't like. The food is sophisticated and beautiful. My only complaint is that the service, especially during lunch time, is PAINFULLY slow. Prepare to spend a good 2 hours at lunch if you go. I'd recommend take-out if you actually want a quick dining experience. Cafe 28 is also a little spendy in the wallet department, but the food is worth it.
