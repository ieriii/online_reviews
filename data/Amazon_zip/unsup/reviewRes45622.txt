Pub-chic. Best in genre. Gotta have one in every neighborhood, and now we do. But ours is wonderfully absent of smoke...although I bet you could find a fag if needed, as Wilde would have it. I had the beer cheddar soup and it was so very savoury and rustic. James at the bar is all you want in a tender. He's attentive w/out hovering, cool, and learns your name! -extra star. Ambiance can't be more welcoming, yet has an entirely local demeanor. Lovely maitre d. The place is large but planned like an English pub au naturale with lots of wood....a living room/parlour with many nooks and I think 3 fireplaces for cozy goodness. It's public, buddyish, you can watch the game and chat it up w/your neighbor, or not, it's even romantic and away from tv noise, and yet you can even invite the family. Yes, an honest English pub lives in LakeviewEast. Wilde but true.
