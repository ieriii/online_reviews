Sabatino's is magical. I love the feel of the place, and I love the violin and guitar guys who visit the tables.  The food, by the way, is super awesome. You get a huge loaf of fresh bread to dip in olive oil. You also get yummy cheese, garlicy thing bread for FREE! Plus, with the pasta meals I've ordered, I get a big ol' salad and a soup! The fettucine is awesome, too. Fettucine can be plain at some places, but if it is made well, it's often the best thing around. It was GREAT! The staff is great, too. I love how there is a valet, even though the parking lot is fairly small. Also, when I was there last with my roommate, I got served the wrong soup. I tried telling the waitress that is was fine (and it was good!) but she insisted on taking it and replacing it. I know you may think that, yeah, that's what they should do... but on top of it! She also took my roommate's soup away so we could eat together. So roomie got 1 1/2 bowls of soup, and so did I!  I also like restaurants that have the rotating plastic on the toilets a la O'Hare airport....
