I really like the food here and so far, I haven't found anything that I didn't like. I usually get the bowtie chicken alfredo. It's cheap and you get a pretty good sized portion that I'm sure a lot of people can't finish. I was told about this place by a coworker who loves it so much. She said they have the best everything.
