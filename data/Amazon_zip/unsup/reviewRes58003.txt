Hands down my favorite Italian place in Chicago. The food on the changing menu is always excellent; more often than not I find myself struggling to decide between 2 or 3 of the dishes when choosing my order. The pasta itself is flavorful and cooked perfectly--never mushy. The establishment is usually loud and sometimes packed to the gills, but it never gives off a cramped or obnoxious feel. Service is good, friendly. A favorite place to go with friends to laugh or treat out-of-towners to a great meal.
