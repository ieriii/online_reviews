When I think of gastropub, L&E is the first and likely best example that comes to mind. Whether it's my wife's all-time favorite corn soup, excellent burgers with crisp & savory beef fat fries, a delicious wild boar sloppy joe, or the duck egg hash with duck confit and black truffle vinaigrette; it's all good. I've yet to feast on their dinner menu, but I've been here twice for brunch and had no issues getting a table right away. To top things off they pour 38 different whiskeys for a scant $3 a shot. If that alone doesn't merit five stars I don't know what does.
