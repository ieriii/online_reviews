6 months later, still pretty good, but I liked the spring menu much more than the winter menu (or is it fall?), the waiter gave me incorrect information (yes, there IS sauerkraut in sturgeon dish, just like menu says.... not just "sauerkraut flavored sauce around the rim of the plate") and even though they comped a birthday dessert (which is REALLY nice to do and much appreciated), and even though it was delicious, it was the wrong dessert, not the one we ordered!. Drinks are still great and still overall love the food and service (they were very nice about re-plating the sturgeon so the sauerkraut was put on the side), but MUSIC IS WAY WAY WAY too loud ; it is hard to feel like you are having a special meal when you have to shout to be heard.
