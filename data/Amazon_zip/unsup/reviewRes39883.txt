They gave us a lot of pickled veggies which were good but we didn't need that much. What we ordered were short ribs and ribeye. I was expecting it to be seasoned but the ribeye was not. The short ribs were fine. I was disappointing cuz I could have bought a piece of meat and grilled it at home. The tofu seafood soup we ordered was good. Its also more expensive than usual.
