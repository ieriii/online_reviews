If I knew any Oscar Wilde quotes about some place being surprisingly good I would put it here. The decor and structure of this bar is great. Nice wood, awesome bar, good table layout, and make sure to check out the sinks in the bathroom. The servers and bartenders are all great. Every time I've gone they're personable and the bartenders will give you a sample size of a beer if you want to try it before you buy it. The food is good and a very nice price. One thing to keep in mind is the front of the bar faces Briar St and during the night time anyone facing that way will be blinded by multiple headlights.
