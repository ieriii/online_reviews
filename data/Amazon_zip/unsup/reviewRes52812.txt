Amazing! Showed up as a group of 5 at 9:30 on Saturday night and they were able to seat us (although I think we were really lucky - the place was packed). Server was exceptional; ambiance was perfect - it was dark, with lovely piecemeal decorations (sewing machine on our table, different types of chandeliers hanging by thick rope, nice fireplace); food was delicious and the price was perfect (came out to $35/person) which included appetizers for the table as well as entrees for everyone. We sat in a covered area outside and the temperature was nice and warm). I got the Oxtail for dinner and it was UNBELIEVABLE. Salty, but in a delicious way! I used to live in Manhattan and moved to the River North/Gold Coast area - I've been looking for a place with such character since I moved here - the taxi was well worth it!
