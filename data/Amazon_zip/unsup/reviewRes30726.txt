Almost went 4 stars , but I want to visit again to be sure. While we had a great time here, with incredibly fresh fish and well balanced food, the question we had was with a menu that large, can they really do everything "well"? The sushi, like I said was fesh and the combination/specialty rolls creative. The special Sashimi for teh night was again, perfect. We even had desert which is seldom the case as the "ridiculous" was too tempting to pass up. I later fell asleep on the couch at home in a carb coma after consuming the tempura fried ice cream, wrapped in carrot cake with caramel and sweet toasted walnuts. Cocktail menu was storng as well with the Pear Sake being our favorite. We will dig into teh expansive Sake menu on the next trip
