Me and chicken are like this. You can't see it but my fingers are crossed right now. If I didn't know any better I'd say I'm genetically predisposed to like chicken.  I truly believe that if chickens had a choice of where they'd be served, they'd all make their way to Crisp. It's that good. My first experience here led to me to the Chi town Chicken Korean burrito. An Asian spin on a Mexican classic sounds taboo but they somehow found a way to make it work. On top of that they have these two homemade sauces, one spicy, one savory, they keep on the table that are the icing on the cake. The next time I had the wings with the Seoul Sassy sauce.  Like others have said, some of the best fried chicken you've ever had. Crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside and slightly addictive. You've been warned.
