4.5 Stars I agree with what a lot of people have already said on Frontera Grill -- the food is wonderful and it's always a treat to eat here and don't think it ever disappoints. Great drinks too -- the Margaritas as amazing. I've lived in CA and spent time in Mexico -- and while I think Ed M has a point -- it's not always possible to go to San Francisco, San Diego or Mexico -- and in my case Chicago is a little closer and Frontera is great -- I think Rick Bayless is not adequately appreciated in our new food celebrity vs chef trend -- and he is really good with meats -- especially grilled.
