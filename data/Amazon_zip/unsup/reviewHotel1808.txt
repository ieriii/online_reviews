Not a fan at all. 1.) Noisy- next to the L. One day there was also amplified music outside at 6AM which woke me up- told management but they did not seem to care 2.) Generally good service (most folks really tried) but had the front desk get snarky with ,me for their screw-up, separately eff up my reservation, and make me wait about 20 mins to check out on a third occasion.  3.) Ws are great for hipsters- they're not great if you're traveling for business. Little things (like think lights that are actually bright) just aren't there 4.) This part of town is dead after dark, so don't expect to walk to dinner unless you're not picky. 5.) The gym sucks even by hotel gym standards For the price, not worth staying here. Marriott, I think I'm coming back!
