Since I now am a passenger on the no-meat train...I tried the grilled cheese at SuperDawg the other day. Yea, I know, but oh well! It was great!! You get an option of dark rye or a bun- I chose the dark rye and was lovin every minute of it! Loaded with cheese and served with some tomatoes...a very delicious meal! Their fries are great- always crunchy and never soggy. SuperDawg satisfies once again....
