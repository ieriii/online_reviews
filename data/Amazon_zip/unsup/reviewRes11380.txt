Being lactose intolerant, I never thought I'd get to review a pizza place. For me, their plain pizza (no parmesan) with goat cheese is a winner regardless of the toppings you choose. My preference is green peppers, italian sausage and pepperoni. My husband is a lover of all things cheese and he even loves this pizza. Also, I somehow think their red pepper flakes are made of magic. The baked goat cheese appetizer is really good. And I've never had a beer from their brewery that sucked. Golden Arm and Full Frontal are my personal faves. So good.
