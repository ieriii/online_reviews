I was in a foul mood when we headed to L&E for dinner with friends. We arrived pretty early and were told we'd have to wait about an hour and a half, which put me even more down in the dumps. I had previously checked out the menu and being a rather unadventurous eater, I wasn't very excited. Fast forward about 60 minutes and two beers later, we were seated. We started with a few appetizers but the one that struck me was the olives. I was expecting (especially from a Michelin star restaurant) about four olives on the plate. There were tons of them in the little bowl and I ate more than my fair share. I got one that had already been pitted that tasted like it had balsamic vinegar marinade in it and we all spent the rest of the bowl searching for another one like it because it was so good. I settled on the burger and it was one of the best I've ever had. Every element of it was perfect and it all went together flawlessly. I can't even tell you how delicious the beef fat fries were. I had a bite of one of the desserts but I can't even remember which one it was because I was in such a food coma of happiness from olives, burger and fries. I'm not a huge fan of long waits but I'd go back in heartbeat for that yummy cheeseburger! By the time we left, I was in excellent spirits.
