Cozy atmosphere with the romantic vibe, super awesome bartender and waiter, and sensational European food. It's The Purple Pig. We went there for lunch just to get something light and were overwhelmed by interesting and creative items on the menus. The menu was presented tapas-style with lots of smaller dishes that ranged from $5 to $15. We sat at the bar and ordered scallop spiedini with chickpea aioli, pig's tails braised in balsamic and my favorite.. pig's ear with crispy kale, marinated cherry peppers & fried egg. The food was delicious. It also had great texture and lovely presentation. Huge wine/beverage selection was a plus. I wished we could try them all that day. With that said, I'd definitely come back to try other items. Now add purple to my favorite color!
