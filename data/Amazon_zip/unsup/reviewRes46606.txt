RJ Grunts ROCKS! This place is always crowded, but has a great home-y feel to it! I've been there many times (I can't recall) and have always tried something different. The salad bar is ginormous, and is a vegetarian's dream some true. You come to RJ Grunts for beer and burgers mainly. Their chili is also great, and their temperature soups are a great deal! I love their bufflo-style anything!
