I have a split opinion on Pequod's. The pizza is a unique take on Chicago-style deep dish that's one of my favorites. The crust is unusually crisp for this style, and the caramelized edges give their pies a delicious, deep flavor that I love. Eating at this place can be a nightmare, though. First - if you have anywhere else you're thinking of going on a weekend, go there instead. The dining room is a shit show of bitchy 20-something staff and customers trying to edge their way into the bar for most of the evening on the weekends that's really not worth bothering with. If you're a grown up, do not go here on a weekend night. Also, they will tell you that they take reservations - do not believe it. This is basically a college pizza place, they do not have the ability to actually reserve a time, or if they do they will ignore you anyway for anyone who got their pager from the host desk before you. Again, for emphasis - DO NOT BELIEVE THEM WHEN THEY SAY THEY TAKE RESERVATIONS. TL;DR - Go for the pizza, but take it for carry out.
