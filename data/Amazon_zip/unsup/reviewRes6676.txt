The best way to describe the restaurant is "upscale BBQ." The environment is nice and the wine room is great for a group of around 20.  Dinner started off with BBQ chips and pickles... a great way to open up the pallet. The wait staff shared that Chef Lee Ann Whippens faced Bobby Flay on "Throwdown".  APPETIZERS FRIED GREEN TOMATOES - Thick cuts of green tomato with crunchy crust and dill cream sauce. The crust was a little heavy but it worked well with the sauce.  BBQ SHRIMP and LEMON INFUSED-GRITS - Nice large shrimp but really didn't taste the lemon. MAIN The way the do BBQ is that it's a dry rub and provide with four sauces (Regular BBQ Sauce, Vinegar BBQ Sauce, Mustard and Spicy BBQ Sauce) http://www.yelp.com/biz_. I enjoyed the Spicy best but they were all good. SALMON STEAK http://www.yelp.com/biz_ The asparagus was very good. The salmon is grilled with crisp skin and was recommended medium. It was ok but it lent itself well to the BBQ sauce. SIDES BRULEED MACARONI and CHEESE http://www.yelp.com/biz_ - the mac & cheese is a solid side but not spectacular. Would have hoped for a bit more "brulee". DESSERT MILK & COOKIES http://www.yelp.com/biz_ Chocolate Chip, Oatmeal with Cranberries and Candied bacon, White Chocolate Apricot Almond Bar. Friends said the bacon was nice and smokey but didn't provide enough savoriness. Was expecting more out of the the Almond bar... it was good but didn't really taste all the ingredients. KEY LIME PIE http://www.yelp.com/biz_ - Very creamy with a light lime flavor... almost tasted like cool whip on a crust. The waitress also recommend the STRAWBERRY INFUSED CHEESECAKE but like the Grits the flavor wasn't there. Overall the service was excellent and the food was solid. Good environment great for groups. Wish they would have stronger options for non meat eaters but overall pretty much what you'd expect for an 'upscale bbq' restaurant... 3.5.
