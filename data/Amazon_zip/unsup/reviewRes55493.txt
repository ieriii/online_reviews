I read the reviews before going here and although some were not good I wanted to try it. I should have listened to those reviews! My husband ordered a pork dish and had to send it back. It was all fat and the part that wasn't was extremely hard to chew. He then got the cod dish which was only ok. I ordered pasta with plain red sauce since I don't eat meat. The undercooked pasta was drenched in sauce and reminded me of chef-boy-r-dee from when I was a kid, just a sloppy meal. We eat dinner out about 6 nights a week and this was just a HUGE disappointment. The restaurant is nice inside and we enjoyed it when was Thyme a few years ago. We won't go back.
