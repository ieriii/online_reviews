Defintiely the best new bar to open in the past year. Great drinks, cool dimily lit decor, laid-back vibe (great for a date), and great eclectic music selction (Frank Sinatra followed by Animal Collective followed by Nick Cave). I've always come early so never had to deal with the wait. My only complaint is that it sometimes can seemingly take forever to get your drinks (esp. annoying when the table next to us came in after us, ordered after us, and got their drinks first). Still, drinks are so unique and well done, I'm willing to wait.
