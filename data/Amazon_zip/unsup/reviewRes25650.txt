A friend took me here for my birthday. This was my first fondue experience, so I am going to make my first Yelp review talk about my first fondue experience. Atmosphere: The waiter was impeccably professional, polite and entertaining. They had a wonderful flamenco guitarist to provide background music. The room is dark and romantic, even if you are a little too close to other people's tables. Food: The cheese fondue was probably my favorite part. I would have been happy to eat that all night. Cooking the meat in oil was fraught with problems for my overanalytical, perfectionist side--what if I leave it in a little too long??? Does this look done??? But you can't fault Geja's for that. Chocolate fondue for dessert was delicious, as was the little cake they gave me for my birthday. Price: A little pricey, but they give you a $25 gift certificate towards your next meal with the check, so that eases the pain a little. I'll be back any time I can find an excuse.
