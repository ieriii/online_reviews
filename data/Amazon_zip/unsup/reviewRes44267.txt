Wakamono is a fun sushi restaurant with a good product. The overall vibe is sleek, but tounge-in-cheek. No one is striving for authenticity, just a good time. The short review: It was the best parts of a Little Buddha without the pretense or prices. We started with a pair of specialty drinks and gyoza. The drinks were really good, and the one on special was almost affordable. The gyoza was better than most I've had, which id saying something because it's always good. We had a mix of traditional and specialty rolls, including both that were discounted that night. My liberal guilt of over-fishing kept us from buying any tuna, even though it was staring at me through the counter. Everything was on-par with what you'd expect from a quality sushi restaurant. The one stand-out, in both name and flavor, was the Yo La Mango. Judging by the tables around us, I wasn't the only one announcing my indie-creds. We sat at the counter, but it wasn't the chatty experience you sometimes get. The chefs had their heads in the work, but were still nice enough to show us the rolls before they went out. Even if the meal didn't blow me away, we both had such a great time it deserves 5 stars. Everything just worked.
