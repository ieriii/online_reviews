I've been here a couple of times for dinner and have been pretty impressed overall. That's not to say that every dish is superb, but most of the ones I've tried have been very good. Here's a breakdown of my most recent meal here. There were four of us, and we opted to order a variety of dishes to share (this is what the waitress recommended). For starters, we got cheese and fig jam on toast, which was excellent. We also ordered the marinated beet salad, which I have to say was a huge disappointment. I love beets, but the marinade that was used in this salad completely overpowered any beet flavor. In fact, the dish tasted more like perfume or soap than food. It was quite bizarre. For the main course, we ordered the pork belly, truffle pasta, and a short rib pasta dish. Of the three, my favorite was the truffle pasta, which I easily could have polished off by myself. The other pasta dish was also good, but I'm not a big beef eater. The pork belly was quite tasty. We split two desserts: an apple cake and carrot cake, both of which were equally delicious. The service was good overall, but I did feel like the waitress was rushing us a bit at times. She was also very particular about how things were arranged on our table. For example, there was a pile of appetizer plates in the middle of the table and she found it imperative to distribute the plates to us as we were still perusing the menu. It seemed a bit anal considering that we weren't even eating anything yet. Those are really small issues, though. Overall, the food here is really good and the atmosphere is nice. I definitely plan to return.
