Can't believe I forgot about Piece- haven't been here in forever. I love this place. You throw their beer selection in the mix with some of the best thin-crust pizza and fresh toppings and I'll be there. Piece is a great place to check out with a group of friends, but it's always insanely crowded so prepare yourself. I'm a fan of the Plain pizza (cheeseless). Just ask for some extra sauce and you're in business. A little advice: don't go crazy on the toppings, only because- since the slices are thin, you don't want to weigh it down too much. Also, the crust is delicious, so don't be one of those people who eat the entire slice but the crust. You're better than that.
