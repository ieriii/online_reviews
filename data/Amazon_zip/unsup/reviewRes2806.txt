I still (after many years) can remember the taste of the octopus here, so I figured I should review it as I'm sure the quality and food have not changed. I think this is one of my very top meals in the city. I had the larger tasting menu when I visited Tru - it was phenomenal. The caviar staircase was so good, I could have eaten 10 of them as my meal instead (or, so I thought before I saw the other courses as they get better throughout the meal). The octopus was so fantastic - I wish I could get it again. It was so thin, it looked like a design on the plate. This dish seemed to have only been seasoned with salt and pepper and it was so.so.good! I hope it's still on the menu! Everything was delicious. We didn't do a full wine pairing, but had the wine director choose appropriate wines as necessary. I liked that we were not pushed to have the most expensive options, but were given true recommendations based upon the food. All of the picks were great. The dessert was out of this world. I have to say, I think Gale Gand is super (I have a cook book of hers) and I've enjoyed both making items from the cookbook and eating her creations at Tru. I especially liked the little take home pastry things (sorry, I don't recall their official name!). Service, as one would expect from this type of restaurant, was perfect. I didn't find it stuffy, but actually quite friendly and warm. The space is beautiful and it's really an enjoyable spot to sit and take in the event that is dinner here. Due to the price, I would consider this a special occasion spot, but it's well worth it. The quality is flawless and this restaurant is definitely worth a visit.
