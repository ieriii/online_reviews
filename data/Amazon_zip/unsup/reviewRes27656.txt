YUM. my husband and i had dinner here last saturday night. We decided to order 4 appetizers and share an entree as we couldn't decide on just 2! we had the risotto, gnocchi, buffalo chicken and shrimp ceviche and the skate as an entree. The shrimp ceviche and buffalo chicken were our favorites and the skate was delicious. I thought the portions were a nice size and the service was great (love the unlimited sparkling water for $5!). For dessert do not miss the roasted corn one!  we will definitely be back!
