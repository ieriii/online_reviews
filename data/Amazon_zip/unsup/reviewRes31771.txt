I've been eating at the diner for several years now. I've only had one dish that hated (the brunch Monte Cristo). I order the Reuben with mashed potatoes and diner gravy almost every time I go. They constantly update the menu and keep it fresh, though there are definitely some dishes that I miss (chick'n parmesan sandwich!). And the addition of sweet potato fries was a great one. Eat here! and order the vegan cheesecake!
