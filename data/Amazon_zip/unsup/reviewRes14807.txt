My husband and I just got back from an early dinner at Sabatino's. I am still basking in the glow of the best fettucini alfredo I've ever had. Ever!!! My husband loved his minestone and manicotti. We got free cheesy/pizza bread to nibble on before our meal came. Everything just tasted absolutely amazing and had a lot of flavor. I've been to Sabatino's a few times years ago and always enjoyed it.... but this time for some reason everything tasted even better. We got our own little private booth too, which I didn't even know they had! Yes it's old, yes it's kitschy, yes the servers are sometimes slow but omg seriously, the food is so freaking good I don't even care. I love having Sabatino's in my neighborhood.
