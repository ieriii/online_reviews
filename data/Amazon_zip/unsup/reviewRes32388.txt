I'll make this quick and easy. Why 4 stars? - Wonderful food - Helpful and polite waitress (we were a party of 22. Trust me she could've lost her mind a few times) - BYOB - They asked us if we had any discount coupons at the end of the meal (nobody else has ever done that) Why not 5 stars? - We had a 9:00 pm reservation and our table was ready at 9:20. On a cold spring night, it's impossible for 20 people and 2 children to stand in the waiting area without being stared at by EVERYONE!!
