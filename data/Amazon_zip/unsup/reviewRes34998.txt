We call it 'candy sushi' for their creative, yummy rolls. Its a favorite among my girlfriends who want a place to come for great food and quiet, relaxed atmosphere. In the many dozen times that I have been here, I have only had to wait for a table once. My personal favorites are the Honey and Spider rolls, and I also love the Hibachi Scallops & Shrimp dishes.
