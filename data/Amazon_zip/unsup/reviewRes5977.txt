I know everyone always raves about this place, but I had a less-than-amazing experience dining here. I took my boyfriend here for his birthday and we were both excited for a delicious, juicy, RARE steak. When my steak arrived, it was comparable to hamburger meat... it was terribly overcooked and appeared well-done.  When I told our waitress that it was far too overcooked (which I absolutely HATE doing), she first insisted that I cut into the middle of the steak to ensure that the whole thing was too overcooked. I'm sorry, but if I'm paying $35 for a steak, I'm not only paying for the center to be cooked how I ordered it. After our wonderful **cough** waitress finally admitted that the steak was WAY overcooked, I had to wait almost 15 minutes for a new one to arrive! I was extremely disappointed that I would have to pay so much for such a terrible experience. However, in the end, the steak that actually came back rare was pretty delicious.
