So great! Our dinner last night was wonderful. The service was perfect, and the food was excellent. It's a pricey excursion, but it was well worth it. My boyfriend and I started off at the oyster bar and split a half dozen. Super fresh and delicious. I also had some sort of berry martini. Mmmm.... a little sweet and a little tart....a few of those could definitely do some damage.  We moved into the main dining room for dinner. The Alaskan King Crab legs are amazing-- I don't think I've seem crab legs this large. They also butterfly them for you, so that you can eat them politely, and not look like some sort of scavenging animal during a date.   They ran out of the dessert sampler plate, so we finished off with the Key Lime Pie instead. It was great-- nutty crust and tart and creamy inside-- it was actually too decadent for the two of us to finish. UPDATE: Got to try the dessert sampler this time-- awesome and more awesome. The sampler had key lime pie, a really excellent creme brulee, a tiny piece of pecan pie with it's own tiny cup of hot fudge (excellent), and their signature raspberry pie, which pretty much tastes exactly like summer. And the best part is when you get little samples of each, nothing is too decadent to finish.
