Go to Schwa if you can. It was my 18th birthday dinner, and this meal kicked the ass of my dad's 60th birthday at L20 a year ago. The service was great, the food was amazing, and the entire experience was laid back in a way no other fine dining experience would be. We ordered the 9 course meal, but ended up with 12 dishes (possibly thanks to a bottle of wine gifted to the kitchen crew). Highlights included a fig and scallop dish, the infamous quail egg ravioli, a smore with campfire smoke, and the perfectly cooked octopus with pineapple. As the night ended I made a trip through the kitchen to the bathroom. On my way Chef Carlson asked how the meal was. I said it then, i'll say it again, it was amazing. Thank you Schwa and Chef Carlson, you deserved at least 2 stars, if not 3.
