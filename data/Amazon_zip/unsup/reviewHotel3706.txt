I searched long and hard for the perfect wedding venue. I wanted somethign classic and elegant and somewhat moody. This was the place I had my heart set on after we saw it a while back while attending a close friend's wedding. Just to make sure I didn't put my eggs all in one basket, I went to look at several other venues such as the River East Arts Center, The University Club of Chicago, Metropolitan Club, and Spiaggia. Nothing read Chicago elegance like the Drake. Kate Strause was amazing from the day we said we wanted our wedding here, up until the day after our wedding, when she arranged to have some belongings we forgot at the hotel delivered to my brother's house. Every little detail was perfectly in order and made our wedding feel truly 5-star without any "attitude," which was very important to the both of us. She even helped us with our strict kosher requirements and was an excellent liason with Daniziger, our caterer.
