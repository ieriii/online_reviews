Tru was just not up to what it should have been. The service was excellent, if a little cold. But the food was not up to snuff for a place like this. When I'm spending $250+ per person, I want to be blown away by the chef's creativity and have a wonderful memory to hold me until I can dine at another super high-end restaurant (which is infrequent, but I have been to several so I know what to expect). Some of the dishes weren't just boring, they were actually bad. If you really want to go, I suggest the dessert tasting. The desserts were wonderful and amazing and didn't disappoint a bit.
