Great beer menu. But then again, what place in Chicago doesn't have a huge craft beer selection?  The burger was the best I've had in this city. I guess that's all you'd come here for anyways so they don't really need to do do anything else to prove successful. It's nothing amazing, but if you want really good beer choices and great burger options that aren't over fried and greasy like Kuma's, then you'd come here.
