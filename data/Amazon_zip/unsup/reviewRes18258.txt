A positive but mixed experience. Sever was enthusiastic and personable, and made good recommendations. the outside seating area is very pleasant and is off the main drag on Lincoln. Wine list is short, as it is much more of a beer place, but well chosen and fairlty priced. The starter of grilled eggplant (with tomato, goat cheese, and basil oil, I believe) was complex and delicious.  Also, the Mexican flavored pork sandwich was good. The crisp edges of the pork cutlet stood out. But the sauce needed more zip. And now we come to the pork belly burger, because it is primarily a burger place. This was a bit of a disappointment. The MR order came out MW (no visible pink in meat), and that should not happen at a place like this. The flavors were a bit of a jumble, more ambitious in the concepting than skillful in the execution. And the garlic oil on the fries sounded good, but the oil rendered the fries limp. They needed to be more crisp. All in all a solid choice, but not a candidate for best burger.
