Beautiful hotel. Perfectly located. The rooms although stunningly decorated are a bit small. This is a hotel to visit if you want the extravagant atmosphere. It is very large and although there are many entrances and exits (it covers an entire block) it is a bit like being a hotel hostage. There is a starbucks and many other shops to enjoy which is nice.
