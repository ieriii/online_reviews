This is the best place in the universe!!! I would like to give more than 5 stars...I LOVE HOT DOUG'S. I do everything humanly possible to cut out early and get lunch here at least once a week. The fries are the best, the plain old hot dogs are so much better than anywhere else, and the other selections are always enticing. They have veg. options too, and a fun selection of drinks. Great music, other customers are usually friendly and willing to talk if you want to...The staff is super nice, and when they remembered my name I felt very special...It's worth the wait x's 100!
