REALLY GREAT...WITH ONE BIG CAVEATFantastic sandwiches - among the best in recent memory. The chroizo was perfect, lots of great flavors that worked really well together. Complimentary sparkling water is a great touch as well.HOWEVER...if you've ever had hot chocolate in Barcelona, you will be VERY disappointed by their Barcelona hot chocolate, which is like to real Barcelona hot chocolate the way Manischewitz Extra Heavy Malaga is to a bottle of vintage Chateau d'Yquem. If you drive all the way downtown expecting Barcelona-style hot chocolate you will be, like me, a not very happy camper.
