I've been here a handful of times. It has a New York style restaurant feel with the shared tables. The atmosphere is always lively with tons of people. Reservations are hard to get for the weekends; for walk-ins they have a lounge area in the front of the restaurant where the wait time is less. Upon first looking at their menu the variety of food is all over the place so I wasn't sure if it would be good. We had the "No you didn't...the ultimate handroll" it was a little spicy but had a great taste and good combination. I had the chilean sea bass and we also ordered the duck. Both entrees were great! I wasn't too impressed with their drinks (maybe we just had a bad bartender) I ordered a simple kettle tonic and it wasn't great. Overall a good place but the atmosphere is really what makes it great.
