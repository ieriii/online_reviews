You must try this place it you are in Chicago! This thing is like a mix between pizza, pie and lasagna. I don't think it is physically possible to eat it without a fork, but then again... I'm not a Chicagoin... Chicagite...Chicagoer... whatever.  The crust is flaky and delicious topped with thick sauce and stuffed with cheese and whatever else you would like. I went with pepperoni and absolutely loved it. I can not wait to go back for more. The restaurant itself s nothing special, but the pizza is definitely worthy of 5 stars. This spot has a great local feel to it and makes you feel like you are part of the city.
