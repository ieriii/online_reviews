It's a small restaurant that serves the original korean style fried chicken (whole birds) along with BiBimbop (Buddha Bowl) and Burritos. When you walk in, there's a set of menu to your left, review it and know what you want so you don't hold up the line, especially if you are a first timer. Ordered the whole chicken with 1/2 Sassy Seoul and the other 1/2 with Crisp BBQ along with Onion Rings. Once you order, you pay and they will call your name when the food is ready, yes, it's a self service.  The food comes out within 10 minutes, unless it's busy... when we got there, it wasn't that busy, maybe around 8 people.... Seoul Sassy - this is probably the best sauce... it's little sweet and works well with the chicken. Crisp BBQ - it's bit on the salty side... so if you don't like food on the salty side, stick with Seoul Sassy.  Onion Rings - it was crispy and good.. in my humble opinion, most likely it's not made in-house. If you use Yelp, then make sure you check in prior to ordering, as they usually offer specials... for example on the day I went, they offered whole chicken, two sides and two drinks for $20.... I paid $22 for my order, so make sure you check-in on Yelp first.
