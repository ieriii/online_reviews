All in all it was a pretty good stay, the rooms clean and they pride themselves on being green, so that's A-OK. The front desk staff pretty friendly, but they did shove a overnight parking bill under my door with no explanation - I did not drive here!   But the irksome thing was the construction noise, even after changing rooms the noise at night was bothersome, so caveat emptor!
