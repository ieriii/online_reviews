The hubs and I went back here and it was still awesome! He got the comel(i probably spelled that wrong) it was basically fajitas but AWESOMER. I got the Cuban pork chops... so thin and moist and yummy! This time I got the raspberry mojito and suck those down like there was gold at the bottom! so yummy too! Still great atmosphere and still great service and still one of my favorite places to eat in the city!
