Stopped in after hearing tons of good things about "THE Bayless." I read that the Ahogada torta was to die for and a must have. So I tried it and was less than thrilled! Half the sandwich was sopping wet and falling apart from sitting in the broth. Totatlly killed the nice texture of bread and it made it that the first half of the sandwich didn't taste like anything but the broth. I was not a fan of the broth either, it tasted kind of like blended salsa but with too much vinegar. It was ok for dipping, but not any good for just finishing up the extra by itself. The pork, onions and beans were all spot on, but I was just expecting more. I'll have to try something else another time, and maybe I can increase the rating for Xoco!
