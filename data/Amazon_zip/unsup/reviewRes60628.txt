I really enjoyed the ambiance. The dcor is very homey, warm, and welcoming. Waiting in line for our table (about a 30 minute wait), every dish passing by looked amazing! Good presentation. I truly believe my experience was due to our waitress, Abra. She was SO welcoming! Funny! I truly enjoyed her presence. I ordered several things off the menu. I was impressed with 3 of the 5. The other two were Good. I would definitely eat there again. I wish I saved room for dessert because the desserts looked and smelled amazing. I would recommend the Spinach Dip and the Winter Vegetable Soup. Both were marvelous! I know veggie soup, amazing, but it really was! I could have just had that! The only complaint was that one of the gentlemen I was with ordered his burger medium and it came out well done. Simple mistakes like that loose a star because if you're going to charge $10+ for a burger it better be done right! Overall, wonderful and I will be eating there again!
