Doug has mastered the art of encased meats. The game of the week is quite interesting: some top ones include the elk sausage, gator, duck. The chorizo is remarkable but you may want to take a few days to eat it or your tummy might pay for it in the morning. Oh the line...and those annoying hours, and closed on Sunday. These should all be knocks against the place, but quite frankly, I really have to respect the fact that he doesn't give a damn.
