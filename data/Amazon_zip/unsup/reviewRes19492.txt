This place is excellent... I had heard multiple good reviews for this Wicker Park/Buck Town hot spot and finally got to try it for myself. It lived up to all expectations. Great date spot... BYOB certainly helps too. Wish I could offer more suggestions, but we went with pretty much what everyone else suggested... Edamame and Seaweed Salad to start. Can't go wrong with these... We also got the King Crab Roll, Po' Boy Roll, and White Dragon Roll. All were very good and I would recommend. Next time I hope to step outside the box a little. Atmosphere is great though, and we went on a Sunday night at 6:30 and there was no wait. Saturday however might be a different story as I have heard but worth it.
