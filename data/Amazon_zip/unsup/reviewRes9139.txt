I visited this place for the first time last weekend. I was very pleased with the whole experience. They set you up when you walk in with a basket of pita (that they will constantly refill) and give you a pitcher of water for the table. The humus was excellent (and I am a huge critic of humus, so that is pretty good). My friend and I both got vegetarian dishes- zucchini dish & the Poobla something? Both were interesting and excellent. We got baklava to take home, which was pretty good as well. The waiter was extremely friendly and helpful as was the general staff. It was overall an excellent dining experience.
