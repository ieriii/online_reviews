I live in the area. Finally I got over to yolk for breakfast. I went on a Thursday around 7 or 8 am. It was not very busy at all. This was nice because I have seen a pretty good wait walking by here on weekend mornings. I have the California omlette. At least it had avocado involved (must be a CA omlette, right?) I was very please. Big healthy portion that will not leave you walking away hungry. Price was also quite reasonable around $10. The waiter never let my coffee empty and was more than attentive and kind. I wouldn't recommend to friends. It isn't anything too off the beaten path. P.S. They make muffins and various baked breakfast things fresh each day so go early and get them fresh :)
