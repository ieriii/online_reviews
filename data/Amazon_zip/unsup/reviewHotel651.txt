This DoubleTree did not let us down, it was exactly to the standard that we expected. We did have a bit of a hard time with the room keys which was annoying but the staff was quick to fix any problems or issues we brought up. The beds are very comfy and the bathroom are large with nice showers. My only gripes were that they have a super-ultra-modern theme and big 'ol tube TVs in the rooms from 1990... it might be time to upgrade, oh and the wifi is $10/per day if you want it in your room, it's only free in the lobby, which was pretty blah if you ask me. Good location though, walking distance to lots of fun stuff, Michigan Ave, Navy Pier, restaurants etc.
