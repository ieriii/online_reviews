My previous review was nothing, but glowing. However, after a recent visit to Icosium, I have decided to downgrade the rating. They still serve the same tasty food, but the portions have dwarfed in size, on top of hiking up the prices. The salad we used to frequently order, now costs about $15.00, after tax and has shrunk to about 3/4 of the size it was before. Sure, the menu states to create your own salad it is $10.00, but an additional $4.00 to add a meat. Really, for a few small pieces of chicken-- $4.00?! It's plain ridiculous. What we loved about coming to Icosium was that it was inexpensive for fresh, delicious food. This place isn't a high-end establishment by any means, so what's with the high-end prices for a salad? Oh, by the way, they only take cash now. No more credit cards. We won't be paying Icosium a visit any time again soon, which is quite sad.
