I'm breaking my own no-5-stars-based-on-a-single-meal rule here. Yes, it's that good. Like many Yelpers do, I began formulating this review in my mind well before the meal was done. And I'm still struggling with whether to write a serious, superlative-filled rave or simply a string of guttural moans. Please know that it was a toss up. The food is unbelievable. Started with the fried calamari: perfectly breaded, perfectly crispy, and served with the best marinara sauce I've ever tasted. I'm not a big bread eater but I was quick to make my own ad hoc bruschetta with the leftover sauce. Next we had the caprese salad: fresh, simple, and delicious. Amazing how 4 simple ingredients (mozzarella, tomato, basil, and olive oil) can marry so perfectly. Yes, this is a little over the top, but best basil I can remember tasting. The entrees were the crescendo: Baby Back ribs were falling off the bone tender. No idea why they even gave me a knife. Marinated in milk, honey, and thyme, this is one of the best things I've ever eaten. The rabbit ravioli, served in a burnt butter/wine/cream sauce was also superb. I realize that this sounds rich/heavy but in reality was subtle & delicate, and the flavor profile was the work of a genius. If I had to pick one of these to order again I'd go with both. The service was also warm and on point. Perfect spacing between dishes, never an empty wine glass. The best meal I've had in a long time. Can't wait to come back.
