There were 10 of us going to Carnivale for a birthday party on Saturday night, and the evening started out omniously. First, they had put our reservation down for the wrong evening, so our group of 10 that arrived at 8 p.m. on a Saturday night was told they may or may not be able to accommodate us. I was scared this was going to be a bad sign. Instead, we chose to wait it out at the fun and expansive bar area, which ended up being a good choice. We finally were seated at 10:15, after several rounds of the Mango Margaritas (very recommended.) The food was good and worth the wait - not the best "Nuevo Latino" I've ever had, but it was quality, the restaurant was festive and our server was pretty outstanding. The ceviches were ok - the guac was great and the fufu that comes with the pork chop is amazing. I would definitely give it another go around.
