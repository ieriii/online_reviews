Wow what a let down. Honestly with all the hype I heard about this place (just like its neighbor Big Star) I thought we were in for an awesome good time. We didn't even stay 20 minutes. The decor was pretty and it felt perfect for a date or for couples in general. But I really think that people think its so good just cause they've heard how it is SO good. Our waitress was friendly but took way too long. I think I was just really disappointed because of all the hype. The music they were playing killed my buzz....country doesn't go with shabby chic. We literally went running out of the place.
