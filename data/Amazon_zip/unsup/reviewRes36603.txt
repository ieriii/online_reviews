I drive by this place all the time and finally had the opportunity to check it out. It was Halloween weekend 2011. We arrived before 6pm on Saturday and were seated immediately. The place was practically emply, but that's why I like to dine early. The menu was huge and we enjoyed reading it. However, at least 15 minutes passed and no one came to take our order. We noticed that several servers were at a back table doing each other's makeup and taking photos. Seemed like they were all dressed as cats. Anyway, I set my alarm for another 5 minutes. Totally ignored. We got up to leave and a waitress finally took notice and caught up with us at the door. Too late. We went to Ethiopian Diamond down the street and were attended to promptly, as always I won't be giving this place a second chance.
