I hate standing in line. Especially when I'm on vacation. Especially when I've taken public transit out to some godforsaken part of suburbia and walked what seems like a mile across some questionable sidewalks. But Hot Doug's was worth it. We were in line for about 45 minutes on a Friday just after opening time with a mix of people who knew what to expect and people like us who were unprepared for the magnitude of the thing. But eventually we turned the corner, eventually we saw the menu, eventually we reached the counter of Doug himself, who was just as happy to take our order for a foie gras dog, a chicago hot dog and some duck fat fries as he was to take the order of the two guys ahead of us who ordered something like twenty hot dogs and two sets for fries between the two of them. "You can't under-order here", they said, "You'd have to get back in line." As promised, we found a seat easily, and the food came out quickly. They are working as fast as they can back there, and standing around in line to order is preferable to standing around waiting for your food or looking for a table. "Trust us, this works", say the signs. The place is like a museum to encased meats - all sorts of interesting things line the walls, serious or not. Oh? The food? I'm supposed to comment on the food, huh? The hot dogs were excellent. Fresh, well prepared, and above all - well flavored. Doug knows what he's doing and will not steer you wrong. I thought the duck fat fries were excellent as well, though my companion, who is not really a fan of fries, didn't see what all the fuss was about. Like I said. Hate lines. Hate wasting time when on vacation. But this was worth it. Best hot dog of our visit to Chicago by far.
