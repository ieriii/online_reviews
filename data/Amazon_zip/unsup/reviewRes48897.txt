My girlfriend and I went here just about a year ago to celebrate my birthday. Since we went on a Wednesday night reservations were pretty easy to come bye and we were seated at one of the two person tables along the wall. Our waitress was extremely knowledgeable and helped up pick out our meal and drinks. I am pretty sure without her our experience would have been miserable as we had no idea how the menu worked. Luckily, the meal ended up being DELICIOUS. Our first course was a very nice salad (I can't remember what type now), followed by the clam fry (word to the wise, they fry their lemons in there too, my date who had never eaten clam before was very confused by the "odd, star shaped clam that tasted like a lemon"), then brussel sprouts with bacon, and finally the suckling pig. If you go to the Publican for one thing make it the brussel sprouts and bacon, I have never had anything so delicious, the bacon literally melted in my mouth. The ambiance is pretty relaxed, and the seating is comfortable. However, they seat people public house style with a few long tables with lots of chairs so if you are the type of person who likes their personal space it may not be for you. Beer and wine selection is fantastic. Definitely would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a quality, reasonably priced meal.
