Encased meat heaven ! I can't believe people are waiting in line when it is -20 F wind chills to eat at this hot dog restaurant. Every type of meat possible including aligator sausage. Even the veggie dog is amazingly tasty and not dry. The experience is unique. I had guests in from overseas and they loved it ! There is a slight feel of the Seinfeld "soup nazi" episode as there seems to be a custom or a cult following along with all of the nuances of ordering and eating here. You must go !
