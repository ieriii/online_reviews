I'm so happy this place opened just a few blocks away from me! I used to always go to Ethiopian Diamond, and I think Demera is much better. If you decide to do the sampler, you can actually randomly pick items throughout the menu whereas Ethiopian Diamond pre-picks it for you. Their food is amazing and the beer is good--plus they have a full bar if interested in a cocktail. The service is very good albeit a little slow but that's somewhat typical for Ethiopian places. Plus they have outdoor seating!
