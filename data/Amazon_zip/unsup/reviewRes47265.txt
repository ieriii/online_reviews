Awesome burgers! I know, everyone's comparing them to Kuma's - they're good but I still feel Kuma's burgers are a bit juicier and more flavorful. I will give them this though, their fries are much much better than Kuma's and the aioli is perfect. I also enjoy the many TVs they have so I can watch my Cubbies (don't hate!). My first trip here, they had fresh made chips and aioli at the table for us, but not on my 2nd trip. What gives? Maybe they ran out? I must know! I am definitely hooked on their Lockdown burger though, I think the fried leeks are what sealed the deal for me. Oh, don't try the Arson burger unless you're into some serious heat. I like spicy food, the spicier the better, but this heat is the kind that builds up and lingers. The warning on their menu is no joke!
