Being that my boyfriend and I are both from the South, we were intrigued and decided to try Big Jones for weekend brunch. Let's just say that I was quite jealous of what my boyfriend ordered. I got two poached eggs over corn cakes and red beans. He got, basically, crab cakes benedict. Yea, he won. My corncakes were underwhelming, and my eggs were overcooked. His, on the other hand, had deliciously runny eggs on top of crab cakes on top of some sort of brioche yumminess. I tried to switch...he wasn't fooled.  Otherwise, the coffee was just alright, but the little beignets (their New Orleans take on a breakfast bread basket?) to start the meal were a nice treat. The service was excellent, the atmosphere was lovely. But most importantly, my dish was mediocre, and I wouldn't come running back for hit or miss food.
