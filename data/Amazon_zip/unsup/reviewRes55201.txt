I went here during restaurant week, and was satisfied with my meal. The salad options were great, and the meat was very good. I would have liked more options in terms of done-ness. I prefer meat medium-well to well done, but most of what they brought out was rare to medium rare. For dessert, we shared a papaya dessert, which our waiter claimed had digestive enzymes in it, but really just tasted like vanilla soft serve ice cream with some papaya puree. Nothing special.Overall a pleasant experience.
