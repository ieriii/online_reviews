My husband and I needed to vacate our apartment for a night and we utilized Hotwire to get a hotel room. We ended up at the Intercontinental and I am pleased that we did. Now, I had been to the bar numerous times for high-end cocktails (delicious, incidentally) but had never been in a room. The rooms are decorated tastefully, if not a bit boring. But the bathroom was big, the bed was comfy and the small window-thick drape combo made our room look like 2 am when it was 8 in the morning. Oh, Glorious Darkness! I will definitely recommend the Intercontinental to friends when they come to town. Could they stay with me? Sure. But with the street lamps outside our place, it looks like 8am at 2 in the morning. Sadness.
