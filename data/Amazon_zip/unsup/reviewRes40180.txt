I use to come here all the time. This place has some good galbi but they skimp on the meat once in a while.Their chop chae can get a little too sweet and soggy. Their spicy soups are delicious. This restaurant serves up the most of those little dishes of appetizers (sorry, I'm not sure what those are called). The thing that's stopping me from coming to this place is the service. I really wonder if the waiters know that they make a "I'm so fed up with this fucking job and you stupid whore" face all the time. I swear everytime I ask for anything, they turn around and curse at me under their breath. Not everyone in the restaurant is like that though, there is this one lady who I think is the boss who always carries a smile. But she doesn't make up for the 5 other people who wear the bitch face 24/7. The parking lot sucks here too. It's small and cramped and almost always looks like a accident waiting to happen. I had dinner here with 2 first timers(i know, I probably should've brought them somewhere else), the dinner was great until they kept rushing us. They told us that we should be eating faster because there was a lot of people... Bitchface kept trying to clean our table even though we were obviously not done eating... never going back again.
