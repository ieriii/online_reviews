This is a nice place with decent atmosphere. The lighting was quite dim where we were sitting, my date even joked he will need a flash light to read the menu. The only thing that seemed a bit disjointed was the clubby music. Not sure what was going on there... I felt like I was 12 and at a rave. Crabtini - recommend as an appetizer.. very tasty. mixed greens salad - I think they shaved half an onion on mine.. NOT the best choice if you go on a date if you know what I mean. The fillet was really good...what is there not to like... steak... good... butter... good...AND it was certainly a very good size cut. Next time I will probably go with the petite fillet as I barely could finish mine off... Asparagus side dish - it was a bit overcooked for my taste. I like my asparagus a bit more crunchy... this was quite mushy.
