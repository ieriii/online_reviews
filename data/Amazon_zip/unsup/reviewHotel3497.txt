I visited Chicago for a quick event in October, and was so surprised by the southern hospitality. I loved it. From the moment I stepped out of the cab to the moment the Bell Man saw me off the following morning at 4:00 AM... I felt like they cared about making an impression. Without request I was offered a room upgrade which ended up being a mini-suite. I loved it. I have and will continue to recommend this historic, yet posh hotel to my friends and clients. Bravo!
