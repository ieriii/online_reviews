I grew up in pilsen and have been going to Nuevo Leon for years. Not all the food is 100% great. I personally love the breakfast items like the huevos rancheros or the huevos divorciados ( 2 eggs over easy one with green sauce on with red sauce accompanied by chilaquiles) not on the menu but ask for it!! I also like to get the caldo de res( beef stew) It's made fresh on Saturdays and is ready by 10:00 AM I hate a crowd so i usually go at 9:30 the crowd starts pouring in at about 11:00. My husband and I enjoy the BYOB option as well.
