Loved my stay here! My room was spacious, modern and very clean. The little kitchenette definitely came in handy for saving dinner leftovers fmand having them for lunch. Hey, I'm cheap like that! Speaking of cheap, this hotel is an unbelievably great price. Granted I stayed in the middle of bitter Chicago winter, it was only 80 per room. Also, the location was super convenient with all the major downtown points only a few blocks away. I'm a pleasantly surprised fan.
