I won't go into details but basically employees at this hotel enforce policies in different ways. If one tells you something is okay to do, but the next person working disagrees....it will coat you the customer for there disorganization. When I asked if they expected me to check with every employee on how and which policies they enforced, they simply said yes. That is a burden no customer should bear and no customer should pay for employee disorganization.
