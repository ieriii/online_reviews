Love The Gage. Some of the best eclectic Irish fare you will find outside of Ireland. Whether you sit at the bar or in a booth your experience will be memorable. The only reason for not giving 5 stars is how crowded the bar is and the length of the wait when you don't have a reservation. Not a place you can just drop in for a drink or a quick meal. Otherwise it is awesome.
