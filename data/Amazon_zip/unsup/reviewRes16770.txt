Huge space and late night dining make for a great atmosphere. We ate here a few nights ago and had a blast. The drinks are great (one of the best mojito's I've ever had) and the food was delicious. We went with the cheese board and Serrano ham to start. That was enough food by itself but we powered on to the short rib and some of the best mac n cheese I've ever had. I'm not great at writing reviews, but I do know I would eat here again and again and again. It is worth a visit.
