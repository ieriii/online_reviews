When my aunt asked me to come eat Brazilian food with her and the rest of my family, I looked at her in confusion. I wondered if I'd ever had Brazilian before, and where we'd be traveling to in order to get some. "Brazilian? Where will we find a Brazilian restaurant in Chicago?" Little did I know, there are tons of Brazilian restaurants in Chicago. And fortunately for me, she treated me to Fogo De Chao, where I discovered that I love Brazilian food because all it is meat. Pork, beef, chicken, beef, more pork, more beef... I ate it all. I ate a million of the rich, buttery cheese dinner rolls that they'd left out for us. That filled me up the most, but I couldn't resist those amazing rolls. Then I had about 10 different types of meat. All wonderfully meat-flavored and probably marinaded for hours, because some of it was pretty salty. The waiters were all very polite and carrying around giant skewers that probably weighed more than me when I got done eating. I was being offered so much food that I failed to realize that my coaster was flipped on to the green side, which means "Yes, I want food." I flipped it over to the red side so that the waiters knew not to ask me if I wanted more meat. I was relieved of savory meats for a few minutes and had time to stuff my face full of more dinner rolls. Then I rolled over and died happy.
