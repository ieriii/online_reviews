The food and service were okay. On Sunday, May 2 we arrived at 4:40 PM and was informed that they were still serving late lunch and we could not order dinner until 5:00 PM. The late lunch menu was sparse so we asked for the dinner menu at 4:45 PM. They gave us the dinner menu and said that the waiter would be back at 5:00 PM to take our dinner order. My question is, Does something magical happen in the kitchen so they can serve dinner in 15 minutes? Did they go out in 15 minutes and get a piece of halibut to serve for dinner. In this bad recession, you would think that businesses would bend over backwards to make customers happy. This is my first and last visit to Uncommon Ground!
