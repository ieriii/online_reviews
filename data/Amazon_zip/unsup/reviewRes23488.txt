this place is awesome! if you like spicy food, this is the place to go! Tony's chicken is a must try, its alittle crispy and the chicken is very tender! the dry chili chicken is very good also. i would stay away from the salt and pepper ribs tho, there is very little meat on them and to me it is just not worth it. i am looking forward on trying other items on the menu!
