Great place to get quality barbeque if you are looking for a nicer night out! The building and decor is really neat, and has classic southern style to really transport you. Was not thrilled with the host - a little pompous since we did not have a reservation - but still they accommodated us nicely. The homemade potato chips and pickles were awesome, especially since we were starving when we got there. We started with the hush puppies -- sooo good! Then I had the pork sandwich and my bf had the kobe beef brisket - we would have gotten the competition ribs, but we weren't looking to spend too much that night; those come highly recommended but are quite pricey. I highly highly recommend the pork, especially for the price. Tender and smokey on a delicious pretzel roll.. the bbq sauces were all also unique and very very tasty - they have a bourbony/rich quality to them and the carolina sauce was different than any other carolina sauce I've tried. My bf loved the beef brisket, but I didn't like it as much - though I'm not a huge beef fan. Overall, our amazing meal came out to $25 a person with a beer, sharing an appetizer, and an entree - a solid deal for such a nice/upscale place.
