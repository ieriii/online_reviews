I've been here a few times, but this is the first time I've decided to write them up. I'm going to focus this review on my last experience, dinner service on a Sunday evening. We started off with an appetizer of asparagus. It had white and green asparagus, a duck egg and cornbread. The egg was cooked perfectly. And the yolk was not too runny and made a fantastic dipping sauce for the asparagus and cornbread. I told the waitress I would have licked the plate if no one was watching. For dinner I had the smoked pork shoulder with poblano cheddar grits and greens. The pork was so tender and juicy. It had that elusive pink smoke ring inside and just a great smoky flavor without being overwhelming. The greens were outstanding too. I'm not a big greens fan, but this side dish had some smokiness, again not overpowering, and was well-seasoned. For dessert we had the blueberry tart with huckleberry sauce. This was a pleasant wrap up to such a fantastic meal. I also highly recommend the kumquat sangria. It was fruity but not too sweet. Service tends to be a little off here, in my opinion. It took about 10 or 15 minutes after seating for our waitress to come by to take our order. I gauge the service latency by the amount of time it took me to make a choice, as I am one of those people who likes to analyze the menu. If I have my order ready by the time the waitperson has arrived, I know service is slow. Having said that, once we placed our order service did flow well.
