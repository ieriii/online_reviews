My family and i have been to Spacca Napoli on several occasions. Never needed reservations. However, we did make them a week in advance for 6:30 last night for a party of 7 since it was a Saturday evening. Some of our party arrived 9 minutes late and they gave our table away. When we asked the owner why they would do that and not offer any other accommodations his reply was simply "I'll run my restaurant." Just the kind of pompous attitude that will undo 6 years of success. The only thing people remember more in a restaurant than the last meal they ate is the way they were treated. We will not be back.
