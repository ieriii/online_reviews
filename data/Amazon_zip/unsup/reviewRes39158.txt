Oh gosh................. I heard about the wait at Longman & Eagle, and that didn't scare me away. It shouldn't scare you away either. Holy crap. I've been missing out on Sunday brunches for the past few years because I've worked through the weekend. But boy did I take advantage of it at L&E. Dining with my fiancee and two of her gfs, we wound up waiting for about an hour. But consider, we got there in the heart of brunch hour. The hostess[es] will take your number and give you a call if you decide to mingle around the neighborhood. Otherwise, L&E has a few picnic tables outside to hang out while waiting [if they're not seating parties outside]. After waiting, we were seated and quickly greeted by our server. The guy was super nice and helpful, letting us know what's good...and what's good is the chicken and waffles. Ya heard correct. Chicken and freaking waffles. Huge pieces of chicken, fried to perfection. Juicy. Flavorful. Ugh... Waffles crisp and fluffy at the same time. Maple syrup so balanced in viscosity and sweetness. Sweet potato and pork belly hash. SWEET POTATO AND FLIPPIN' PORK BELLY HASH. Who does that?! L&E does that. The fiancee ordered the crab benedict [it's sorta her breakfast/brunch thing] and boy was that good too! Not your typical fried crab cake. In fact, it wasn't really fried [much] at all. The hollandaise is pretty traditional, having a rich buttery and citrus taste. Served with house potatoes, this benedict is among my faves [and I it's up there for the fiancee]. Top to bottom, we had a great experience at L&E. Service was on point. Food was top notch. Can't wait to go back [and wait for a table]!!
