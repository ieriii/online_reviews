I share the agony of living down the block from this place. Smells so good all day everyday! We eat here at least once a week, mostly for the deep dish but also for the specials, everyday they have all day specials that are very affordable and come with about 3 meals worth of food.  The service here is exceptional for not being a full service place and everyone has always been very polite to me. They are sure to warn you if your order will take awhile and really put in the extra effort to get you fed as quickly as possible.  With plenty of options, anyone who hasn't eaten here at least once is missing out.
