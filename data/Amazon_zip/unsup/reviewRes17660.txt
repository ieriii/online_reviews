I was treated to an evening here by my former employer...our group held its annual meeting in Chicago, and we had our big dinner here on a week night. The food was delicious! It's not easy to pull off a group of 20 plus people, but everything came out warm and freshly prepared. The guacamole was mouth watering (or maybe I was just starving), and the service was top notch. We didn't have any trouble getting drinks, either at the bar or during dinner, and we had a great time after our meal as well. The atmosphere is really funky and neat, and the place just has a fun aura to it. I'd love to come back with friends sometime.
