I moved to the States 11 years ago from Korea and I have tried many Korean restaurants. Mostly Galbi places so when I found Crisp, it was a pleasant surprise. The Buddha bowls are great!! I usually order a small bowl with an egg, and my hubby gets his with meat and we share a whole order of Seoul sassy fried chicken. The hot pepper paste for the Buddha bowl is a little on the sweet side. Every time I am near that neighborhood, I make sure I get my korean fix. Reasonable price, clean atmosphere and great food!
