If you have a friend in town for the weekend, and he or she says, "Take me to the best sushi restaurant in Chicago," take them here. Many sushi places try to create a fine dining atmosphere, but end up falling short when it comes to the quality of food and overpriced when it comes to the bill. Sunda has really mastered the art of sushi in an upscale setting. Both the food and the overall dining experience deserve 5 stars. They also have a good selection of wine and cocktails. I really like their version of a caterpillar roll, complete with caramelized sugar on top! Also, try some of the appetizers. You will not be disappointed, and the service is top notch!
