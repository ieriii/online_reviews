A fun and delicious place to eat! Right off of Michigan Avenue, The Purple Pig has great sharable sized portions. My absolute favorite is the pork shoulder and mashed potatoes...it melts in your mouth, and I am always tempted to place another order! They have an extensive wine list, and knowledgeable staff that is happy to make recommendations since the list can be a little overwhelming. They have adventurous dishes like bone marrow and pig ear, and more generic dishes like chicken kebabs and sausage. But, each dish was very good and well prepared and presented. I am not a big dessert fan, but the nutella panini with bananas and marshmallow was great! They do not take reservations - however, it is well worth the wait!
