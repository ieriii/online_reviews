This is a lovely place. I've been there a couple of times for brunch, and there is always something tasty. I recently ordered the special egg benedict, and it was positively delicious. The decor is nice, they have a Farmer's Market during the summer, and there is an organic garden on the roof! It's quite a green place! Plus the staff are very courteous and friendly. Cute too! Which of course never hurts. Would recommend for a tasty brunch out on the town.
