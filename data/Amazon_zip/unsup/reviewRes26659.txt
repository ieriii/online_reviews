Went here with a small group of friends on a Wednesday night and had a nice meal. The food was fresh and tasty. For appetizers we ordered the avocado rangoons and shrimp tempura. Both were good and free of that strange deep fried flavor that some asian food can have. For entrees we had the beef noodle soup, shrimp fried rice, chicken and mango and veggie delight. All were fresh and delicious. I will definitely be back. One downfall was the service. Our waiter was attentive until our main course arrived, then we never saw him again. Also a BYOB, which automatically adds a star.
