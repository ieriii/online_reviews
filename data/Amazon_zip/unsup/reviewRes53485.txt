TRUly an amazing experience! We started with the caviar staircase and did the large tasting menu along with the wine pairing. Probably safe to say we won't be ordering caviar again anytime soon but still a fun, yet pricy, first experience. The 9 course tasting menu was unbelievable. It was by far the most adventurous meal we've eaten. The service was outstanding along with the ambiance. We will be back sooner than later.
