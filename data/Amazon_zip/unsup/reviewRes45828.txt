I should preface by saying that it would never occur to me to enter a place like this on my own. I went here with my sister and her friend, who has an expense account and treated us to lunch. (I mean... we had a business meeting. Yes. There was much business happening that day.) The place reminds me of a slightly classier TGIFriday's. They do the same type of classic-dishes-with-a-twist, but the twists are never that exciting. I don't remember what I ordered, actually, but I enjoyed shoveling it in my face.  Atmosphere: tourists with shopping bags, groups of middle-aged ladies cackling, a few young couples - fyi, this is not a good place for a first date - some suits, but they mostly stay away. Not my type of place, but if you're mom is in town and she wants to go to Nordstrom's, this might be a good place to take her to lunch.
