I had a great experience at Big Jones that left me hankering to try more of the menu! I went for a late light lunch with a girlfriend and we both ordered the house salad and a cup of soup -- her the shrimp and crawfish bisque, me the gumbo. Both soups were outstanding (I stole a taste of the bisque, of course). The gumbo was nice and spicy, plenty of big hunks of sausage and seafood and lots of those good southern veggies like okra. The house salads were a delight, with fresh greens, candied pecans, apples, blue cheese and a light vinagrette dressing. We both had a house-brewed ginger beer (non-alcoholic) which were wonderfully light and refreshing. Before the meal, our server brought out some fantastic little corn muffins and some sort of sweet bread (as in flour and water, not innards), which was a great added touch to the meal. Service was perfection--it being midday and one of the only tables in the restaurant probably helped. The decor is quite lovely -- I especially dig the chairs and bar. I can't wait to come back to try their dinner menu and one of those amazing looking cocktails! Then it will be a big five stars for Big Jones for sure. :)
