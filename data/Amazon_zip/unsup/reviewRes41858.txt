We stopped at Ruth's Chris last night because it was close to our hotel and we've really enjoyed their location on the Plaza in Kansas City and we were not in the mood to make a hit-or-miss restaurant decision. The crab cake appetizers were very good - good flavor and portion size. The tomato and onion salad was also good - but that salad is always subject to the flavor of the tomatoes. Maybe I'm just anticipating fresh garden tomatoes soon at home so while the salad was good it just lacked a bit of "something". But we didn't go for crab cakes or salad we went for steak... I had the ribeye and my wife had the petit filet both cooked to a medium temperature. Both of us thought the steaks were good - much better than many we've had but not cut-with-a-fork melt-in-your-mouth good as we were expecting. I don't know that either of us knew for sure exactly what was different. The meat appeared to be cooked to the correct temperature, etc. I suppose it goes without saying that the sweet potato casserole was excellent. Our waiter did not take the news regarding our thoughts on the steaks well. He did a capable job of waiting on the table the rest of the night, but we did seem to unintentionally break the repertoire that one likes to have with the wait staff while dining out. Overall it was a good experience - definitely worth going especially if you've never been but also worth remembering that just because a restaurant is a chain doesn't mean that every franchise is identical.
