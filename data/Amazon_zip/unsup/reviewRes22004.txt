Since my beau and I have never had actual Greek food, we decided to pay a visit to Greektown for lunch. We originally had The Parthenon in mind, but after circling around for 30 mins to park, we saw Greek Islands. Charming place with plenty of ambient indoor seating, but we chose to sit and eat outside. I wasn't sure what to get since everything looked delicious - ended up ordering a feast. Even the server said it was a lot of food and made sure I really wanted it. Although I'm a tiny person, I sure can devour everything in front of me, leaving the restaurant staff wide-eyed. For appetizers we got: Cold spread sampler - the Taramosalata "Greek caviar" spread was my favorite with the baked bread. So creamy with a hint of saltiness from the cod roe. Grilled octopus - succulent, tender. Pairs well with the olive oil and balsamic vinegrette base. Entree: Combo roast leg of lamb & roast loin of lamb - great with rice & potatoes. Found the leg of lamb much better than the loin. Loin was gamey and flavorless. Wonderful food, but a bit on the pricey side for lunch. Didn't find the portions enormous like the server suggested. In fact, I was still munching on bread and sopping up the rest of the spread. By then, I felt like a pig as he was bringing out the bill.
