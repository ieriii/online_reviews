The first and still the best of the Lettuce Entertain You Restaurants. The wait can be terrible, but the food is great, the service is great, and the music, um... ROCKS. If you don't care what your waist line is going to look like when you're 80, go for the bleu cheese burger and the malts. If you *do* care, you probably already know about that salad bar. WOOF!I'd normally mark it down to 4 because the wait really *is* dreadful, but Grunts is everything I love about Chicago. It's quirky. It's weird. It's fabulous. The quality is top-notch. The prices are good. And, it's locally owned and it's not something you see in every town from Maine to California. So, if it takes 45 minutes, I suppose it's because everyone knows that it's worth it. So, yeah. 5 Stars!
