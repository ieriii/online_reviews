mac and cheese is awesome. burgers are good- lots of choices, HUGE, and a steal at $8. BUT they could use a bit more flavor. garlic mustard for preztels is a flavorful snack while you wait the fries with chorizo and cheese sauce is freakin tasty. maybe mix up the tv screens a bit at night...... ill be back all summer!
