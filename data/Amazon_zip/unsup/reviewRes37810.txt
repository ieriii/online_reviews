Deep dish done right. At least, as far as I can tell. Lots of cheese. You better like cheese in order to like a stuffed pizza. Chicago should be proud of this. It was great food and great atmosphere too. As a West Coast born and raised L.A. kid, this was all new to me. I've had deep dish before but this had a certain authenticity about it that is hard to describe. I am happy and at the same time sad to have had tried Giordano's now. Happy because it was so good, sad because I have to go back to Chi city to have it again :( Interesting how you pre-order your pizza right after checking-in to put your name on the wait list. By the time you are seated (~30-40 minutes later) the pizza should be almost ready! I wonder what they do with the pre-ordered pizzas of parties that end up leaving without being seated? I suppose no one is that crazy to pass up a Giordano's famous stuffed pizza!
