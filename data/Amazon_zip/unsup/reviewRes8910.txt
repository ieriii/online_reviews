This is my favorite Brick Oven Pizza in the City!!! I always have their house salad except I ask for red peppers on my salad. The house oil and balsamic vinegar they use is amazing! The margarita is my favorite! I eat one by myself .. even if I go there with friends I make them order their own. Plus I think that Spacca pizza size is more a personal size then to share you will leave hungry if you share your pizza. The dough is perfect, not too thin and not too thick, The sauce is perfect well seasoned a good flavor. The cheese is delicious, but I think they can use a little more then it would be perfect..and as for the basil..no complaints here. The owner John had Italian brick oven maker build the oven its beautiful, the restaurant is so tastefully done, very inviting and in the summer they have the sidewalk patio open for business, an added plus is his staff offers great service. This is a HUGH Plus for any restaurant... I HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND SPACCA NAPOLI.
