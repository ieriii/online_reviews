After reading several of the past reviews, I feel like I agree with all the reviews. My wife and I put our reservation in over 6 months before we got a table, but it was worth the wait. I will never go back, because I don't think any meal can justify the $150 per person price tag (just the cost of the tasting menu), but if you really want to splurge, it is worth a try for the experience.
