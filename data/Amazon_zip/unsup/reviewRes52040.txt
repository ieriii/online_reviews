I really love deep dish pizza, but my first trip to Gino's east was a bit disappointing. We went in there starving and so we were a bit daunted by the 45 minute wait for the pizza -- but if it was good, it would be worth it. In the meantime, we had an order of the toasted ravioli, which was really really good but, unfortunately, turned out to be the highlight of the meal.  We tried to order the veggie pizza without mushrooms, but they said their vegetarian topping was pre-mixed so went with a half-sausage, half-four-cheese pizza. For a "small" the pizza was very big and very filling. Unfortunately, the crust was only mediocre and the pizza cheese seemed to congeal a lot quicker than other Chicago-style pizza places I've been to before. The sauce was pretty good, and so were the toppings but something just felt like it was missing.  The pizza itself would probably get 3 1/2 stars, and then ravioli would give it an extra star on top of that, but the service we got there -- we rarely saw the waitress, and she just didn't really seem to want to help us -- forced me to drop the rating down to 3 stars.  Overall, I'd prefer Giordano's (although I've only been twice before) or, more preferrably, Zachary's in California.
