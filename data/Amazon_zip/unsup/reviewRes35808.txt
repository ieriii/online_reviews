I was afraid the price may increased in proportion to Sun Wah's square footage, but thankfully that was not the case. Went in and was ushered by hostess to a table. Their wait staffs were very friendly but slightly disorganized so we had to flagged them down a couple times. But it didn't really bother me much. I really see that as a mark of an authentic Chinese restaurants...no, not really. Anyways, back to the food. The Peking duck was tasty w/ its crispy skin and I enjoyed all the condiments that comes with the dish. Yum! Despite its modern decor, Sun Wah still offered all the authentic, delicious Chinese dishes they used to have. We would always get the Beef Ho Fan when we go there and I was glad to see the menu hasn't changed. The only thing I was sad about was that they ran out of the sorbet they give out at the end of the meal. I heard it was good. We walked out of the restaurant two very full women, already talking about when we're going to go back.
