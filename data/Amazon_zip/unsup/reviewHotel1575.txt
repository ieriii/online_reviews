The views from this hotel are phenomenal. I took a lot of pics that I want to get blown up now. The hotel is located right in front of the Riverwalk near the water. You can see all the bridges at night it's so beautiful. The room was good. Flat screen TV, nice bathroom and very large windows. I did have trouble with the TV. It seems that it wasn't plugged in properly and we went without it for a day. Who needs TV when you are on a vacation? They don't have a pool so leave your trunks and bathing suit at home. Bring a laptop cause each room has FREE WI-FI.... That is not a typo!
