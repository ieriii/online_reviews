First off, its no map room. The service can be fantastically pretentious, unfriendly, and at time down-right rude. Fortunately, this tends to happen more when its crowded than when its not. Now I'll go in only during the day or very early afternoon. The beer list is killer and the pomme frites are delicious but prices are needlessly high. We'll maybe not needlessly, but enough so that they wrote a defense of their pricing in last months beer advocate saying that it cost them something ridiculous like 3k to open their doors every morning. It definitely worth checking out or hanging out with friends at two in the afternoon but do yourself a favor and try the map room down in bucktown as a comparison.
