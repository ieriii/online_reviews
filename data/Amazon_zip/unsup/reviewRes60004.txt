I was here last night, and my experience pushed me to sign up on Yelp, since I use the reviews to navigate towards great experiences. Ambiance is nice, waitstaff is friendly & atttentive, but the food...I had a combination platter with my boyfriend-forget the name of the platter, but the pork ribs were horrible. I can't believe they actually serve that to people-I wouldn't feed that to a wild animal. The chicken was just ok, but I figured, well, I didnt come here for chicken. The plantane was really good, and the potatoes were just ok too. Chorizo was pretty good-I could have had a plate of that by itself. Overall the food-was "meh, ok".My favorite part of my meal was the sangria. It was really good-$24.00 for a pitcher, not too shabby. I brought wine, but couldnt stomach the $8.00 corkage fee-that was the price of the wine itself. Would I go back? Maybe to try their skirt steak, and give them another chance. I gave them the extra star for the sangria
