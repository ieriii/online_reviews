From reading the other reviews it seems that everyone is raving about the duck, so I had to try it out for myself. For me personally, it was so-so. I ordered the duck over rice. Maybe it was because I was full from every other delicious thing I had ordered. We started out with egg rolls, which are very large and quite tasty. We also ordered a soup to share. The soup was the highlight of the meal. The shrimp dumpling soup with noodles had lots of flavor. The staff was very friendly and many other people came by our table to clear plates, refill water or get us togo boxes. They also have a very large dining area which can accommodate many. With the great food, friendly staff and reasonable prices I will definitely be coming back to try out more of the menu.
