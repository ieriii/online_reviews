so I didn't actually order food there but I had bread, olive oil and nibbles of my friend's pasta. considering that i'm generally foodily opposed to eating bread because I think they're bland and boring-the bread + olive oil combo at MF was delicious! I ate almost 2 whole pieces of bread accompanied by almost the entire jar of Olive oil. My friend's plate of lentils, sausage and pasta was far more delicious than I would expect for any pasta plate. The sausage was delectable, the lentils were soft and very flavorful.  I'm almost certain I'd return here to eat, even though I hate italian food. I think that says a lot about the restaurant.
