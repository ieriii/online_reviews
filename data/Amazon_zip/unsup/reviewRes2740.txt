It isn't too often that I feel a restaurant truly lives up to the hype and the aclaim that it's been given, but this time, this place just had to be one of them. My table had the Chef's tasting menu, featuring foie gras mousse, seared wagyu, and crispy bork belly, along with the sommelier's wine pairings. They wagyu was so tender and juicy, it practically fell apart before I could chew it.  I can't say that the entire tasting meny was excellent, though. There were a couple things that tasted great, but were largely forgettable. The care and creativity that went into the dishes that "mattered" were nothing compared to the execution of them in the kitchen. However, the dishes that fell short, although tasting, great, did not live up to the calliber of the ones that made the evening. The dessert was the biggest let down. It was seriously just of scoop of ice cream over melon balls...no more, no less. I really expected something creative.  In addition to the food, the service was exceptional. There were moments when I forgot the servers were serving, because their performance was immaculate.  I'm glad I had the pleasure of dining at TRU recently, and if I am ever able to afford the bill again, I'd be there in a skinny minute to see and taste what else the chef has to offer.
