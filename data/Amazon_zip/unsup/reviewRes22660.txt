Just don't eat outside! Whatever you do, don't eat outside; unless of course, your idea of a good dinner conversation is one that is being interupted by the El every five minutes. I don't care how nice the weather is. So, not only is Irazu good for people watching, but the food is outta sight. While you munch on fresh and chunky guacamole with tomatoes and pureed jalepeno for kick, you can have your own personal contest of finding the tightest pants in the place. Ya know, try to find out who won't be breathing after they are done with thier fried yucca.  You can guestimate how long some of the patron have gone without showering as you shovel in the rice and beans that are so soft and full of flavor.  Perfect consistency with green and red peppers(the rice and beans, not the patron's hair) and just the right amount of garlic.  Ah yes, the garlic...the pureed garlic and oil sauce that I slathered all over each and every bite of the fried yucca. I can barely contain myself over here. And while we are on the topic of fried, you absolutely must try the chiccarones. Deep fried and crisp, these pork chunks are simply evil...wrong ...should be out-lawed.  So come on and give it a whirl. Make sure to stop at the liquor store for some drinks before hand and bring your empty tummies and open eyes. This place is definately stimulation for the eyes, ears and mouth! I repeat, just don't eat outside and you'll have far less stimulation on the ears.
