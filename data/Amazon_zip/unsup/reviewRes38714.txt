Having just landed in Chicago a few hours before, I was anxious to try some of the world-famous 'deep dish' pizza, particularly being born in New York and privy to their specialty pizza for a number of years. A coworker of mine had visited this restaurant before on good word and promised me I would be impressed. We sat down and ordered and received some unsolicited advice from a fellow patron at the next table. He said that although each pizza would take approximately 40 mins to make, it would be well worth it. A few mins later, this patron (having finished one slice of his pizza and half a beer) got up and left. The wait staff looked panicked for a few minutes and after asking about it, we discovered he had just boned out. Interesting that he would take the time to compliment the restaurant before ditching without paying the bill. Regardless, we were more than happy with our dinner, the pie was thick, had plenty of cheese and ingredients, and covered with a sauce that reminded me of my Italian grandmother's marinara. I was very impressed and will make it a point to revisit this restaurant the next time I'm in the windy city.
