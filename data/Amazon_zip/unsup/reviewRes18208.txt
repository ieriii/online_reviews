This place honestly deserves all 5 stars. Anywhere I can get six or seven different kinds of seasoned french fries that also offers an extensive beer list is great in my book. Our server was knowledgeable on the beers and was very helpful, despite the fact that it was a busy night. I love the Bad Apple!
