I am not Vietnamese and have not been to Vietnam, even though I've been in neighboring Cambodia twice now, so I can't speak to the authenticity or closeness in flavors to 'the real thing'. What I do know though is that I was extremely disappointed when they stopped their short lived delivery service. This place is pretty far by my lazy standards being that I'm in the South Loop and this is at the Argyle stop of the red line. But oh is it worth going out of the way to. My friends and I like to challenge ourselves to eating a full bowl of their tank pho. But even though that is what carries the name sake of their restaurant, it would be a huge disfavor to yourself if you don't try some of the other things on their menu. I have yet to have a bad experience here and quite honestly, I'm not really sure what I'm ordering half the time when I deviate from the pho. This place gets crowded but if you have to wait, it'll be worth it.
