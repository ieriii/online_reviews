The freshest and best seafood I've had in the city ... you could easily go spend 4 times as much at those other restaurants that claim to have fresh fish flown in daily. Glenn's is the best choice for fresh and great seafood in Chicago. My favorites: Pan seared scallops (with bacon and mushrooms), Mussels, and Crab Cakes (ooooohhh the crab cakes, sooo crabby goodness) Service has always been top notch, Glenn the owner is always present and more than welcome to tell you about his choices on the menu. He definitely takes pride in the quality and freshness of the food he serves. Glenn's takes reservations, (definitely recommended for the weekend) and is BYOB ... they also serve wine & beer if you don't bring your own, or like us and drink through your supply and need more!
