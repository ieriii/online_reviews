We waited in line for about 2 hours which was mostly due to a bachelor party taking place in the back room. However, we were nicely taken care of while waiting outside with chips and guac. When we finally were seated, everything else moved along smoothly. Our waiter was really great. The food was amazing. Our group had the the chicken mixed with rice, the chile relleno, chifrijo, empanadas, the veggie burrito, patacones, and the oatmeal shake. All the food was amazing. However, the patacones was strange. Stick with the sweet plantains. The oatmeal shake was phenomenal. To top it all off, it was byob. We were incredibly satisfied with our experience. The food was just as we remembered on our Costa Rican vacation many years ago, minus the amazing Costa Rican ketchup.
