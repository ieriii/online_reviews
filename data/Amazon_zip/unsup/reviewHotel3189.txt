I like this place, not sure why I don't come here often, but I have never had a bad experience!! Yeah it's a bit snotty and what not, but hey it's a great way to break the cycle of our usual hectic and at times boring life. Besides their restaurant is yummy!!! U should walk in here with no expectations and hopefully u'll be impressed if not then hey at least u can say "been there done that"!!:-)
