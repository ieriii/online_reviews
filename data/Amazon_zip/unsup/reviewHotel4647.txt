This is a great hotel! recently renovated with a LEED rating of silver. The hotel is simple, but elegantly modern. The rooms are very reasonable for what you get, albeit a little on the small side, everthing was soo nice, you don't mind. Best part was that there was a safe in the room. I also liked that you needed a key card to use the elevator. The location is also great, minutes from the subway and "el" trains, and a block from a whole foods! I would definitely stay here again. P.S. try there signature drink down in the bar, made with a special spiced rum, milk, honey and an herb, i think lavendar! very unique
