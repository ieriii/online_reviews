Maybe I am a KFC (Korean fried chicken) snob (being a recent transplant from NYC and, quite simply, a native Korean), but Crisp didn't quite cut it for me. To be fair, Seoul Sassy was pretty tasty. The meat was juicy and not swimming in grease. BUT, rather disappointingly, the sauce was only reminiscent of the original Korean fried chicken sweet, tangy, spicy sauce -- not an exact replica.  And what's with no pickled Korean radish as a side?? (This nearly appalled me.) It was quite obvious that Crisp, located in the heart of Lincoln Park/Lakeview yuppie land, was accommodating to the American palette (i.e., sweeter, less spicy, less tangy). Now, there's nothing wrong with that. A smart business knows its surrounding market and audience. And Crisp most certainly is a smart operation. I may well have given it a 5-star review had I never been exposed to the REAL KFC. But, alas, one cannot fool her/his own native tastebuds.  I'd go back if in the neighborhood. The plain fried chicken (and maybe some of their rice bowl dishes) perhaps deserves a try.
