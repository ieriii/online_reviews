Since my flight overlay was 4 hours, thought I'd take a walk in Chicago. Good thing I checked with yelp for pizzerias. This was definitely a hit. Ordered the Veggie deep dish to go cause the place was packed. It says it's enough for 1 - 2 persons, I'd say you could even split it with 3 people. The pie was a lot thicker than I expected. Soft crust, super saucy, lots of filling, and real cheesy. Definitely one of the best slices I've had in my life. I'm coming back to try the thin crust, hope to see you again soon Chicago..
