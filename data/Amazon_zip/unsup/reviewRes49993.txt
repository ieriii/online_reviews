IT'S BACON! BACON BACON BACON BACON BACON! If you could've heard my inner monologue as I devoured Fifty/50's incredible BBBLT, I would've sounded like the dog from the Beggin' Strips commercial. I could deal without the extra piece of bread in the middle, but I was in hog heaven and no extra piece of bread could distract me from this homage to bacon and all its smokey goodness. Also, Fifty/50 has officially become my new destination for their mouth-watering sweet potato fries. Not too crisp, not too soggy, and seasoned just right. To top it all off, our server was friendly, polite, fast, and proactive about getting us refills.  I'll definitely be back!
