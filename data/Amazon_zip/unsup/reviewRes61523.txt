quite possibly my favorite mexican food chicago has to offer. considering there are so many fantastic restaurants in this city, that says quite a bit. chicken and steak are marinated, butterflied and grilled over charcoal. wow. talk about amazing with an extra helping of delicious. a definite must if you seek the best of the best!
