the piggy tugged at my heart strings. oh, lord, i am a pig fanatic. pork belly, bacon, pulled pork, pork rhinds, you name it. between the 3 of us we ordered 6 plates and later a dessert. we started with: pork rhinds- WOW!!! Best, ever. fig salad- delish ham- gooooood. fried perch- oh, lordy, this was a big delicious shocker. lamb loin- good, aziza-esque porchetta- dayummm, fierce! will def be back or will have to try out blackbird.
