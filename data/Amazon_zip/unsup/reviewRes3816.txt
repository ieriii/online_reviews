In a nod to other reviews, I'll note they we enjoyed our meal at the unbusy hour of 4:00 pm on a Friday so the staff gave us their undivided attention and the place was quiet. BTW, the staff was also very friendly and helpfully and patiently explained the concept behind the KFC and the Buddha Bowls. Now, for the food. Awesome. We enjoyed wings (big, meaty) with both the SEOUL SASSY and the CRISP BBQ (which were my favorite). Just really darned good. Also we split the CHI-TOWN CHICKEN BOWL with the Atomic Sauce. Very good.
