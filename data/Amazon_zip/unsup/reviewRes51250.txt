Gag. We're thinking of moving to the area, so my boyfriend and I stopped in here while we were checking out the neighborhood. The tortilla soup was awful--melting shreds of cheese in soup are fine with me, but there were also big cubes of some other cheese, as well as chunks of avocado in the soup. Not to mention tons of soggy tortilla strips. I ate two spoonfuls and left the rest. My boyfriend ordered it, too, but only ate half of his bowl. The bowls of soup were big, but that was not a plus in this case. I also had the two-taco plate with beans and rice and it was not good either, but not horrible. I ate one of the tacos, but not much of anything else. My dear boyfriend who always gives anything the benefit of the doubt, said "the rice is pretty good." It was just rice, folks, and it was still the highlight of the meal. Margaritas were OK, but tasted like your average margarita mix. Service seemed somewhat slow. I would also expect, if I'm sending 90% of my meal back to the kitchen untouched, to be asked if there was a problem. Not at this place. Cannot recommend it on any level. Will never go back.
