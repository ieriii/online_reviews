This is one place that never disappoints. There are times I don't feel up for going out to dinner, especially with a group of people, but mention this place and I'll gladly get dressed. Even when I know I'm not very hungry, it works out nicely because I have a few bites and I take the rest for lunch/dinner the next day.  I know a lot of reviews talk about great the pizza is, in fact, just the other day an acquaintance mentioned how much she liked the pizza, but I'm a sucker for their pasta. I don't even care for pasta all that much, but I really enjoy trying a new dish every time. I've shared other dishes (fish, chicken parm, whatever special was going on at the time) and always leave full and satisfied.  The accordian player always plays "Sweet Caroline", which won me over immediately, but he's one of the nicest and most enjoyable guys there!  On a different note, I've been there for a wedding reception and had a great time. The room looked great, people cleaned their plates and service was never lacking. I can't believe it's taken me so long to review this place. It's one of few restaurants I've recommended to people where I haven't gotten any negative feedback about.
