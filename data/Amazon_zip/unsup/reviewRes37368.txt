Wow this place has been over-Yelped. Took my dad here awhile back to wallow at the temple of the second best beer in the world, Belgian (after British cask ale of course). The much discussed surliness of the staff was totally absent. The beer was amazing, served properly in each variety's own glass. The mussels and the rabbit and the frites were top notch. Loved the brick dining area, so atmospheric. Nothing even remotely like this place where I live.
