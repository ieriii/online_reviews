Took step-daughter and her friends downtown for a night at Navy Pier, Willis Tower, etc. Got them a room here adjoining ours - staff was friendly and accommodating. They asked her name and age, sent up a nice piece of cake, card and drinks with their compliments! That was very nice, not expected - everything exceeded our expectations, thank you!
