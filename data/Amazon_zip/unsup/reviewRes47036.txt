So obviously if you haven't jumped on the going green/sustainablity initiative by now, you are a loser. Uncommon Ground in Edgewater is green from its thumbs to its rears. They have a garden on the roof, they have signs in the bathrooms to remind you to not waste paper towels, they have martinis called treetinis; when ordered a tree is planted. A lot of the food is made with locally grown produce so if you're a locavore, this is the place for you! I had the sweet potato fries and they were delicious! Then I ordered a pasta to-go. It was a homemade pasta with buffalo Italian sausage. It's ok to drool, I did. The atmosphere is amazing especially this time of year. The place looked like it was built around the season of fall. Their beer list ain't so bad either. I had an Alagash. Dig it!
