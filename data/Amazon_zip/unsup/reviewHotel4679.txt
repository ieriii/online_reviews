This place has one flaw- room sizes. Depending on the purpose of your trip, this could either be a no big deal, or a huge one! I wanted to book a hotel in the downtown River North area, but not mag mile. Those hotels are often huge, loud, not updated. Arriving at Hotel Felix, I was pleased with small lobby, friendly front desk staff and modern decor. HOWEVER, the room I first got was incredibly small! My walk in closet in my house is bigger! I was traveling alone, but this room was claustrophobic! I can't imagine how a couple or worse- a family could stay in that room. I was ready to walk out but called the front desk first, and they put me in a slightly bigger room, which was better. All in all, this place COULD have been great, but the room size has left with a serious handicap when compared with other hotels in similar price range...
