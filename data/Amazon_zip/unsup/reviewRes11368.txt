Piece is a hipster pizza joint that is definitely worth a visit, but on weekends get there early and even then be prepared to wait by the bar for a few beers before being seated. Co-owned by Nick Nielsen of Cheap Trick, there are guitars from Nielsen's collection adorning the walls complemented by its tattooed waitresses and bartenders with perfectly manicured emo beards. Countless different types of pizza served on a slab and great micro brews brewed on site. Their trademark is their obnoxiously cut pizzas, with long awkward slices. Its almost as if there's some drunk in the back that's going wild with the pizza cutter.
