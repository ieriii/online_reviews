Do you like meat? Well this is the place to go. On this night the Tip Sirlion, House special and Filet Migon stole the show. All served at medium rare and full of spices. Talk about heaven. The salad bar is really good too...it is such a shame that most people stay away and go after the meat...that is what you are really paying for.
