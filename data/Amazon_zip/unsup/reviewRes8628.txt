Oh gluttonous day! The salad bar is great, really you can eat that all day long. Thank goodness it is an option to just get that. Honestly though most people come here for the meat. This is were the service and the place shines. You want more, flip your card to green and you kept being brought different cuts of meat, you want a little more well done, they bring you more well done. You want another type, they will bring you more and more until you can't handle any more. The bacon wrapped chicken I had was a bit dry and not that flavorful. Some others were okay. The fillet... good lord how could you go wrong with fillet? They didn't. Their caipirinha was great, but hella strong. I would say the service is great, friendly and attentive, if you eat meat there is probably a meat here for you, if not, you'll probably love the salad bar. Oh and if you have some room, try the desserts. They are great way to finish off this glutton-fest.
