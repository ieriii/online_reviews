I like when I can speak Italian to the manager in an Italian pizzeria, that shows that this guy has to have some connections to the old country and must know how real food tastes. The oven is straight from Napoli and the pizza is cooked for only a few minutes at a very high temp in the wood burning oven to give it a thin, crispy texture. The pizza had a nice neapolitan crispness to it, not soggy at all, mozzerala di bufala and sausage. The choices of pizza are great, and quite authentic. The decor was moder, yet a bit rustic.
