I'm 5 for 5 at Calo. Whoever grills their meat (in my case, chicken and shrimp) is a genius--it's always perfect. My GF and I are suckers for their pasta, and though most of the entrees are pricey for us, they're that good. We grab glasses of the affordable Chianti Rustico to go with it. Calo food also passes the Microwave Test: We always have plenty of leftovers from Calo, and despite the flavor-destroying proclivities of a microwave, it still tastes excellent reheated. I'm no gore-may, but to me that's another sign of some damn good food.
