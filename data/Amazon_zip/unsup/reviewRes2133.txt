Hmmmmm. There was no line today at 2:30. I never thought I would eat here. It was on my blacklist, along with Kuma's. I never thought I'd join the Hot Doug's Bandwagon. But, I have to admit, the foie gras hot dog was delicious. Absolutely. Like the T-Shirt says, "The two most perfect words in the English Language are: Encased Meats."
