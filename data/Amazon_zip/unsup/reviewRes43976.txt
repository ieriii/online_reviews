cute brunch spot, but this place is hell on the weekends. brunch food is good (huevos rancheros are delicious), but it's not worth the inefficient seating system, super-crowded restaurant, and lack of places to stand while you inevitably wait half an hour to sit down. plus you have to navigate the crowd anytime you want a coffee refill. in the end, go somewhere else for a brunch experience that does not make you want to tear your hair out. oh, and for a restaurant as small as milk and honey (the size of a closet), they should not allow strollers inside. what a nightmare.
