My first taste of Chicago's speakeasy's, I enjoyed the atmosphere and insurmountable list of ingredients in each drink. I like that they're separated by liquors and that it's easy to find a flavor that you'll like. VH is definitely better suited for an intimate date or small group. It can be a bit difficult to see with the really dim lighting. But the no phones, shut out from the world feel is rare and appreciated. The line can be daunting, but leaving your name is a good call while you head to another bar. Worst case there are plenty of good bars in the area if the line is too long!
