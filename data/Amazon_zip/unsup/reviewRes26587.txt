Well i been in Pilsen my whole life and been attending this place w my family for years now. I must admit that the quality of food is not as it used to be nor the portions are like they were but like anything things change. Inflation changes everything. But Nuevo Leon is still a great place for a traditional mexican style dinner on any night of the week. The service is usually great but i prefer being in the bigger room, not the one as you enter. Just had a bad experience w a waitress in the past. Also, be careful w the weekend since it is super packed w suburban folk probably from thursday 5 pm until sunday 12 mindnight. LOL. j/k fellas. But in all seriousness this place does get packed in the weekends. W lines most of the time inside and at times stretching outside on good nights. Just be aware..... Anyway, its a great place. Being BYOB is a super plus. The fresh made tortillas, the salsas, caldos are awsome. Since I been goin ive been really fond of the taco dinners, enchiladas,flautas and fajitas more than anything but all the food is great. the carne asada is awsome. Guaca is ok but the beans and rice are great. oh and try the nachos. Nuevo Leon is def one if not thee best mexican restaurant in the neighborhood. Fresh, Tasty and inexpensive. Just stay away from the guacamole, that is kinda pricey. They always have the jukebox roaring so theres always music for entertainment. They have a parking lot about 4 buildings away because sometimes its hard to find on 18th so just keep looking. Oh and they dont accept credit cards but do have a cash station inside so remember that all you American Express holders. :) So judgement that this place is guilty of having awsome food. If ever in Pilsen, come to Nuevo Leon. Also, go the Mexican Museum of Fine Arts. Adios,
