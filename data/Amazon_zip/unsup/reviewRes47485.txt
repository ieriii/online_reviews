Awesome! Great service,great burgers and no wait (at least on a cold winter friday night). I had the congenial visit burger which is thanksgiving dinner in a burger! Turkey burger, cranberry, stuffing...how can you go wrong? The Mac and cheese is just as good as well. The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is because one of the beers we had on tap was off in taste and another kinda flat. But the bar tender/waitress offered to buy the next round when we told her the beer was kinda off. So if I could do 4.5 stars I would. Will be going back and will be spreading the word. Who needs Kuma's?
