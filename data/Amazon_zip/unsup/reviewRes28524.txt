Phenomenal drinks and food. I had the sublime drink which had gin and cilantro in it. I think its my favorite drink now. Ordered the flank steak for dinner which had a rootbeer bbq sauce and it came out perfect. Would definitely recommend to anyone. The atmosphere inside the restaurant has a very welcoming feel to it. If you're hungry, go there for food. If you're thirsty, go there for just drinks. They have a nice bar area and friendly people.
