Outstanding spot.  I showed up after a few happy hour drinks with some friends, to grab a bite. We grabbed a drink at the bar while we waited for our table, and on a warm afternoon, the Dark & Stormy was the way to go. We were seated shortly thereafter, at which point I let my eyes wander a little bit to the urban farmhouse style decor - exposed brick, rustic wood furniture, and an overall feeling of subdued rawness. Well done.  The table split some of the most insane cheese I've ever had, as well as an incredible plate of steak tartare. I took down the meatballs & grits (outstanding), and a few other people had the chicken. I didn't taste it, but judging by the smell, this was one restaurant where it is probably not a bad idea to order the chicken. Skipped dessert, and made our way to Violet Hour afterwards, but this was an awesome meal...
