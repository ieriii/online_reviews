This is a really great, always consistent pizza shop. My favorite so far is the deep-dish sausage, with the pepperoni as a runner up. I have also tried the cheese and a veggie pie, and another thin crust. If you like a deep-dish with a good crust, lots of cheese and filling, and light on the sauce, then you will love this pizza. Its also really cheap, less than $10 for 2 pieces and a large drink. Recommended for sure.
