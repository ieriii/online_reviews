They do fantastic friend chicken at this place...and it is on the NORTH SIDE! It is rare to find a place with great chicken that isn't on the West or South side. I can't speak to the other items on the menu (rice bowl, burrito) because everything I got I buy the chicken, either in whole or wing form. I dig all the sauces and each one is great, depending on what I am in the mood for. Sometimes a guy just wants some buffalo wings, not Seoul Sassy. They also cater out wings for parties....I got wings for the Superbowl. The wings look expensive on the menu, but it is important to remember that each "wing" includes the wing and the drummette.
