The Violet Hour sets the standard that every cocktail bar should aspire to achieve. The drink menu is expertly crafted and the spirits/accompaniments in each drink are meticulously chosen. The environment they've created (furniture, decor, music, decanters, glasses, house rules and all) make for a unique experience. It's not for everyone, and I'm perfectly ok with that. Every time my wife and I are anywhere around the Chicago area, The Violet Hour is at the top of our to-do-list.
