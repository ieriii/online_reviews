This place is aswesome! Food is as good as Le Colonials but for about 1/4 of the price. They are so nice and so gracious and they really appreciate their customers. Aside from that, the food is amazing. We love their Salmon and Curry Chicken. They deliver also. They deliver very fast and always give us fruit. We love Simply It. If you are looking for an inexpensive place to dine and bring your own wine, you really should try this amazing place!
