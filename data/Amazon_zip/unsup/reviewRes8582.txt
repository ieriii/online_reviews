I wanted to badly to love it too...First - the good things. We had an amazing experience with the appetizer special of prosciutto and bufalino mozzarella. It was so fresh and exploded in your mouth with taste like nothing you get here. Next came the pizza - I had the mozzarella, basil and tomato pizza. The taste was great; but the dough was soggy in the middle - not just a little - a lot! Sorry; but that ruined my experience especially with the tab afterward. I don't mind paying the high price for the pizza; but only if it is worth it. This was not.
