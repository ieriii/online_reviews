Well...I understand that most W are known to be trendy hot spots for most Chicago locales and tourist but I'm going to have to disappoint many people by saying this W (on Lake Shore Dr.) isn't a place I'd ever recommend. Let me first start off by saying...it use to be a Days Inn. What Starwood did was slap a coat of paint and added some Ikea like bedding. The service...well I'm not sure if people who work at the W know that they are in the service business. For some reason I find that most people who work there think you own them a thank you. The bars...are awful and over priced. I don't like paying 15 dollars for a drink and a bad one too. The bartenders don't seem to know what they are doing. I'll pass on this W. The one on Adams is top notch!
