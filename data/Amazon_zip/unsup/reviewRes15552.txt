All I can say is DELICIOUS! I had been hoping to go to Violet Hour for the longest, and I'm so happy I finally made it. I came here with 2 of my girlies at 7:30pm on a Tuesday night for drinks. In my opinion, this is probably the best time to come here. Every time I go past this place on the weekends, the line is WAY out the door. By the time we were leaving around 9pm, there was a bit of a line, but it wasn't out the door and it wasn't too long. So I'll say come early, and come on a weekday. The atmosphere here is just simply magical. The seats are all really tall and the lights are really dim so you sort of feel like a little fairy in a mystical world of cocktails. I also feel that I have to mention that the temperature was just right - not too hot not too cold, which is a rare thing in Chicago in December!  I had the Black River gin-based cocktail which was heaven. Easily the best drink I've ever had. I don't think I'd ever waste money on food here when the drinks are so damn good. And (ahem) $12 a piece. When you come to Violet Hour, do yourself a favor and drink your dinner. Bottoms up! ... That is, fancy, lacey, schmoozy Violet Hour-appropriate bottoms up!
