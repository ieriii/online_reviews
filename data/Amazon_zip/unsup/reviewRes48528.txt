Your enjoyment of dining at The Publican will be similar to that of living in an apartment complex: it largely depends on whether or not your neighbors listen to techno music. In some ways, this place is like a more authentic Medieval Times. Everyone sits at one large wooden table, without even the illusion of personal space. Be prepared to sit very close to people you don't know, and perhaps think of interesting anecdotes beforehand so that you're conversations are way more interesting than those had next to you. Fortunately, my employment as a cowboy rodeo astronaut leaves me with many interesting tales. As others have noted, the service is slow, as there seemed to be about one server for every thirty-person table. Ours was very friendly, but he did make me feel like I was dining at TGI Friday's with comments as "Are we cool guys? Everything cool? Hey, bro, how's that salad? Is it cool?" (Note: It was cool.) "Aw, man, you totally destroyed that dessert!" (Note: we did destroy it.) We had the country style ribs and they were tasty, but nowhere near as amazing as The Publican's sister restaurants, Blackbird and Avec. However, the old-style pub setting is a fun concept and it was nice to try. I wouldn't go back, but I can definitely raise a pint glass and a chomp a pig's leg in support of Medieval Times. I mean, The Publican.
