One of my favorite Chicago restaurants. Get the pork rinds. Eating the pork rinds is like eating popcorn, except that pork rinds are way more awesome than popcorn. Get the pork belly. It's not a huge portion, you can finish it in like three or four bites, but it's heaven on earth. I shared it with my buddy once, and as soon as he took his first bite, he looked at me and nodded all like "Oh, hell yeah." Charcuterie is always great too. Excellent beer menu and knowledgeable staff. They'll let you know their recommendations, and you can almost always guarantee that whatever they suggest is worthwhile. I wish I lived closer.
