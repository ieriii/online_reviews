I love the food, I love the seitan, I love the presentation, I love the fries, I love the selection, and most of all I love that this place is ALL vegetarian!! yeah!! Animals rejoice, you don't get eaten here. I even took my dad here (the most hard-core vegetarian you'll ever meet) and he loved the place. I've had sandwiches (turkey, BLT, something else I can't quite remember the meat-version name of) and other stuff like venezuelan arepas - which totally surprised me when they tasted like real arepas. The fries are incredible. There are plenty of sides to choose from, and that's always a plus, but why would you have a salad when you can have sweet potato fries?? The food is absolutely delish, the staff is always nice, and the atmosphere is chill, even though some of the pictures could be thrown in the basement never to be seen again. My little gang of meat-eater friends will come with just to please me but you can tell they're just ok with the food. Why wouldn't they love it? who knows. Meat-eaters. Gotta love 'em. Each time I come here the place is packed. That's 5 stars right there.
