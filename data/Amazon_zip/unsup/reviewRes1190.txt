Last person in Chicago to go to Hot Doug's: me. And 1269th person to review it on Yelp: yup, also me. Wait time: less than 40 minutes before noon on Thursday. Two hot dogs for breakfast: (1) foie gras and sauternes duck sausage with truffle aioli (2) corned beef sausage with Russian dressing, sauerkraut and Swiss cheese--both were pretty tasty, definitely A+ on creativity with flavors. Also had a taste of my friend's chipotle and cilantro smoked chicken sausage with pineapple-kiwi salsa and habanero-Jack cheese, not that impressed by that one. Didn't get to try the duck fat fries, but regular fries were soggy and kind of burnt...would skip it. Street parking is easy. Most important thing you need to know, it's CASH only.
