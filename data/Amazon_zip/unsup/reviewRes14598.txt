My first instinct when walking in was to sit at the bar and start an afternoon long tasting of all the in house brews, but only had one, the "Double-fist" 9% ABV IPA that will not only knock you on your ass after a few pints, but also goes great with the fish and chips on the menu. Im used to seeing cod or catfish when ordering the fish and chips and was slightly uncertain when i saw that the fish of choice was Scrod. Unbeknownst to me at the time, this is merely a younger more tender cod (like eating veal, a younger more tender cow) and I was delighted at the flavors and the slightly spicy novel tartar sauce that accompanied the dish. Service was shockingly fast and exceedingly more helpful than you would expect from a place that, from an outsiders perspective, looks like just another microbrewery/pub place. A little expensive if you're doing a full meal, appetizers, multiple beers and an entre but for just drinks or just lunch its perfect both in price, quantity and quality.
