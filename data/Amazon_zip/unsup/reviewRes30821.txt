I couldn't have asked for anything more. That's the satisfaction I leave with whenever I come to Mastros. Tomahawk was good, double cut porterhouse and bone-in filets were stellar. Also, so were the truffle gnocchi and creamed corn and lobster mashed potatoes. Seafood tower appetizers are incredible-presentation and taste. Alaskan king crab claws, oysters, and gigantic shrimp! Crab cake was very flavorful, oysters rockefeller is good unless you prefer the creamy cheesy kind, wedge salad was bursting with bacon, and lobster bisque really soothed the tummy before the excitement of streak arrivals. Creme brle was incredible with real vanilla beans and berries, chocolate cake was indulgent, but the butter cake tops any dessert in Chicago-be sure to have that one a la mode. My favorite server is Eric. Absolutely does a phenomenal job to ensuring that your meal is unforgettable. He is what completed the dining experience :)
