So I really want to love Schwa because it speaks to me in so many ways. Unpretentious chefs making world class food; a BYO policy I love; food that rivals Tru, Alinea or Trotter's -- but despite all those great things, I won't ever go back. You all know the drill on the nightmare trying to get reservations and how much personal effort it takes to make one. Well get this, I made reservations two months in advance for four of us. I get confirmed. I show up and they tell me that "you called and changed it to a 2-top." I explain that they are mistaken, that it must be someone else who did that and they say sorry, it's been changed and we can only seat two of you! So, I look like an idiot to my friends and we've got to find somewhere else to go on Saturday night at 8pm. They called the next day to tell my "hey, our bad, we made a mistake."  But the problem is that's just their attitude. So, sorry but I can take the indifferent service, the crowded room, but it's still an expensive meal and I do expect some minimal effort at providing service. Go at your own risk, and I'd suggest a back up plan.
