Yelp reviews are regularly on point - but they are wayyyyyyyy off the mark with this place! The great thing that happened was that my friends and I were seated right away on a Friday night. As the night went on, however, I could see why the place was nowhere near packed. Our food took over 40 minutes to get to us and when it came, one of the orders was completely wrong so our friend had to watch us eat till they got it together.  Both orders of fries were completely cold (I was afraid to send mine back as I did not know how long that would take). Moreover, the waitress made more than one snippy comment each time she came to our table. The burgers do come on great buns and the topping choices are very creative indeed - but that is it. The meat was completely unseasoned I'm sure they have to have salt somewhere in that kitchen but it did not touch our food.Below mediocre experience for average price.
