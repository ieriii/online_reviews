Well, take this review with a grain of salt, because I didn't go here for breakfast/brunch, and even though they do offer breakfast all day (which is very cool) I didn't order breakfast. What I did order, however, wasn't too bad, just really nothing special, and the same thing happened to my hubby and what he ordered. I opted for a smoked turkey club, eh not bad, and he for the Cajun chicken pasta, dried-out chicken. They had some nice work on display from local artists, and I do like the idea of a diner-type place that serves booze... but if your not in the neighborhood I would not seek this place out.
