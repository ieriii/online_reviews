I have heard of Revolution for quite some time and I just started getting into brewing, so I went out of my way to try it out and I was not disappointed. The atmosphere is great, especially the central bar. Our waitress was excellent and had an awesome knowledge of their offerings. The food was above average, even though I felt the bacon popcorn could have been better. Now for the real reason I went there, the beer. I ordered samples of all their beers and I have to say they were all amazing, even though some were not for me. My favorite had to be their Iron Fist Pale Ale. Overall this was a great experience. I didn't realize it's right by the California blue line stop; I am definitely stopping by here in the future on my way home from work.
