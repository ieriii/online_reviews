Went last Tuesday to enjoy half-priced margaritas and ended up selecting a pineapple one which only cost $4. Nice, little place in a good location with a very helpful and friendly wait staff. Good sized portions for a very affordable price. Like most Mexican restaurants, offered some combination dishes which came with a lot of food for under $10. Will definitely be going back whenever I am in the mood for Mexican and especially to enjoy good, cheap drinks on a Tuesday evening.
