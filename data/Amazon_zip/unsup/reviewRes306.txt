This is my first EXTREMELY fancy restaurant experience. What can I say other than FOODGASM!!! At first, we felt out of place...we were a younger couple surrounded by a mixed crowd of 40-somes on a double date, a table of young executives buying out the bar, a family of 4 where the parents came saying how they loved it here last time, etc etc. But we felt right at ease when the food arrived and they told us exactly how they wanted to eat it. Hey, we can follow directions :) Every dish was the best dish of my life because of the various tastes, presentations and overall quality. I loved the ideas and creativity behind each dish. Except I hated the beet dish - I can never be friends with a beet and this dish, albeit a wonderfully tender short rib was cooked to perfection underneath it all, was screaming beet flavors. Ewww. I know that I have nothing to compare this to but I'd definitely recommend Alinea to everyone. My "mass quanitity food only, please" and "who cares about presentation and food art" fiance would, too, and that certainly is an accomplishment for Alinea!
