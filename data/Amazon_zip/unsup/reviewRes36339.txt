I guess I'm going to have to go back and give it another whirl. My husband and I went there for lunch today and it was so-so. I had the corned beef panini w/ pasta salad, husband had a sandwich w/ pasta salad. Mine has very little taste, it could have been turkey on the sandwich for all I knew, it tasted like nothing.  Both of our sandwiches basically were what they were, nothing fancy. The pasta salad just wasn't very good, at first it was okay, but the more I ate, the more a really weird taste was left in my mouth. The service was really good, probably my best service experience in Greektown. Prices were pretty reasonable. I will go back to give breakfast a whirl, they have some great offerings on the menu. I was expecting so much more with such positive reviews on the place.
