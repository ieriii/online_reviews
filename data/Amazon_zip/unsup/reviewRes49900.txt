I've visited the Fifty/50 twice, the first time to drink, the second to eat. Both experiences were dramatically different. My first visit was on a Thursday night, and there was an NBA playoff game so it was understandably very crowded. I thought the service was sub-par and the drinks were over-priced. The second visit was on a quiet Monday night to grab a bite to eat with my husband and in-laws. Our watiress was very sweet and helpful, and came back to check on us several times. Wow, I didn't expect their food to be anything better than standard bar fare but I was wrong. I had a spinach salad and it was soooo good, I'm still thinking about it weeks later. My mother in law ordered the salmon, which she said was amazing, and my husband had a pulled pork with bleu cheese sandwich that he loved. I'm very impressed with the wide variety of the menu, it literally has something for everyone. Good drink specials throughout the week, too. Can't wait to come back here.
