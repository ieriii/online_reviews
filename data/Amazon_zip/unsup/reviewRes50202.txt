Brunch, Brunch, Brunch. Brunchy Brunch Brunch. Sooo delicious here! I have been here a handful of times and I love the unique bold flavors of the louisiana breakfast here. A truly hearty meal every time! The bacon is kind of out of control though. The thick cut bacon does my boyfriend and I in. I have also enjoyed some of their seasonal choices. The beignets they bring to you are so fresh sometimes you don't get them right when you sit down. But they are complimentary and I'll take 'em when they are ready!  Good bloodys, lovely tea choices, great coffee and excellent food.  My one beeeeeef... Service depending on the day or time you go can be somewhat lacking. One time we had a really nice attentive waitress another we could barely get our order in. We don't need attitude just a smile and a sorry it took so long or I forgot your drink. No harm done, we're all human right? But I do have to say the hostess always seems flighty or stressed.... luckily we always make reservations on open table so we don't have too much of a problem. And I will admit it can get pretty packed, because of the lay out.  LOVE the decor though... very french american and totally creates great ambience for the experience.
