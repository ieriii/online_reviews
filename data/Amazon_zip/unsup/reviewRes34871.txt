I've been to this place a few times. Once a long while ago when it just opened, then again for a business meeting, now again just because I heard they have a few new menu items. Overall, I'm not crazy about the place. It's cool if you're looking for trendy sushi at semi-reasonable prices. But if you're a sushi fanatic, Sushi X may not satisfy your needs. For one, they don't do sashimi (or sushi for that matter). Huh? How can sushi make up 5 out of 6 letters of your name and you only serve nigiri? Well, that seems a little shady to me. Also, their mega rolls are really big, but fairly light on the fish. So, I don't think I'll be back anytime soon. The overall quality is pretty good, but when a man needs sushi, a man needs sushi.
