Small portions... Good quality food.... Reasonable prices... There is a $7 corkage fee but wines are sold for retail price with no mark up. My only grievences are a very small bar/waiting area...they used a two person seating next to the bar as main seating. People were pretty upset to have that seat...really can ruin an intimate night out for a couple. Also very long wait on a Saturday night it was 1 1/2 hours... the small space made it quite uncomfortable. But overall a decent experience.
