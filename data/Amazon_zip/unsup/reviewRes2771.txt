Dear Tru, I have rarely had more perfect service, from making decisions about wine by the glass to the presentation of the cheese cart,basically on time. The food was excellent with the seared wagyu being the absolute best dish of the night. This was one of the best restaurant experiences I have had in my life and I recommend everyone tries it at least once. However over all alinea was a better meal- which is why i give tru a rating of 4 stars
