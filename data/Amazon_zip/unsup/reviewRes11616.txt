If it wasn't for the long lines and the occasional confused waitress, this place would easily earn 5 stars from me. The coffee is great (which really should be a given at these prices) and the food is even better. Well, at least the Chocolate French Toast is since that is all that I can seem to order. Still, everyone that I am with seems to enjoy their meals. But for my money, the Chocolate French Toast is the real deal, even worth the whopping ten bucks! Think of it as breakfast dessert. As of last weekend (3/25), the dish was on the Fall/Winter menu. I certainly hope it's still there when the Spring menu comes out. Since my bank account is not as full as I would like, I have to reserve trips to The Bongo Room when folks come in from out of town. Which means I can hardly wait to get that guest room ready again!
