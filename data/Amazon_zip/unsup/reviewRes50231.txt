I went for one reason: The Hell Burger. This place gets five stars for having the guts to put this thing on the menu. This is serious, half pound burger, fresh Jalapenos and spicy cheese, topped off with habanero salsa - insane. It gets a 9 out of 10 on the spicy scale. The only dish to top it is the XXX Over The Top Spicy Wings at Jake Melnicks in River North. The place itself is pretty average, cramped, sports bar with a ton of TVs. Great place to go on the non peak hours... when it gets to peak though, time to go...
