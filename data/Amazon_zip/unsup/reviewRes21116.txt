Let me start by saying I am not a fan of drinking/ sipping/ tasting alcohol. I am still at an age where I prefer shots. Unless there is a football game or a life size Jenga game going on then of course I will drink a Blue Moon. Mayan Palace is about 7 minute walk from my apartment. I was really craving some Mexican food and realized that there is a joint on Halsted. So my BF and I went here. I ordered a Pina Colada from the bar while waiting for our seats, and I felt like I was at the beach at the Domincan. BUT I did not get a margarita even though they were only $4. I had the steak fajitas and they were sooo good. I finished it all by myself and craved more. 2nd time... I had a margarita. and OMG!!! It was like drinking juice. And after I finished it and went to use the ladies room.... I definitely got a real good buzz. They are not cheap with their Tequila and it showed in my walk home. I have since been there a good dozen times and I love everything there. Try: Spinach & Mushroom Quesdillas, Guacomole, Vallarta Chimichanga, & the steak fajitas. The Vallarta Chimichangas are def my favorites!
