I went here for Valentine's Day weekend for brunch. We did not have to wait a long time for our table and our waitress was attentive and friendly--though she encouraged us to order desserts on a Zen level and we politely backed down her suggestions.  I had the Chicken and Waffles which were really tasty. The chicken is fried perfectly and the waffles came with 2 types of syrup. Our favorite part were the strawberry mimosas and the blood orange mimosas. Those were really delightful and fantastic.  The restaurant is just like Cheesecake Factory but larger and sans cheesecake. It does have touristy feel (granted it's on Mag Mile) but for a Valentine's Day brunch with my sweetie it was a lot of fun and we both had a good time.
