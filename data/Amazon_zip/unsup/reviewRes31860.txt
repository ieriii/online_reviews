I had long been awaiting a dinner here after hearing some great reviews and was excited to make the trip last Friday. Unfortunately, I just may have been misinformed.  Food was below average - shrimp and pork egg roll appetizers were flavorless. Shrimp Lo Mien noodles - oily and also lacked any distinctive flavor. Sushi was a complete disaster - we ordered the rainbow and scorpion rolls - the flavors were off and fish was not up to par with any of the BYOB joints I frequent for 1/2 the price. Service was spotty - they promptly seated my girlfriend and I at one of their communal tables, which is what I would expect from this trying-to-be-trendy atmosphere - though I had to wait a very long time for my second glass of wine when I clearly wanted to drink it along with my meal, not as a digestive. For the prices affixed to this menu and the quality of food, service and ambiance, I can't imagine taking another trip to Sunda. Maybe I ordered the wrong combinations/menu items, maybe I was there on an off night, but a bad taste was certainly left in my mouth after this dining experience.
