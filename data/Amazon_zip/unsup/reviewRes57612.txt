My favorite restaurant in Chicago! I have been here about twenty times and I have never had a bad experience. Whenever my parents come into town, they insist that we go to Geja's. Expect to spend quite a bit as it is a bit pricey, but well worth it and they have a very good wine selection. We always wait for a booth as the tables are in the middle of a very narrow walkway and I was always getting bumped into when I sat there once, so now, I just wait for a booth every time. The bar is a decent place to wait and have a glass of wine. This is the best place to bring a date as it is dimly lit and they have a Flamenco guitar player to add to the atmosphere to go along with the delicious fondue and good wine.The only negative I can think of is how my clothes smell when I leave.
