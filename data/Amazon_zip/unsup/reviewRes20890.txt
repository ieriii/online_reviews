I really really wanted to like this place, you guys. I had heard so many good things about it. I came here with a date. It was a spur of the moment thing, but we were seated at a table in the bar area right away despite the fact that it super crowded.  There was a good beer selection. I ordered the pork chop. It was dry and flavorless. I can make a way better pork chop with a skillet, olive oil, salt & pepper and it won't cost anywhere near the $30 my date paid for it.  I really felt bad, but the restaurant was his suggestion and he insisted on paying.  We moved over to the bar after we ate and were accosted by a drunken conference attendee. The bartender had stopped serving the guy but ignored the fact that he was bothering me and I had to ask the bartender to take care of the guy so he'd leave me and my date alone. I'm not sure I'll ever bother going back there. I could see potential for a really nice dinner but that's not the experience that I had.
