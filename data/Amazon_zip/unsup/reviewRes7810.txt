I had read the reviews... and heard the stories... And they are all true. Thank you Fogo for ruining my evening.  My little brother was in town from Denver for my birthday and we partook in a little meat heaven. Fogo de Chao was extraordinary!  Let's start with the salad bar alone. That salad bar has to be the best salad bar in the city: Fresh mozzarella, hearts of palm, freshly sliced prosciutto... not the normal things you might find on a salad bar. But, you must not feast away on the salad bar... Oh no, no, no... while feasting on the salad bar you will miss the best part: The Meat Course.  Holy crap that was a lot of meat. And it was all so deliciously prepared. Filet Mignon, prime, ribeye, lamb, chicken... whew. It makes me full just thinking about it. The polenta was great also. But, after the meal ended, i would like to say BOO to you, Fogo De Chao... I was absolutely worthless for about 6 hours following your meal. I was able to do two things: Stare at my TV and sweat. That's about all. The meat coma that followed was intense and long. I was so full and the rest of my plans for that evening had to be put on hold so i could sit on my couch and digest. Crazy meat course...
