Peppercorn 8 oz filet + horseradish sauce + asparagus = HEAVEN. Have been here twice and had amazing service and delicious food both times.  Word to the wise: we reserved a table outside on a Friday night and as soon as we were seated we asked to move inside - the "ambiance" was sub-par, with people from neighboring places hanging and talking loudly around ten feet from our table (which was at the very edge of the outside seating area - boo) and tiny bugs infesting our butter, water, wine, and eyes, ick. Wasn't feeling that. The staff moved us quickly and with no questions asked - very professional. If you love mushrooms and deliciousness get your steak al forno - it looked absolutely amazing and judging by how fast my boyfriend ate it, tasted just as good.
