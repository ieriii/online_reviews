I've been to Little Bucharest three times over the last three years, and while I love the atmosphere & character, the service and food doesn't justify the price. First off, it seems that every time I return the menu gets smaller and smaller. Currently, they have one vegetarian dish and I believe one seafood item. As I don't eat meat, this really limits my options. They used to have an amazing shrimp dish, but as of May 2011 it was no longer on the menu. Secondly, the staff is very friendly, but we always seemed to get overlooked. Maybe we don't look like big spenders, but I always see the owner chatting up the guests meanwhile our drinks are forgotten. Our server was quite sweet and apologetic about our long wait for food & drinks (on this particular night she had a huge party and the place seemed to be understaffed) but this has happened before. I do enjoy the lively atmosphere, the Romanian beer & wine options, as well as eating something outside of my usual comfort zone. However, I feel the menu could be expanded, the service improved and/or the prices lowered.
