I have visited this restaurant several times now when I'm visiting Chicago and the service, food, environment is absolutely tremendous. The men that bring the food around are always pleasant. The food is always hot, well seasoned, and just down right delicious. It is a nice casual atmosphere that I just love to dine in. The prices are alittle high but, you get what you pay for. Whenever I make a visit I make sure to visit. Oh and by the way, try their warm pineapples. They are to die for. Excellent restaurant!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
