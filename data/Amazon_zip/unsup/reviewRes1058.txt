Tried Hot Doug's for the first time last week. Wow! I've heard about it for a while now but never had a chance to make the trek to Avondale from Hyde Park in the middle of the day. Arrived at 3:30 and the line outside was ridiculously long but moved fairly fast. Unfortunately, we'd nearly made it to the front of the line when we realized it was cash only. But some extremely nice people standing in front of us overheard our conversation and offered to cover us. They were great! Allie and Tyler if you are reading this, THANK YOU again! We tried the Elvis, an amazing Polish sausage with everything on it, and the Paul Kelly, a beer soaked bratwurst w/ grilled onions. The wait was definitely worth it, and we had the privilege of meeting some really cool people in the process. I would definitely recommend Hot Doug's. Just get there early...and don't forget to BRING CASH!
