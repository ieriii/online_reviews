What a great discovery in the neighborhood! And that's saying a lot because if you've read my reviews you know I'm not big on Meats R Us type places.  Here are the highlights of what I tried: cheese fries - its like glorious spicy cheese wiz, homemade chips w/ french onion dip, I did not get to the muscles in time but they look and smell divine - very popular with our group, the Caesar salad has an interesting curry or mustard spice but just too much - ask for the dressing on the side and the build-your-own turkey burger. The meat was moist and flavorful and on a pretzel bun! And don't forget the fried pickles. Yum! The staff is super friendly and helpful. I can't wait to try more combinations with the turkey burger.
