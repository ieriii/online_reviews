I had wanted to go there for a while and when i had told my boyfriend he was like yeah it's down the street so we walked over one morning. I chose the stuffed french toast and wow. so scrumptious that with the farm greens very tasty my guy got the homestyle skillet which was lacking punch .. along with a side of sausage which again was just ok it tasted a bit dry. they had fresh squeezed juices which i had to partake in . i haven't had fresh cranberry in forever and forgotten what the real stuff tastes like. service was very good. my favorite part other than the french toast which i still dream about was probably the open kitchen i loved watching the different plates going out and being able to see everything made. i'll dine again.
