I ate at this cute little diner last week and it was pretty good. They have a very creative menu with dishes to satisfy any breakfast or lunch craving. Pros: 1. Yummy Mexican hot chocolate- very satisfying 2. You can make anything vegan 3. Friendly wait staff Cons: 1. The booths are really hard to get in/out of. Maybe they were built in a different era when people were smaller- but I felt like an ogre trying to squeeze in and out 2. The fresh lemonade lacks some lemony taste 3. The sweet potato fries were kinda bland compared to those at other restaurants I got the egg sandwich with tofu in place of an egg. It was just ok. I'll remember the experience because after I had taken a bite, I had to sneeze really suddenly. It was truly a beautiful memory that I will cherish. I'll definitely come back- especially since one of my best friends in Chicago is a vegetarian and until recently, I was one as well. It's nice to see a place get imaginative with veggie options.
