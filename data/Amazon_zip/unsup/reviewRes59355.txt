This review is of the grocery store only and not the cafe. For years, I used to stop in here about once a week on my way home from the office. It used to be a great source for meat and fish, and had an outstanding bakery.The past year or so (and more so recently) the quality had really declined. Prices remain high, but meat and fish are barely above Jewel and definitely not on the level of Fox and Obel. Selection of meat and fish has declined. The bakery still is good, but it is tough to justify a trip just for the bakery. The selection of other stuff is often limited.It is too bad, but it is no longer worth seeking out.
