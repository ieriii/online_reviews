I have been to their cafe multiple times...and multiple times they have messed up our order, either it took over an hr, was wrong, wasn't in the system, etc. They have a terrible system of getting the food entered and delivered, and it's unfortunate because while I like their food and it's down the street from my parents, we always debate going strictly based on service. One employee is consistently ridiculously rude, for no apparent reason other than she hates her job. Shouldn't be my problem. They just need an overhaul of the system and I think the problem could be fixed. Luckily, they have the very best rice krispy treats in the city, so they'll always have some of my business.
