I was so excited to try Demera. I drove past it or years. But finally they had a deal on Groupon. I'm all for trying new foods. So I was quite excited to experience Ethiopian food. Me and a girl friend stopped by after class around 5. When we got there the place was quite empty with only 2 other tables being taken. 4 people in the restaurant before us. It took a few minutes for us to even be greeted and seated. I should've taken that as a hint for what was to come. The overall service was horrible. We were never checked on during our meal. The food took nearly 40 mins to arrive. All the waitresses seemed as if they had an attitude problem. One waitress stopped by our table after standing by us n ask rudely if were done. The whole experience made us feel so unwelcomed. However they were quite friendly to the table behind us. I don't know if it was because we were college students or what. But it was a horrible experience and I have never felt so neglected and unwelcomed in a restaurant. The food was nothing spectacular. Especially for the price they were charging. Thank goodness I had my groupon so I didn't feel ripped off. The spongey bread threw off the taste of every dish. The dishes themselves were not bad. I enjoyed the potato, the tilapia, the spicy beef was tender. But overall the bread completely ruined the dishes for me because it made everything taste super sour. It over powers every other taste. Never again.
