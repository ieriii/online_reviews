WOW. I LOVE LOVE PIZZA in general and their white pizza was DA BOMB. ( i probably should not write/say/humm bomb since im brown, but oh well) We got their white pizza with tomatoes and basil. It was definitely one of the best pizzas i have ever had, and i have had my share of pizzas pre-yelp days. I try not to go to pizza joints b/c im always there, but im glad i went here! If you love THIN crusts, their normal crust is thin enough, but next time im ordering it thin. ( im not a huge deep-dish fan) I remembering eating pizza from famous pizza in NYC and NJ ( those small pies of takeout heaven) and this comes SOOO CLOSE! I will be returning as soon as i burn off the calories i gobbled in by eating almost half of a medium pie ( which is enough for very very hungry two mid sized people). We paid 20 bucks for a MED pizza + a soda... not bad for over-inflated chicago prices. PLEASE go!
