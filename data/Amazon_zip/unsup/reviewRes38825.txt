Chicago's got quite a few great beer bars, but Hopleaf is about as close to perfect as it gets. There's not alot new that can be said about it. This bar almost singlehandedly moved me to Andersonville, due to its huge and often-changing beer list (and wine, and mead in season). The food menu is fairly small, but let me be clear - everything is incredible. There is no way to avoid the incredible mussels, which are served with the delicious pommes frites, my favorite fries in the city. Last time, I had an awesome onion and goat cheese tart, and also a Gunthorp Farms pork stew. My advice - wait for a dining room table, where you'll have some space, and get to drinking.
