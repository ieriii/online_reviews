I just went back last night to pregame before the yelp wicker park bar crawl or whatever it was called. we got the plain pizza with clams which was pretty good but very garlicy (sorry for those that I talked to at the crawl, i tried to eat a lot of gum) as usual the beer was good, i had the porter and the hefe. no reservations, in and out under an hour and a half friday evening.
