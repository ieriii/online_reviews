3 stars for awful service at the bar (only 2 tenders on a packed night to cover the whole restaurant). Live music in the bar was very cool! I will say that the food is still very good. We had small plates at the bar and despite having to literally wave down the tenders on every occasion, I was very impressed with the quality of food. Ropa Vieja, Guac, Ceviche...all very good. I ordered a mojito, easy on the sugar/syrup and it was perfect.  Would definitely consider Carnivale again and especially for a large group/party.
