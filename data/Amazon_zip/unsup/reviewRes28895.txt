Nothing here was bad, but only one dish stood out for me: the lettuce wraps appetizer. Other than that, the food was not nearly up to the level of the place I normally go, which is Pot Pan in Wicker Park. I normally go with panang curry at any Thai restaurant, but Opart's was disappointing. Fortunately we split several dishes amongst six people, so I got to try some other things too. The spring rolls were weak, the green curry was probably the second best thing we ordered, and the basil chicken was not that good. Again, everything was edible and cheap, so they get points for that, but I wouldn't consider this one of the better Thai places in the city.
