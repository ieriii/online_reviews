As you walk by this restaurant, the festive music plays and entices you into an culinary escape. With copious amount of outdoor seating, a warm summer night is the ideal time to go. I found the food to be adequately seasoned and the portions satisfying. The yucca was not the best but the shakes are worth making the trip to Irazu by themselves. I got the guanabana shake and it was surprisingly bland. However, my friend got the house specialty "oatmeal" shake (I know, sounds a little strange but texturally is a treat) with banana. The shakes are an amazing dinner drink or great for dessert. Vegetarians can eat here but is a carnivorous happy-place. BYO is o.k. and parking is hit or miss. The only thing missing from this establishment is sand for you to plant your feet while you eat.
