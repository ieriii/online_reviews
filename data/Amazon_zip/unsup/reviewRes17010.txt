Let me preface this review by saying that I'm not generally a fan of food that is so spicy it makes your eyes water and your mouth burn, however if that's your thing, then you might like this place. I have eaten authentic Indian food and I feel like the food at India House is a wee bit too heavy on the spices, they almost hit you over the head with it--it drowns out any real taste the food might have. Way too much curry in everything and almost all the dishes in the lunch buffet made my mouth burn--not a good burn, a painful unnecessary burn. Real Indian food is supposed to be a delicate balance of spices with different tastes shining through each dish, but here all you taste is the curry and everything pretty much tastes the same--spicy. Service is not very good and a bit rushed during lunch, they try to get you in and out as quickly as possible like cattle. And another unfortunate side effect of eating here is that you and your clothes reek like curry and Indian food for several hours after you leave the restaurant.
