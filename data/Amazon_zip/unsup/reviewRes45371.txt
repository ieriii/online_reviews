Wilde gets 5 stars in my book-- I usually stick to the steak salad, but they have a full gf menu that can be trusted. When my mom was in town, we ate here two nights in a row just for the gf mac & cheese which was delicious and unique. I also have called to ask food-allergy questions (q: what kind of oil do they fry their fries in? a: a mix of corn and canola oil... (awesome!)) and the staff is very helpful...thus, the 5 stars. General good food-- the turkey burger & sweet potatoe fries, the full Irish breakfast, and for dessert the *must have* is the sticky toffee pudding (sigh). As far as a pub goes, I would say there are great ones out there (Galway Arms will always be one of my favs), and Wilde is more of a Broadway staple. But for a gf or allergy-free meal that can be trusted, Wilde is definitely a place to go no matter what Chicago neighborhood you live in.
