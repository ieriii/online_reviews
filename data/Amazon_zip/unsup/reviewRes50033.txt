My family and I (it was four of us) came here for my father's birthday using the Groupon coupon. I am overall happy with the food, customer service, atmosphere, etc. The only things that I would complain about is that it opens at 5pm and that it does not have its own parking lot. These are the food that we ordered there: - Sangrias (Happy that it is half priced on Monday) - Mango Fruit Juice - Picada Colombiana - Estrana I would highly recommend one to get these food there. The picada colombiana was overall great. The yuca was good; the chicken was good; the arepa was good, (all were just good!!). We fell in love with the steak so we asked for the extrana dish. We ended up only getting two entrees since the entrees were huge! (The picada columbiana is said serve for 2 people, but really it can be for 3.) The customer service was very good. We told our server that this was the first time that we were going to try Colombian food. She was very generous and was very helpful throughout our process of trying Colombian food. She provided us recommendations and provided a detailed, useful description of what the food are. The atmosphere is very nice. Our family differs in ages so it is difficult for us to find a restaurant that provide a nice atmosphere for all of us. Nevertheless, it was good as the adults, teenagers and children enjoyed it. It was peaceful , pretty, and warm. I would then highly recommend others to try out this restaurant. It really does not matter what type of people they are. I do think that everyone will enjoy it.
