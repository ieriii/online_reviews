The only reason these gorgeous menz of the middle east don't get the full five stars is because they don't take credit / debit cards (and they used to take them - very frustrating). I was brought here by a friend first around '02. Been coming back ever since. Food is very inexpensive, very tasty and served by some of the hottest men on earth. And YES, that does make a difference.  C'mon baby light my shwarma!!!
