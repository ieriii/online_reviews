I don't know how anyone can give Frontera Grill anything less than 4 stars, unless they're bothered by the wait, or unfamiliar with quality Mexican cooking. Don't go if you expect tacos and burritos. This is the food I've enjoyed at top restaurants in Acapulco, Oaxaca, and Mexico City. Once you get a table, trust your waitstaff - they've knowledgeable and friendly, if a bit overworked. Don't bother with the generic tequila - the margaritas are better with a premium brand. Watch the daily specials, like the mahi-mahi in spicy sauce, beans, and greens.
