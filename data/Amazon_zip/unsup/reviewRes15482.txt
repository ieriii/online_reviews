The infamous Violet Hour.  Let me just preface by saying that VH was originally on my shit list after my now-bf tried to take us here after dinner on our first date. We were quoted a wait time, they got our numbers, but we never got a call. Not cool. From then on, I pictured VH as this snobby place and I kept on telling myself that I wasn't missing out on much anyways. I'm going to say it: VH, I was wrong. We came here with another couple as soon as it opened at 6PM on a Saturday night for several drinks before going to dinner and we were seated in a nice cushy booth. WOW. I loved the interior of this place. There is so much privacy and the tall throne-like chairs in the front room were so Alice in Wonderland-like. It was dark, sexy, mysterious, romantic, & cozy.  The drinks were spectacular. Some of the ingredients for the cocktails read like gobbledygook to me. Sazerac...whatsit? Chartreuse...I thought it was a type of fabric? It didn't matter. We got amazing recommendations from our server. The presentation of each of the drinks was beautiful as well. Seriously, art.  At $12 a drink, you're not coming to VH to get schwasted, but it's perfect for pre- or post-dinner drinks.  You're off my shit list, VH.
