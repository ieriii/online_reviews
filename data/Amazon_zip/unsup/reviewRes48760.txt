Like this place a lot, even though I'm not a huge meat eater. Don't sit at the bar on a busy night unless you don't mind a couple splashes of beer here and there! (We moved to a communal table when one opened up). The staff was very nice, and our waiter was helpful; he made good suggestions and knew the menu very well (which is nice, since its a bit confusing if you haven't been). Everything we had was delicious, and I only wish I would have saved room for dessert since there a few very tempting options. The only weird thing was that there was no music playing, which I didn't notice since it is pretty loud in there, until a random song came on...then nothing again, until right before we left they played another song.  Would go back, and recommend to friends. Fun restaurant, and good for groups.
