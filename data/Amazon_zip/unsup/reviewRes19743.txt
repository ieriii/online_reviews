Coast is a great sushi restaurant. With the emergence of sushi place after sushi place, Coast stands near the top. I enjoy lots of things from a sushi menu and I tried lots of them my first time at Coast. I had fresh salmon, yellowtail and spicy creamy scallop sushi. All were excellent. Almost the best I have ever had. I also had bites of various rolls our table ordered. I had at least one piece of 4 different rolls. They were all excellent as well. I tried the spicy miso soup and the normal miso soup. The spicy is spicy. Make no mistake about it. The pieces of jalapeno floating on top of the soup were a bit much for me - and I like spicy food. It was girlfriend's birthday and they brought her dessert but then added it to the bill??!! HA. Now that is lame. That won't happen at Sai Cafe. All in all, Coast comes highly recommended. I look forward to my next visit.
