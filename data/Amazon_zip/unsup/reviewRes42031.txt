I love this place. Any time I'm craving some delicious ph, I make my way over to Tank. Convenient to get to, and always fantastic. Even when every table is full and you are forced to stand there awkwardly while being tempted by the amazing smells, I've never waited more than 5 minutes for a table. Thank goodness. Anyway, the beef ph is awesome and it's my go-to dish. The crispy pork rolls are heavenly. Oh man. The restaurant itself is a big place that's tightly packed, and a little hectic. But I think that's part of it's charm. So if you want fantastic ph on ANY budget, go to Tank. Even at my hungriest, I've never been able to finish my entire bowl of ph in one sitting. That should be reason enough.
