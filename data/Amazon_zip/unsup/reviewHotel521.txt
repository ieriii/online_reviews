This is a wonderful hotel with a friendly staff and outstanding service. Tracee at the front desk was wonderful. The rooms are large, beds are comfortable with a duvet cover, fluffy towels, reasonably sized kitchen area. Breakfast is excellent, although sometimes difficult to get a table. Pool is good - spa a little hot for most, but stil ok. The only negative... it is located near a fire station, as is other hotels in the area. So get a high floor if necessary, as was our 11th floor. It was not that bad. Valet service is competitive and excellent, but takes about 10 minutes. Overall - this is a terrific value, great services, friendly staff.. Take if from someone who travels frequently. This hotel was nicer than the Chicago Hilton, without the fancy ceiling.  The Hilton does have one of the cows.  that's what you're paying for.
