My family really sucks, they didn't want to eat at Uno's which is famous for their deep dish pizza. It's okay though i'm planning on back to Chi-town pretty soon. My family ordered a anti pasta salad and a 2 topping thin crust pizza, which i understand now because this stuff is full of empty calories and ended up walking it all off ...thank god ! Staff was helpful and excellent customer service.
