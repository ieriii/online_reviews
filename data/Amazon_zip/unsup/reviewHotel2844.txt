On the lower end of Sheraton hotels. The lobby and public areas are nice. The rooms are dated, though some of them do have a nice view. The concierge lounge only does continental breakfast which is kind of a bummer. Location is pretty good, close to Michigan Ave and Navy Pier. All in all, not a bad stay, but don't expect to be wowed.
