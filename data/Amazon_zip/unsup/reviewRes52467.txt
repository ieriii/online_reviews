Bring your own saltshaker, because they don't put one on the table unless you ask, and you will definitely need it. I must have a snooty meat palate. I was rather unimpressed with the quality of what I sampled here. I really only enjoyed a few cuts, and even at that, they weren't special enough to stand out in my mind, e.g., "remember the filet at Brazzaz?!" As for sides--the bananas, which I was really looking forward to, were a major disappointment. I'm quite sure they were standard bananas rather than plaintains, and frankly I think they would have been better presented raw. Brazzaz folds them in a flavorless egg-roll-type wrapper and plunges them in a deep fryer (it seems). Even run-of-the-mill bananas can be elevated with a little grilling, roasting, pan-frying--the point is to encourage some CARAMELIZATION. Without that, you might as well just microwave the fruit, because that would add about as much flavor as this deep frying method does. The polenta and mashed potatoes were less offensive, but didn't add anything to my meal. On the up side, the little popover-type buns they served were a real gem--piping hot, buttery-cheesey-tasting, and somehow airy, light and tastily dense at the same time. And thank God for the roasted pineapple--I ate more of this than anything else. A pineapple lover, I really could not have been happier with this fruit. And if you have to eat here, be sure to have a caipirinha, because mine was fantastic. No comment on the salad bar, since all I did was glance in its direction. Decor and ambience are quite nice, and the service was excellent. Felt more VIP here than Fogo, but I'm starting to think that the large Brazilian steakhouse is more concerned with quantity than quality. For a real meat treat, I'll have to go elsewhere.
