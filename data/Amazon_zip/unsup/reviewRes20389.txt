This gastropub has some very delicious beers on offer and the food was very good. I had the rabbit hash eggs benedict, along with brie potatoes, and goat cheese grits. This is the type of food you will find here. Normal burger fans need not apply. I ended up choosing the above but I was so tempted by the fish and chips. I'd go back again.
