A poor man's Avenues? Not exactly bistronomic in my opinion. I was a big fan of Bowles' work at Avenues Restaurant at the Peninsula, but Graham Elliott was under-whelming to me and my girlfriend. For example, the foie gras-topped Rice Krispie treat, or "spice Krispie" as the menu touts, tasted like something even a stoner with "the munchies" would find totally gross. Other dishes were more palatable, but they still seemed to lack that certain Bowles je ne sais quoi.
