Sultan's is far enough away from the action, yet close enough to Piece Pizzeria to be free of D-bags. The interior is very unique, and the food is very good. Plus, they have unlimited re-fills on the drinks (only if you get water). The portions are very good for the price. The only downside is that they don't take credit cards. Come on, this isn't 1922. Who carries cash anymore? I still give it a 5.
