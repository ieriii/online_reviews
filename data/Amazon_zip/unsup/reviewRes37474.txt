Love this place for lunch. Think panera but 5x better. They have great soups, sandwiches, and salads...I split a burger with my movie date and was pleasant surprised. How good could a burger at a place serves lentil soup be right? It was delicious. The patty was thick and juicy. The meat wasn't over worked so it had great texture. Was a little disappointed I had to share, I would have given up my half of the fries to have an extra bite. Btw their fries are tasty too-sweet potato or Parmesan and truffle!  Now I have never purchased anything from the grocery store, but I have perused and they carry the type of products you expect at trader joes. The location is off the beaten path in my opinion but if you are going to river east or navy pier stop in. They have free parking! (for 2hrs) - bonus! I will remain a regular at F&O.
