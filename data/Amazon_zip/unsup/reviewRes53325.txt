When it comes to encased meats this is the place. Although I won't say they have my favorite Chicago style Dog, Doug never disappoints. Be ready for a bit of a wait since this isn't exactly a hidden gem.  If its your first time use the time in line wisely and chat with those around you... its Chicago we're friendly and most likely those standing around you are regulars. Hot Doug's namesake is always behind the counter feel free to ask him for recommendations and definitely don't leave without getting at least one of the specialty dogs.
