HOT DOUG'S never fails me! As a Chicagoan, it's hard for me to NOT order Chicago Dogs. Every time I visit, I always make a stop at Hot Doug's and order at least three different types of sausages and one dog. The wait is a part of the experience and every experience has been amazing. Quick tip for foodies: Don't eat Hot Doug's before going to Alinea. I learned the hard way. LOL!
