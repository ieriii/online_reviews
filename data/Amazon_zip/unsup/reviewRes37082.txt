Lazy sundays are best spent at F&O. With a wide selection of Jeni's ice cream-- it becomes quite the feat contemplating which flavors to lug home.  Take a stroll around and sample to your heart's content. Have a cup of coffee while nibbling on their heavenly pound cake. Stop by the cafe for a bite to eat-- their offerings rival that of their sit-in bistro on the other side-- however, expect no difference on weekend wait times for both places. Notable noms: truffle fries, quiche lorraine, and eggs florentine!
