This place is awesome and the prices are pretty good considering what you get for the money. If you go with one of the dinners you get a salad, a cheese fondue appetizer (with breads, grapes, and apples), your actual dinner which consists of your meats, vegetables, and dipping sauces, and then there is the awesome dessert fondue. They actually light it on fire and you get to toast your marshmallows over it. They also give you awesome fresh fruit and poundcake. Aside from the excellent food it is super romantic and classy and the service was really great when I went. I have never been to the melting pot but I have friends that have been to both and they agree that this place leaves the melting pot in the dust. Personally I prefer places that aren't chains which is one of the reasons I chose Geja's to begin with. Geja's prices are also better. For what you may pay only $40 a person for at Geja's (like the premiere dinners I was talking about earlier), you would easily spend close to $80 a person for at the Melting Pot. It's defenitely worth checking out.
