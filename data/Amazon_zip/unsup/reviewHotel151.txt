My mom really loved this place. We arrived at 8AM, wanted to check in really early, and they got us in quite early at 12PM. We just walked around town for a bit, and our room was ready. The valet parking was $45 a night (or for 24 hours) but was convenient and safe. They have free coffee and tea in the morning. Only one downer was that wireless is $9.99 a day, what? Who charges for internet these days? I guess they want to keep that also historic just like their building. You could tell the building wasn't brand new, but the rooms were very clean and neat. Air conditioning worked great and the water pressure was awesome. They have clean down pillows and down comforter which made me feel at home. If it wasn't for the paid wireless internet, I would have given them 5 stars. But it was well worth the $96 I paid through expedia.
