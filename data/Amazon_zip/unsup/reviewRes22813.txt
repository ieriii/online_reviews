Not the spot to go if you want to grab something quick (maybe if you call ahead for takeout), but otherwise a wonderful experience. The side dishes were all very flavorful even the ones with little eye appeal (I'm looking at you, refried beans), and of course the grilled steak... Can't say enough about it. We waited for outside cause, not having been here in ages, I thought the inside would be hot and cramped since it was close to the kitchen, but as I saw on my way to wash my hands, it's actually quite pleasant inside--next time I'll certainly pick "first available". The only minor complaint is service, while very friendly, was a bit slow, but that's because all of the food is made with care. There's a good reason this place packs 'em in on the weekends.
