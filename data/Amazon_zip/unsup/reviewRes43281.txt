Yum! I love pizza with good taste, and this definitely fits the bill. We got the pan pizza, and it's definitely a filling sort of pizza. The garlic bread wasn't really worth it (you'd be better off making your own), and they oddly included a small bottle of red Mountain Dew with the order for free (too bad I think Mountain Dew is toxic waste). But still, great pizza!
