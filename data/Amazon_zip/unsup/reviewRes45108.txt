I may be going out on a limb, but I would venture to say that Anteprima has the best NY strip steak in the city. I would love to share more about this quaint little joint, but it's all I've ever gotten when I've gone. It's served with a warm arugula salad with shaved parmesean cheese that, when mixed with the juices from the steak, allow you to very easily clean your plate. A bit pricey and not much elbow room, but worth it.
