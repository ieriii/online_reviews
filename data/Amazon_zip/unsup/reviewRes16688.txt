I love this place. I've been here twice and neither time disappointed.  The raspberry mojitos are good, not too sweet. My husband swears by the caipirinha but that is definitely too sweet for me. We started off this past trip with ropa vieja, braised beef on plantains with mayo and cheese. I could have just ordered two of these and called it a day.  I decided on the Costilla de Res, braised short rib and it was amazing. The beef was so tender and everything that came with it, even carrots (see my last review) were delicious. Husband had the Churrasco which was equally tasty, the goat cheese puree was a tad bit smokey which was odd but otherwise, everything was yummy. I'll definitely be back, there are way too many appetizers left for me to try.
