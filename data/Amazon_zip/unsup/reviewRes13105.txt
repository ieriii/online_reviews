Good fresh fish and the cereal option makes it a good place to take the kids though not a big fan of over $4 for a bowl of cereal. Three of us adults had fish and the other two plates were outstanding (Baramundi and Walleye) while my Perch was less ideal as overfried. But the appetizers are good, beer selection provides some uncommon varieties, and service is very friendly. I would choose a different fish dish and the prices are a little high but I will come back again.
