In the mood for cheap but good margaritas, and maybe some Mexican food? Then try Garcia's. Their menu is reasonably priced with generous portions, especially their baby-sized burritos!!! Their margarita's are delicious and also light on the wallet. Garcia loses one point for ther guacamole. I'm not too sure if it's real guacamole. I decided to do a test with it. I bought the quacamole and put it in the fridge. If it was still the same green color instead of the oxidized brown color after a night in my fridge, then I was not going to buy their mutant guacamole again. Needless to say, I've been going elsewhere for my guac and chips!
