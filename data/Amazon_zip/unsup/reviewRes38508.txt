Super duper tasty mussels. The bartenders aren't half as mean as people always talked about when I first came to Chicago. True that if you come early you'll have a better all around experience...because you'll be able to sit at a table with the people you came with instead of standing in a corner, looking longingly at your friends who are sharing bar stools with strangers. Even when busy the food comes out: hot, good and fast.
