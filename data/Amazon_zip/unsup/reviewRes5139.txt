I ate at The Purple Pig on Saturday night and thought it was good. We were there at 5, so we were seated right away. My first impression was that the place was very loud, however, it only seemed to get louder while we were there. Maybe it was because the tables were so close to one another. I could barely hear my friend across the table, let alone the people next to us! The waitress recommended my friend and I order about 5-6 dishes to share. We were hungry, but not too hungry, so we decided to start with three and go from there. What we ordered: 1. Salt roasted beets-sweet and delicious. The goat cheese was light and perfect--loved it! Pork neck bone gravy with ricotta-excellent toasted bread, rich layered tomato sauce, delicious cheese. Milk braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes-good, very tender, but a little too salty, sparse mashed potatoes--mostly good! After the three dishes we felt full and decided not to order anything else. The waitress seemed a little annoyed that we only ordered the three dishes, but she was nice enough and the service overall seemed good. When we left around 6, there were throngs of people waiting outside. I would recommend getting there earlier if you don't want to wait!
