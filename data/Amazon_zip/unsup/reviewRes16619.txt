I have only been here twice. With the sort of wait and exclusivity, its kind of hard to be a regular. Not to mention the especially expensive drinks. Regardless, I am a fan. If you can figure out a good time frame to come (I won't tell you mine), and actually you can ask if you can leave a phone number and get them to call you when your table is ready, this is quite a nice place to impress someone. While your date would not be so impressed about the wait (be smart and dont do Violet Hour date in the middle of a snowy winter), the ambient once you get inside is pretty impressive. Its quiet, its dark, it has a nice fireplace, you can talk, or just watching the bartenders is entertaining. The drinks are classic and refined, and I love that. balanced and well concocted drinks that you savor, not get wasted upon.
