Really great for the lunch buffet. The options are great including quite a few veggie options. They bring naan bread and tandoori chicken to your table, and then you can try the desserts (I'm partial to the little balls of death... the fried dough in the cardamom syrup. Yum). Then, head back to your office and enjoy your food coma for the rest of the afternoon.
