ok, i know i'm late to the game. i just tried this place like a month or so ago. my friend ordered it on a movie night and i was hesitant. i do not like deep dish so i asked for thin crust. even though this place is known for deep dish pizza...the thin is out of this world. i could not stop eating it. it's really not that thin.  my boyfriend and i went back the other night to have it again. the service was good and we even had left overs the next day. the pizza tasted just as good or not better the next day. next time i have friends in from out ot town, i'm bringing them here.
