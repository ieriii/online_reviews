My first taste of this gem's delectable middle eastern food was on a food tour. It was a 1/2 falafel sandwich. "Wow," I thought. "This place is pretty Fin good." I didn't even realize I'd like falafel until I came here. It's just deep fried chick peas for God's sake. Well, I'll be damned because they can deep fry and season their chick peas better than Oasis Cafe and even Taza! On top of that, they offer a tremendous value. You will either be really full or really full with leftovers. They have a line on weekend nights, but who doesn't in Wicker Park? Their menu is extensive enough to satisfy. I have yet to try their salad bar, but it looks pretty daym tempting. I don't remember all what I ordered on the few times I've been here; just know that nothing will disappoint. I've taken friends here, too. That's the mark of a good restaurant! I'm a cheapskate, a huge critic, and a lover of Sultan's Market. I love this place, and I know you will too. The hype is true. Visit now. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
