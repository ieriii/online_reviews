If you like meat, this is the place for you. Like everyone else has said, the service is impeccable. They work as a team. Plates are cleared so quickly you won't notice, water is filled, meat appears before you've even placed your card down green side up. I'd recommend going for a late lunch. It's the same food as dinner but half price. I've gone and not gotten any meat, so I'm probably not getting my money's worth, but the experience is fun and if everyone else in your party is getting meat, it'll even out. The salad bar is ridiculous. There is a bowl of bacon on it. A giant bowl of bacon. If that doesn't persuade you, I'm not sure I can.
