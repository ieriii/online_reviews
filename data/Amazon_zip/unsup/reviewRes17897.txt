This is the best Indian food I have ever had. However, I have never been to India, but I have eaten Indian in Europe. In terms of specific dishes, I really enjoy their selection of "street food" (especially the Papdi Chat). The tandoori chicken is delicious -- also the best I have ever had. My girlfriend is very particular when it comes to the temperature of food (i.e. she requires her food to be piping hot); India House delivered! Their service was great; everyone was very friendly and cordial. The only downside would be cost; it is a bit on the pricey side. Whenever I am back Chicago, I salivate for India House.
