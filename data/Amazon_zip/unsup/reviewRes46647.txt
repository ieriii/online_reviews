I recently moved extremely near to RJ Grunts so I've done a couple of carry out orders. My girlfriend and I tried the BBQ Pulled Pork sandwich and California wrap most recently. The wrap was decent but nothing outstanding, but the pulled pork was amazing! Served on a toasted challah roll and cooked extremely tender. Order with the cottage fries and you've made the right choice. The first time we ordered I went with the buffalo chicken wrap (which was excellent) and veggies. The veggies were not great - cooked carrots and peas. My girlfriend ordered the buffalo chicken fingers but was disappointed to find they were not already drenched in the buffalo sauce. The result was a dry, not so flavorful meal. Service for pick-ups is quick and only takes about 15 minutes for them to complete the order. I give it a 4 because if you order the right thing the food is excellent and not too pricey.
