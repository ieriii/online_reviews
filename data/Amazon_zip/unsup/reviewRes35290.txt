Last time I went here, we had such rotten service, that I'm taking away 2 whole stars. The duck is great, but no food is worth the kind of crap we had to put up with. Made a reservation for 2 ducks FAR in advance for a large group on a Wed. night. Got there, waited....waited....waited....waited. Nothing. 45 minutes later, found out they were running low on ducks, so would we mind waiting some more. 30 min after that, ducks came out, but it is now 10 pm on a Wed. night, we are all starving, and pissed. Didn't offer to take any $$ off our bill, we were charged for everything. I *might* go back, but somehow, I doubt it.
