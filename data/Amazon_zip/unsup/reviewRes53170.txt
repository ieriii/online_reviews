We first tried to go to the other location, but they were about to close so they suggested we go here to sit down.  It was Friday night, so they were pretty busy, but we were seated right away on the patio, which is enclosed in winter (presumably it's open-air when the weather's better). The staff are super friendly. We had maduros for an appetizer. Delicious! I had rabo encendido- oxtail. It was my first time having it. When it came out, I was surprised at how BIG it was.  I guess I never thought about how big oxens' tail vertebra are before.  It was very tasty. It also is kind of fatty. This isn't what I'd recommend if you're looking for a lean meat. It comes with rice, black beans, and maduros. I also had a guava shake, but it was very mild, and I didn't feel like finishing it- not that it was bad, it just wasn't what I was looking for. My boyfriend had ropa vieja. It also was good, flavorful and tender. He also had Cuban coffee- it was served soo hot, and was strong.
