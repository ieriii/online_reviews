I've been coming here for Years and the food has always been great and the service has been super consistent. Although prices can be high, the chenjeh and lamb is a great combination of meet. You get one skewer of each and it will be sure to fill you up. A side of hummus as an appetizer works nice and a bumya with tea as a dessert always hits the spot
