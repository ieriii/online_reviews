Outstanding menu and certainly worthy of the accolades. I feel I would be repeating the 5 star reviews. Thus, I'll leave some advice if you are thinking of dining here. One, don't be shy to take a picture of the food. It is definately worthy of your FB or Flickr page. Two, if you are driving, drive slowly when you are north bound on Halsted because it can be difficult to spot. Three, the meal is an event within itself . So don't try to couple it with a Steppenwolf play. Lastly, if you don't do the wine pairing, talk to the somelier for suggestions. A poor pairing can ruin the meal.
