Saturday was my second visit, both for brunch. I am still waiting for the wow. At the point where I will only go back for dinner. OK, dishing it out ... Food: Heavy is the word that comes to mind first. Had the shrimp and grits; sauce totally dominated the dish and was way out of whack, ratio-wise, to the S&G. Much, too much. Shrimp: Cooked fairly well. Overall, an OK dish, hardly great. Dad had the Biscuits and Gravy and he said the flavor of the gravy was still with him an hour and a half later. And not in a good way. I tasted the gravy; I can see what he meant. Biscuits were good, though, flaky and buttery. Mom's bacon was crispy and very tasty, salty goodness. Her eggs were cooked well. My "one hour" eggs had not reached the custardy quality they were apparently going for. They were still too runny and unevenly cooked. Service: Perfectly fine. Not special. Good. A solid good. Coffee (which was very good, by the way) was promptly filled. Decor/ambiance: I like it. Comfortable. Although I must say it gets noisy in there. Be forewarned. It's full of cool people, but I did not feel out of place with my nearly 70-year-old parents. But then again, they are cool people. Price: A little high, but not offensive. Overall: Both visits left me wanting more. The first time we went, my Dad's dish was served way too cold. They heated it up more on request, and the first visit was better. But neither was five-star worthy. I want to like this place oh-so-badly, but it hasn't lived up to the Hipster Heaven Hype. I will try it again -- one more time as of now -- for dinner, but I am not clearing my schedule to do so. I'll go in the summer ... will be curious to see if there is more finesse in the food in the warmer months. If so, I am out for good.
