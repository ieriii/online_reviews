Hot Doug's is as good as it gets. Whether you go with friends and wait in line, or sneak in the door right before close (PS, there is usually a limited line there are this time on Mon/Tues/Wed), it is always a pleasure to get to go to this fine Chicago establishment. I would like to ask yelp to increase their rating system another 5 stars for the fact that Doug is there every day, greeting every customer. If he's not there? They're closed. That's pretty rare in this day and age. Bring real money, they don't take credit cards. Doug, I will see you later on.
