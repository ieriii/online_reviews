I was very excited to try brunch at the Publican. I had read several great reviews and took my husband and my mom there on a Saturday. Let me start with, the food was really good! My husband and I had the pork schnitzel and waffle and my mom had the scrambled egg focaccia. The waffle was unbelievably light, the schnitzel was very tasty and salty. I'm normally not a fan of salty food but salt worked with the pork. My mom's entree didn't look very big but turned out to be a lot of food. The Mimosas and Bloody Marys were ok, not bad but I've had better. Our waitress seemed like she didn't care about anything and wasn't overly pleasant. My biggest dislike was the price. For two mimosas, one bloody mary, two coffees, three entrees and a side of hash browns, we spent $92! I totally get city prices but $100 for breakfast is a tad too much.
