It's interesting to read some of the other reviews, because I feel like I stayed at a completely different hotel. That being said, we didn't have an extended stay like some of the negative reviewers, so maybe the place just wears on you after a while. We booked a room through a discount site for a belated anniversary staycation. The location of the Allerton is excellent, which is primarily why we chose it. I noted on our reservation that we were celebrating, and upon arrival the front desk agent kindly wished us Happy Anniversary and offered an upgrade at no cost. So sweet - thank you, Allerton! I expected a teeny tiny room based upon the reviews I've seen here, but we were delighted to find a two room suite (bedroom/living room) with two large screen TV's, a desk, a large bathroom, and a King bed. I do agree with those folks who say that the toiletries are minimal...no lotion? I actually mentioned that to my husband, I just assumed they had forgotten ours. Also, no wash cloths? That was odd to me, though it certainly wasn't a big deal. We ordered room service for breakfast in the morning, and as per usual in a hotel, the bill was quite high. The food arrived on time and tasted fine, nothing to write home about. I do appreciate that they accommodated a couple of special requests. If I could do it over again, I would not order room service, primarilly for the cost. When we checked out, the front desk staff inquired about our stay, wanted to make sure we were happy, and wished us well. I genuinely couldn't have asked for a better stay in a better location.
