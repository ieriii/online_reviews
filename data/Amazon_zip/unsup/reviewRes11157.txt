This is for delivery, as I have, of late, found it difficult to have a tasty pizza delivered (food poisoning from one place that I haven't reviewed recently has me off the Chicago deep dish for now). And with that... YAY! Piece is back! We've ordered a few pies from them recently and they have all been awesome. No more crust stuck to the middle of the box. Nice chew, not too much sauce or cheese - little heavy on onion, but I'm sure I could put in a request for them to go light and that would be remedied. And the chocolate pizza? Still about the best dessert/next day's breakfast if it lasts that long thing in the world. Oh! And the delivery guy is great - the pizza arrives still flat in the cardboard and not smushed to the side from the box being carried upright. I'm so happy Piece is back!!
