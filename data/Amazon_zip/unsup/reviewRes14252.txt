Looking for a place with great microbrews? Does this place need to have a communism themed hand carved mahogany bar? You're in luck! Redonk bar notwithstanding, this place is boss. The food is amazing. I ordered a pork shank special that came with some kind of heavenly polenta that I would have eaten a bucket of if given the chance. I will definitely be returning to this place.
