I was so excited on my recent trip to Chicago to try a famous stuffed pizza. Giordano's didn't disappoint! The pizza is very different than what you may be used to. It is more like a pie than a pizza. We were told the wait would be 45 minutes......but, we could pre-order our pizza so it would be ready when we were seated.  We had cocktails and an appetizer of fried calamari (really good!) while we waited for a seat.   The pizza is very different than what you may be used to. It is more like a pie than a pizza. We got one with peppers, onions, sausage and pepperoni. The cheese was really good and really plentiful. Be careful not to order too much,as the pies are really filling.   I would have given 4 stars, if it weren't for the service. Our server wasn't rude, but he was hardly friendly. The cashier where we pre-ordered wasn't any better. A place that is surely brimming with tourists need to be friendlier and more inviting. There are a hundred different pizza places in Chicago. Step up the service guys!
