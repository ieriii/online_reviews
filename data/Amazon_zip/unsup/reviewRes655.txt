Well, this is a place to save for a night that you truly have time to take in the experience. I think that the numerous small plates you sample throughout the night are each a little bit like a piece of art. You almost need to study each plate and take time to appreciate the nuances. That said, I would not show up here starving and hoping for a satisfying meal. If you want that, I'd go out for a nice steak! You'll have to patiently wait for each small mini-course to make its way to your table. The only reason I gave this restaurant 4 stars is that I thought the somber demeanor of the servers got a bit old. I'm sure they are told to act "professional," and thus they don't crack a smile. I also got really sick of being chased by the servers every single time I got up to use the restroom- apparently customers are not allowed to be troubled with opening the bathroom door by themselves:)
