Regular dinner entrees tend to be a little bit lackluster, but the specials tend to be excellent. Brunch, well, it is what it is. Almost all the dishes consist consist of 3 or so different kinds of by-product from enough soybeans to keep a city bus running for a week with a side of potatoes and a fruit garnish.
