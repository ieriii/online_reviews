My husband and I met my parents at the Wit, they were staying there, and overall we were disappointed. We had a few drinks on the very crowded roof top deck. Our waitress was nice, but evidently miss informed. As we were getting ready to leave we asked if we could take our drinks with us to our room, to which she replied "of course". Obviously that was wrong, because as we left my husband was surrounded by about six employees, who ALL proceeded to tell him he could not leave with any drink, even to go back to our room. We've never been to a place where you could finish your drink in your room. Bummer, we won't be going back there any time soon.
