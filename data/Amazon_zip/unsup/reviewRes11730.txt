I avoided Piece for years because it looked like a yuppie convention, but then I tried the pizza. And the beer. So, now I'm hooked. I dislike Chicago-style pizza immensely, so Piece is a very welcome addition to the city. The crust is excellent, and I actually prefer the New Haven-style option (no mozzarella on top) to the more traditional options. As for the beer, Piece has its own master brewer, and I've had some absolutely fantastic pale ales there -- very hoppy, complex, and intense. The atmosphere isn't anything special, but it's a nice enough space. And while I'd probably avoid it on live music nights, otherwise it's a great place to hang out, eat, drink...and then order a few more rounds.
