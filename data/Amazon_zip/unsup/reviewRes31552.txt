I give it a mixed review. The wine, shrimp cocktail (and amazing horseradish), double cut pork chop, and sides of wasabi mashed potatoes and truffle gnocchi were all great. Butter cake was very good. The bone-in filet I ordered medium was overcooked so just okay. The raw oysters and cold king crab appetizers were gross. Next time I'm planning an expensive steakhouse dinner I'll try somewhere else.
