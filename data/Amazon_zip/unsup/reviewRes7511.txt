A fabulous Italian eating experience, with great options to have tapas or full-sized portions (I had one of each). A more exciting, but not overwhelming, range of choices than in many Italian restaurants. Unbelievably good pork ribs. Everyone in our group of four loved this, and not too expensive ($150, including a good bottle of wine and one shared dessert). Notably competent and knowledgeable service. Easy online reservations.
