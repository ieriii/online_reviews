This is one of my favorite places in the city ! The owner / chef comes to the table and explains what is in each dish, although unless you are a serious culinary maven you won't really know what the ingredients are, but I can honestly say that every dish I have ever had has never disappointed ! The plate wear is also a great added touch, as the owner explains that they are custom pieces he has imported from japan. Whenever I want a super high end dining experience, without a super high end bill (thanks to being a byob) this is hands down my #1 spot.
