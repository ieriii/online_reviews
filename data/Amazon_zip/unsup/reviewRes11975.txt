Why are you still sitting at home eating a fruit cup? I honestly CANT WAIT TO GO BACK...it was my day off, thank you Veterans!! A perfect, pristine morning of sunshine and cool breezes. A cardio scupting class followed by an intense, Im-going-to-throw up abs class. My heart was pounding with excitement on the North Ave bus heading with my friend to Bongo Room for brunch; a reward for our insane workout. The wait was 20/25 minutes...I was starving. I couldnt even wait for a hot, steaming cup of coffee. A two-seater table opened up and it was ours, all ours. Where do I even begin with the menu, not to mention their specials. I was overwhelmed by the amount delicious words popping out of the menu at me: creme, mousse, glazed, praline, walnut, orea, vanilla, apple spice, cinnamon, its all even too much to think about. Im salivating while I type. If its one thing I ask, please, Bongo Room, PLEASE keep the Pretzel batter pancake with ooey gooey hot caramel and white chocolate sauce on the standard menu....not just as a special for the season!! I cant live without it. Ive never tasted something so good in my life. And yes, we ACTUALLY compared it to sex. As my friend so perfectly put it, our meal was a food orgasm. I would give it more than 5 stars if I could. You cant pass this place up--unique, satisfying, and incredibly delicious. MY FAVORITE BRUNCH IN CHICAGO.
