*HARVEST BRUNCH ONLY* This review is for the harvest brunch, which was one of most impressive brunches I've been to. There is a layout buffet of cheeses, smoked meat (my fave), fruit, salads, duck confit potatoes (I went for seconds with that. Delicious!), and some sweets. Then the servers bring items to the tables such as maple candied bacon (mouthwatering), cinnamon rolls, meat on a stick, etc. Most of the food was good but there were some misses...like the crabcake. Maybe it's because I'm from Maryland and I know how crabcakes should taste, but this one was WAY over seasoned. Then again, I typically hate the seafood in Chicago because it's never as fresh as I'd like it to be. The food and set up makes this place 3 stars for me, but what gets the extra star is the SERVICE. The service was impeccable. I mean, never have I been treated so well in a restaurant before and I kept thinking that maybe the servers thought I was someone else. Someone important or famous, perhaps. But, nope, they give that level of service to all their customers. All the servers had personality. They joked with us, made sure I always had a mimosa in my hand (and for that, I want to give 5 stars!), and made sure we always had food at our table. They asked if we wanted to try anything else again and they brought it out to our table right away. Seriously, guys...bravo. On another note, ZED451 also has a rooftop deck that was beautiful. You are always welcome to take your drinks up there and I do believe you are allowed to order food from the deck as well. A+ for the brunch. I'm definitely going to go again.
