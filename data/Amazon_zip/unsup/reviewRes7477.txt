This is a pretty neat place, definitely don't judge it by the Exterior...It's kinda like you're in someones house!! "Lounge" area in the front with a smallish bar/Dining in back area. Very clean/classy look! Liquor Dept-- I thought the "Beer List" was definitely lacking big time, nothing on draft either? Beers served in shitty pint glass? Bad Move.... Food on the other hand, the food rocks! They start you out with some Homemade "Chips" and "Bread &Butter Pickles" I guarantee you, these are some of the best pickles you will ever taste in your life!! Next up, tried the Cheddar/Bacon Hush Puppies--Very Flavorful with a nice sauce! Entree-- I had the Kobe Beef Brisket with Habenero Cornbread... It was awesome, nice smoke ring/very tender. Really liked the Cornbread with kind of a "Crusty" top. They serve all their food with their 3 different types of BBQ Sauce--Original/Spicy/Vinegar.. I liked the Spicy the best. Menu also had some "Competition" style slabs of ribs that are prepared in limited batches as if in Competition... I wanna go back and try those for sure! Great staff and the girls are dressed up in cute little flannel outfits!! P.S-- Great little "Private Lounge" Area upstairs-GREAT SPACE for a "Meeting"or "Group", not sure what it takes to get up there..GTFJD
