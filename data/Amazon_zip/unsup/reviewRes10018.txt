I have been wanting to check this place out for as long as I can remember. It consistently gets ranked "Best Patio in Chicago" so I had been dying to see what it was all about! Now, normally when I consistently hear good things about place, it gets over-hyped and then I am disappointed. This was NOT the case with Piccolo. Piccolo Sogno met and even exceeded all my expectations. When I stepped onto their patio, I literally shrieked "This is a Magical Wooded Wonderland!" Honest to God, that was my first reaction. Their patio is breathtaking. It is filled with huge oak (I think?!) tree that are lit up and just sparkle. Many of the tables have huge umbrellas that also add to the magical feeling. The food was just as good as the atmosphere. I went with my "Moms Club/Sanity Club/Drunk Club"and we all tried something different, as well as all had a different salad. I had the Panzanella salad and a margarita pizza! Deish!! We also sampled several great white wines! We had a reservation and were seated right away. Additionally, the service was fabulous all night! I have higly recommended Piccolo Sogno to several people since visiting. I literally can't wait to go back. I am hoping to take my husband back there before summer ends!
