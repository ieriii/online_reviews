Okay, who laced the wings with crack? My roommate and I ordered often; I prefer the Seoul Sassy wings. And my gawd, they are cracktastically delicious. Seriously. Hot, crisp wings with a sweet soy base. Yum. 10 pieces for $12 is more than enough to feed our apartment. My roommate tried the Koreanified burritos and adores them; I have yet to try it. Why? Each time I want to, I keep remembering the wings (laced with crack), so I forget about them burritos. One day. I mean, the place is just four blocks from my apartment, which could be a bad thing.
