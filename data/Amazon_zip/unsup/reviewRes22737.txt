I've visited Greek Islands twice in the past couple of weeks, and both times I've found the Mediterranean Seabass to be completely irresistible. The fish is stuffed with oregano and I don't know what else, scored, and broiled at what must be like 2,000 degrees for thirty seconds, and finished with an olive oil and lemon juice sauce. The result is something best described as nirvana. The fish is crispy on the outside and unbelievably tender, moist, and tasty on the inside. I prefer my fish whole, and that's how I've had it both times. Greek Islands does other things well, too. The Greek-style okra is incredible, a tender mixture of okra, tomatoes, onion, and olive oil. I've never really enjoyed Greek-style green beans, but okra prepared this way is amazing, and Greek Islands does it so well. The drinks are excellent (I had a Maker's Mark Old Fashioned the first time... wonderful). The prices are not shabby at all. This is not dining on the cheap, but considering the quality and quantity of goodness you get, it's not exactly expensive. The service? Top-notch. A fair number of the restaurants in Greektown make me embarrassed to claim my Greek heritage. Greek Islands is redemption on a plate.
