My first trip to this place I experienced many of the great popular pork dishes; from the juicy and tender pork blade, crispy pigs ears with kale to the carefully chosen cheese and charcuteries. Their commitment to paying homage to and respecting the swine through their cooking is absolute. I'll be the first to admit, I HATE Thanksgiving for the mere fact that I don't care for turkey. I usually can tolerate a roasted turkey leg, which is the only saving grace of the holiday. Recently finding myself back at the Purple, I ended up ordering the Turkey Leg Confit, Crispy Lentils, Treviso, Endive & Agro Dolce dish. Damn Skippy!!! The supple turkey leg was kick-ass and the rich sauteed greens and onions were scrumptious. The turkey was so confited, that it tore away from the bone with little to no pressure. Wasn't melt in the mouth like a great steak, but the poultry was soft, gentle, deep in flavor and moist.  I wish this place was less classy so I could pick-up the leg and knawl at it caveman style.
