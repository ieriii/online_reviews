I have given many places 5 stars but Alinea is by far one of the best restaurants I've been to. It's always a fun and unique experience every time I dine in this restaurant. The food is outstanding, surprising combinations of ingredients, out of this world! It definitely gives the wallet a workout but it is worth it. I recommend this restaurant! You will love the food and the experience!
