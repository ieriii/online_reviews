I really enjoy going to Bin 36. I moved to Chicago about a year ago from Boston and had never quite been to a "wine bar", so "flights" of wine were new to me. I LOVE IT! I'm a huge fan of the Bubbles flight, Fat City (cheese flight) and the Sexy Reds. I've never had a meal there, but I'm sure it's good. And I usually end up buying a few bottles from their market on my way. All in all, I think it's a great place to relax and experience new (affordable) wines.
