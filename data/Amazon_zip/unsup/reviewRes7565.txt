ready for the best italian in lakeview? (or even maybe the city?) then you have found the right place to try.  i have visited sapori several times and have never been let down. with its friendly staff and candlelit tables, it makes a perfect date spot or just a great place for a girls' night out. (*also awesome for when parents come to visit) the food is always fresh and will satisfy your need for cheesy pasta and rich desserts.  some of my faves on the menu include: *lasagna - they make a single serving (well they make it just for you, but it could easily feed 2) and its caked with cheese and all kinds of delciousness. mmm. drooling just thinking about it... *pumpkin ravioli - WATCH OUT. it may possibly knock you off your chair. the first time i tasted this i just covered my mouth in awe and said SHUT UP! its almost not fair how ridiculously tasty this dish is. it comes with a cubed butternut squash side that tastes like the most delightful potatoes to have ever touched your lips. wow, i need to go back soon for this. *caprese salad - pretty awesome for a starter *tiramisu - while i'm not a huge fan of this dessert generally, this one was fantastic. loves sapori. do try, do try.
