I just discovered this place a few months ago but have been back many times!! The honey jalapeno pork chop and Almond Crusted Halibut are EXCELLENT!! The pistachio crusted chicken was good, not great! Awesome place, they don't take reservations but I have never had a bad wait even on a Sat. night. Oh, and the mojitos are excellent, must try the frozen mojitos!!! reminded me of ones i had on vacation!
