This has to be one of the best restaurants, ever. There is not one detail that is over-looked and the food is fabulous. It's friendly and professional; one of the best and hardest working wait staff I've encountered at any restaurant. The ambiance is sophisticated, but not stuffy. During the daylight hours when the weather permits, I would recommend the outside dining garden area. One of the prettiest places in the city.
