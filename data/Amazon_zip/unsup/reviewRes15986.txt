My first couple of visits to this bar was with a group of 3 or 4 which is really fun because chances are everybody's drinks are going to taste good. As a matter of fact, I would say I've only tried one drink on their ever changing menu that I wasn't a fan of. After getting a drink you like I would recommend getting two or three different things, chances are they will be delicious. The decor was pretty minimal and you know, very cool and hip, but there wasn't much to it. It's best to come on weekdays when they first open to avoid crowds. For the most part they play good tunes and it's a fun place to try new things. I would also recomend sitting at the bar when it's not busy because the bartenders are nice and not that pretentious when it comes to drinks... I guess the one problem with Violet Hour is that if you are expecting a normal bar you will be disappointed. Bartenders are kinda snobby here and seem to make faces about even using Vodka in drinks. Also for some reason on my last visit after having 4 drinks I barely felt drunk. I drink like 12 times a year so I have a pretty low tolerance. If I am spending $44 on drinks I would at least expect to be pretty wasted.
