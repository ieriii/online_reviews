I love this place. The first time my boyfriend and I passed by, it was completely packed. It was both romantic and suitable for kids and families. The seating area was crowded but I don't mind as the restaurant was so lively and the service was good. There was a path to a patio in the back. It was an outdoor dining space resembling a Venetian patio surrounded by four walls, with a stairs to the house and a fountain in the middle. The food was amazing depending on what you order. I ordered Linguini alle Vongole/White Wine Clams Linguine ($16). It was very slippery linguine in light white wine and garlic sauce with a decent amount of clams. The portion was good enough for a dinner and a late night/brunch. My boyfriend ordered half Spring chicken, and it was indeed a disappointment. It was flavorless and kind of dry. I feel sorry for him. Mia Francesca is good at Pasta, not the meat, so try to avoid if you can. People who go there just look so happy in general. The kids are happy and content and the old couples are sweet and enjoy their long-lasting marriages. I personally did have a great time and great food there, so I give it a 4 star.
