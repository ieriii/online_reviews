Meh I have for sure experienced better. Maybe I didn't order the right thing. I liked my appetizer a lot! The roasted bone marrow with onion jam & course salt with greens, that was awesome, but I got the scottish salmon with brown butter and I expected to be blown out of my orthopedic shoes. This was not the case unfortunately, I will have to go back and try some pork belly or something, I was not really in the mood for anything heavy like that also. I found that the salmon was covered in oil; which was kind of disgusting, and they did not offer anything to accompany the oily fish with? Really? Lemon and capers? For $23 I would expect a green been or two for fucks sake. Their drinks were awesome however, I really enjoyed the bee sting. Another disappointing item were the crispy frehanchhajajaoiou fries or whatever the fancy name they were. I did not dig these very much, and the weird mayo dipping sauce was so rich I almost ralphed. My boy Jourdan (add him as a Yelp friend) reccomended a bunch of dishes that were no longer on the menu, so I think I will come back once the menu rotates again.
