Bottom line: Good food and decent portion. Time: 10:30-11:00AM Occasion: Brunch with a girl friend. Party of 2. Service: Depends on the time. Morning - Ehhhh. Lunch - Ok. - Breakfast is crowded, so they definitely need more staff. - Had to refill my own cup of water a couple of times. Food: Unique. - My favorite is their homemade sausage. Never had anything like it. Would go back and order a plate full. - Lots of options and so far, everything I have tried so far have been yummy! Just one of those spots you can't miss out on when you are in Bridgeport.
