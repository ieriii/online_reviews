I'm a fan. I was looking for a business hotel for one night in central Chicago. First the location is great. 2 blocks from the Blue Line metro stop which runs straight for the airport. It's close to Millenium Park where I'm going jogging in the morning, and close to the offices of the businesses I'm visiting. The hotel has been recently remodeled and upgraded. The lobby is plush and comfy; the $109 room I got from http://Kayak.com was clean, modern, although not super big. Surprisingly this was the 2nd least expensive option available. The cheapest option had abysmal Yelp reviews, everything else for $30 or $40 more didn't have stellar reviews either. Allegro is a good middle of the road choice for the casual business traveler. What I also liked, and which prompted me to give the 5-start rating, is that they didn't nickle and dime me for things that should be a commodity. I can't stand it when hotels charge me $10+ for 24 hours of wireless access. The Allegro has free wireless if you sign up for their (free) customer loyalty program. That's a fair trade. Same with things like toothbrushes. I'm always annoyed when I stay at a $150+ a night place and they charge me $5 for toothpaste. That's just ridiculous. The Allegro actually has a list posted in the bathroom of the toiletry items that are free (all the most common ones are) and the ones they charge for like nail clippers. And the fee is moderate too. Tumbs up also for the fluffy duvets and super comfortable bed. It seems run by conscious people that care about the customer experience. Recommended.
