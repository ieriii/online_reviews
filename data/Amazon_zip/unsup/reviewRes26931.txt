I normally try to avoid deep dish pizza like the plague. But after seeing a piece about Pequod's on some late-night WGN show, we had to check it out. Their 11am-3pm lunch special is a great deal: $4.95 gets you a soda and a 7" personal pizza with 1 topping. I, of course, chose jalapeos and was not disappointed. Not too greasy like some I've had and the crust was just the right amount of crunchy. The sauce-to-cheese ratio was perfect as well. I probably won't go back too often (after not being able to stop eating the entire 7", I pretty much hated myself), but I'll definitely say it's one of the best deep dish pizza joints in the city.
