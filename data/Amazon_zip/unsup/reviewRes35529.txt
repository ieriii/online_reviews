It wasn't the best or the worst seafood I've ever had. I wasn't impressed with the sides either. My issue with the crab was that they were a bit rubbery. The crabcake was good. The shrimp was great. My friends weren't impressed with their lobster tails. Service saved the night. For as much as they charged, I expected better quality.
