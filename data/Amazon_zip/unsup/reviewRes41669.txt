Is there any way you can give a place 6 stars??? We LOVED the dinner we had here last night. Like others have commented, the highlight for us was a baked scallop and crab dish, which was other-worldly. Most impressive was the service - the people were so friendly and nice, without being intrusive. They did a great job of keeping our wine chilled in the back, and making sure our glasses were never empty! Will be back as soon as their menu changes!
