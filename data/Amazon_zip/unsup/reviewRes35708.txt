I had a hankering for some Chinese Food on New Years day and my girlfirend and I were up for something new. We Yelped some local spots in her neighborhood in Chicago and Sun Wah came out on top. We read a couple of the reviews and had to check it out. So heres my take on the situation. Pros:  Quick Seating - Waited 2 - 3 minutes and were taken to our table. Food Came out Fast / Large Amounts Many Menu Options - Combo Rice was awesome Seating Arrangements were great and can accomodate large parties Cons: Food was slightly bland. I am not a huge fan of salt but a couple of pinches here and there added some needed flavor. Wait staff was not very friendly. They know what they are doing process wise but miss the customer service aspect.  Overall good if you want Chinese food in the city and they were doing a brisk take out service if your an eat on the run type of person. Recommendations: Combo Fried Rice Shanghai Bok Choi Chicken w/Brocoli
