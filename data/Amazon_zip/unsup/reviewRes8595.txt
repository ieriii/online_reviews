This hot new pizza place is at the corner of Sunnyside and Ravenswood. The Napoli-style pizza is the opposite of Chicago deep-dish pizza. The individual serving pizzas are very thin, with crisp and puffy crusts and a smattering of fresh and light ingredients. The pizza here is very authentic when compared to what I ate practically every day during my visits in Napoli, Italy. You may have to wait for a table inside or out, but the pizzas themselves take only a few minutes to create. I forgive Liliana for not waiting for me, but she is right this is a great joint.
