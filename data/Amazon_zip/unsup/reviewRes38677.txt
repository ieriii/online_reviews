Beers = GREAT selection/quality Food = Mediocre, our table tried the mussels (no big deal to make well), duck rueben, Montreal-style smoked brisket, onion rings w/aioli, side of German potato salad, the sausage plate starter. The highlight by far was the sausage plate starter, worthwhile. Every other food item we had was mediocre at best and the German potato salad was pathetic. I'll wait to try it again after the cold winter has settled onto Chicago and I'll make sure to go on midweek day rather than weekend.
