Ok, may be I am a little biased because I never had Costa Rican food before this place but Yes, yes and YES!!! Orgasmic food. . . you can smell the place from blocks away. I learned of this place from my now husband as he is familiar with the owners and the owners know him which is great because it takes the confusion away from ordering for him. Being as I am a vegetarian and my husband is a beloved meat eater this place is sure to please us both in food, price and all. I love their fries, empanadas and their claim to fame. . . OATMEAL SHAKE! They let me try one for free and I was in heaven after that. It is one of my many comfort drinks. I have taken my mother here and she loves the place. (note- my mother lives in Arizona) So, no complaints here except they take cash only so you better have a debit card handy because they have an ATM in the facilities. The food, the atmosphere, the friendly staff, the only thing I am missing is that cute shirt. Irazu is definitely a place worth trying out!
