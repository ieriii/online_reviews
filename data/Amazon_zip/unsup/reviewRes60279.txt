this is a really chill down-tempo coffee place. Its got a sweet mini fire place and amazing decor. The coffee/menu list won't blow your mind away but its damn quality. I had a Cider drink with a cinnamon stick along with a chocolate bread - Tis was awesome.. I will definitely be going back there as soon as i can get my lazy ass out of Logan square...P.S. its also got great soup and you must try the cider... its wicked...
