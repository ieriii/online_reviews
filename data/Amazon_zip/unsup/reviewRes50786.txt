Blinded by a noontime mid-December snowstorm, my companion and I trudged on through the whitewashed west Lakeview neighborhood on our quest of doing some weekend Christmas shopping. Nearing the corner of Ashland and Belmont, a decision was made to procure food. We needed energy if we were to carry on through the tundra. Though neither of us had ever been, we both remembered we were near Wishbone, so we headed for the brightly colored home to quality breakfasts with a southern twist. We arrived at about 1:00 on Saturday afternoon and waited for 5 minutes before being shown to our table. The service was prompt and polite and the food was above average. I had the shrimp and grits which could have had more of both shrimp and grits, but the flavor was excellent. She ahd the blueberry pancakes which were promptly proclaimed "possibly the best bluberry pancakes ever". These pancakes had so many fat blueberries in them that every time the fork hit the pancake, blue juice shot across the table. It was a much needed, and warmly enjoyed break for food. As we headed back out into the worsening winter storm, I was glad to have a belly full of coffee, grits, and bloody mary.
