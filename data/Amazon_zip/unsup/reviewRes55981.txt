Great spot. The roast duck was excellent as were the scallops. Twice in about 5 minutes, the food delivery guy came by my table with a meal I didn't order. It was a fast floor so I assumed he just messed up the table number or something. However, for that my glass of wine was on the house. Unrequested (and unnecessary really) but a nice touch on their part. And the cappuccino I had to close the meal was really terrific. One thing though; don't be put off by the lack of a dress code. This is the sort of place where tuxedos dine along side sleeveless t-shirts.
