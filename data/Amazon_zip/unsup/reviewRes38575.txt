Yum!!! One of the only places to have mead on draft and a very extensive list of GOOD beers. I had the cashew butter and fig jam sandwich (with a mild cheese, pan sauteed to crisp the sourdough bread) and after the mead, had a very good IPA out of Michigan. The server was very pleasant and will be heading back Thursday with my Dad. I don't know why the most recent reviews are bad. I was VERY pleased. Give it a shot. Andersonville in Chicago, IL.
