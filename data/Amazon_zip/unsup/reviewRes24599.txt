Much to be desired. There's a difference between an intimate setting and being too dark, and Geja's falls into the latter category. This normally would not be an issue, but if you opt to go with chicken or fish as your main course, then seeing if it's completely cooked is crucial. The ventilation is poor, so prepare for it to be warm and a strong smell from the friers. Caution, the booths are hard and cramped. As several others have mentioned, the price is out-of-hand for what you get. A couple can easily spend one-hundred on their meal and leave unsatisfied. The chicken is raw cutlets; not seasoned, not marinated, nothing, so it tastes bland even when dipped in sauce. The service was excellent, but unfortunately did not save this restaurant.
