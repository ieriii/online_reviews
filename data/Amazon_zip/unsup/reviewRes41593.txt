I haven't tried many pho places in argyle, but I like going to Tank just because it's conveniently located right off the red line stop. Only order pho though, their other food just isn't as good. I usually order some shrimp spring rolls as well, the sauce that comes with it is what makes it yummy. As for the pho, I always get #44 with the TENDON mmmmmm. Some of my non-asian friends think that tendon sounds disgusting and won't even try it, but they're missing out! Tank's pho is not the best I've had, but it's decent (probably because it's loaded up with MSGs haha). The service at Tank is really a hit and miss. I went this past Sunday and my waiter was really friendly and cracked jokes with us the whole time. But I've also been to Tank when they've been so busy that they didn't take my order until I had been there for at least 20 minutes. If you're going for your first time, be sure to pay attention to what you order, especially if you go in a large group. The bill that you receive does not list each order by its name, instead it looks something like this: FOOD   $8 FOOD   $8 FOOD   $10 FOOD   $4 DRINK  $3 DRINK  $3 TOTAL   The first time I saw this I thought it was funny, but it can actually be quite frustrating if you go with a large group and everyone wants to pay separately. There's also a bakery a couple doors down from Tank that has amazing coconut tarts for less than $1 each! I always make a stop there after pho.
