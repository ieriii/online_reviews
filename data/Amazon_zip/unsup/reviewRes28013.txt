Oh My God!!!! This place is sooooo good! I am not a fan of pan pizza but I gave this place a shot because I was talked into it. The sauce was yummy!!! We ordered olives, italian sausage, and mushrooms. Other than too many olives the pizza was delicious!! I will only eat deep dish here. I think I liked it so much is because the crust was still crispy and it wasn't just cheesy. ALL THE FLAVORS MESHED WELL TOGETHER They wear tshirts with a thong on a whale. If you haven't noticed ask your server.
