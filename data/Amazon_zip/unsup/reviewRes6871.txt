Sad to say I have lived around the corner from this place for almost 2 years and never stopped by. I have walked by quite often and thought about it, but just never stopped :( A friend of mine raved and raved about the food here and decided it was a good idea to go on a double date here...Hell yeah!!!! We made a 7:15 reservation just to be on the safe side, but it wouldn't be that crowded on a Tues nite...Wrong! It was mad crowded...glad we reserved a spot. The place was small and has a nice intimate setting as I would expect any Italian place to be. My friend was looking forward to their tapas tuesday menu as she wanted to share multiple plates, but they told us since they were so crowded there was no way they could handle Tapas Tuesday. My friend asked to see the manager and he was nice enough to cut us some slack. Tapas tuesday was on!!! Milk and Honey Baby Back Ribs - Very tender and flavorful...definitely the highlight Gnocchi Bolognese - amazing (I hardly ever use that overused term) Rigatoni Caprese - Awesome! Zucca - Great butternut squash and pumpkin dumplings Crostone Di Avocado - pretty damn good Chicken Torteloni - Very good and creamy Veal Meat Balls - was good Dessert: Tiramisu - Melted in my mouth..some of the best I've had outside of Italy This place has made me a fan and the people who run this joint are completely awesome! I hear the bread pudding is out of this world so I will def return for that alone...looking forward to going again soon :)
