I'm a big fan of Indian food and I have to say that this is one of the best places downtown. Slightly more expensive than other places but more than makes up for it with a great upscale venue and a delicious and varied buffet selection. The entrees are good but it is the lunch time buffet that really stands out. The buffet is approximately 11:30AM - 2:00PM and if you can take a long lunch, it's a great place to take your coworkers. Unlike some other Indian restaurants' buffets, which may hit or miss on any given day, this restaurant has all the great dishes all the time. Chicken masala, lamb, lentils, spinach, delicious buttered naan, tandoori chicken, and many other meat and vegetarian selections await. You will definitely find something you like. And you must try the mango sorbet once your done--it's absolutely fantastic and included in the buffet. The buffet costs about $12.
