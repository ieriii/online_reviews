I was heartbroken when Pita Hut in Niles closed, that was a cheap little family-owned place that always had consistent eats. But, when I finally tried Sultan's Market a few months ago, I was like "pita what?" This place has THE BEST falafel I have ever had in my life! It is cooked to a perfect crisp, and still deliciously moist inside. On days when I can convince myself to get something else, like the Lamb Kefta, or Chicken Shawerma, I don't even miss the falafel, because these little bundles of pita heaven are absolutely phenomenal. The meat is always tender, and wonderfully seasoned. They never skimp on the hummos or hot sauce in the sandwiches, and they don't jam pack it with nasty iceberg lettuce like some other places (Pita Inn, eat your heart out!) Not to mention the awesome selection of teas and juices, plus the delicious rice and lentils, this is by far one of my fave places for a cheap meal.
