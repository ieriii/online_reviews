I had their "Ruben Sandwich" with sweet potato fries. Oh they were so yummy delicious!!! Unbelievable sandwich, tasted like the original. And I love the original. For the fries, the best sweet potato fries I ever had. We did have an appetizer but I only remember that it was also good. I really came here for their ruben sandwich experience. We want to come back to try other stuff.
