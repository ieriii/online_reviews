This place officially opened on Monday, but when we went last night (on Thursday), it was insanely busy. We came around 8:45 pm and were told there was a 1 1/2 hour wait, so we basically made a reservation for 10 pm. When we came back, we were told there was no table available, which I thought was strange since we were on the reservation list. There are several seating options though--you can sit at the bar, the sushi bar, the main dining area or in the lounge. The lounge is first-come first-come seating and full service, and there were a couple of open tables so we decided to sit there instead. Seating in the lounge is a bit uncomfortable though. Service was great and knowledgeable. We had the Food Buddha's Crispy Rice, which is basically Japanese fried rice topped with avocado and shrimp tempura. It was sooo good but really expensive--$10 for 4 small bites. I'm used to paying premium prices for sushi, but I think Sunda's prices are a bit ridiculous since the portions are so small. But, it was so good we ordered another one. We also had The Number 10 roll ($15), which everyone raves about, but I don't see what the big deal is. It was just okay--it's kinda like the White Dragon roll at Coast Sushi, but Coast is way better (and tastier). We finished with the "Ridiculous" dessert, but the only thing ridiculous about it is the price - $9. The concept is kinda cool (tempura carrot cake surrounding vanilla ice cream) but it was way too heavy on the ginger. We really didn't have that much food but ended up spending $50.  Overall, the atmosphere has a warm, lounge-y vibe and the service is good, but if you want to shell out the dough, there are much better sushi places in the city. Go once just to try the Crispy Rice dish though--very pricey but really tasty.
