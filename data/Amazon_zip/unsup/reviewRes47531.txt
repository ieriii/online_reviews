Super classy ! I love the weekend brunch deal. At first I was about to get a heart attack from the price of $29 a person, but believe me you need to eat smart to make it worth the price. The place is simply gorgeous ! It would elevate anyone's mood ! So our waitress allowed us to start off around the buffet. Go light, and I mean a small teaspoon of each little thing. No need to stuff your plate since that food is going no where and you could always go back for more if you have room in your tummy. Around 5 mins into the salads and light appetizers, they come in and serve 4 random dishes. My friend loved the bacon, and when I meant love, I meant that she refused to share any of it. I like their idea with the usage of stones where the chefs would delightfully bring some of the selections. During this time they served us chicken waffles (first timer for me) Salmon, Beef, and more ! What I love is that we could always order more of what we really liked. The food was so delicious that we had a second helping of bacon. Too bad we were so full that we couldn't finish, and they don't do to go boxes. Unclassy side note: My friend really wanted to take the bacon, so I took some paper napkins and wrapped it. Like always, NEVER WASTE GOOD FOOD ! Our waitress gave us our bill with $0. It was funny, sucks it was a mistake.... Also, lovely shuttle service .
