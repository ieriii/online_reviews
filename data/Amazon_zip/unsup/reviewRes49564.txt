I'm on the fence with this one... Normally, I like or dislike a place. Plain and simply. I really wanted to like it because I really like Bin Cafe. I mean nothing went wrong. We had a really great server who was pretty cool. Good wine, obviously. The food was alright. I'm still not sure what I thought of the space though. I think I may have to eat here another time to figure it out.
