CHEESE GRITS.  Nothing does a hangover good like cheese grits!  Hit up this joint last weekend, post wedding/red wine debacle. Was pleased to see that the line moved very quickly, and before you knew it we were sitting down to a life sustaining fatty brunch. I really appreciated the mix of healthy and fatty and meaty and veggie. This place has vegan southern comfort food! Beat that. Next time I am in Chicago, and looking for a major calorie load, I am coming back!
