Fantastic Carry OUT!  One of my friends stopped by with lunch today... I felt so lucky!! She brought one of my favorite sandwiches in the world-- the Turkey Brie sandwich from 3rd coast!! Yummy, buttery, toasted bread with melted brie cheese and turkey... I am very full, but just thinking about it makes me want another!! I always get the fruit salad with it, instead of fries... they do not just stick you with cantaloupe and honeydew, they also have bananas, pineapple, strawberries.. Great desserts too! the brownies? Chocolate, rich, and savory.. Happy day!
