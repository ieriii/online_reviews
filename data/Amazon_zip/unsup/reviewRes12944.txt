Went here intending to order the full dinner and were so blown away by the salad bar that we skipped the meat service. Not only was this a healthier option but also satisfying and guilt free. The offerings were fresh and attractive and replenished immediately. Highlights included lobster bisque, fresh mozzarella, sweet peppers, asparagus, tabouleh,quinoa salad, cheeses, cod fish, tuna, beef and rice, potato salad, au gratin potatoes. The Brazilian salad dressing was fabulous and more like a fresh salsa. Table service included great little cheese puffs, mashed potatoes, and plantains. Service is professional and they do not push the higher priced meats. Never thought I would go to a high end Brazilian steak house and skip the steak, but this dining experience was wonderful. We especially liked loading up on veggies on a hot summer night.
