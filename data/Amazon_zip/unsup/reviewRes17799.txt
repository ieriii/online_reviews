Way way way overpriced for the quality of food. Though I may have been charged for the grease because it came in abundance...in every dish. The samosas we ate at the bar over a nice glass of wine and enjoyed while we waited for our to-go food. Whence we got back to the hotel, it was a sad, sad disappointment as the food was drenched in grease. Fast food take-out at 4 star pricing.
