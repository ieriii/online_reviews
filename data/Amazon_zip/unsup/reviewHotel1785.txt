Got a great rate here through a discount site and stayed two nights. Took the train from O'Hare and the hotel was a couple blocks from the stop. Great central location! The staff was friendly and check-in was easy. Our room was clean and big, with modern furniture. The whole hotel has a fun, hip look to it! My boyfriend enjoyed tromping around in the funny leopard/zebra bath robes! Yeah, the bathroom was weird, with the sink in an awkward spot by the toilet and no room for stuff on the sink, but otherwise, no complaints! They serve coffee in the morning, drinks during the day, and happy hour cocktails. Wireless internet is free, which seems to be uncommon these days! Pretty cool! I'd go back, for sure!
