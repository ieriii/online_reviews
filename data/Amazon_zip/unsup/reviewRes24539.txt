I came with a group of friends about a year ago. The girls ordered the dessert chocolate fondue only, while the guys got the three course premier fondue dinners and they shared their food with us girls because my guy friends are the best ;) The environment is super romantic so we were a bit out of place. Everything was really fresh. Both the cheese and chocolate courses had a good amount of alcohol. It added a lot to the depth of the chocolate course, but only made the cheese course strange. The amount of food we got was definitely sufficient for our group (the three course dinners are huge). This place can indeed get pricey if everyone orders the full menu. Overall, 3.5 stars rounded up to 4.
