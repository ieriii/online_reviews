Friend of mine rave about Bad Apple so I was more than excited to check it out. And overall, it was a good experience. The good: The burgers are great. Good variety with some really creative combinations. I had the "hangover" burger with ham, fries, fried egg and toppings and it was intense, but really good. Highly recommend getting a burger with the pretzel bun. Tasty. The fries were amazing too. I paid $.75 more for the truffle fries and they were perfectly cooked and tasty. The not so good: Service was spotty at best and our waiter wasn't exactly winning Mr. Congeniality anytime soon. We didn't even have silverware until our appetizer arrived. I've heard service wasn't great and sadly, that was true. But the food was good so that somewhat made up for it. Also, our food was barely room temperature. We ordered Poutaine, which was very tasty but not served hot, like my friend has had before. And her burger was barely room temp too. The atmosphere is great and the hostess was really nice when we arrived, although beware, you will NOT be seated until your entire party arrives. I will definitely go back to Bad Apple because the burgers are tasty and affordable, but I will be more mindful that the wait staff isn't fabulous.
