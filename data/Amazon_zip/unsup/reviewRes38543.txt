This was our first deep dish experience. I have to disagree with most of the reviewers.... I didn't like it as much as I thought I would. There's too much cheese! It'd be OK if it was decent cheese but it's too thick and the quality isn't there. However, the price is right. One medium pizza was about $25 and fed 4 of us. I wouldn't go back to Giordano's..... there's gotta be a place with tastier, higher quality deep dish pizza!
