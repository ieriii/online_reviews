Always a good place to take a large group. Even though it gets really busy, the wait staff stays friendly and sufficiently attentive. Good pizza and surprisingly good American craft beers -- speaking of which -- if my empty growler housed a Piece Genie with the power to grant me three Piece wishes... the first would be, that Piece would include their beers in their delivery service!!! Is that too much to ask?!?
