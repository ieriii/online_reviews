Haven't been here since '98 nice to see nothings changed. after David Burke and topolobampo day prior should be in food coma. Not so much. guac, Ceviche trio, taquitos, lamb w/ red beans and super smokey tequilas ( not a mezcal expert, who knew ?)  Service is sick in the minutiae of regional Mexican food and booze. GO!!!
