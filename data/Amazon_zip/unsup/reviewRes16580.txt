the first time i came to violet hour, i was smitten. the lights! the chairs! the drinks! the mystery of the experience was intoxicating. after my first drink there, i had to have more. i started bringing all of my out of town friends. i'd build it up and talk about the unusual, yet extremely potent drinks with ingredients like lavender berry bitters or rose water gobblygook. i would describe the non-descript door and how the paintings on the outside wall change ever 3 or so weeks -- from a million tiny white birds on a blue background to now, just a plain depiction of the alphabet in a long line. if the violet hour has done anything right, it's to develop a flawless atmosphere of enticing mystique. with that being said, don't come here too often. this place is supposed to be one of mystery! don't ruin it with overfamiliarity, as your curiosity will only add to the experience. if you've been here recently, wait a while before returning. go again when you've forgotten the complexity of the drink menu, when the deep voice of the doorguy will be a little surprising. that way, when you step through the curtain and see the chandeliers, you'll once again be surprised that this place has been hiding, and you'll wonder all over again what you've been missing.
