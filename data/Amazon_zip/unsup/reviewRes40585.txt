I've been coming here for a few years now. Each time it's definitely been a positive experience. Though the restaurant is fairly large, you may find yourself sitting with another party, if your party is small and/or it's busy. But I would say this is a plus, as food and drinks (BYOB, by the way) usually promote conversations! Tank is regularly packed during the meal times, but I find that the quality of the food is not diminished, even when this is the case. Once a table becomes available, you are usually seated promptly. The waiters, in their camo outfits, provide you with a pretty expansive menu. There are various Vietnamese dishes, ranging from chicken/pork/beef dishes to your ever popular Banh Mi sandwiches and pho. Dinner started with a couple shrimp rolls. Each roll had a few shrimps, lettuce, and the radish/noodle. You're also provided with the hoisin sauce and peanut crumbs (favorite part!). At Viet restaurants, I usually get the same item - X-large Special Combination Beef Noodle Soup! I don't know if I'd say that Tank's broth tasted better than other restaurants. However, Tank doesn't skimp on the meats, tendons, meatballs, etc., and the basil/lime/bean sprouts. As for their Banh Mi, I ordered the marinated pork sandwich. The meat was very flavorful and tender. The crunch of the radish, carrots, and cucumbers definitely complimented the meat. And the jalopenos gave the sandwich a kick! The bread was perfect too, slightly crispy and not soggy. Having just come from a long run, I felt pretty stuffed at the end of dinner. On a normal day, I'd probably just go with the spring rolls and pho. You're looking at about $15/person minus t+t for dinner. This is more than reasonable, considering the amount of food that you're given.
