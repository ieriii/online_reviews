Simply amazing sushi. Visiting Chicago for business, my colleagues and I had a casual group lunch at Sunda on a Friday afternoon. We asked the server to bring a smattering of their best dishes, and we ended up with a table full of amazingly fresh and creative sushi rolls: some variation of a dragon roll with shrimp tempura, a few with kobe beef, some jalepeno spicy tuna, and a bunch of other goodies. We also got a few orders of their rock shrimp tempura. Everything was delicious, and paired perfectly with Veuve Clicquot Rose (then again, doesn't everything? ;-) The space is gorgeous (albeit a bit loud), and the staff is super attentive. They also have a gorgeous bar area where many people were eating. Overall a wonderful dining experience for this tough New York critic!
