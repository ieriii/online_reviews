While I was on my all girls vacay in Chicago, a friend of ours who is from Chicago recommended this place to us. I am glad that we came here for lunch because it was the best fried chicken ever!!! Oh, and their kimchi was soo yummy!! If you ever go to Chicago, check this place out for some really good fried chicken!
