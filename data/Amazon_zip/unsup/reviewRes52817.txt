Definitely one of Logan Square's best kept secrets. My only complaint is that they close on the early side...which the problem can be solved easily...we'll just have to get our acts together faster! The Cuban sandwich is definitely the best thing I have had so far. This restaurant is literally a two minute walk from my sisters apartment so it's so easy to get to. We go several times during my visits to Chicago. The food is so delicious and authentic. They have such a fantastic sandwich selection. In addition to the Cuban sandwich I get the Media Noche sandwich which has the same things as a Cuban sandwich but it has different bread. Also the Caribbean Lechon sandwich..same as the Cuban sandwich but on delicious coconut bread. If pork isn't your thing(if you don't like pork I don't know what you are doing at a Cuban restaurant)..but if you don't like pork definitely go for the Ropa vieja sandwich or the Frita Cubano sandwich. If sandwiches aren't your thing then I would definitely go with the camarones al ajillo...it's a delicious shrimp dish, coated with delicious seasoning and it's served with really tasty black beans and rice. 90 Miles is definitely a great hidden gem of Chicago, especially Logan square!
