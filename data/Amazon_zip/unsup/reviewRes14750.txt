I love the variety. Everything is made very well and I think I've hit one of each parts of the menu so far. The chicken wings are amazing. The burger is too big...maybe not for some. The pizzas are perfect and I love the Italian Seitan. The beer is FANTASTIC. Any way you go you need to take a couple notches off the belt.
