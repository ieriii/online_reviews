I have been to this restaurant a few times now, and I've always left completely stuffed, with leftovers, and a little buzzed. It's always a great night! The service is outstanding. My water is never less than 3/4 full. Every server is extremely familiar with the menu and can offer suggestions or answer any questions you could have. For drinks, we go back and forth between the refajo and the sangria. Both are tasty. As appetizers, I've tried the empanadas, the aborrajado, and the arepa rellena. All were delicious. For the main meal, for which I am usually already quite full but decide to forge ahead and keep eating anyways, my husband and I always split the picada colombiana. It allows you to taste many different meats at once. The skirt steak, chicken, and fried sweet plantain are my favorite and are all absolutely wonderful. The menu says this dish serves 2. If you get an appetizer, as we always do, this will not only be your dinner, but you will have enough leftover for 2 people to eat again. We used the groupon and had absolutely no problems with it. We'll happily be back without a groupon next time.
