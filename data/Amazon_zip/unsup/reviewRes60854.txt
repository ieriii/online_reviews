This place was by far one of the best places that I have eaten at in Chicago. Not only was the food and drinks exceptional, but the staff members make this place the most memorable. My party and I felt like royalty the whole night and the service was on top of their game! The whole experience was well worth the price of the food. I definitely recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a great food, drinks and dining experience.
