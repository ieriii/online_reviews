The Talbott is an amazing gem in the sea of hotels in downtown Chicago. I have never seen a hotel property and clean and pristine. For a hotel built in the early 20th century you wouldn't be able to tell by all of it's upgraded features. Not to be forgotten is that the hotel is locally owned and operated by a great and knowledgeable staff. A must stay for business or pleasure just a few blocks away from Michigan Avenue and great sights and restaurants.
