After waiting for about 20 minutes (we were lucky, lots of snowfall outside), we ordered as much as we possibly could for two people - two tortas (milanesa and choroqueso), chips and guacamole, salsa, hot chocolate with almond milk and tres leches, and of course, a churro. The chips/salsa/guac were all very tasty, i didn't think anything was too different from other good mexican restaurants. The tortas were both excellent. Great flavors, lots of well-placed ingredients, and in both cases, the breads were fantastic. We weren't huge fans of the hot chocolate, but the churro was excellent.
