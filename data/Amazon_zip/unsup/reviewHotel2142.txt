I used to have a pocket full of nickels and dimes before I stayed here and now they are all gone. They charge almost $50 for parking, $10 for Internet, $12 for the fitness center, and $7 for water. Seriously $7 for water! Obviously in order to stay here they expect you to show up with at least 25lbs of nickels and dimes. My favorite part of our stay here was the warning I encountered when I tried to put my own bottled water into the mini fridge, "For the safety of you and your fellow guests, please do not put any additional items into the refrigerator." We stayed up all night waiting for that thing to blow!
