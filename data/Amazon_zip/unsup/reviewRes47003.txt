When I first heard Uncommon Ground was coming to my neighborhood, I wasn't thrilled. I had several negative experiences at the Wrigleyville location and expected the Devon restaurant to be the same. I was very, very wrong and this is now my favorite place to eat - for any meal! The decor is so comfortable and cozy. I love all the wood and leather, as well as the fireplace. And the regularly changing "art gallery" on the walls always gives you something interesting to look at. Their weekend brunch specials are my favorite, although their Bloody Mary could stand a little less spice. I've also eaten here on many price fixed nights, such as Valentine's Day. The music and ambiance have always been perfect, and the menus delicious with great wine pairings. And the fact that it is organic and eco-friendly just adds to the experience. The food is all so fresh and tasty and it's nice to know when it comes from the garden on the roof above your head. I could go on and on about all the little green touches.... Uncommon Ground Devon is just an all-around great place to eat and relax. I recommend it highly.
