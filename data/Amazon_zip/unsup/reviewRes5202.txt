Just went to the Purple Pig last night for Rioja Restaurant Week. The place was definitely a haven for foodies and "porkavores" alike. The best dish by far was the milk braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes! The shoulder meat was tender and well-seasoned. Coupled with creamy mashed potatoes. It's making my mouth water again! Food (4.7/5) - Hits: Milk braised pork shoulder, Octopus with acini, Pig's Ear with Krispy Kale - Surprises (good) - Salt-Roasted Beets with Whipped Goat Cheese - Misses - Roasted Bone Marrow, Mussels with Treviso The seating arrangement was quite interesting as there were several big tables in the middle of the restaurant that allows for different parties to sit together at the same table. However, if you go there with 5 or more in your party, it will take a while for you to be seated. Since I went there with one other friend only, we were able to be seated in 20 minutes despite the long wait for groups of 3 or more.
