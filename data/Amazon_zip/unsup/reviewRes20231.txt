Got to finally try Coast (only been to South Coast as that location is much closer to me) and it was a great experience. Can't recall too many of what we had because everything was good but not memorable except for the angry salmon. First of all, how could you not love something called angry salmon?? I get a mental image of a salmon looking fiercely at me and going "Grr!!" Plus, it was absolutely scrumptious. You know it's good if you're debating on ordering another one even though you already ordered way too much food. Service was also excellent so I was a happy camper.
