The food is fantastic and the portions are generous. Service can be hit or miss, but if you're having a "miss" day usually the other servers keep an eye on you. I've eaten here with people who are not vegetarians before and they started out skeptical but left as fans of the food. It's that good. It can be kind of pricey but I feel it's worth it to go to a restaurant where I can eat everything on the menu. It's the cost of a huge selection. The only time I had any issues was on a Monday night. Apparently the weekend had been super busy so they were out of... a lot of things. That was kind of a bummer and the waitress wasn't very upfront about what they were out of until, you know, we tried to order it. Aside from that she did a good job and was friendly. But other than that I have never had issues. Bonus: They are one of the restaurants in the American Airlines dining program. So participants get miles for dining here.
