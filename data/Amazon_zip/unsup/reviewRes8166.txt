My first experience with Fogo de Chao was several years ago, but I go back whenever I'm in Chicago. If you love meat, this is the place for you. I enjoy almost every cut of meat and a few times I've ventured around the salad bar (it's beautiful, but as we know it's about the mean).  I've also sampled the various starches on the table (bananas, polenta) and I love them, but again it's really about the delicious cuts of meat coming around every time your card is on green. If you go, go hungry and clear the rest of your schedule. Even if you don't stay too long, you'll be in a lovely meat-induced sleepy state for the rest of the evening. I was thrilled when a similar place opened in Scottsdale, AZ (closer to where I live) and I try to budget in a few visits a year.
