THIS PLACE IS A JOKE!!!! I am not sure how to start this review without making it sound crazy, let me tell you a few things: We paid $49 per person for the grand slam of fondue, starting with a house salad: 1)The salad that served as a first course was the kind you get in places were your main course comes with soup or salad, the dressing drizzled on top, not even tossed...quite unusual in my book 2) moving on to the cheese fondue, can't say anything too bad about the cheese although don't expect anything special, just know you will be getting pieces of bread (really?) to dip with a few pieces of apples and grapes (how much did we just pay for this meal?) 3) Main course is not any better, sauces tastes very generic and unmemorable and maybe not even made in house 4) the chocolate fondue is served with the cheapest kind of sponge cake, the chocolate tastes like hersheys syrup (I am not even kidding) and I could easily do better at home In conclusion, when you know how much labor is involved to prepare the meal and when you see the quality of the food being served, I honestly think it is a rip off unless your are a regular at Olive Garden or Red Lobster or just a self-admitted chump
