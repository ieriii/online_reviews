For the adventurous foodie, this is as good as it gets. If your taste buds are a little more on the conservative side you may not enjoy the food as much. Personally while the experience was top-notch, some of the food was a little adventurous for my taste. We had the 12 course menu and by the fourth course we were already counting them down. The first course almost made us gag - a bowlful of fish eggs and fishy foam wasn't the best way to start. Thankfully the food did get better - highlights were the lobster course and the bubble gum course. I made a note for the future when they ask about any allergies or food dislikes speak up about my food dislikes. I thought that I would throw caution to the wind and let the chefs guide the night, but in hindsight I should have spoken up. Service was top-notch, save for the head waiter lecturing another waiter for yawning without covering his mouth. We requested a tour of the kitchen before we left and were escorted in to see the chefs in action. The personalized menus were a nice touch. Five stars for the experience and the quality of food, but at $175/pp for the 12 course menu I'd rather go to Gary Danko in San Francisco or pay the extra and head for French Laundry.
