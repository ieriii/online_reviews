So this was my first visit to Hot Doug's. I came on cold Fri morning around 10:45am and was in line what seemed like forever! Actually I got to order my Hot Dog (The Mountain Man Sausage (A Damn Tasty Combination of Elk, Antelope, Buffalo and Venison) with Pomegranate-Fig Mayonnaise and Hickory-Smoked Rambol Cheese)) and the Duck Fat Fries (only served on Fri & Sat.) by 1145am. Overall, I thought the Mountain Man Hot Dog was very good and it was not too gamey in flavor, which I personally don't like. The addition on the Pomegranate-Fig Mayonnaise and Hickory-Smoked Rambol Cheese gave the hot dog a sweet and mild spicy flavor.  The Duck Fat Fries were very well fried and crispy and were solid fries overall. But nothing really special about them. Eat them with a cheese dip (upon request, its free), which really complimented with the duck fat used to fry the fries, lol. I would have given 5/5 stars, if they served beer or wine, but they don't. I did beer and wine while I was in line. So maybe this place is a BYOB? Did I mention Doug the owner took my order, really friendly guy and they play a very eclectic selection of music ranging from 80s rock to old Brazilian Bossa Nova:D
