Great little restaurant, fantastic location, romantic ambiance, delicious food and great service - need I say more? I ordered the Bo Sate - filet mignon medallions sauted in a delicious sauce with yams and string beans. The flavor was amazing! The service was superb, the wait staff was always one step ahead of us...the way restaurant service should be! Le Colonial is definitely on the to-do list next time I'm in Chicago.
