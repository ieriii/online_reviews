Came here for a company dinner and was surprised by the service and quality of food here. I can not say much to price, since it was on the company's tab. First of all, I would recommend this maple syrup martini. It was a hit with the ladies as well as the men. The salad bar has a variety of food from salads, vegetables, soups, cheeses, cold cuts, and soup. Never overload because the main course is amazing. We got the chef's selection and a whole bunch of meat came running at us and I just kept asking for more. They serve a variety of food from beef, chicken, pork, seafood, and duck. For such a big size group we had, they gave us some small portions but I was never afraid to ask for bigger sizes. They are not afraid to give it to you. Our chef's selection came with a variety of vegetables, mac cheese, etc. One thing that did not impressed was the individual sized desserts. I am a big dessert person but I took one bite of the cheesecake chocolate covered lollipop and I put it right back on the plate. Overall, the service was good. If the servers run out of a meat, they come right back to you with a fresh rack of meat. The space is amazing with the decor. The restaurant had a wow factor and the food did not disappoint.
