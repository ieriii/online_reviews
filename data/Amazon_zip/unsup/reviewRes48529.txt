PROS The food is outstanding. I mean OUTSTANDING - and is reason enough to go. Pork, any way you like it is done at a level I didn't think possible. Too many items on the menu that sounded wonderful, so I will be back for the menu alone. Beer selection is outstandingg, and dare I say "fun." Again, reason to return to try more beers that I had previously never heard of. CONS Service was at best - mediocre. Sat way too long with empty beers for comfort. Missing table settings, hurried servers were overseated. Finally, the cutesy communal table strategy isn't for me. I go to have dinner with my wife, nobody else. IT will always work against my decision to return. If we could guarantee a table to ourselves, I would return once a month. But I have no interest in what other people have to say or do. So it's sad, but unfortunately, it's part of the decision making process. Food and Beer = GREAT Service and Seating = Not so great
