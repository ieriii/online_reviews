Sunda was amazing! I have heard so many good things and finally got to experience for myself a few weeks ago for my first time. I really enjoyed the Crispy Brussel Sprout salad, which is something I probably wouldn't have tried on my own. The sushi was great, of course, The Tail of Two Tunas was my favorite and I know Spicy tuna is a classic, but some places don't get it right, but Sunda did. Had a roll that came with guacamole or something - too overwhelming, too many tastes and too heavy for a sushi roll - that is my only complaint of the night. We went on to have dessert, which completed the evening, we had something with a weird name, but none the less, it was awesome, some carrot cake dessert.
