I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place. On weekend nights there is usually a wait. Order a couple Mojitos (the best I've had) at the bar and you will be good to go. The butter they serve with the bread is fantastic. I would recommend the Honey Jalapeno Pork chops with sweet potatoes. You get two HUGE pork chops (lots of fat, but that adds to the flavor) for a decent price. The service can be a little lacking, and it can get a little loud. However I still love it. After reading some reviews I will have to try brunch.
