The Pros: Fun atmosphere, nice inside of the restaurant, good location, great drinks. The Cons: Overpriced for what it is, and some dishes are really subpar. 4 of us went to Gilt tonight with varied expectations. Overall I thought the meal was pretty good. Definitely the best dishes included the Pot Roast (delicious), the mozzarella/garlic/toast spread, the parmesan gnocchi, and the asparagus. dishes to avoid include: the cauliflower, the mussels, and the meatballs. I am curious to taste the dishes we didn't get. This is a fun, shared plate type place to go with a group. I thought the best dishes were very good and the worst dishes were fairly bad. Would I go back? I'm not sure... probably for drinks. Not a bad spot, just have to order the right stuff... I do think it's unreasonable to have $18 small plates... but I guess that's just me.
