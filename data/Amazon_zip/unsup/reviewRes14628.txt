My dad was in town last week and suggested we meet here for lunch. Free valet - thank you, Yelp! :) I walked into the bar area and quickly found the reservation counter. The decor very old-school but charming. They had small trellises set up around 2-seater booths with lights strung through and around. Glass display cases separated the small dining rooms and were filled with random little glass figurines. It was pretty empty around 12:30 but had a nice sized crowd by the time we left around 1:45. A lot of regulars which is always a sign of either good food or bargain prices. Both of which I am a fan of! The waiter didn't miss a beat. He had everything ready to go for us knowing we were in a bit of a time crunch. We split the crab and avocado salad which was an interesting combination I had never had before. Not bad! Not bad, at all. They didn't skimp on the minestrone. It was very thick (it probably didn't help that I added a couple spoonfuls of Parmesan) & I'm not gonna lie, I was sad to see it go but had to save room for the entree! We also split the bow tie pasta with peas, sun-dried tomatoes and mushrooms. Pretty average, nothing spectacular but a good side if you're going family-style. In typical dad fashion, he wouldn't let me leave without having a slice of tiramisu and a capuccino. Mm mmm! I'll definitely stop in again if I'm in the area.
