We went recently for the Peking duck dinner. The duck skin was crisp and tasty. I definitely enjoyed eating using the buns rather than thin pancakes...made it a more novel experience. The accompanying duck soup was delicious. The duck fried rice was...duck fried rice. Good and fulling. My daughter had the soy sauce chicken over rice. which was quite tasty and a good value. We also saw some seafood dishes flying past us...looked delicious! Next we'll order a combination of BBQ and non-BBQ dishes as well as some more soups. This could be a second home.
