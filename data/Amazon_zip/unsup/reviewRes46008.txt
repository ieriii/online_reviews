There is a reason everyone compares this place to the cheesecake factory. It's an overpriced, crowded chain restaurant. I went here with some of my coworkers for lunch one day and had some sort of grilled sandwich that was forgettable and bland. We had reservations, but we still had to wait for 45 minutes in their overcrowded waiting area to be seated. Meh.
