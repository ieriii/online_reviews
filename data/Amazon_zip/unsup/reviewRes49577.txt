Really enjoyed. Went solo and sat at the bar. Staff was busy attentive. Wonderful wine suggestions to pair with the foods. Had the oysters- delicious but inconsistant in size. Heirloom tomato and watermelon salad was delicious. Side of eggplant was ok- needed salt but I prefer chefs that undersalt to over. Had the Good Humor Man desert- cute and nice presentation. Great experience overall would definitely return with friends or a date.
