Cute atmosphere BYOB helps when going as a big group. HOWEVER - if you are a TRUE sushi lover who understands authentic sushi/sashimi - you will be very disappointed by their sashimi. The sashimi pieces were paper thin and the portion size for a $23 large sashimi plate was just pitiful. When I say paper thin, I mean paper thin, when I pick the pieces up with my chopstick, it just sags over. Most other sushi places have at least 3-4 times the thickness of the sashimi at Coast. They don't even know how to cut the sashimi pieces correctly. There is a reason why REAL Japanese sushi chefs go through years of apprenticeship to learn how to properly slice sashimi pieces to ensure maximum flavor and texture. I didn't hear one word of Japanese among the restaurant staff. If you are going for the americanized rolls and don't know the difference between authentic sushi vs rolls with creamcheese and tempura crunch (cheap fillers) then by all means go ahead and enjoy. In terms of the other items - the teriyaki dishes had very small portions and hardly filling for $15-20. Gyoza was deepfried which is a no-no. The tempura tasted stale and the oil they used was probably old.
