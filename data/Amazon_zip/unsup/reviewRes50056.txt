A friend and I went to Fifty/50 on a Saturday around 9:30 for a birthday gathering and were very unpleasantly surprised. The men were so drunk and aggressive that getting to the bar for a drink involved constantly removing grabbing hands. Once we elbowed our way up the bar, we couldn't order for all the drooling men staring at a bar tender who's t-shirt was cut to completely expose her naked, fake breasts. I appreciate a beautiful woman, but COME ON! Is this a strip club!? Lucky for everyone, several men decided to balance things out and take their shirts offs. Eeeeew. Thankfully our party had some tables reserved so my friend and I were able to keep out of the groping crowd. For the rest of the night we were somewhat entertained by Wicker Park's version of Jersey Shore. The crowd is what defines this place and the exact reason I will never return.
