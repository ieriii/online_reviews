Whatever you do, please make reservations. Otherwise, you will stand and wait a long time for a table!!!! We made reservations and were seated right away. I ordered a spicy stew that had cinnamon and anise star infused broth. It was heavenly! My date had a traditional beef pho that was very good and smelled delightful. Our green tea and mango smoothies were very good.  Service was fast and prompt, but please remember to call and make reservations!
