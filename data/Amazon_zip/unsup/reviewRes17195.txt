Probably would make a great first date. Just picture it: Walking down the street with your new girl, open the random door on an unassuming wall, walking through the dark hallway, no big deal, curtains open to reveal a sweet-looking lounge... could be impressive if she hasn't heard of this place already. The drinks are fancy but are actually really good and not crazy expensive, the servers are all super nice and knowledgeable. We went the first time kind of on accident while waiting for a table at Piece so I went in with a baseball cap, and the guy who came over to ask me to remove my hat did it in the nicest way possible. Cool place.
