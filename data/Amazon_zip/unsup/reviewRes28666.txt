I have mixed feelings towards Opart Thai. We went there for dinner, before a movie at The Davis on a Friday night. On the one hand, the Green Curry was quite spicy, which is always appreciated. On the other hand, my stomach (which is made of iron and survives third world street food) was NOT a fan. I spent the entirety of "The Avengers" in a state of much discomfort and that is highly unusual. Also I generally prefer a little more variety in the vegetables used in my curry as opposed to just eggplant and green beans. Also not a fan of having to pay extra for rice. It always just seems a little stingy on the part of a restaurant. Date's Pad See Euw was tasty. Service was fast, which is always appreciated. I loved the interior although it does seem as if they might be fitting a few too many tables in (although given how busy they were, I understand). I'll give them another try at some point, but I think that, for the first time, I may NOT get Green Curry at a Thai restaurant. Which, let's face it Opart, says a lot.
