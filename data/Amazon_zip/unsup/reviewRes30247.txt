I was recently in Chicago and had lunch at Frontera. I was very happy with the food and the prices. The service was fine; though certainly nothing to brag about. The decor of Frontera was really nice and though the place was a bit loud I think that Rick B. has a fantastic concept in both his style of dishes and the different restaurants all in basically the same location. Next time I'm in town I want to try breakfast at his casual place next to Frontera. I would recommend this to anyone who loves good, slightly unique food that is made with fantastic ingredients. I had the Sea Bass (I believe) over mashed potatoes and green chili cream sauce....it was fantastic. My coworker had the enchiladas in a red chili mole; it was also really good.
