I've stayed here many times over the past 25 years, but most recently stayed here on the historic evening of November 4, 2008. We had tickets to the main event at Hutchinson Field in Grant Park and really didn't want to deal with the aftermath of getting home to the north side. So I was surprisingly able to use my Hilton Points to get a free room. Check in went very smooth. The room was nice and has the free coffee maker. Oddly enough, the young republicans and a republic candidate for attorney general of cook county were occupying the ballrooms. Though most of the traffic in the hotel was press and Obama supporters. Anyway, to get back to the hotel, they did a nice job of handling the evening with security and easily getting us back into the hotel. I would recommend staying here. The views of the lake and grant park can be spectactular.
