I dragged my friend here with me last night because we were both starving and I've been meaning to stop by Crisp for quite some time now. We walked into the small, brightly lit restaurant and immediately felt a little intimidated-- not quite sure how to begin ordering. Sensing our hunger and uncertainty, the man at the counter quickly began chatting us up. Or should I say wooing us with his bitingly loving words? He introduced himself as Doug. Doug Funke. As in "Funke Chicken." Whether he was toying with me or not, I do not know. I do not care. From that point on, I agreed to everything the man suggested. Try both the Seoul Sassy and the Crisp BBQ? Okay! Try both the garlic and mango salad dressings? Yes, sir! Try the Baby Buddha Bowl with beef? Okay, Doug Funke! Bus our own table? Anything you say, Mr. Funke! Oh yeah-- the food was pretty darn good as well. ;) My friend (who happens to be Korean and is somewhat of a picky eater) was even going on about how good the chicken was. So I took that as a good sign. In conclusion, I left with a skip in my step and a happy rumble in my belly.
