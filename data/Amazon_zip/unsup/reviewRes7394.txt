I went here on a double date during Restaurant Week, and it was amazing! The highlights: Food: Best comfort food I've eaten in Chicago. The hush puppies and onion rings are my personal faves.  Service: Our waiter, Edwardo, was delightful.   Price: Very reasonable for an upscale restaurant. I will definitely be visiting Q again soon! I'm already craving the hush puppies......
