What can I say about Greek Islands Restaurant that have not been said. The atmosphere and service is top draw. I have been a long time customer and truly long to eat there again. Just writing about it makes my mouth water, mm yummy. The smells hit you before you enter the door, it tickles your pallet in anticipation of whats to come. The lighting flatters all skin tones, and will prepare any couple for romance. Note this is a great place to pop the question. So, I hope wend you think Greek food, think "Greek Islands Restaurant" Until next time "good eats".
