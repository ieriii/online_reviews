Red Velvet French Toast. Need I say more?! I don't know if it's just me, but everything in Chicago is just exponentially bigger!  The portions here were HUGE! The menu so vast, it was so hard to choose. And for those of you trying to watch your weight - which frankly is pretty hard to do in Chicago with the good food - they did have healthy options like egg white omelettes, etc.  The red velvet french toast was to die for! And it was stuffed with cream cheese frosting.  We also ordered omelettes. It was so good! Beware the portions here are huge!  The line was fairly long... we got here at about 9am on a Saturday... the wait was about 15 minutes, not bad, but we opted to sit at the bar rather than wait for a table. When we left about an hour later, the line was out the door and there were tons of people waiting! But trust me, it's worth the wait!
