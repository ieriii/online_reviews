Bought a GroupOn and was discouraged from redeeming it by the owner who provided an 8:30PM reservation saying that it's going to be packed and might take up to an hour to get a table. I took it and got there at 8PM only to find nobody there. Not a good start. Waitress (who was very nice) asked if I would agree to an 18% gratuity which I agreed to since the meal wouldn't cost that much, right? Wrong. One appetizer, two entrees and two beers totalled $59 plus $10 tip. About the entrees, I had the sausage stuffed chicken thigh. I thought it was bland and confusing. My dining friend had the chicken schnitzel which looked a lot like Tyson chicken patties that I'd though on hamburger buns in college. Sat outside which was nice as was the owner who was friendly enough in person. Probably wouldn't return, but wanted to like the unique menu and atmosphere.
