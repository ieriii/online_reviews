OH BABY!!! Best Deep Dish in Chi, Best Stuffed in Chi, and their thin crust is pretty damn good too!! The sauce is tangy and in perfect proportion, the crust is buttery and delicious (alternating between soft and crispy as appropriate), a perfect amount of cheese...I would've given them 4 stars because of the cramped eating area, but they expanded into the next storefront and now have ample seating (kinda tight on parking though).  BOTTOM LINE: If you have someone come in from out of town and they want the "real deal" Chicago style pizza...Take them to Art.
