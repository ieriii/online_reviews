I have never been so mistreated or been spoken to so rudely as my trip to this overrated eatery. The confrontational and utterly bothered staff were clearly annoyed that I arrived near their 4pm cutoff. Upon getting our food, it was clearly a rushed effort and of course the hot dog tasted as such. I would say this is soo not worth the wait and overrated at best. Stay away.
