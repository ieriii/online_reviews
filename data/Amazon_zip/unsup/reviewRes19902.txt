I really liked the dinner I had at The Gage recently. Very clean and smart looking bar/restaurant with very friendly and efficient staff. I had the Haddock and crab cake which was very good while my gf had their special autumn butternut squash soup with duck sausage. The soup was tasty but the duck sausage really helped it have a better flavour. The fish and chips taste great and I would say are the best in Chicago that I have eaten. The locally crafted sausages were also very good and it shows that the head chef here does put time and effort into what items go onto his menu. The server (I think his name was Jason) was exceptional. A really smart professional that always had refills of drinks before you had to ask, great wine suggestions, and was attentive at all times even though the restaurant was full and he was clearly busy. He was a person who takes pride in his work and after my experiences in Market and District bars it was a welcome change. I can't help but feel that having items on your menu like "saddle of Elk" and "Bison tartare" are there more to show that the Gage is not like eveyone else as opposed to them being great menu items. However, this is a small criticism on a very good evening with good food and great service.
