This is arguably the best restaurant in the city. The great drinks and amazing appetizers are well worth the money. The main courses also are very good, but less amazing and less of a value. I've been here over a dozen times, and the service uniformly has been excellent and extremely informed.  IMO, "it's too popular so there's a long wait at peak hours" is certainly worth noting, but it's not a valid criticism. It's popular because it's very good, and I can attest that there is no wait at non-peak hours.
