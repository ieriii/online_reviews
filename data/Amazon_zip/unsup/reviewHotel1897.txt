I get the appeal of a trendy boutique hotel, but there are definitely better places to stay downtown and not feel cramped in your room or alienated by the thumping music in the lobby or the staff looking down their nose at you. The bath products are the only ones I've ever sought out after using them in a hotel. Also, this is another place that you pay handomely for a night's stay, and they STILL charge you for internet. That's like how places used to charge like $2 for long distance calls; It's just tacky.
