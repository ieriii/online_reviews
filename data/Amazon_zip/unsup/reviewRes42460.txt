i've had pho in lots of restaurants in various states around the country, but tank noodle has the absolute best pho i've ever had. i get the same thing every time, #47 (pho with sliced beef) and #247 (coffee with condensed milk). i'm not an unadventurous eater, but nothing beats this. pho has completely replaced chicken noodle soup as my cure-all. it will cut through the winter cold and even refresh you on a hot day. i usually go once a month but have been known to go every week. one of the first times i went to tank, the two of us had to share a round table with two older vietnamese ladies who took it upon themselves to help us order and even eat, even though it was not our first pho experience. normally this would have irritated me, but for some reason, at tank, it wasn't a big deal. the waitstaff is attentive but will not drop the check unless you ask for it (normally you just go to the cashier and pay at the front yourself) because they don't want to rush you. the ONLY downside is that they close for about 4-6 weeks every winter. i imagine it's because they make enough of a killing the rest of the year to be able to take that kind of vacation, so more power to them, but it sure does leave me with quite a hankering!! that's just my selfish side wanting pho whenever i want - i certainly can't begrudge a hard working family from a vacation!
