Today was the second time I was able to visit Piece this summer.... I was dying to get back. The pizza is awesome! The crust is thin, the cheese is gooey, and the pizza is hot! I always order the Red pizza with sausage and feta, but they have an abundance of toppings for you to choose from. I also had the chips and salsa which was very fresh and tasty! Go to Piece!
