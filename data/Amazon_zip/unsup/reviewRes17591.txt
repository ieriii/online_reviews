just to reiterate how awesome this place is, let me begin by saying i have not been a fan of brandy, both the spirit and the singer. regarding the spirit, i guess i'm just not an adult yet. despite my distaste for it though, i ordered a drink that had brandy as its main ingredient. why? i couldn't resist the maple syrup (Orchard: Laird's Applejack Brandy, Lemon, Maple Syrup, St. Elizabeth All Spice Dram) note the repeated 5 stars and you'll know how much i loved that drink.... bye bye vodka & soda, i guess i grew up. sorry brandy the singer, i just never liked you and never will.
