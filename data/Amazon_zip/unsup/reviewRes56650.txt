Wow !!!!!!!!!!!! Davanti Enoteca is incredible. I remember when you could not walk down this street. Now it is safe and has incredible restaurants like Davanti. Davanti, has a great atmosphere, very friendly knowledgeable staff. The food was great & the wine was even better. Good thing we all took cabs. The amazing thing was the bill. We thought that there was something wrong. That it was way too low for all that we had. We pointed it out to our waiter. It took him awhile to process it. I guess he has not been wracked with the difficult complaint of customers being concerned about being undercharge. He took the check away with him and returned with a satisfied look on his face. Yes the bill was correct and we were not being undercharged. Since we wrongly accused our fine waiter friend of undercharging us. We felt it was our duty to over tip him. We had such a great time and everyone there was so kind and friendly. I would highly recommend Davanti to all. We will be going back many times for sure
