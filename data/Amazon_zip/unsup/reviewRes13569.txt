Another Diner's Drive-ins and Dives pick that doesn't disappoint. First of all, I hate bloody mary's. But holy goodness, they look delicious. If you like them, they're huge and shrimpy and celery-y and I was impressed just looking at them. The mimomas come with your very own little bottle of champagne and a cold glass rimmed with sugar. So. delicious. But enough about alcohol. The food is out of this world. For brunch, I had the new orleans scrambler. Shrimp, andouille sausage, wild rice, peppers, onions, hot sauce ... and egg? So strange, yet so, so good. I stopped myself from eating it all just so I could savor the flavory goodness again for lunch today. My husband had the parmesan and chive eggs and thought it was pretty outstanding. But the. potato. pancake. It has fairy dust in it or something, because wow is it fantastically good. Quite honestly, I was impressed with every dish that came out of the kitchen. Everything was so pretty and looked quite tasty. We liked Glenn's so much we're heading back over the weekend to try the famous fish. Apple jack and pretzel encrusted fishies? Ummm, yes please.
