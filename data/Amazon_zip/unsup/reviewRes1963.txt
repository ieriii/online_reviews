Can't add too much here. This review might go a little differently if it were rainy and cold during my 'short' 30 minute wait outside. I appreciated the decor inside the place. Lots of personality and quite informative. After having a 5 minute discussion with Doug about how I'm shocked he's not Korean (he told me his last name Sohn is obviously shortened from something, although I did not manage to find out his ethnicity) Talk about a friendly guy. You can tell he's there because he genuinely wants to be and loves people. So, if you're waiting in line a long time, you'll realize that the owner's wanting to appreciate you with quality time when you order.  Figuring I wouldn't be returning very frequently (due to the wait), I decided to try 3 items: the antelope, cognac lamb/pork, and the highly touted fois gras. While it was obvious I wasn't paying $8-9 for presentation (we're talking cased meats here), every single flavor combination was so interesting, I was glad to have a few bites of each and a menu handy to remind me exactly what I was tasting. The duck fat fries tasted like.....fries. Believe me, I REALLY wanted to think there was something special about them, but my palette really couldn't pick it up. So, I decided to just give them a good whiff, and that's when I noticed it. There was something subtly different about their aroma, albeit too subtle to pick up with my tongue. Oh, well.... If it's a nice day out and you have the time, try it!
