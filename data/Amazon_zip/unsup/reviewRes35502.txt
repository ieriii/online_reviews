After a hiatus, I was looking though my reviews and noticed that I never have reviewed Sun Wah. What an egregious omission. Sun Wah is only my favorite Chinese restaurant in town, but my favorite restaurant on Argyle and my standby "I am stressed and need to have my way" restaurant. If I go on my own, I am moderately stressed. If I ask my wife to go with then I am really stressed. I have a lot of stories about Sun Wah and most have less to do with the duck, Hong Kong pork, or garlic fried ribs than I care to admit. Sun Wah is great family run restaurant that offers one of the top special dinners in town in the Beijing Duck special. For $28, you share a 4 course meal with as many of your friends as you choose. You get first tableside cut duck in buns, then comes the duck soup, next is the remainder of the duck in duck fried rice, and finally comes house made sorbet. If you are lucky, you get a fifth course of radishes to start. We love the owner's daughters who have so much energy, knowledge, and willingness to chat. The Duck special is great, but if you want to go off menu, try the Hong Kong Pork or Garlic Fried Ribs. If you want something specifically, I'd call ahead to make sure, you can get it as well.
