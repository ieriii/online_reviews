Considering that I rarely venture north of Armitage, Hopleaf was worth the trip north. The atmosphere is just what I'd expect for a pub. Don't be intimidated by the beer list- the servers are incredibly knowledgeable, so trust their recommendation.  The food was AMAZING as well. Duck meatballs to start- everything I've ever dreamed of and more. The mussels were equally impressive. Even though I practically had to roll out of Hopleaf, I'll be back!
