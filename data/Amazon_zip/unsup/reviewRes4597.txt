We get in and take our seats and immediately our waiter has this snooty demeanor towards our entire table, although, I felt as if he was trying to subconsciously communicate with my boyfriend and ask him what a handsome guy like him is doing with a woman, instead of a strapping man like our waiter!  Pardon my digression, the lack of friendly service we received was superseded by the odd crowd that this place attracts, (or attracted that evening) it was reminiscent of a grade school party in someones basement, all different types of people all stopping to stare at the other one. It was quite the awkward scene. The food left much to the imagination, and was not overly satisfied with anything that was ordered at our table.  Would I try this place again? Poor service and lack luster food? I forge ahead and find another establishment that I can sample their fair and hopefully embrace a better experience at my next destination.
