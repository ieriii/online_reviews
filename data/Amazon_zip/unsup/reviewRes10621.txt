The usual crowd isn't my scene but I'm not going to let that stop me from enjoying some of the best pizza and microbrew around. I love, love, love the pizza here. And the beer. Can't forget that. It's not cheap. But for me, every once in a while, it's definitely worth it. The service has never been exceptional, but then again, every time I have been there (dinnertime weeknights and weekend nights) it's extremely busy. Are they understaffed? Or just not efficient? I don't know. I am not in the hospitality business and I will not pretend to be. I just learned to keep my expectations low.
