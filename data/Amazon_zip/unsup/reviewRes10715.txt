I'm such a fan of Bongo Room - I can't say it enough. It's my favorite brunch spot HANDS-DOWN. I've been back here maybe 3-4 times #guilty Their eggs benny ..... I don't think I've tasted a more fresh eggs benedict. I didn't get that full/sick/fat feeling after eating it. I never do here. It's always either pancakes or eggs benny here. They cook the two with such skill I don't even know how they do it. It's just too good. I wish you guys were open a bit laterrr on the weekends for brunch and weren't so busy all the time!! #wah I gots love for The Bongo Room. Yeah, I gots it.
