Been going here since the place opened when Opart was actually there. If you have to drive there, parking can be a bitch. The wait can be tough too but once seated, and I recommend not taking a table in the front room, you're in for some great Thai.Cheap and plentiful I think.A fave w/the lesbian crowd. They like it hot too!Tiger cry beef, Basil beef are quite nice.Afterward, hike over too Lincoln square proper & visit Cafe Selmarie.More Lizzies there too (lots) but the fresh pastries will soothe the Thai burn. Srawberry roulad or banana eclair ought to do it.Burp
