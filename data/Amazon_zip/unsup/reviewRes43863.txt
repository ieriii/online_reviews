Wow, had a completely different experience when we went for dinner last Saturday. Went back for dinner with the hubby last Saturday after the owner (Susan) invited us back after reading our review. We were already impressed that the owner contacted us after reading our review. The food: -Calamari: perfectly cooked with just the right amount of batter. Served with marinara and aioli. Delicious! -Caesar salad: perfect split for the two of us as we just wanted a little bite of salad. It was fresh and delicious -Bone in filet: perfectly cooked rare. And warm!! Last time, my biggest gripe was that the steak was cold but it was warm and perfectly cooked. Melted in our mouths! -Mashed with bacon and garlic: Wow, so delicious! We were so sad that we didn't order another one. It melted in our mouths with our steak! -Chocolate cake: what i love about the desserts is that they're not outrageously sized. It was a perfect ending to our dinner to end with a little bit of sweet without it being too overwhelming or pushing us over the edge. The cake itself was warmed with slices of strawberry and some creme fraiche. +Another plus: free corkage!! how many nice steakhouses offer free corkage?? We brought a great bottle of Silver Oak and enjoyed it with our dinner with no corkage fee! +Service: perfect. it was great last time as well. Our water was never empty and they promptly cleared our dishes. Overall, we were very impressed this time around. The food was delicious and wonderfully flavored. Will definitely be going back. This place is on par with some of our favorite steakhouses! But what's nice is that it is a local small business so they are more attentive to their patrons then some of the bigger establishments. Definitely recommended!
