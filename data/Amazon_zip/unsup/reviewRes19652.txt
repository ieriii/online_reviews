I can only speak of the Almendrado (almond milk and hot chocolate) and the churros, with regard to food. Environment: loved it. More specifically: my friend and I were sitting brainstorming for a commercial script she had to send the next morning and we sat on hi-top style chairs by the window and had awesome convo in a cozy yet lively environment. Salsa and a few other Hispanic genres were playing a little on the loud side throughout the restaurant but I didn't mind because; any excuse to feel like I'm not the only Cuban in Chicago :). It was like 8-9pm on a Thursday night which also makes it ok. I've heard of lines but we didn't experience any. Almendrado was great. It's an almond-ish hot chocolate. Very distinct taste so you may or may not like it. It's thick yummy goodness. Churros- 3 for $3 I think? I have to be snooty and say that I'm from Miami so I'm used to roadside 10 for $1 from a dude in a hat, a styrofoam cooler and a Sharpie advertisment. That aside, they were pretty great, overloaded with what looked like brown sugar and sprinkled with little specks of chocolate. Tip: Dip the churros in the Almendrado for a burst of goodness in your mouth!! Now I know why it always smells like chocolate near the Chicago stop on the brown line. I thought it was because of another chocolate place but nope, it's comin' from Xoco!
