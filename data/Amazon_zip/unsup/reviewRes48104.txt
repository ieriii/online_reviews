I feel I've experience all the possible ways one can enjoy Publican. My first time was just for beer and snacks. The pork rinds (chicharon if you're awesome) we're mindblowing. Best I've ever had...if only they served some vinegar to go with it. Great beer selection too. Next, dinner on my birthday. The pancetta was crazy...pork tenderloin wrapped in more pork fat. Oh, and a couple more orders of chicharon. And today, the fabled Publican brunch. Bacon, prosciutto, pork shoulder, prosciutto (yeah, twice). One of the tastiest omelets I've eaten (with gouda and prosciutto), and the maple bacon was amazing. If I just had a giant platter of their bacon, that'd be the perfect meal for me. Filipino's blood are comprised of two things: vinegar and pork. At Publican, I feel like I'm finding new life.
