Got the pan pizza with prosciutto and goat cheese. Was a little more doughy than I would expect for a pan pizza. The pizza I would give 4 stars, but what irritated me was the massive difference in the posted prices online (both on their website and grubhub) and what I was charged. Not sure I'd try it again. Still on the hunt for my favorite pizza...
