One of my favorite places in Greektown. I used to go here all the time when I lived around the area. (I miss it so much!) I love the atmosphere and sitting on the little balcony. A great place for a casual meet-up or date. It looks like a bakery/cafe/wine shop all in one. I have been here during lunch, dinner and even for a late night wine stop. I've had their pizza, sandwiches, artopitas, and Mediterranean fest (hummus, baba ghanoush)....loved them all. SO many vegetarian options too. The number one reason I keep going back? I am in looove with their potato salad!!
