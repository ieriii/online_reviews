This was a good place for a small crowd, since it's bustling, right off of Michigan Ave, and consists of small plates (where cost gets diluted if you have larger numbers). We had a party of 5. Unfortunately, since we made a reservation at 8:15 on a Saturday night, we had to wait a bit for our table. The house bread was a delicious parmesan bruschetta which whetted our appetites before the food came. Our selections: Queso mixto - came with a blue cheese, a raw cow cheese, and a sheep's milk cheese (I think) and each one had its own sauce/accompaniment. The cheeses were good, though the amount of bread was pretty minimal. Tocino con cidra (Pork Belly & Granny Smith Apple-Black Truffle Slaw) - very good, decadent. The acidic apple was a nice contrast to the earthy truffle. Mar i Muntanya II (Serrano-Wrapped Yellow Fin Tuna, Potato Croquette, Pickled Red Pearl Onions) - also delicious, especially the onions contrasting with the creamy potato croquette. Paella Valenciana (Chicken & Chorizo Paella, Artichoke & Tomato Salad with Saffron Aioli) - this was a little disappointing. while the flavor of the paella itself was good, i was hoping for more substance (seafood, meat, whatever). also, olives were included (which i hate) that threw off the flavor of the dish and you could taste it all over the bites that touched an olive. Pelotas de calabaza y cordero (Butternut Squash Dumplings, Lamb Ragout, Beech Mushroom Escabeche, Black Truffle) - this was really delicious, creamy, rich, earthy. unfortunately the order only came with 3 so we had to order 2 more but i definitely recommend it. All in all, the order came to about $33 per person, which isn't bad for all of us being full and having a good amount of paella left. For the price and location, it's also a good deal. The portion sizes are pretty small though, but the variety is nice. 4 stars! P.S. I've been here for restaurant week lunch.. it's excellent!
