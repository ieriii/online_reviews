My favorite spot in the city! Great place to bring out-of-town guests or newbies to the city. If your looking for a real Chicago spot - this is it. 30's art deco styling with a lot of charm DO YOURSELF A FAVOR and eat in the LOUNGE! It's just as good as the main restaurant but way more fun! Walk in and go to your left, they don't take reservations for the lounge - its name on the list / first come first serve - so get their early or expect to have a few cocktails before sitting. On Thursdays the jazz band is flowing and drink specials are too. No white table cloths in the lounge and CHEAPER food! The menu is not as big as the main dinning room, but easily as big as any other spot. Go for the lobster roll if you're not to hungry - so good. Or go for the lobster or fried sole.Grab a cigar out of their case and some dessert and you won't be disappointed.
