My friends and I stopped by here for dinner on the way to a Cubs game (it was recommended to us as a must try if you're in the area). We were so glad we did! We were running late and called in a few times to move around our reservation. They were very nice about it. Food: - Bread with herb infused olive oil: very good and held us over until the rest of the food arrived. - Pan Roasted Pork Tenderloin with Creamy Polenta and Wild Mushrooms: I ordered this dish and was surprised at how tasty everything turned out. I didn't realized this dish had mushrooms, but the flavors were so good I didn't even mind it! The polenta was too creamy and had the texture of mashed potatoes so I didn't enjoy that part of my dish too much. - Pollo alla Florentina: the-juiciest-chicken breast-i-have-ever-tasted. lemon butter sauce..not too big of a fan, but WOW. JUICY and TENDER! - Rigatone con Melanzane: the sauce was out of this world. - Spaghetti with Sausage: ehh...not much I can say. It's spaghetti.... - Cavatelli con Pesto: cavatelli was a little too doughy for my taste, but the pesto was good. Service was impeccable. Our server was warm and friendly. We told him we were in a hurry because we had to get to the game, so he brought everything out super fast! This was one of our favorite dining experiences during our trip to Chicago.
