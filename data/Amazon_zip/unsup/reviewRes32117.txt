As far as sushi goes in Chicago - I think Sunda is theeeee best. Their rolls are filled with the good stuff (rather than overdoing it with the rice to fill you up fast aka what other places do). I am a HUGE fan of the LOBSTER roll, best $20 you will ever spend! The brussel sprout salad, and the steamed duck what..pork buns are also amazing! My favorite drink would have to be the Blushing Geisha.  The ambiance and decor are beautiful, but I am not a fan of the noise in there. It often hard to speak to the people at your table. The staff is always great and food comes promptly. Its definitely a hot spot, so don't come in sweats. During lunch hour you can see a lot of local business people and toursists dining there. At night, esp on weekends, it is filled with a younger crowd as a first stop before a night on the town.  Definitely the best place for Sushi in Chicago. I am definitely a regular and eat there at least once a month, and I can't say that about any other place in Chicago.  I heart Sunda.
