Outstanding experience. We saw Glenn's on the Food Network and decided to try it during our fall break. Glenn's did not disappoint. Our server, Jacqueline, was very welcoming from the beginning and had supurb knowledge of the menu. Everything she suggested was a home run!! We stayed downtown (Illinois and Columbus) and took a cab to Glenn's----it cost $25 each way for 6 of us and took about 15 minutes to travel. Once there, the staff immediately brought us a wine chiller for our wine and beer. Glenn's is BYOB and charges a cork fee of $5 per bottle of wine or 6 pack of beer----awesome! Between the 4 adults, we ate the crabcakes, calamari, fresh lake perch, scallops, sturgeon, and beramundi----amazing food and preparations. For dessert, we once again listened to Jacqueline and had the pecan pie and a warm brownie covered in bananas foster----both were to die for and a great way to end the meal.  We travel to Chicago often and will certainly return. We encourage everytone to venture out from the same old downtown staples and try something that is unique, fun, and a culinary gem.
