hands down one of my all time favorite places to eat. its been consistent since i first discovered their "vegetarian sandwich" (black beans, muenster, lizano sauce, lettuce, tomato + avocado on french bread...YUM) 10 years ago. in recent years it has become even more reliable hours-wise/random vacation wise etc. its small but cute. the food is delicious, served in healthy portions, tons of vegetarian options and its affordable. go get some =)
