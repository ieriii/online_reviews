My wife had seen glowing reviews for Bayless & this restaurant, so we tried it on a visit to Chicago in May 2011. What a disappointment. Our meal was overpriced (over $300 for party of 6) & skimpy. Worse yet, the food was very unauthentic (i.e., Americanized). It's so ironic because we had wonderful, reasonably-priced Mexican & Latin American food on the same trip at Loteria Grill in Los Angeles and at Nacional 27 in Chicago. They are everything that Frontera Grill should have been but was not. My advice--pass this place by & try a place with better food & reasonable prices (Nacional 27, Tango Sur or Rosebud on Rush).
