All around excellent. In hindsight, I should have just gotten the steak tartare and called it a day. Not that the other food I tried/shared with my friend was bad -- it's just the tartare was so good and I wanted it all to myself. The decor is cool, if a bit predictably dark 'n trendy. Our waitress was very nice and attentive. It wasn't loud or crowded but that may have been because it was a Monday. The cauliflower was very yummy. Gnocchi -- good, but heavy. Caesar salad was excellent (nice citrusy fresh dressing) and large enough to share. Didn't try a dessert but will next time. Fries get an A-/B+ -- totally solid, but not the greatest fries ever. There's nothing exceptional about them. That did not stop me from eating a bunch of them, though. The tartare is stellar, among the best I've had. The egg yolk was not quite runny, just a smidge overcooked and didn't break like it's supposed to, but we were still able to mix it in. I'm salivating just thinking about it. Cocktails looked fun --- I opted for wine. Some good options in the $9-$12 range. I'm sure I will return and FYI, I do not intend to share the tartare.
