If you are looking for a fancy dinner...don't go here. But if you are looking for comfort food, a casual night or just some really delicious milkshakes, salad bar and desserts...then this is the place for you. It's salad bar is quite extensive with fresh fruit selections, 2 soups, and yummy chocolate chip cream cheese (w/graham crackers). Service isn't the best....but the food makes up for it. It's a good place if you are starving b/c the portions are usually huge. I highly recommend it, and also recommend just getting the salad bar which is guaranteed to fill you up!!
