Seriously I don't get it. I got the White pizza and Golden Arm beer, both were extremely sub-par. I get that my pizza was bare-bones basic and maybe I should've gone crazy and got it with 23 toppings to make it taste better. But sometimes, a great slice of pizza just entails the basics, all of which did not come on my Piece slice. Golden Arm, you tasted like a bud light.
