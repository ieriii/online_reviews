The food here is amazing!! Well i've only had two things on the menu, the a19 and the e61 but i've already ordered take-out from this place three times and it was delicious every time and very consistent.. They give very generous portions and the food has really good flavor.. I highly recommend the a19 as an appetizer and the e61.. soooooo good
