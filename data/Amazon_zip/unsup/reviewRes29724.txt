So so so good! Their chicken Tom-Yum soup pleases me like a bottle of whiskey pleases an alcoholic or a chocolate cake to a fat kid, or...etc. Whatever...it's perfect soup for winter. Their curries are consistently good...just make sure you have enough rice for it though...last time I got gypped with just a side of sticky rice. I need my rice dangit! It's okay though, I still love you, Opart. Always and forever.
