I'm always surprised when I go in here that there isn't a line out the door. The beer menu here is lengthy and fantastic. As for the regular menu, they have a great variety of burgers and sandwiches. Today I had the belly burger which was GREAT. I'm a huge fan of pork belly, and it was absolutely delicious on the burger. As well, they have great truffle oil fries. For the appetizers, I tried the fried cheese curds (which were amazing and I wanted more of) and the poutine, which was also great. Overall, you can't go wrong here.
