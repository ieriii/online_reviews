Great food, we had efficient friendly service, I'd go back for sure. Honey jalapeno pork chops are huge, tasty, but don't get much of any jalapeno taste, more just honey, well worth what you pay for, i'd come back just to order this dish..... my wife ordered the cuban roast pork, she wasn't too impressed by that, neither was I. we also had the taste of cuba appetizer which was great, other appetizer was a bacon wrapped date special which is just fair also had the tres leches cake and chocolate horno dessert, both were good, not great.
