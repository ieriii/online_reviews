Been here a couple of times and never been disappointed. It's a quaint small place, but very trendy. The great thing about this place is they aren't shy to give you enough. The portions are incredibly huge. Just there godzilla sushi alone can feed two people. The godzilla roll is great. I think what makes it so great is their spicy mayo sauce. It makes the tempura shrimp inside the roll so delicious. I can go on and on about it, but you must taste it for yourself. You can even ask the sushi chef to make your own rolls if you'd like, that's how laid back it is here.
