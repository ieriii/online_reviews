This place is an old-school Italian restaurant with a bar. As some people have noted, you walk into the bar and then have to make your way to the hostess stand. It is a bit awkward, especially when they're busy, but I wouldn't let that detract you. We were there on Sweetest Day, so it was a little hectic. We had made reservations in advance and were seated right away. Our server was Carolyn and she was great with making menu recommendations. She was a bit slow on the drink refills because of how busy they were, but I was very happy with our service. I had one of the specials, a rigatoni in a four-cheese sauce. It was super rich and very good. My husband had the chicken parmesan and he said it was one of the best chicken parms he's had in years. We had the Baked Alaska for dessert...it was great!!! If you plan on getting it, let your server know early on so they can start getting it ready while you are eating your dinner. It has a romantic ambience, but it gets busy and packed so don't expect a quiet meal. However, we enjoyed our experience and would definitely go again.
