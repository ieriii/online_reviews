I can not get enough of Milk and Honey. If ever moved out of Chicago this would be the number one thing I would miss. I go here about once a week and have had pretty much everything on the menu. Might I suggest there scrumptious pancakes and the huevos rancheros is amazing. I actually hate eggs, but I definitely made an exception after trying this dish. I suggest getting there early, the place opens up at 8am, anytime after that plan on waiting in line for 30 mins-1 hr. I have viewed other reviews and some people complain about the staff. I think it is quite interesting because I've never had one complaint. I highly recommend this to anyone.
