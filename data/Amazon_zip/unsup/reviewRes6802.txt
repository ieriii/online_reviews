A great find while in Chicago for business!  Went here on Monday and took advantage of the Friends and Family special, which was outstanding! I have never seen a better deal than the 2 apps, 2 salads, 3 entrees for $21 pp. I would have happily paid a lot more for quality of food and level of service provided. The menu consists of your traditional Italian dishes...nothing too creative, but still a fair amount of choices to choose from. Overall, everything was great...starting with the soft warm bread, bottle of wine, apps, mixed greens salad (simple with very good dressing), and entrees. Between my colleague and I, we tried the crostini di avocado, calamari griglia, lobster ravioli (light, but flavorful - pasta tasted like it made in house), linguine with claims, and lasagna di antoinio.  I will definitely be back!
