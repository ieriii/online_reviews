When I first moved to the area everyone suggested I go to Tank Noodle... so I did. It's just an ok experience and the food is nothing special. Chaulk it up to expecting too much but I don't care for Tank. It's passable food - decent food for an ok price but it's about it. There are better viet restaurants all up and down Argyle. They have a nice big menu though and the big windows make seems more open but it's not worth waiting in line.
