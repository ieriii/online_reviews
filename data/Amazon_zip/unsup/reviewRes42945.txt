I really enjoyed my experience at Gilt Bar and would definitely go again. The atmosphere was beautiful, making it the perfect date place. There was a good crowd by the time we got there to have our 11:30 latelate dinner, which made it feel more fun. I enjoyed the cocktails tremendously and the food was pretty good (not mind blowing, but still tasty enough that I would eat there again). The service was pretty average -- kind of on the slow side.
