Chicagoans, you don't know how good you have it! The average restaurant and average female in your city are so far above other cities' average restaurants and females. It is just absurd.  Pros: Great beer selection, amazing mixed drinks, outstanding food Cons: a bit pricey During my last visit, I stopped into L&E for brunch at 2 on a Sunday. The place was packed with hipsters and their too cool facial hair. My friend and I ordered drinks at the bar and were seated surprisingly fast considering the crowd. Rule: GET FRIES. That is the only MUST every time you come here. My pork belly blt sandwich rocked too, but i am excited to try something else next time.
