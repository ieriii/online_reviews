The only good thing about this place is the fact that they deliver to my house. After many searches, I found a Japanese restaurant that delivers in my area. And they got there fast, but it all went downhill from there. The crab rabgoon were the worst I have ever had. They were BARELY stuffed and mostly just wonton wrapping with little flavor. The sweet potato maki was DRY and mushy. Even the miso soup tasted funny. Unlike any I had tasted before. Thankfully the veggie maki was somewhat satisfying. Ill give it two stars because MAYBE if I ate in it would be better. I guess I'll never know.
