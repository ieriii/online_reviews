Best and most authentic pizza around! I love the arugula pizza and the white sauce ones are excellent. I carried out an order recently and it was a busy Friday night. I didn't have to wait long, but they still gave me a complimentary glass of wine. The zucchini appetizer is EXCELLENT and has me anxious to go back for it again.
