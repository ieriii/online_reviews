This restaurant is great. Atmosphere is fantastic. As a vegetarian found great options. It is very reasonably priced. For some portions might be small but I love the opportunity to try different things. We had the Truffle Egg toast, Ceci Beans, Roasted Corn Walnut salad, the Raviolo and desert Torta Bacio. Everything was delicious. My favorite, aside from the desert, was Truffle Egg toast. I didn't know what to expect and it was delicious. Though everything was amazing. Finally we saw the wine list, initially thought get a glass but it was cheaper to get a bottle. The total was $48.
