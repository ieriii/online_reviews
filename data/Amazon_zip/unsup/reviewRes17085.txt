Where to begin... there's almost two sides to Carnivale: the up-front bar and the restuarant itself. The bar is genarally packed with mostly happy hour/business types entertaining clients, often making it challenging to get a drink. No blame on the staff, they're just slammed. The restaurant has been exceelnt in my experience. Last trip was for work, and simply asked our waiter to bring us 'a bunch of great food' for 6 of us to share. Worked out great, and everyone was happy with the selction and quality of the entrees and ceviche. On top of it all, a visually amazing space with huge ceilings and over the top style... was like dining in the middle of a Cirque du Soleil show. Highly recommend - hope your experience will be as nice.
