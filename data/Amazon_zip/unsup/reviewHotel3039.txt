THE GOOD: GREAT lighting in the bathrooms (this is something that Ws seem to struggle with) Terrific lobby/living room Bliss spa! Love! Comfy rooms Good service Location. You're right on the lake, which provides some beautiful views, especially from the Bliss Spa. THE NOT-SO-GOOD: Location. What with it being on the lake, it's a bit hard to get to places. Not impossible, as there are always cabs out front, but not as easy as other hotels in the city, either.
