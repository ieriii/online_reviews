food was generally good, but service was terrible. a couple people in our group ordered sashimi for their dinner and requested that it be brought out as their entree with the sushi that the rest of our group ordered to share. we waited a long time for appetizers and sushi, but the sashimi never arrived. we waited and waited.... eventually had to ask our waiter if the sashimi had been forgotten, but he assured us it was on its way. when it finally came, the order was completely messed up and they tried to pass off different fish for toro. we had to wait forever to get our waiter's attention to notify him of the error and then we waited at least another 20 minutes for them to bring out the correct order. seriously, this is raw fish we're talking about... i don't see why it takes over 2 hours to prepare in the first place. they got the next round of sashimi correct, but now they were mysteriously out of one the orders that had been a part of the previous, incorrect order. throughout the entire fiasco, the waiter, the manager, and the sushi chef all came over to apologize, but at the end of the day, they did not offer to comp a single thing we ordered... not one drink, appetizer or dessert. we spent about $130 per person. also, a note on our terrible table location. we were seated behind the sushi bar with the flourescent lights the sushi chefs need to see their work blaring in our faces. i felt like i was an actor on stage and got a headache from sitting with the bright light in my eyes for 3.5 hours. there are so many better sushi places in the city -- fish that's just as fresh, service that is far better, and prices that are more reasonable. i hope sunda gets their act together because there are some great dishes, but i wouldn't go back until their service has seriously improved.
