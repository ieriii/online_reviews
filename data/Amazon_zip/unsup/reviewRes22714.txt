Eh, it's fine...nothing special. I went on a week night at about 8:30 pm and easily got a seat. I ordered what wound up being a $2.25 little airplane bottle of diet coke. The waiter seemed irritated that we weren't boozing it up that night. Then I ordered a $15.95 entree (which was fairly tasty - the lamb chop with artichokes and egg lemon sauce - my friend got the shrimp with tomato sauce and feta and it was pretty good too) but I felt like I should have gotten more for my money. There was no free side, no free salad, nothing. Just an expensive entree from a pusher waiter. After dinner the waiter suggested we get dessert, when we started to look at each other to decide he got frustrated and just grabbed the menu back. My friend and I had to stop him before he stomped off to ask for coffee. A tiny $2.50 coffee, I might add. All in all, I felt like I've had way better food for the money. I thought the waiter did the job but was pushy and rude.
