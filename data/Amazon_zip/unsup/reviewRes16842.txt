Mmmmm... my favorite Indian Food place ( though I have not ventured out to Devon Street- just too far! ) Whenever I get a craving for a specific cuisine, I will try a different restaurant every day until my craving is satisfied (my poor husband....) I came here once a few years ago and remember loving it. I had recently come back from London where I heard raves about their Indian food and was severely disappointed. When I got back to the States I wanted to come here but couldn't remember the name- so went to India Garden mistakenly. Good, but my craving was not fixed. The very next day I came here and it was as good as I remembered.  I prefer buffets for Indian cuisines because I'm not sure which dish I like and I never remember the names of dishes. Their lunch buffet was $16- not too bad considering normal dishes are what- $12? there's a beautiful decor and a strong smokey tandoori scent that comes at you as you enter the restaurant and follows you the rest of day. The food though is great! A lot of variety! different varieties of vegetarian dishes, lamb, and chicken. I've noticed at many Indian buffets there's 1 lamb, 1 chicken, and a bunch of vegetarian. I like my meat (and veggies!) so I love this place. I'm not a big fan of the tandoori chicken that comes out to the table because it's usually dry and bland, but IH's is more moist and flavorful- though I'm still not a fan of it. I love love the nan! and the mango ice cream is the perfect way to end the meal. overall, the food is great- very flavorful with lots of different spices, but not too overpowering. Service is pretty good. parking is hard. valet was $8 i think.
