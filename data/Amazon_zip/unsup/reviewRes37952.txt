Well, thank god my friend was waiting at the bar for us because the wait for a table is insane- even though when we walked around there were a few open tables. Their speciality is the mussels but there really isnt anything special about them. I tried both kinds with the people I was with; good but I can make better mussels. They give you a ton of them; but I recommend them as an appetizer to share. My friend had recommended them as an entree for two people to split. Well, that was horrible advice. I got sick of eating them about 2 minutes into it and I will still starving! I wasn't impressed to say the least. But the beer selection is definitely impressive, however not enough to get me to go back anytime soon.
