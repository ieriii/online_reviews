Stopped in for breakfast on Memorial Day before rolling out of town and I will definitely be back. I ordered the simple two-egg breakfast (though I substituted a can of Half Acre for PBR) and was impressed with the quality and taste of the sausage and potatoes, not to mention the refreshingly cheap price.I will be back.
