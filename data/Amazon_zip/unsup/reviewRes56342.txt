I lived in Vietnam for a couple of years and I loved the food, now I take advantage of every opportunity to eat vietnamese food. I have visited many vietnamese restaurants here in the US and Simply It is by far the best and most authentic. Also, the service is super friendly. You HAAAAAVE!!!! to try it.
