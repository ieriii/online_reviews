This is the Brazilian churrascaria that began it all in Chicago over 12 years ago. I loved it from the beginning and stayed with Fogo until Texas de Brazil came along, but I think Fogo has held its own having lasted longer than several of its competitors, like Sal & Carvao. I see it outlasting Brazzaz. Fogo has a nice, open floor plan, and the salad bar is accessible from anywhere without bothering any other patron's table, like Brazzaz, but it can't compete with Texas de Brazil which has a larger, more extensive salad bar, soups and a sushi bar too. The meat, desserts and price are comparable, if not identical. What really seperates my two favorites is that Texas de Brazil offers a coupon you can purchase for about $60.00 before April that gives you 12 dinners for 1/2 off from Monday thru Thursday.
