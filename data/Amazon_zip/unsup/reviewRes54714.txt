Stopped in Shaw's twice this month. Ffirst time we went after work and sat at the Oyster Bar. Service was great, the bartender outstanding. We tried a sushi combo plate (ok) and the crab leg bites (very good, but could have used a butter dipping sauce instead of horseradish).The second time I went in alone late on a Saturday. The waiter seemed in a hurry for me to order, eat and go. He was attentive, but overly so. I tried a combo bar app plate. Crab cake was good, but tiny. The shrimp was ok, too. Bread served with the meal could have been hotter.
