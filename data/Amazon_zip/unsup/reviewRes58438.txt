My mom got food poisioning here from the breaded veal cutlet...she thought it looked a funny shade of brown when she was eating it but didn't pay much attention. I called back the next day to tell them and the guy that works there goes, everyone eats veal no one got sick, I ate the veal parmesan yesterday and I'm not sick. I hate when people do that it's like...you can eat ONE little bite that is contaminated and you're sick. It doesn't matter how many other people ate it...take some responsibility for it. He was just really rude about it, no apology nothing...I was trying to be nice just to inform them they may have gotten a bad supply. How rude. Never eating here EVER AGAIN/ and their baked alaska tasted liek s*** GUMMY and gross...and the alcohol that she used to light it on fire was SO heavy it ruined the cake...gross gross gross
