I had a excellent experience at The James Hotel. My number one problem that I have when traveling is that I can't find a hotel that will except a rottweiler. Sure, they'll advertise they are pet friendly, but what they really mean is only lap dogs are allowed. The James Hotel accepts all breed and has no weight restriction with pets. The rooms were ultra modern and cozy. As for their bed, it's awesome. Its also in the heart of the city and if you don't mind walking, you definitely don't need to hail a cab. I would love to stay there again...in a heartbeat. Very pricey...be warned! But I guess you get what you pay for.
