This is indisputably the best pizza in Chicago. This is the REAL thing, and absolutely unbelievable. It's the first pizza place I've been to that would be considered superb in the pizza capital of the US: NYC. Pies are thin crust and made in one size (9" I think...get one per person if you have a good appetite). They use the freshest ingredients, and they are pizza purists all the way. We also had prosciutto and bufala mozzarella appetizer that was melt-in-your mouth delicious. I can't see any reason to pizza anywhere else, unless you don't want to wait--it's busy.
