Sweet Jiminy Christmas on a cracker! I just got floored by an avalanche of taste in the form of exquisite wings!! Me (in my head while walking down the street): Oh, I've heard about this place. I think I'll try some of their wings. Guy at counter: Hello, how are you today? Me: Hi, good. I'd like to try some wings. I heard they were pretty tasty. Me (in my head): mmm, something smells really good. Guy at counter: Oh yeah, they're probably the best wings you'll ever taste. At least I think so. Me: You smug bastard. I'm gonna eat my wings right here in front of you and god help you if they are anything less than extremely awesome! Me (in my head): Sounds like a plan! I can't wait to dig into...oop, I said the loud part quiet and the quiet part loud... Well, I took a bite and wow. I, unlike Clinton, inhaled, and before I knew it I was left in a messy, orgasmic-like state wanting more. After apologizing to the cashier for my tourettes and adding to their tip jar, I left a very satisfied customer. Seriously, the Seoul Sassy are very good, the Spicy Buffalo are extremely good, and the Crisp BBQ are best described as heaven on earth meets pact with the devil deliciousness. Do yourself a favor and stop by asap! I seriously might stop by again later today for seconds. Makes sure to bring a bib to protect your clothes and cash, money to pay.
