Hmmm, the food was good. Our waiter was nice, as were the food runners and hostesses. Something was up with the bar staff the night we were there, maybe they had just gotten yelled at or eaten poison mushrooms because they were moving in slow motion, superslow. Consequently we didn't get to order as many drinks as we would've liked while waiting at the bar for our table and once we were seated the wine pairings didn't come when the courses were served. It's a very pretty room, but I think overall this restaurant falls into the tourist trap category and for the price I'd rather go somewhere new next time I'm spending $247 for 2 people.
