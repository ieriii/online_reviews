"Meat Free Since 1983" is the slogan, and I think we can all agree that any place open for nearly 30 years must be doing something right. God damn I forgot how good Chicago Diner is, yikes. Way before my Yelping days I'd tackle this spot any time I was in the city, so during a trip back to the home country I obviously had to stop by for some grub. Chocolate chip pancakes, tofu scramble, seitan sausage and country potatoes just like I remember. My lady's Egg Biscuit Sammy (made with tofu instead of egg) was stupid good. No lie, if I still lived around these parts this would be a weekly stop for life, I am slightly bummed I couldn't squeeze in one more trip as that Chickn C-Zar sandwich had my name all over it. Amazing food for sure, but also perfect service. No matter what you ask your server it's all smiles and assistance. Whether you're a vegetarian, vegan, meat eater, or alien I'm pretty sure you're going to enjoy this food. Give it a shot, you're body, the animals, and the planet will thank you for it. Now if only I can convince them to open a Los Angeles Diner I'd be set.... *sigh*
