WOW.. Just..Amazing. This bar slash restaurant offers your typical, casual dish with an unique, upscale flair. Reuben Sandwich? Nope! Duck Reuben! ($12) Slow roasted Peking duck with cranberry cream cheese spread and sauerkraut and a side of their pommes frities. A-MAAAA-ZING Taste. PBJ Sandwich? Nope! CB&J! ($10) House-made cashew butter, fig jelly and morbier cheese, pan-fried, with a melt-in-your mouth side of macaroni and cheese. An adult version of a kid meals. DEEE-licious. House Salad? Nope! Roasted Cauliflower Salad! ($8) Roasted cauliflower with marcona almonds, apples, golden raisins, mache, spiced yogurt vinaigrette..all cubed and with just the right amount of sweetness Mussels? Nope! Mussels from Hopleaf! ($12) They have traditional mussels as well as one special each day.. definitely ask what it is. we got the special of the day which contained paprika for spicyness, chorizo for heartiness, among other ingredients, then we spend a good amount of time soaking in the remaining broth with our warm bread. First four things I tried here are all recommended, and I can't wait for another trip to Chicago so I can try four more items..that is if I can pull away from these 4. Other major pluses include a very extensive selection of beers and very good service.
