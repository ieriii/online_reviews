This is our FAVORITE Mexican place ever and it's located around the corner from us!!!! It has the best margaritas and salsa!!! If you haven't tried the Jamacian Flower, give it a try. It is excellent! Their food is the best.....although I think their fajita's are worst item on the menu. I really can't recommend this place enough. I don't think it gets the credit and recognition is deserves! And it deserves a lot!
