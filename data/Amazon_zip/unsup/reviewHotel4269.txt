We stayed here for 2 nights on a weekend trip to Chicago. Good location right off of Michigan Ave. Small rooms and poor layout (TV to the left of the bed) but we didn't spend much time in the room so it didn't matter too much. Nice bathrooms with Peter Thomas Roth products. The second floor lobby is beautiful. The hotel is historic without looking/feeling dirty or old. We booked the hotel through Priceline and weren't treated too great upon check-in. We were told we were in a smoking room and that it was the only room available. When we expressed our displeasure, he found a non-smoking room acted like he was doing us a favor, when really he just lied to us at first. This has happened to us at other hotels too, and it's something I just don't understand. I wouldn't mind staying here again.
