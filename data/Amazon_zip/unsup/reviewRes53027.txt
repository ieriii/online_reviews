This tiny restaurant may appear to be a random hut on a street corner of roscoe village. It truly is a diamond in the rough. My friend and I took two buses to come up north to check it out, and we left with full bellies and no disappointment. I ordered lechon which is slow roasted pork from their dinner manual. The pork was tender, juicy, and flavorful. It was roasted with sliced onions. I added habanero sauce to my pork. To be honest, I could not wait to take the next bite after consuming my first. The dinner was served with beans, rice and plantains (they actually use bananas rather than plantains but they were tasty regardless). I also saw other people ordering sandwiches which looked delicious. I will definitely go back to check them out. 90 Miles - added to my list of must visit restaurants for ethnic food in Chicago!
