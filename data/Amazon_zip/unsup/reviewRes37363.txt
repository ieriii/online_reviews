I just love this place, and if I could give it 10 stars, I would. We recently moved out of Chicago and I didn't realize how much I would miss shopping here. Everything is just top quality, with very few exceptions. When my husband asked me what I wanted for my birthday, I told him I wanted some of the chocolate salted caramels from Fox & Obel. When we called to see if they could send me some, they couldn't be nicer and more thorough. They really wanted to make sure I was getting the right product. When they arrived on my doorstep, there was an extra small package with additional candies in it with a note that read "Happy Birthday from Fox & Obel"! What great customer service!
