I came back here for dinner upstairs this time around. It was Friday at 10:30pm, and although we were told initially that there was a 20 minute wait, we were sat right away. Unfortunately we were sitting right next to another door, and the draft kept me pretty cold most of dinner. Also I think the drinks upstairs are not made, I'm sorry "crafted" as well as downstairs. The service was a little slow at times, but that wasn't a huge issue.  That being said, the food was really good. We had the triple cream cheese plate, which was awesome, with fig spread and bread that was slightly burnt, buttered, and perfect as an appetizer. We also tried the rabbit pasta dish, which was new for me and really tasty. By the time the mussels came we were getting kind of full but these were really good mussels, and the sauce was perfect for dipping bread in. I am looking forward to coming back but would probably make a reservation, and request a better location next time.
