Had dinner here to celebrate my birthday and started the evening off with the Crustacean Junction Pot Ppie. The crust was amazing and I wish there'd been more of it. The base of the pot pie was assorted seafood that was covered in a mornay sauce. It was baked to perfection and served with mushrooms on top. I think the combination of the mushrooms and mornay over powered the seafood a little bit. I like mushrooms so it wasn't a total downside. I noticed there was a spicy undertone to the dish. The more I had the more I noticed it. I am sensitive to spice but this didn't keep me from eating it. One of my girlfriends had the jambalaya, one had the white fish and one had the swordfish. All were thrilled with their dishes. For dessert, I had a piece of the Golden Carrot Cake. I had high hopes but was disappointed. Nothing quite meets my gold standard for carrot cake (Tavern, Libertyville). It was a little bland and dry and the icing didn't quite taste like a traditional cream cheese frosting. However I did get to taste the key lime pie and it was outstanding. I would definitely return to Glenn's. It's a great small restaurant putting out great seafood.
