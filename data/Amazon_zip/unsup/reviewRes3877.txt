As good as the Seoul Sassy wings were, the Crisp BBQ was my favorite. If you like gochujang, you'll kill for Crisp's BBQ sauce that most likely uses it as its base. The wings here are very big. And when they say 1 wing, they mean the whole wing: the mini-drumstick, the 2-bone piece, and the little piece at the end that most people don't eat. Not only that, they have a lot of meat on their bones. Other than their wings, they don't offer much else and the place can be a little pricey. Also, there is limited seating and the tables are communal dining style. Parking is scarce around the area as well. If all that doesn't matter and you're hankering for some chicken, then you'll really love this place. Personal Recommendation: 10 Wings (1/2 Seoul Sassy, 1/2 Crisp BBQ)
