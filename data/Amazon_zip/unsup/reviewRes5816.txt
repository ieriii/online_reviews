With excitement in my eyes, I looked at you with yearning. Then it struck me, I did not know how to eat you. Such frustration! Luckily enough, The guest of honor, Was quite the food enthusiast. Mix the honey comb into the jar she said! We did as we were told, and The delicacy was spread. Honey from the comb, So sweet to the taste! * Riccio di Mare e Granchio (linguine + sea urchin + crab) Dear sea urchin, I though of you, Only as a spiky shellfish. As it turns out, You look like pure cholesterol, You smell like the briny deep, You taste rather like a crayfish, You feel like foie gras of the sea, and You sound like you want to be eaten.
