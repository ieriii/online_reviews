I completely agree with Amanda's review. This pizza was nothing special at all. I'm surprised at all the rave reviews. Sometimes a place just gets an image and that just lives on. I totally don't see it in this case. If you're going to try Chicago style pizza, stick to Uno's on Ohio or at the least Lou Malnati's.
