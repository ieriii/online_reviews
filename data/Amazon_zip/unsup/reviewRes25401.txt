Needed to take deep dish pizza off my bucket list. Whereas I have to conclude that I personally prefer thin crust, if you want a deep dish experience, then this is supposedly the place to go. The pizza takes about an hour to prepare (no wonder), the place is semi-divy which gives it a gritty but yet cool atmosphere and it is (from what I could tell) in a totally random location. Can recommend that if you are in Chicago and want to go deep dish... PS: even if you normally can eat big volumes, order a small deep dish or share a medium. I wasn't able to finish a shared medium one.
