My first thought on seeing the building was that Sabatino's probably had character--and I was definitely right. We were greeted warmly as soon as we walked in, and the food/ambiance were excellent. Decor is a little cheesy, but also charming and very suited to the food. I paid $16 for a mammoth bowl of pasta (which lasted me three meals' worth!), which came with soup, a fresh salad, and deliciously crusty bread. I will definitely be back!
