Wonderful restaurant! (4 visits in the last year) The service is always good, the restaurant is comfortable and nicely decorated, but the food is what brings us back every time! Very authentic and always consistent. The salad selection is very good and very reasonably priced. We usually have the Tre-colore salad and the beet salad. I ALWAYS go for the Frutti Di Mare - by far my favorite seafood pasta dish I have ever tried. If you like the seafood pasta dishes - you will not be disappointed. Black spaghetti with wonderful spicy sauce and a very generous mix of shrimp, mussels, clams, and calamari. My husband loves their lasagna. Good wine selection, well priced!
