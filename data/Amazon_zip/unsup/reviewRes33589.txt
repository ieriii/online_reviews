I had heard from several friends that it Mia Francesca was delicious and I must say that this little restaurant was quite a delight. I ventured over here with my parents and boyfriend on Sunday evening and we all had a fabulous meal as well as plenty o' cocktails. We made reservations (highly recommended) but ended up waiting about 20 minutes in the coach house in the back. Where in most cases this would have been a minor irritation, the bubbly and beer made the time fly. Our appetizers (fried calamari - lightly breaded and fried perfectly so you could still admire the true fish taste; bruschetta - loved the variation and fresh bread) came quickly as did our entre's despite a packed house. I had a taste for salmon but our server recommended a variation on what was offered on the menu. I tend to trust servers with opinions deterring from the menu, and she nailed it with salmon covered in a wild mushroom medley that I just loved. No one was disappointed in their food, although my dad said he would have enjoyed a bit more sausage in his pasta dish. The desserts were a grand slam too... All in all with about 2 drinks a piece, 2 appetizers, an entre and 2 desserts for the table to share we left there having spent about $250, including tax and tip. Definitely a value for the quality and atmosphere. I will gladly return.
