I thought Laura H's rating was a little unfair...her "theories" about the place...what? anyways, i've always liked this place...there was one time when i went and it wasn't good but every other time, everything was excellent. if you're not into rolls, it's not the place for you as they don't serve regular sushi and sashimi.  i like this place a lot due to it's simplicity and i feel like it's really cozy inside. sometimes, they'll have some crazy techno music playing but if you ask them to put on something else, they'll usually switch to some downtempo house or other loungy music.  BYOB!!! ther'es an osco kiddy corner from it...they have saki! i highly recommend their ginger salad, spicy tuna roll (spiciest i've ever had), and their monster godzilla roll. i also love the spider.  one thing about this place...i miss the old couch in the curtained off area...they replaced it with some tables a few years back...made me sad. oh yeah, my friend lit himself on fire from the tabletop candle...probably the funniest thing i've ever seen in my life. Nautica Down Jacket vs Tealight Candle...winner: Tealight Candle!
