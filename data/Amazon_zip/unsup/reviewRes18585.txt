This past weekend disaster. Arrived and the suggested wait was 45-1 hour. Host suggested leaving cell number and he will call when a table opens. We venture out about 1/2 mile away and return in 40 mins. When we return the host now says another 45-1 hour wait! Packed area only to stand and no bar. The host could not care less. We walked out a bit shocked. Not the way you treat paying customers.
