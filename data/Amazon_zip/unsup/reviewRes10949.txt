So I am not going to say that I really understand coffee....  that is why I roll with people that can be considered "coffee connoisseurs". So apparently one of the perks of the Bongo Room is Intelligentsia Coffee, which makes up for the fact that there are actually no Bongo Drums (i.e reason this isn't getting 5 stars). So all percussion instruments aside, this is a really happening place for breakfast/lunch. Atmosphere: A combination of the chic of a cafe, with the energy of College cafeteria. This cozy joint has large windows, and close tables so you can people watch outside, and gander on the dishes of your neighbors. Its got an "IKEA" college student feel to it, which is help keep it fresh. Service: Very friendly, and as personable as service can be when madly serving the masses.  Coffee was always filled, and napkins a plenty. Food: I had the Roasted Duck Egg Benedict, and might I say it was awesome.  The menu is creative, and is definitely a good place for those of the egg persuasion.. I mean come on, where else would some think mixing a duck with a chicken...genius. Mommy Factor:  This place is definitely family friendly. It has an open atmosphere, but a noticeable 'Young" clientele. Not sure if they have many high chairs, so I would be careful with those with the kiddies. Date Factor: This is a fun place to take the significant other, but this is open air so you are not going to have any private romantic moments., well unless IKEA does it for you. Bling: I spent about 10 bucks on my meal + Juice/Coffee. I would put this on the moderate scale for priceyness. After a meal here you can't help but feel a little heavier, a little hipper, and in the mood to frequent a Swedish furniture store. **NOTE I don't own stock nor interests in IKEA or any of its parent companies, but I once met a couple from Sverige and they were ridiculously cool.   **
