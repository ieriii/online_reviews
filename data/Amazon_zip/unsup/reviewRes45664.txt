One of my favorite things to do on a crisp fall day or snowy winter afternoon is come to Wilde Bar, sit by the fireplace, and sip their tasty raspberry bellinis. The waitstaff is always super friendly, and the place itself always has the most charming seasonal decor. The food is pretty good too. So if it's gray outside and you feel like going someplace cozy, head to Wilde Bar!
