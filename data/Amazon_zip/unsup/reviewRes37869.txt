If I could come here and eat their mussels every day, I would. I always get the mussels for two and polish them off by myself. That's my appetizer, entree and dessert. Forget the bread that comes along with it. I'm here for mussels and mussels only. Oh, well the frites with the aioli too. What a perfect accompaniment to the meal.  They have a ton of beer selections but since I am allergic to alcohol, I can't really comment on that. I know people come for the cool beverages but come for the food. It is excellent.  Lastly, be prepared to wait. They don't take reservations (as far as I know) so come early if you hate waiting. But even if you do, it's worth it.
