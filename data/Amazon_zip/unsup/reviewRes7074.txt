A-OK indeed. A little Italian tapas menu during the week never hurts in my opinion since I'm a gastronomic try-sexual. I liked everything I had here, outside of the caprese salad which inexplicably suffered from styrofoam tomato syndrome in the middle of summer. It also wasn't salted, but did have delicious fresh mozzarella. It also lost a point because it had a hot wheel on it.  The mussels in white wine sauce (regular menu) and sweet potato stuffed pasta dish (from the tapas menu) were my favorites. We also had a truffle and spinach homemade pasta in cream sauce that was good but may have utilized the far less flavorful canned black truffles.  Be sure to keep an eye out for the occasionally whimsical menu descriptions, like a braised pork and lamb dish subtitled "I don't know how this will be prepared but I'm sure it will be delicious."
