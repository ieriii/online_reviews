I attempted to come here the previous two nights and ran into a 45 minute and 1 hour wait, respectively. I gave it another try tonight and man am I glad I did. This my first review on Yelp. Mostly because I have been lazy over the last year with the app. But the Purple Pig is definitely worthly of my first review. I ordered the Pork Neck Bone Rilette & Mostarda and the Pork Blade Steak with 'Njuda & Honey. I have no idea what the ingredients mean but I don't really care. The Rilette came first and had a pate with it and bread. It could be best described as a bruschetta. The flavor combinations were amazing. Next came the blade steak and the honey glaze was excellent. The wine list is also one of the more extensive I have seen, especially for a out of the way restaurant like this. Too bad I won't be near this place next week. Otherwise I would be back. I may just change my hotel back to the Marriott just to be closer. Enjoy.
