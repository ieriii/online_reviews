My husband and I went here to celebrate his birthday before heading off to The Hubbard St performance at Harris. I would easily give this place 4 1/2 stars if I could, as we had a terrific experience there. Our waiter was great and most of our food was excellent. I had the fondue, a small salad of greens w/ some fruit, and the risotto. The fondue was delicious -- as was the bread it was served with -- and my risotto was incredible. The salad was fresh, but not exciting.  My husband had the fried zucchini and olives, which I didn't really like and the Scottish egg, which he thought was delicious. He had the mussels, which he didn't care for, because he thought the vindaloo did not do the mussels much good and he longed for the traditional butter and garlic method of preparation after trying these. He also had the fish and chips, which he thought was the best he'd had in the city. As you can see, we had a LOT of food. The menu says that the first course (apps) is for tasting and we were told they weren't very big. Wrong. We had way too much food. We enjoyed it, but we definitely would not have ordered so much if we had known what the portions looked like. We had an excellent experience w/ the sommelier and enjoyed her suggestion for wine. Our bottle was $49, which I thought was quite reasonable considering how much more expensive wine usually seems to be at other pricier restaurants. NB: If you are going to the theater, as we were, you must leave yourself plenty of time here. We were there at 5:45 for dinner and had to skip dessert (not that we had room, but I would have loved for my husband to get a piece of bday cake!) to rush over to the show at The Harris. This was not our waiter's fault, as I had not told him about our show, since I thought that we'd have plenty of time. All-in-all an excellent experience and I would definitely go back.
