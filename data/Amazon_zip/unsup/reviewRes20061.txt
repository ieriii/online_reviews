I've been here a few times and it has not yet failed to be a very good experience, from the food to the ambience. And so adaptable, it's proven great as a date place and I've taken friends here who are visiting Chicago for the first time. What I find interesting is the service, usually pretty good but I've had a couple of very quirky servers with strange mannerisms, which I'm fine with, it just gave us something else to talk and laugh about. Their new rule sounds like a complete downer which is an unfortunate black mark against this bright dining spot
