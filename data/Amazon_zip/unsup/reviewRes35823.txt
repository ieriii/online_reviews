Sweet sassy molassy that was some mean duck. Ordered the Peking/Beijing duck dinner that came with fried rice and soup. Fed four of us comfortably and not knowing it was BYOB, ordered off their $3?!?! dollar beer menu. All in all very tasty and the bus boys and girls really move at this place- literally running back and forth. Will be here again. Make reservations during peak times and make sure to order extra bao when you place the order as the group burns through them right quick. BYOB.
