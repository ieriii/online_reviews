This is a step up from the typical suburban Hampton Inn, as it features Prairie Style interiors in a nod to the Midwest location. The lobby is nice, the rooms are pleasant, and so is the free continental breakfast buffet. The feature restaurant on the main floor seemingly changes yearly, but the hotel itself is fine.
