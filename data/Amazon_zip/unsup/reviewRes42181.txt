With a name like "The Art of Pizza" they obviously take slopping tomato sauce on dough pretty seriously. I admittedly may need to try this place again as it may be the most hyped pizza joint I know. Friends rave about it, it was voted the #1 deep dish pizza by the Trib, the dudes on WGN are constantly blabbing about it and the reviews here are sparkling. But it just didn't do it for me. While that's likely because I was expecting the best pizza of my life, pizza worthy of being called "art", it still wasn't even amazing enough to make a mental note to give it another chance. Now it is certainly good pizza. Four stars ain't nothing to scoff at. But when I'm told it's the best pizza in a town known for pizza, I want nothing less than a true masterpiece. This is a good place to go if... you don't take the advice of Chunk D and find yourself believing the hype.
