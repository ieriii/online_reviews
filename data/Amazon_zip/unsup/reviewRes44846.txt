We arrived early for dinner (5:15) and had no trouble getting seated promptly. However, by 06:00 the place had practically filled up and I expect there was a long wait. Part of the reason for this is the waitress informed us the cook time for deep dish (DD) would be 35-45 minutes and since our son had never had DD before, he opted to try a peperoni and cheese DD. However, that pretty much puts anyone getting DD at 60-90 minutes minimum, so that explains the long waits and low table turnovers. It also encourages people to order the appetizers which we resisted to keep the bill down. We opted for a thin crust pizza and promptly scarfed it down as we had been walking all day. He said his DD pizza was good but I don't think he was a fan of all the cheese - DD is definitely an acquired taste. The waiter service was a bit hectic but never bad though I could have used more water refills - they could do better. Enjoy
