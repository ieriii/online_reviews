I am a huge fan of Lettuce Entertain You restaurants, so I was excited to try this place. . It is pretty quaint and modest, so I felt comfy right away...which was good since I was on a hot date with Jo W.  I ordered a cheese burger, and although it was quite pleasant, it wasn't too memorable. I was pretty disappointed in the soggy, warm chips they served instead of fries. The service was on par, but nothing amazing. The manager, however, was great. He made sure to make a table visit, and even got me a fresh beer. Overall, my experience was A-OK...I shall return.
