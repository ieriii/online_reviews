This place deserves a 4 1/2. Obvious comparison is Kuma's Corner which isn't bad to be compared to. As a loyal Kuma's customer (I eat there roughly every other week) let me tell you that Lockdown is right there. If you can't stand waiting in the line at Kuma's, just come here. Amazing burgers and fries with an assortment of mac cheeses too. Don't tell Kuma's this but I might be frequenting this place in the near future just so I don't have to wait 2 hours. Trust me, go here and be happy.
