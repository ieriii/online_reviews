Gotsta be one of the best quesos out there. I love the pita like chips they serve with this queso. Do yourself a favor and get some chorizo on that, along with some cilantro on the side. The only other item i had was their carne asada. Which had to be on of the best I've ever had. Perfectly medium rare and an insanely generous portions. Uhhhh, yeah... I think I need to go back ASAP.
