PHO is serious business in these parts (Argyle)...with Pho 777 and Pho 888 close by, you may think you've landed in pho-ville but make no mistake, Tank is the mayor! (NOTE: Simply It is the pho mayor in LP - for close-to-home pho fixes this is my only spot) This no frills, big bowled, perfectly portioned toppings, Vietnamese noodle shop knows what's up, pho sho. my fav is the plain beef pho (but go real world/road rules challenge style and add some cow penis). that bowl is so big you could feed your mom, dad, sister and grandmama and could quite possibly be the best cure for the common cold. don't miss out on the fresh young coconut water that is served in a coconut. forgot those overly priced bottled coconut drinks with added sugar...this is the O.G. i've tried some other dishes - ginger chicken and spring rolls...all so good, but honestly pho is all i need. after your 1st experience you will TANK-ME-VERY-MUCH. welcome to pho heaven.
