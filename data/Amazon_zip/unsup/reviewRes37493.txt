This is for the cafe. Went there last night - I got the chicken panini and my boyfriend got the special, which was some brisket thing. First of all, it took THIRTY minutes to come out. Aren't cafes supposed to be quicker than a sit down restaurant? Secondly, my boyfriend's food was lukewarm. Brisket that is not hot=gross. My BREAD was supremely greasy. We left this place unsatisfied and $22 (!) poorer.
