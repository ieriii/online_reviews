If you live in Chicagoland, you really can't call yourself a beer connoisseur if you have not been to Hopleaf Bar. The beer list is so extensive, that you will have a difficult time picking one. Not a bad problem to have. If you are looking for something exotic that is not from Belgium, Hopleaf most likely won't have it. I recommend checking out the beer list on their website.
