The alligator sausage with shrimp remoulade (sp?) and white cheese was SINCERELY not only the best sausage I have EVER tasted, but best combo of flavors I have ever tasted on a bun. Always amazing service by all the hard workers there, Doug is always patient and friendly and funny, EVERYTHING tastes great- I never have any fear of trying something new, and the atmosphere is the icing on the cake. Just know you might have to wait in line a long while, but its SO. TOTALLY. WORTH IT. If you havent gone yet, GO GO GO GO GO GO GO GO GO GO.
