Let's get the obvious out of the way: the wings are great! Okay now the other stuff. Crisp is conveniently located in the middle of Broadway in Lakeview which makes it a great place to just stop in when you have a wing craving. The restaurant is a bit on the tiny side, so unless you go at an off hour or have the luck of the Irish I recommend going with take-out. I'm a bit of a spice hound so take this with a grain of salt, the wing sauces run a little on the mild side so I would advise jumping one level up the spice scale than you usually would. All that said the place fries a damn good chicken and offers the bowls for those looking for something a little less messy and more "balanced" (read lots of veggies).
