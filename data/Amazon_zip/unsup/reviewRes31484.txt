Wow. Wow. Wow. My hubby and I had the day off from work together and decided to go out for breakfast. He wanted to go somewhere we had been a few times and I suggested we try something new -- Nana's. Boy am I glad we did!! I had the Huevos Rancheros, my husband had the Nandict. Unreal, both dishes. Delicious, unexpected and I left "pleasantly full." I have to admit that knowing the items are locally sourced/organic was 99% why we went there but we were both blown away. Great restaurant and we will be back for sure!
