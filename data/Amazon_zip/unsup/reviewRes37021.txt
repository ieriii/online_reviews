This review if for the Cafe - this place has unfortunately gone way down hill. Employees seem depressed and unmotivated. Multiple people were standing waiting to order at the counter but no employee bothered to mention that they needed to go down to the register. The $10 turkey, Brie, and cranberry sandwich came out quickly but with dry bread, limited cranberry an a slice of Brie so thin it could hardly be tasted. Basically I got a dry turkey sandwich in bad bread. Chips look home made but taste days old. Very disappointing all around.
