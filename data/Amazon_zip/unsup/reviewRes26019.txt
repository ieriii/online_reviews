This is the kind of place you want to take everyone who visits you from out of town and recommend to everyone you know. I went here for lunch during Restaurant Week and it was still THAT good. I wish I could afford to go back for dinner one night because I'm sure that would be even more mind-blowingly amazing. The scallops I had could not have been more perfectly cooked or displayed. i tried my friends' meals too and each plate seemed better than the one before. Everything about the meal was delicious and beautiful! Even though it was lunch I found a way to try their wonderful white sangria too and I'd highly recommend it. Can't wait to go back. In fact just writing this reminds me to start saving up for it...
