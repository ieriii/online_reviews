I'm not a huge hot dog fan but had to try Hot Doug's after all the hype and reviews. The line wrapped around the corner at 10am on a Saturday morning well before opening at 10:30am.  Unfortunately our group arrived in waves and was split up - the 2 of us who went first got after ~ 50 minutes waiting.  Owner Doug Sohn was as friendly as can be and took our order at the counter - we had the duck dog with foie gras, truffle aioli (very rich and decadent), the spicy keira knightley dog, grilled with everything on top Chicago style (i.e. pickle, tomatoes, caramelized onions), and the duck fat fries. While the dogs were very good, the fries were cold and floppy - they looked like they had been hard fried and crispy at some point, but more like 30 minutes ago.  Fries portions are definitely huge and enough for 2+. The rest of the group apparently liked the alligator and antelope dogs - huge creative points to the owner for redefining the simple hot dog.
