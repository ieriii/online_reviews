It was the weekend of my 21st birthday, and my girlfriend and I were entertaining a few of my friends from Iowa. The five of us were originally going to head to the Chicago Pizza Bowl & Grinder Co., but when faced with an hour-plus wait, we decided to hoof it down Clark st. until we found something. We bickered about each and every place we passed, and I made the decision that we should eat at the next place we find, no exceptions. Luckily, the next place happened to be The Pasta Bowl. Most of the dishes on the menu seemed pretty simple, and I settled on penne with a bologinase sauce, and bruchetta to start. I was more than satisfied with my food, and my companions seemed to agree. They have a decent beer selection, and all things considered, it wasn't the worst place we could have stumbled in to. I'd go back if I found myself in the neighborhood again.
