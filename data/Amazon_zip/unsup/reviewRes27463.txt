Authentic. Authentic. Authentic. While you watch an old timer suck the marrow out of his bones in his menudo, listen to the fast Spanish conversations around you and nibble on pickled jalapenos, you'll feel as though you've crossed the border. Food is good and cheap. Lunch with a steak marinated in red chile sauce, a side of chunky, lard filled beans and a to-die-for slab of fried queso panela with fresh, hot tortillas ran just $5. If you have room, be sure to stop next door for a slice of super rich tres leches cake before you go home and collapse in refried nirvana.
