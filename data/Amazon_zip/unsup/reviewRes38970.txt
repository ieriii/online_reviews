Worth all the hype. I took my brother and sister in law who were visiting from San Diego and had heard about this place. We arrived late on a Sunday night and were pleased that there was no wait! We started with 4 different cocktails and all four were refreshing and had a good kick. Then we ordered a variety of small plates, my favorite of which was the buffalo sweetbread. The suckling pig was also well done.  For dessert, the coconut fritters were outstanding and the sweet corn churros were also good. The only gripe I had was the steep $25 corkage fee; I think that if the party spent some money on liquor- which was the case for our group- that fee should've been waived. All in all a great experience but I was spoiled by the no wait that I'm not sure if I can tolerate the hour- if not longer- wait.
