I like this place a lot. Went there for the first time on Saturday after hearing from friends how great it is. We had reservations and were promptly seated...the place was packed. I absolutely love the menu, as well as the boards with the fish specials. It was a tough choice, as there were so many delicious-sounding preparations, as well as many recommendations from friends we were with. We all ordered clam chowder, BF and I both ordered the halibut, friends ordered walleye (the one with the pretzel crust) and I forget what else. The service was very good...pleasant and efficient. The beer menu is good and none of us ever had an empty glass. The soup came out, and although it was delicious, it was not really hot....bummer. It was barely warm. This is really the only reason I'm not giving 5 stars, everything else was absolutely perfect. The halibut was nicely presented and came with an OMG GOOD horseradish/blue cheese sauce, also with asparagus and roasted potatoes. Friend's walleye was also very good. I wish I had room left for some Hoosier Mama pie, but alas, I did not. Man, I wish I lived closer to this place. I would be there all the time. I really look forward to going back again! Thanks, Glenn's Diner, for a great dinner and a fun experience!
