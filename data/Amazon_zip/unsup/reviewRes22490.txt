not a big fan of chinese food but this was really tasty! the spicy cabbage they start you with was really delicious but burned my mouth! i couldn't stop eating it and then cursing myself fo rcontinuing to set my mouth on fire!! hahaha.  everyone recommends hte dry chili chicken which i agree is pretty good (beware, when it arrives to your table it looks like someone accidentally spilled a whole jar of red pepper chili flakes on the dish) but it's really not that spicy.  the star of the evening was the yu shiang pork- really delicious!! it's also on the recommended dishes at the front of hte menu.  a bunch of people got hot pots which we will definitely be back to try- can't wait!! go here.
