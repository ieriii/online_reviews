One of the best pizza I have ever had in my entire life!!! Ok so I hadn't had anything to eat for about 7 hrs prior to, but still - THE BEST! Went with a group of friends after work on a Friday so there was quite a wait, but understandable since it IS a Friday night. The pizza is thin crust and although prices are decent, the toppings are up to $2 each. I shared a large italian sausage and jalapeno pizza with a friend and it was more than enough for the both of us - even had leftovers to bring home. :)  I highly recommend Piece for those pizza lovers out there.  Service was great as well. Just a note, reservations are not allowed for groups under 10 people.
