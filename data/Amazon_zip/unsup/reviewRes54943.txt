Bucktown is lucky to have such an accomplished cafe, that-- for some reason-- has yet to garner big crowds. On the surface, Bonsoiree looks the part of a quiet, neighborhood joint; a place to hang out, grab coffee, and maybe write email. But behind the casual facade, is a seriously talented team of chefs, who kick out a thoughtful and fresh range of flavors.Though I've eaten brunch and dinner at Bonsoiree, I've become a brunch regular and, like another yelp reviewer, have developed a bit of an addiction to the truffle omelette. It's fantastic; perfectly prepared every time I've ordered it. And the manchego hash browns are an excellent combo for the smoky, earthy wedge of truffle heaven beside them. I've also had the grand marnier french toast, and it was stellar, as well. What about the coffe? Some cafes are content offering Intelligentsia brews. Fine. It's decent stuff. But it's not nearly as good as the Italian beans Kurt and Shin grind. Four cups of Intelligentsia and I start sweating like Jeremy Piven on speed...the Bonsoiree coffee is much smoother, less acidic, and well balanced. My wife and I live in the S. Loop, and though there are a few spots to find a nice brunch (Bongo Room, Cuatro, Giocco), none compares to Bonsoiree. When the place gets its close-up on Check Please, it will be farewell to the quiet, no wait walk-in brunches and dinners, but a well deserved bow for Shin and Kurt. Bravo guys! PS. The back patio will be opening up soon (when we breach 40 degrees again) -- which will add a lot more capacity.
