I live within a couple of blocks and this has become my preferred walk-to burger place. The beef patties themselves are the best I have ever had and really seem to be noticeably better than average. This is something I really didn't think possible but I have had the same reaction each time I have been there.  Beer selection is extensive and includes some Half Acre (brewery is across the street). Reflecting on what another review pointed out, seating on the tables in the bar is uncomfortable but the regular tables in the back are fine.
