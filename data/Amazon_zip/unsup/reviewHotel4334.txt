A very nice older hotel on the south side of the loop, the Palmer House Hilton is a stunner when you walk in. The rooms have recently been updated and the decor is tasteful and appropriately retro-esque. NOTE TO FAMILIES: These are nice, big rooms! If you get a double double, you can also fit both a rollaway AND crib in there - no problem. Looks like there are lots of adjoining rooms available also (yay for older hotels!). Bathrooms are not as big as the bedrooms in terms of scale, but nice. WI-FI is not free! This is pretty ridiculous in my book. I think it's $8 per day. PARKING overnight through valet is a whopping $61!!! Do yourself a favor and park at one of the many lots surrounding the hotel. You'll save 50%. KUDOS to the housekeeping staff. They kept our room beautifully. (Tips do help) Big bonus: forgot a necklace in my room when we checked out. Went back two hours later and the maid had turned it in. We've had things stolen at other hotels, both after check out (only to turn right around and stuff has "vanished") and during stays - so THANK YOU to the woman who cleaned our room. You clinched the fifth star of this stay!!
