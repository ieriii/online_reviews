Went to this place with the girlfriend a few nights ago on a Thursday.The food was absolutely delicious. All sorts of Romanian dishes, the borsch was really good. Really really good. They didn't overdo the whole dracula thing, it only came up as one of their wines, which was pretty good actually.It's a smaller place, but open and nice. The live music and candles made this perfect for a date, but the music wasn't so loud that you couldn't carry on a conversation. At one point one of the other guests went up to sing with the guys. At first I thought, oh no this is going going to be awkward. She turned out to pretty good. The owner is nice, a bit eccentric, he seems to throw in some italian and french when he talks to people. And he pays attention to every table but not too pushy. He came up to us and offered us a romanian drink/shooter after our meal, it tasted like plums, very good (digestif?) You can do a three course thing for 25 dollars if you don't go on the weekend. All in all I really recommend it if you want a nice atmosphere and want to try something new, we had a wonderful night.
