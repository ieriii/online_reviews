Did you know? Yolk has new twists on egg benedict.. Like chorizo, florentine, etc. Best breakfast in the city. The ambiance is really nice. Its just your neighborhood bfast bar with great food. Yes, the wait is always long on the weekend, but its def worth it. Why else do you think ppl still stick around for an hour? Theyre no ordinary eggs benny. I would def rec getting a cup of strawberry orange juice as its the best ive ever had. Its my favorite.
