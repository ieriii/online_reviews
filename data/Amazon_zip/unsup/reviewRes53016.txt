Was going to grab a Chicago dog b-4 we left for a Phish show, just to get something in the stomach before we partied all night, but a friend suggested this place just three blocks from his house. After eating some carry-out, I can see why he steered me away from the hot dogs... The menu is full of all things Cuban and is very well priced. Ordered up 2 empanadas, yuca frita, and some fried sweet plantains, or Maduros. The goat cheese and chorizo empanadas, were enough to fill me up, but I am sure glad I got a taste of the sweet plantains. Everything we ordered was Delicious and only came to around $10. I would not only recommend this place, I will most likely stop there again, whether I am in the neighborhood or not. Diggity
