This restaurant actually borders on 5 stars, and although the wait can be prohibitive, it is well worth it. The roast pork in banana leaf is absolutely excellent and was perfectly done. It loses a star because the appetizer was somewhat lukewarm, although it did not detract from the overall flavor of the dish. It was an extremely creative menu and a restaurant always gains points in my opinion for having such creativity and pulling it off successfully.  The ingredients of each of the dishes that I had were perfectly counterpointed with each other, and the overall balance of flavors was excellent.
