I don't expect to stand out in a clutter of 4 and 5 star reviews, so I'll make it brief. This place is the hot dog - correction 'Superdawg.' It is everything that embodies Americana and a bygone era. I'd say Superdawg ranks right up there with the most important institutions of our day... And having your Superdawg served to you securely nestled in a bed of Super Fries is the proverbial icing on the cake... I mean Dawg.
