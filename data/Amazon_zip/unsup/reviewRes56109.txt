How could anyone rate this place below a 4 star review? You MUST not be human! This is the best junk food on earth. It simply doesn't get any better. If you are looking for fine dining this is not the place to go. I think the name Superdawg and walk up/curb service is a give-away that it's not fancy. If you're looking for a burger or hot dog that tastes like another down the street you'd be in the wrong place. Superdawg food has a taste that is all to it's own. It is absolutely wonderful food, decent service, and a good price. I wish I could give it more stars.
