I thought this place was really good. At first I wasn't sure what to expect, the neighborhood isn't great and its sort of in the middle of nowhere (at least what I'm used to) but in the end it turned out to be a money spot. Once you sit down they bring you delicious chips to start your meal. This is always a plus for me, as I am usually starving by the time I actually end up eating dinner. The service was above average and the wait time for the food wasn't to bad. The burger I ordered was cooked very well and the merks cheese just added to its greatness. The specials of the day were solid and it seemed as if they had a good deal every day.The only complaint I had was the music was blaring. And not just any music, heavy metal music was ripping the artwork of the walls. If thats the kind of thing you like, more power to you, but thats not what I want to head when I sit down for my dinner. Aside from that though, the food was really good and my overall experience was a good one. I will def go back again some time, maybe when I am a more festive rock out with my C**K our attitude.
