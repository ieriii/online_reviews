Of course I love this place! Three Words: Duck Fat Fries! I didn't give this place 5 stars because it's impossible to get into!!!! The owner is cool as hell, but the space is rather small and he makes his own hours. It's in such high demand, you might stand there all morning and never make it in! That's it...if it were in less demand, it would get 5 stars, haha.
