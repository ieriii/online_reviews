i am not sure this place could get any better.... their bus bench ads don't lie - they DO have the BEST falafel in the city! and the -spicy- sauce is just hot enough but not too hot. and it's insanely inexpensive and filling and what is especially nice is somehow they prepare it just right so every bite has every ingredient.... the inside is cozy and comfortable, but lends itself to speedy deli style service. the salad bar is out of this world. you will LAUGH the next time you wander over to dominicks view their selection in comparison... feta, grilled chicken, olives, oh my! and, that little box of sweet treats on the counter that will tempt you the next time you wait for your perfect falafel...? go for it! if you like honey, pistachios, and philo, this is a must! great to share, if you're not feeling like a lil piggie (i currently am eyeing mine wondering if i open it up to coworkers, or hide it in my drawer....) decisions, decisions.....
