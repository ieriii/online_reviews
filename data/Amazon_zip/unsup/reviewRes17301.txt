This is my #1 Go-To restaurant when I want to impress someone from out of town. This is a must see, must eat. As visually stimulating as this place is, the food is even better. This place was my first night out on the town when I moved here, and I have to say, we picked a great start! The wait staff was extremely knowledgable and very helpful when picking out my drinks and meal. Each order is an adventure. We did appetizers, entrees and dessert. While I have no idea where I found the room to put it all (portions are normal to generous), I'm glad I took the time, and prepared my self for a more pricey meal. Few rival the experience had that first night, and each guest I have taken there has felt the same about their experiences. Make reservations!!!!! Even with reservations, many times you will find yourself waiting longer, so be prepared to sit in the bar area and relax with the company you go with. As long as you know the wait is normal and prepare for it, I'm sure you will have a great time!
