I first fell in love with Sultan's when I moved to the city almost two years ago. Their food trumps all other "cheap" food options in the city. Not only is it cheap, it is relatively healthy and doesn't leave one feeling gross after eating it. Unfortunately, they HAVE raised their prices, but I still think that it is worth the extra dollar for good falafel and Jerusalem salad. The priciest part of the experience would definitely be the drinks.  All in all, I have a strong relationship with Sultan's and it's going strong after almost two years. That says something about a place.
