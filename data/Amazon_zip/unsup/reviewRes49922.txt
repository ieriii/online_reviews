The Entrana was very good, and the Carne Asada was OK. The Mojitos were stupid expensive, so drink elsewhere after. Everything on the menu was pretty pricey. The steaks came with half a potato, yuca, and plaintain. As much as I love potatoes, the potato was disappointing because it was dry and I had nothing to put on it to make it have more flavor. The Empanadas were fairly good. They boast of their coffee, so maybe I'll come back sometime for just coffee and empanadas.
