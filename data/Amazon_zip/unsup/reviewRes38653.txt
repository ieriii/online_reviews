My favorite pizza joing in all of the US! "Chicago Style" pizza varies from place to place here so it's a matter of taste which one you like best but for me this is the place. Wait time? People complain but lets face it it's not an hour because they are turning out regular pies you can get anywhere. Order and then sit at the bar and enjoy people watching. If you're in a rush don't bother. Food - "GREAT" I prefer the cheese because w/ to many toppings they tend to get greasy/soggy. I imagine that's the problem w/ being baked in to much cheese. As far as locals not eating here thats BS. This one happens to be located in a tourist heavy area so there are a lot of first timers/out of towners here but the location is close to hotels when visiting so I prefer this one. Overall if you havnt tried it do so. If you have and don't like it there are plenty of other joints to try.
