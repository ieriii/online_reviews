I was compelled to write a review because of a not-great experience I had at a different restaurant. Having one review under my belt, I thought that I would write a review of my favorite restaurant as I did not want to appear to be a crankasaurus rex. It did not take a second's pause for me to write a review on Opart Thai. I often go to this BYOB with my girlfriend and a bottle of wine. I like to over-order here so I can have leftovers and still not feel the pressure when the bill arrives. My perfect meal at Opart: Start with the Tiger Cry beef appetizer, which is chunks of charbroiled, marinated steak with a little sauce on the side. For the soup, we always order the tom ka kai, a milky, coconut soup with chicken, thai red chili and lemongrass. This one holds all these distinct flavors in one bite that, when combined, creates a rich warmth. My favorite noodle dish here is the pad see eiw, broad rice noodles with chinese broccoli. And if I am feeling it, I order the panang curry with tofu. I love love love this place. The wait staff seems sweet, and I always feel like I got away with something when the bill arrives.
