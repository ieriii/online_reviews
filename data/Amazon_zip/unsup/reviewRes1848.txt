If there is a heaven, it would be just like Hot Doug's. Hot Doug's has taken the Chicago hot dog joint to soaring new heights. They do it by serving incredibly inventive, and unbelievably delicious, specialty sausages. Example: duck sausage with foie gras butter and morbier cheese. Drooling yet? Yeah, I thought so. Oh, but there's more. Their "regular" hot dogs are the best around. Their duck fat fries (served only on Friday and Saturday) have probably converted thousands of vegetarians. Throw cheese on those bad boys and you'll be spending the rest of the afternoon on the couch in a beautiful greasy coma. The only negatives are that it is barely open (lunchtime), is not exactly conveniently located, and is too popular for its own good. Lines on the weekends can be daunting. But don't be deterred. Grab a newspaper and wait. You'll thank me later.
