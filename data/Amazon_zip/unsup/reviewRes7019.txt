I saw this place on Chicagos Best and was able to get a Living Social Coupon so I took advantage and they did not disappoint! Awesome food! Awesome staff! I had my birthday dinner here and they reserved a nice table for us..The place had a nice decor..romantic and comfortable..Large display of wines..The Owner/Chef was there and he was so delightful! The presentation of the food and the flavor were just right! Everything was fresh... A few people got the Zuppa Di Pesce which is a seafood mix over linguini and the seafood was fresh! Nothing was "gummy" or oversalted...We are usually picky with seafood because its something you have to cook right..its not as easy as chicken or beef..it has to be fresh and prepared well! Im sure you know what I mean...One of my friends had the New Zealand Lamb Chops and they also enjoyed their meal. The Insalata Mista and Caprese Salad were light and crisp! Also, the portions were generous..I dont have anything bad to say about Sapori... I am definitely going back and definitely one of my new fave Italian spots! Good for groups, but call ahead..
