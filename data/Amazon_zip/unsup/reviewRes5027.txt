Had to give this place a try while in Chicago with all I had heard and read about it. Very interesting menu. Small tapas style. Packed house on a Monday night. We tried the pig's tail braised in balsamic, pig's ear with krispy kale, milk braised pork shoulder, chorizo stuffed olives, and salt-roasted beets w/ goat cheese. Overall, the dishes were very unique from anything I've tried before. I have to say, however, that they were on the saltier side. The white wine that was suggested to us by our server paired nicely with the saltiness of the dishes. All of my friends and I agreed that the beets were delicious. I personally enjoyed the pork shoulder. The meat fell off the bone and the mashed potatoes were very creamy. I would definitely recommend this place to someone travelling to Chicago.
