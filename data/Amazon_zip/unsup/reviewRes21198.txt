Mayan Palace is another in the moderately long line of mexican restaurants in LP/Lakeview that serve relatively similar food and offer unlimited chips and salsa on the table that will inevitably cause you to overeat before your food comes and feel distressingly ill after you stuff yourself full of tacos or fajitas or burritos or enchiladas or (insert meat rice beans and cheese into tortilla shell here). However, Mayan Palace is also a step above some of the sketchier restaurants in this area (taco burrito palace #2, la bamba) in that it doesn't make me wonder if I might be getting sick after my meal. The margaritas are tasty and half price on Tuesdays and Thursdays which is really the biggest selling point for me. Finally there's a nice big back room and a little outdoor seating area behind it which is great in the Summer. If you are looking for a decent mexican meal in this area, Mayan Palace narrowly beats out most of the other competition.
