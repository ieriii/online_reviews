Very friendly staff, nice space in which to relax after work but the food is pretty middle-of-the-road. I heard raves about the Mac-n-Cheese but the serving I had was oily (the cheese separated) and otherwise dry. The food my companions had was okay, nothing spectacular and typical pub fare. It's worth a try I guess but I wouldn't make much of an effort to back.
