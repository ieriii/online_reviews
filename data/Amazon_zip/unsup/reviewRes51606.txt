Not great but not bad. The first time I went I had the chicken tacos and they really hit the spot. I can't say they were the best tacos ever and you should stop what your doing and go get them but they were good. Now their beans are a different story. Go, go now and get some with rice. I will wait...... Did you get them? Aren't they fantastic? I don't know why either. Maybe they are the same as everywhere else and I've been going to the wrong places, but their refried beans are so very tasty . They aren't a watered down grey mush and have a lot of flavor. Now the reason I am not giving Garcias four or more stars. The second time I went it was for dinner and I ordered the enchiladas mole. Not good. Not good at all. It was a hardened cheese flour sack covered in this thick goo that I can only assume was their mole sauce. I don't know if I got the bottom scrapes of the mole pot or what, but it was off. Of course, I devoured the beans that were on the side and drank a few too many margaritas. I wouldn't dismiss Garcias, but I wouldn't order anything with mole. Stick with the basics since they are cheap and load up on the drinks and beans.
