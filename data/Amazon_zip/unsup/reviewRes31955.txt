I will definitely visit Demera again! I never knew Ethiopian food could taste so good, exotic, and ethnic, lol. We did not have a reservation, but we were able to get bar seats. The service and the women were both beautiful. I had the kik alicha (split peas), gomen (collard greens), and salad with my ye-doro tibs (chicken breast). I felt as if I were in entirely different world. Each bite was better took my taste buds to a different level. I am a very picky eater, so if I like---it's a winner, lol.
