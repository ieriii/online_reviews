I don't understand some of the bad reviews of this place. Slow service? It's an ambiance-filled, slightly upscale Italian restaurant. Why can't you sit and enjoy your meal? Because let me tell you, you will enjoy your meal here. I've never had a bad meal, no matter if I'm there with two or six; on Valentine's Day or a random Tuesday. The portions are huge, but they don't skimp on anything. You do sometimes have to ask about the specials, but what's not to like about a place that's BYOB, gives you garlic and red pepper flakes to go with your olive oil for the bread and has such a fantastic assortment of dishes that you can't choose a wrong thing? The place is not noisy, even when it's crowded. On my birthday a couple of years ago, they let us bring in a cake. And sliced it for us. They'll make special orders happily. Just go. No wait, don't, I want to know I can get a table.
