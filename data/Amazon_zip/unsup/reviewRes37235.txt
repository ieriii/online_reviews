I'm going to have to go with 5. I was so very happy and satisfied walking out of Hopleaf this past weekend. I think I loved it more than I otherwise would have because we went in very early and didn't have to wait 3 hours to sit down. This was my third attempt to eat at Hopleaf and both previous times I gave up and left. So here's what I had that made this trip so great, aside from a table: De Koninck beer - Which I later saw on the menu at Fat Cat which makes me hopeful that I'll now notice it around more often. CB&J - Holy amazing. I WILL recreate this at home, somehow. Mussels in a Thai curry sauce - Slurp-worthy.
