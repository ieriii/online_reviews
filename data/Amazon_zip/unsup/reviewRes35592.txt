Came here after work and convinced my coworkers that they needed sushi and seafood as much as I did. Ordered a bunch of random stuff. Nothing too fancy or spectacular. Everything was decent. The crowd was chill but still a little fancy (just a little). Got the crab spring rolls and they were delish. They had a little bit of salt on them and they were bursting with crabmeat that just made the rolls perfection. Yum. Everything else was decent.
