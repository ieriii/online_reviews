Recommended to us by a friend, this was truly legit Italian. Our waiter was very nice, but his Italian accent was so thick I think I only got half of what he said (just the important parts- "sea bass..xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.......prosciutto..") A little pricey, but reasonable for the relatively generous portions and very unique dishes. Chickpea flour fries: Tastes very similar to polenta fries (such as those at Quartino's), but less dense and grainy. Braised oxtail: Tastes like the braised Chinese-style oxtail that I grew up with. Tender, moist, and a hearty appetizer to get you started on your way to that wild boar. Wild boar Ragu Tagliatelle: Yummmm. Comfort food at its best, even if I'm too unrefined to taste the difference between boar and pork. If I grew up with this stuff, I would be probably be twice as strong and twice as happy. Roasted parsnip and chopped black truffle stuffed pasta: Pretty much a ravioli, the parsnip filling is fairly mediocre, but the black truffle taste and fragrance is extremely strong. Very good considering the price of black truffle oil versus the price of the dish, but can be a little overpowering at times. Fruitti de Mare Spaghetti: Very straightforward sauce + generous helping of shellfish, which is always a favorite. The best part of this dish? The black spaghetti, which has a different texture than the usual and is a famously uncommon dish in the states. My favorite fruitti de mare pasta, however, is still the gigantic frutti de mare from Giacomo's in Boston, obviously a better place for seafood than the Midwest.
