Went here the other night and got a Margarita and a Chimichanga. The item I picked might not be one of their signature dish but the person I went with got the combo plate and had basically the same comments. The food here was pretty bland. The food wasn't undelicious, it just wasn't delicious. There's atleast two other Mexican restaurants within a two block radius that have better food and selection and are in the same price range. The margaritas were good. Basically as the two stars imply "meh".
