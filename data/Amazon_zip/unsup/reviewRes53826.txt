I normally don't like hot dogs as much, find nothing special about them and quite frankly, kinda boring. Hot Doug's makes them special and definitely not boring!!! The specials are just a feast, a dish that transcends the usual definition of a hot dog.Trust Doug on the toppings, he knows what he's doing, blue cheese and honey on a wild boar sausage was a divine combination. My wife decided to go with the usuals on her duck sausage despite Doug's quizzical looks and quite frankly, the mustard, ketchup and relish kinda overpowered the taste.The duck fat fries are as good as they are famous, but not just as heavenly as I thought they would be, given what happened to the hot dog. Still the best fries I ever had.
