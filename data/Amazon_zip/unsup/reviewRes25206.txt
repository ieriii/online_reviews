Pros: - Romantic, cozy atmosphere - Fresh meat and veggies - Dinner comes with cheese fondue appetizer, your choice of meat, and chocolate fondue dessert. Lots of food =P. - Wonderful service - Live music Cons: - Expensive ($50+ per person) - Tooo cozy and small - Dependig on your table, hard to see if meat is cooked Overall, definitely a great experience.
