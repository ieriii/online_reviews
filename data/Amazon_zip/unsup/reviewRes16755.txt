So lively! So entertaining! So Delicious! This place is really a carnivale. With it's brightly colored lights, high ceilings, and crazy looking characters/waiters, this place is much more than just a bite. I was happy when a coworker brought me here. It was quite an experience. I ordered the NY Strip and Manchengo Cheese Fries. 2 of my favorite foods combo'd? How can I resist? I must admit, his steak was much more tender and tasty than mine, but my stack of fries was unbeatable. We also shared the 5 taster of ceviche, all of which was delicious.. This place is another great stop in Chi Town. Thanks Joe M.!!
