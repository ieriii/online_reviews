Stay away! Then I will definitely get a seat. I've been here twice, yesterday and last Thursday. Being a first timer, I felt I had to redo it all over again now that I know the etiquette.  No cell phone use inside lounge. Oops! Proper attire requested. (I got all dressed up yesterday and felt part of the flow!) There is something totally romantic about this place. It's the lighting, the music, even how the bartenders carry themselves. It's hidden and definitely meant to captivate a classical sense of just awe and splendor. I love that you can get loss with your thoughts, staring at the magical chandelier, the high ceilings, looking at the bar that you may find somewhere in Paris but it's in Chicago. Swanky & posh to describe this place. I am absolutely smitten! Favorite libations: Thumb in a Pie and Thick as Thieves If you don't like long lines, don't go after dinner. You will be standing for awhile. It certainly, gets crowded....which leaves me to get a seat.
