Very nice lobby and lounge area amenities. Rooms are in good shape but overall are not that great - I hate that there is not a real closet but rather a rack with a curtain in front of it. While it is attached to the convention center it is still a hike. Also, the SHOR restaurant, Forno quick food and M/X bar are all good. I was especially pleased with the pannini at Forno. The best thing about this place? I dropped my Tiffany bracelet down the drain at 2am and the plumber came right away and looked for close to an hour for it - he found it and I appreciate him trying so hard...
