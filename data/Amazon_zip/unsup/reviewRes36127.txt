Their duck is where it's at! No where else have I tasted any BBQ duck better than at Sun Wah's. This place may look homely, but the main attraction here is the duck. I have been ordering BBQ duck here for almost my entire life. Never ever have I gotten sick of these delicious BBQ pieces of heaven. The only other thing I have tried here was their Singapore noodles. They are AMAZING! When I first tried them, I was hooked. The best BBQ duck, the best singapore noodles. Wow, I'm ashamed of myself for not eating here more often, or at least trying something other than the BBQ duck or the singapore noodles. But you can't go wrong with what you love right?
