omg i love hot doug's. i think i have eaten here 5 or 6 times now and continue to go back for more. (i think we're going back on saturday and i am getting hungry just thinking about it.) i have to say, i've never gotten a regular hot dog here; i always go with my fiance and we split three of the specials and we have never been disappointed. they have all been amazingly delicious, even the ones i thought i wouldn't like. the variety is just incredible; where else can you eat a hot dog made out of antelope, buffalo, venison and elk as well as a duck sausage covered with foie gras and truffle aioli? i am notorious for my hatred of lines and my refusal to wait more than 10 minutes or so for just about anything. i don't mind waiting for hot doug's because it is THAT GOOD. (if you can go early on a non-duck fat weekday, you will have a shorter wait, but in my opinion it is worth it to try the duck fat fries at least once!) the line also helps ensure that you will get a seat once inside the restaurant, where you can feast upon your tubes of meaty deliciousness at your leisure. also, doug himself has taken our order every time we've eaten here, and he is a friendly and personable guy! so there is really no reason not to pay hot doug's a visit. just go already!
