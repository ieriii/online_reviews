Checked this place out during restaurant week last month. The place is really huge, you can see it from the highway if you look up at the overpass. The mojitos are really good and taste authentic. This place would be really great for a group but not for a first date..too busy and loud. The special menu consisted of a few options but the appetizers off the regular menu were really good, including the cheese platters. Dessert was really good but we were too full to eat it and took it home. Parking was available on the street like most of the city.
