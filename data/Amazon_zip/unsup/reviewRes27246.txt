Sigh. One week after my meal at Graham Elliot, I finally figured out why chicken now bores me. Because I had already eaten the best chicken of my life and nothing would compare. My friend and I happily took on the tasting menu, complete with wine pairing (and they kindly substituted chicken for lamb for us - EPIC WIN). After our tasty cocktail and the truffle butter, pepper, parmesan popcorn (that I wanted to take home, since I resisted eating all of its delicious goodness, knowing more was to come,) we were settled in and happy and ready to be impressed. Which. We. Were. We signed up for five courses, but with the surprise bites, we had nine! The courses were named: popcorn, caviar, Caesar (brioche twinkie? Yes, please!), onion (delicious, delicious soup), canap (who knew pineapple could even taste like that??), skate (yum), chicken (BEST EVER), intermezzo and chocolate. We were sated and pleasantly full, but not that unpleasant stuffed feeling that sometimes follows a tasting menu. I was willing to give it a "one of the top 5 meals of my life" rating without even thinking about it. My friend was only slightly more cynical, giving it one of the top 7. And our gracious, kind, thoughtful server, Mitch. Sigh again. I want Mitch to take care of my every need at every meal. What a pleasure to be served by him. He should teach classes. Bravo, Graham. What a lovely and delicious evening.
