We had a great experience here, after we got over the awkwardness of sitting at a long communal table. It's also pretty loud in here, so definitely not a place to go if noise bothers you. We didn't mind though, and actually the place has a very European feel to it. We shared all the dishes (they encourage this) and started with the selection of 3 aged hams. Delicious! We could have each eaten a whole other plate of those. We then had the celery salad w/tuna, which was very fresh. Our main dish was the Potee, which had the boar's shoulder, a type of sausage (can't remember!) and the pork tenderloin. This was all wonderful and again, we could have eaten more! We finished the night with the chocolate carrot cake (out of curiosity). After getting past the initial non-sweetness, we actually really liked this take on carrot cake and the chocolate gelato that came with it was yummy. I highly recommend you check it out!
