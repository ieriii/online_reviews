Whenever I go here I get the tasty iced coffee for $2. It's way better and cheaper than Starbucks down the street. They also have good pastries for the price and the staff is always friendly. I also really enjoy the unique fact the the sitting area is next door. It's great to go their and read a book in a comfy chair without the usual cafe clatter.
