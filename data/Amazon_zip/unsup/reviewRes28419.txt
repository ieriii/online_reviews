I went there for the first time and was impressed. They seated us very quickly (we got there before the lunch rush on Sunday). They place seems rather cramped (up front, the back not so much). They take cash only, but do have an ATM machine. They served us the chips and salsa as well as an appetizer. (The appetizer was excellent!) They replenished the chips after we ate our first basket which was a nice surprise. We were served rather quickly. We got tacos, a burrito, and sides of rice and beans. The menu wasn't really descriptive as to what was included with each item. The burrito came with side of rice, but didn't state that on the menu. The waitress didn't really pay us much attention at first, but proved to be a good waitress. She even brought cups with lids and straws for my daughters. She also split our sides up together so that both side plates had rice and beans (instead of a plate of each) The food was good, except the bean. By far the worst I've had in Chicago. They were definitely canned and tasted like they had been cooked in old, burned oil. Gross! The agua de horchata was good, but not as good (in my opinion) as El Chisme. (I love horchata) Also, we were seated in the middle in the front section which turned out to be rather uncomfortable. A big group came in right after us and had to wait to be seated. Unfortunately that meant that they were standing right behind me while I was eating. So close that I could hardly sit comfortably away from my table. There were a couple kids just staring at us while we ate. I suggest requesting the back or left side up front. Overall, I'll go back. But I definitely will not get the beans.
