Best brunch I've ever had. Really good bloody mary with an IPA back. Scone was delicious. The pork scramble was unreal great. Lady friend got the red wine poached eggs, which was so good I wish I didn't get what I got. Which is saying something since it contained pig. Little secret, we showed up and they offered a seat at the bar. All they said was the seat was away from others at the bar. Little did we know it was the best seat in the house. 2 seats, separated from others at the bar, directly facing the kitchen. To say I was entertained was an understatement. Makes Benihana's show look boring.
