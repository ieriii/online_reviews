Not being a fan of food thats not in the range of spicy to crazy-spicy, I've always considered pasta dishes too bland for me to enjoy. Being vegetarian also narrows the options to marinara and such. And then I landed up at Calo once I moved into the neighborhood. Since then, this has become my go-to spot for anything Italian and for Saturday nights with friends.. Good wine, good food, huge portions, great service and wonderful ambience (you even get to pick which room you sit in - the lovely dining area or the booth/bar scene with the TVs). This one sure is a keeper :)
