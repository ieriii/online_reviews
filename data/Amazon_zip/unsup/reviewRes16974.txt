This place seems to be the place to be for single ladies and men of course. On a Friday night the place was indeed was busy and swarming with women hanging around the bar and scoping the perimeter. Anyways, after about 20 minutes of waiting even though we had reservations ( to be fair we made it online 10 minutes before going there) we were escorted to the tiniest table that I have ever seen in my life right by the stairs. Few minutes later our waiter came and described the menu which was not very impressive. Anyways, the food is not that great or what people hype it up to be. The drinks are delicious and the guacamole is not good at all. Chipotle make a much better guacamole and much cheaper too. However, if you are going there to have a good time with few friends or if you are single then I recommend it. If you are going for the food then there are much better places out there.
