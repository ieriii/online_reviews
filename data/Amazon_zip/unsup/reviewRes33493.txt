I've been craving Middle Eastern like mad lately, so on our way back home to Logan Square, we made a pit stop on North Ave. I've meant to come here for years, and have walked by a million times, but this is my first visit. I was a little bit in awe of the salad bar. Any salad bar that is awesomely veggie friendly is a salad bar I can get behind. So, even before I ordered my falafel, I made a little salad bar takeout for dinner that evening. I didn't want to go nuts, so I just grabbed a couple dolmas and a few different vegetables. And then, I did go a little nuts and order up some baba ghanouj (also for dinner, and mmmm...I do love a good baba!) Falafel was cheap and tasty and made spicy to order. Service was rushed and less than friendly, but really...who cares? I wasn't looking for a fine dining experience. The prices and the selection of salad bar, soups and sandwiches will definitely have me return to experience more.
