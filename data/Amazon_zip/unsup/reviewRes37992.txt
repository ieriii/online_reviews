I'm gonna make this quick partly because I went here for what I wasn't supposed to. They are known for their stuffed pizza. I ordered the chicken alfredo pasta. It was not good. Perhaps that is my fault because what dumb ass goes to Giordano's and orders pasta? Me? oh okay. However, hubby did order stuffed pizza and said there was wayyyy too much cheese. The ladies restroom was out of service and although everyone was friendly enough, it didn't compare to our experiences at the other restaurants we visited while in Chitown. I saw enough at this place to factually state that next time I visit Chicago Giordano's will not be on my list of "to-visit".
