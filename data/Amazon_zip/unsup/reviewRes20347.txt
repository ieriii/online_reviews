The al pastore torta was good. Not in your typical bread, it was in a baguette which was good, but i think i would've preferred the typical bread grilled or fancified somehow. The churro was good, just not amazing. I expected more from Rick Bayless. The layout and service is really inefficient. Instead of giving you a number when you order like every other place, the host tells you a seat number. If you change your mind on where to sit after you order, you have to go up to the register and tell them exactly where you are sitting. Had to wait too long for the churros.
