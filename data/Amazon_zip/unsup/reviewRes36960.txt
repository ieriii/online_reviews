Saw this place on the food network and was super excited for the brisket. Some friends and I were out in Andersonville one night and I tried to drop in for a beer, but we were told they were closed, even though it was 1:30 and there were plenty of people at the bar. They asked if I knew someone, so...elitist! I came back though to try the brisket. It was pretty good. The fries are very crisp and the garlic mayo is a nice touch. They have an extensive beer list, but were out of the beer I wanted to try. It was OK. Nothing super great, but maybe their dinner menu is better.
