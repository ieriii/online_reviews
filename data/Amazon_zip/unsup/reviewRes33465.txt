Bottom Line Up Front: the Notre Dame football team of Chicago Italian Restaurants. Overrated. My girlfriend brought me here for my birthday this year. My birthday is in June, which happens to coincide with wedding season. Instead of pushing back our reservation because the place was overbooked, the hostess seated us upstairs in a room reserved for a rehearsal dinner. Hey, I had an awesome time because I like to party, but I'm pretty sure the Asian couple who were getting married the next day did not enjoy 4 drunken Irishmen, 2 Krauts and an out of place Indian guy shouting about all of the horrible things that used to happen at their Frat house "back in the day." (I can tell you for sure that the aforementioned gentlemen's dates did not appreciate it one bit.) Aside from the seating arrangement, the service was good. Our server was attentive and not too pushy, he definitely knew his stuff about which wine pairings would be best with certain dishes. The food was pretty ok. I got the Lamb Shank. It was medimum rare served over some potatoes and asparagus. Nothing about the food blew me away. I left full, but not really SATISFIED. The little lady dropped some serious coin on a nice dinner, so I felt bad... I'd suggest Rosebud or Bice downtown if you're looking for a really nice Italian dinner.
