Italian ? True italian ?? YES this is what you get here !!! NO American stile pasta but very good authentic Italian food !! Its really yummy and i liked everything !!!!! The pasta was cooked to perfection and served in a very light nice sauce !!Service was very friendly and fun !Only thing is that is so buzzzzy there that it gets kind of noisy- so nothing for a quiet evening.But other than that: i can only very highly recommend it !!!!
