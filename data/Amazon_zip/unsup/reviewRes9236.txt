Such an elegant restaurant! My date and I thought we were going to sit inside but we were informed there was a balcony. Yes! It was beautiful! Decent view (Of Aldo and Starbucks?) and nice low lighting. Very romantic and intimate. Our appetizer was the chao tom, "grilled shrimp wrapped around sugar cane, with angel-hair noodles, mint, cilantro, & lettuce, with peanut plum dipping sauce.' Apparently, this was a DIY, which didn't impress us. Messy hands are no good on dates. Also, not much food to share and it was almost $10. My entree was superb: ga xao cari, "sauted diced chicken with eggplant, mango, string beans, & cashew nuts in a yellow curry sauce." Somewhat spicy, very flavorful and delicious. Great service and good drinks as well.
