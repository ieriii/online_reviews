I came here because a friend of mine is a head chef at Disney World, and Las Tablas was one of the places he recommended in Chicago. He was absolutely right. I've lived in Chicago for about 4 years and I've been here at least 15 times. It's the some of the best food I have found in Chicago. I read the negative reviews and they all say the same thing. First they say that the service was slow. Well what do you expect from a place that is packed at both of their locations every single weekend? People are going for a reason. The second thing they say is that the food was not that good. Most of those people who wrote that are confusing a Columbian restaurant for some other Hispanic food. One reviewer thought it was Argentinian, and another was actually upset because she is Mexican and Las Tablas didn't have any tortillas for her. Wow. Go here, get some empanadas, an aborrahado, El Matrimonio, and get yourself a fruit juice with milk. You won't be disappointed, as long as you're not an idiot who thinks you're at an Argentinian restaurant.
