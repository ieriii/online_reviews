Ok, Been here twice and love the food. Its a bit pricey for drinks, but the appetizers (what we order) are on point! I have not ordered dinner yet, but enjoy the food immensely. Valet'd the car for $5 and walked in with a RESERVATION!! I would not attempt a weekend visit, cause the crowd is banana's! ropa vieja, empanadas, yuca, ceviche....are a must my GF says! she orders our meal there. and she says its a 4.5 stars if they allowed it.
