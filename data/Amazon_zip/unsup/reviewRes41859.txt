Let's put it this way, Tanks is a place for tourists. It's a Vietnamese restaurant, but Vietnamese people never eat there. I'm not even Viet, but know it's silly to wait for a table at Tank when Uptown is filled with restaurants that are at least 10x better. My white-washed, Asian, ex-gf liked it though.
