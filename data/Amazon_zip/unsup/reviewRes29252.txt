I'd heard good things about the Pasta Bowl for years, but avoided it because every time I passed it and The Other Side it seemed overrun with Lincoln Parkers of the loud, drunk, spoiled and generally annoying variety. Fortunately for me, I put aside my prejudices and went for it, albeit on a dead late afternoon before all the yuppies get off work. The food was surprisingly fresh, delicious, abundant and, even more surprisingly, cheap as hell. I tend to avoid pasta places because most serve microwaved, overcooked, bland and needlessly expensive dishes. Not the case here. Also, our server was very friendly and attentive and made me feel welcome even though I do not look or act anything like the bulk of their clientele.
