MY DISSATISFACTION OF THIS PLACE MADE ME CREATE A YELP ACCOUNT.  (2 stars because the food was alright!)We just moved to Lakeview a couple months ago. My sister ordered from this place the day we moved. The food was alright (cheese and veggie pizzas, cant really mess that up), however it was an hour and half late (over 2 hours total). We called and asked about the food multiple times and they said "Sorry, the drivers are all backed up with other restaurants"... are you kidding me? you are a pizzeria and you "share" drivers. (btw a very unpleasant driver, even though we still tipped, since it wasnt his fault)The lady on the phone was rude, however she did give us a discount on our next order. So we tried again....... this time food came on time, the buffalo chicken pizza would have been awesome, however there was too much oil and sauce (or w.e they use). the "driver" looked like a criminal... I WAS HONESTLY SCARED TAKING MY WALLET OUT IN FRONT OF HIM. this place would be good if they worked on THE MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT of pizza delivery.... THE DELIVERY ITSELF! ......trust me i dont usually judge people, but it was extremely hard not to... is it really that hard to find pleasant and friendly drivers in chicago?
