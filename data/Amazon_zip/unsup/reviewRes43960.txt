It's grown on me. My wife is a "regular" who would eat here every morning if she could. As a matter of fact, we went through a period of time when we actually did have a healthy stock of their yummy granola in our kitchen for easy access. We usually eat here for weekend brunch. The egg panini sandwich is really good, as long as it's made fresh. I feel like on busier mornings, the quality of the food suffers, but it's still very good. I've more recently been on a huevos kick. They only make it for weekend brunch. it's more of a southwestern egg casserole with srambled eggs, black beans, onions, cilantro topped with tortilla chips and cheese. a creamy sour cream based sauce comes on the side, and I like to pour on tobasc0. The coffee is good (i think its intelligentsia), and I've always found the employees friendly. For first time visitors, you basically wait in line to place an order. while youre waiting your turn, one of the hostesses gives you a number for your table. After you order and pay at the register, someone brings you your food. The whole seating/ordering situation is the only reason why I didnt give them 5 stars. Oh, they also have a dog water bowl out front, which Waila, our pup always appreciates. I have noticed that over the years, the breakfasts are getting more and more crowded, but the popularity is well deserved.
