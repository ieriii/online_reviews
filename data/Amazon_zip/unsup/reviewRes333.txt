Clearly, Alinea is a place familiar to many not only in Chicago, but all over the US. I am here to not speak about the food in particular, but to really share my "experience". I find it hard to categorize Alinea as just an upscale restaurant because it is so much more than that. Even to just say that it is an "experience" kind of diminishes what Grant Achatz and his team are trying to do here. I've read the reviews and realize that when people complain about the price charged and questions about the worth.....I feel that those individuals just don't get what Alinea's purpose is. My dining experience at Alinea really made an impact on my view of food. Food is a necessity for all living beings, but Alinea took that necessity to a whole other level for us humans......there were textures, flavors, fragrances, sights and smells that I have never experienced before. It was not about just filling my stomach with delicious, high quality food (of which they definitely did), but more of a place to discover that my palate consisted of more than just limiting myself to taste sweet, salt, bitter, etc...... I walked in with an ignorant palate and walked out a graduate of true flavor and taste. Thank you, Alinea!
