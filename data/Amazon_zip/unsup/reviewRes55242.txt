Every restaurant should have a dual colored coaster (red on one side, green on the other) on each table that lets the staff know that even though you've consumed more food in 30 minutes than many small towns in South America, that you've not yet reached capacity. Excellent salad bar (but save room for the meat). Very good quality meat and a great selection. The last time I was there, a guy at the table next to us did not stop chewing for the duration of my visit, about 2 hours. Don't be that guy.Those complaining about the price, consider this - at a steakhouse of equal quality, my meal would have cost about 2 grand. If you like to eat, it's a bargain.
