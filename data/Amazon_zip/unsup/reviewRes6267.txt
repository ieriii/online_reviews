I live in the area and have heard nothing but great things from people that don't even live nearby. Well those people obviously need to get out a bit more. I was not impressed by anything at Davanti. I went with my family at 4pm on a Saturday after a game at the United Center, and it was pretty empty. Our server was terrible - we had to wait 15 mins to even be greeted and place drink orders. She did not help us or explain the menu at all so we guessed how much to order and what to do. Meanwhile, we could barely talk because we had hip-hop music blasting throughout the restaurant (again at 4pm!). The decor is cute enough but nothing special. The food was meh. Nothing special - especially for an area full of historically great Italian places, I would not go here again. While it tasted fine, there was nothing remarkable about it and nothing stood out. Pizza was fine but nowhere near as good as Pizzeria Via Stato. We tried the raviolo with egg yolk and it wasn't nearly as good as The Bristol. And the giant rigatoni with sausage, which has been voted in the top 10 plates of 2010, was generic tasting, like cafeteria spaghetti and meatballs. We wanted to try dessert but realized after being ignored for 25 mins by our server, it was better just to get the check since our meter was going to run out at this rate. Overall, it's trying too hard to be trendy and I'd much rather go to one of the many other Italian restaurants in the neighborhood that treats you like family and wants you to leave happy and satisfied, instead of just wanting you to leave so they can go back to their smoke break. I will not go back.
