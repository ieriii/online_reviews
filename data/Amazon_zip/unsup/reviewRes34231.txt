Absolutely amazing breakfast chain. Delicious coffee, friendly & energetic staff, and just amazing food. The busy always seems to be bustling with a good amount of noise but I like that in the mornings to help me wake up. You have to find street parking but I've never had trouble. The interior decor is modern and retro which somehow helps to motivate me. Probably because I ate here on my business trip or maybe because my entire experience was psychologically deemed "the north" as compared to southern Texas. Nonetheless, this is a must stop every time I go to Chicago.
