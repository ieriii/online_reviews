Second time I brought my family here in three months. First time the meal was very good. The second time the experience was not pleasant. After being seated we ordered our pizza knowing about the 45 minute wait. After 60 minutes, seeing tables being served pizza that where seated after us, trying to get the waiters attention(he seemed to be avoiding us) we asked the waiter about the pizza. He came back after 10 minutes saying the kitchen messed up the order. The pizza that was served 30 minutes latter was under cooked. Even if the kitchen didn't make the order, why didn't he check on our order when he started serving the other tables? I would have given them 1 star, but the previous trip brought them up to a 2.
