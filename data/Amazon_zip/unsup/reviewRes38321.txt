My boyfriend said that Giordano's pizza is the best in all of Chicago. So when we visited Chicago last week it was a must-stop for us. It was the BEST deep dish pizza I have EVER tasted. Tip: Don't order anything else -- like appetizers or salad -- because otherwise you won't have room for more than 1 slice of pizza. Also, a small pizza is more than enough for 2 people (even if you're starving). Another reason I say just stick to the pizza is because I ordered the caprese salad and it was disappointing. Usually a caprese salad is made with quality heirloom tomatoes, mozzarella, balsamic vinegar, olive oil and basil. When I got the salad it looked like they grabbed any tomato from the produce isle, sliced it, threw some mozzarella on it and brought it to me. No bueno. Their cheesy garlic bread was really good, but filled us up, thus why we were only able to eat 1 slice each. So I'm giving Giordano's 4 star rating overall because the salad was a bust, but the pizza was definitely 5 stars.
