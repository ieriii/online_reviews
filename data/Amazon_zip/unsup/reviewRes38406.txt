If my pizza had come out ridiculously hot, or even moderately hot, this would be five stars. Gooey cheese, excellent marinara, super rich and buttery crust... I seriously could get used to this, if I didn't mind living in Chicago with an extra two or three layers to get me through the winter. Fortunately for me, I live in Seattle and this is an occasional [read: has only happened once] kind of treat.
