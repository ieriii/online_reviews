Which of the following do you enjoy? A) Taking a trip downtown for dinner at a cozy restaurant (contrary to what the appearance of the surrounding streets might suggest) B) Italian food C) Attentive service/a decked-out-in-all-black-ninja-like waitstaff (if you look up, you might not see any of them, but in the next instant, you might see 6 staffers floating around) D) Paying more for a Restaurant Week dinner ($33) than you would if you were to order your 3 courses a la carte (what the hell?) E) 100 OpenTable points F) $6 valet parking G) An energetic noise level If you picked any of the above, give Piccolo Sogno a try! I enjoyed my appetizer arugula goat cheese pear salad (excellent contrast in crisp and creamy textures and fresh and bold flavors) almost as much as the ravioli entree (so fresh!). Opted for the vanilla panna cotta dessert, which was really bland and almost reminded me of tofu. I'm still miffed that the Restaurant Week prix fixe price was more than the separate 3 dishes alone. I would think a restaurant would want to show off some of their more upscale dishes, while offering a savings in dollar value, during the week and a half long promotion, but that was not the case for atleast a handful of 3 course combinations.
