Had the best pizza in my life here. Honestly, it was heaven in a slice. I almost would justify going to Chicago again just to have this amazing pizza. And this location is great but busy....because it steps from Michigan Ave. Also, be prepared for a wait....our pizzas took an hour from the time we ordered them.
