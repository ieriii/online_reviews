So. Within 2 hours of my review I was contacted by the owner of Piece. He said that we should have been allowed in, just not allowed to drink. I proposed that he let his staff know to suggest this option. It wasn't even offered to us as an option. Regardless, it shouldn't have happened. I'll leave the 1 star review as is, so people might see it and remember to bring their ID, or their passport, or a really good fake. Anyway, here is the honest 5 star review for the pizza. We ALWAYS get a white pizza with onions and mashed potatoes. (With onions and other things depending on who orders...mushrooms...green peppers...jalepenos...etc... (Sometimes we get additional pizzas as we have people to eat them of course) But the white with mashed potatoes is to die for.  I initially thought it was weird when my then boyfriend, now husband suggested we get it. He promised me it ws good. I still thought it was weird, but I agreed. I can't explain why it was so good, it just is. We actually ended up getting a carry out pizza 2 days later for the aunt and uncle to try. They loved it too! (And if mashed potatoes on a pizza is weird for an American, I'm sure they thought it was extra weird) I'm pretty sure they could grab me out of my booth and throw me out the door for no reason....and I would go back. If we want pizza, we want piece. Also, apparently if you have an issue, they are quick to respond to clear up the situation.
