Smoky? Yes Expensive as compared to other korean joints? Yes Impersonal wait staff? Yes but.... Fun experience? Yes Open late? Yes Good food? Yes Lots of Panch'an? Yes I found that if you're not into the whole bbq thing, some tasty and less $$$ options would be the Jap Chae or their Soon Tofu. I've always left full and happy. When we didn't get bbq my bank account was full and happy too. Can't beat that.
