I've been part of the Yelp community for years now. However I've never written a review. I thoroughly enjoy reading all of the entertaining insights on all of the places I've worked my 14 years in this business. It helps me to gain new insight in my chosen profession as "director of cuisine". Not only does Yelp humor me-it humbles me as well. Let me be clear that I am breaking my oath to keep silent- strictly based on a service perspective. I have dined at the Purple Pig enough times to safely say that I have tried almost each and every item on the menu- It is brilliant and undeniably delicious. I wake up craving particular items- plan my day around how I can somehow squeeze there deliciousness into my break from my double at work. Like an addict I care not of the repercussions. I compare my relationship to The Purple Pig to that of a sick love affair with a married man. I get the meat I crave but none of the true tenderness that builds a lasting relationship. The service is painfully pretentious and unapologetic in being so. Each and every time I remind myself before heading there, not to expect a smile or a thank you. Each and every time I prepare myself for the rolled eyes or blatant ignorance of my simple requests. All of those issues seem to just dissipate the moment those flavors and textures hit my lips. But I have to say-after today I don't know how much more abuse I can take. I pride myself in the work I do-with the relationships I form with my customers, and I seek solace in putting my pride aside at times when I know I'm wrong. Next time you walk out the door of The Purple Pig-after throwing down a couple hundred bucks in this economy.......ask yourself this...."Do I feel like someone my significant other would take home to meet the parents-or did I just get screwed?"
