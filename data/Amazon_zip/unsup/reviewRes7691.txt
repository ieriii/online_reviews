OMG, this place is fantastic. If you are debating between Texas de Brazil and Fogo de Chao, pick Fogo! While the food is amazing at either Brazilian joints, the service here at Fogo de Chao is what pushes it way over the top from Texas de Brazil. I've been to the one in Houston and the one here in Chicago and both were excellent. We went for special occasions both time (Bachelorette/Bachelor party and my birthday). Since it is on the pricier side of life, this place is best reserved for special events. You will have some amazing cuts of meat here and they will get served to you so fast you won't know what hit you! The salad bar is also a treat. You could easily fill up on the salad bar alone, but why? Treat yourself to the entire experience and do the all you can eat salad and meat combination. You (and everyone in your group) will be talking about Fogo de Chao for a long time to come. My whole family still raves about it and many say it is the best food they have ever had at a restaurant!
