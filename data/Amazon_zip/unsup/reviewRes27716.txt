I had seen Chef Bayless on tv and was a fan of his passion for Mexican food. While I was in Chicago I had to check one of his place out. Frontera lived up to the reputation. I had the Mole Trio and was very impressed with the complexity of the favors. I was surprised by the green veggie mole in a good way. Each of the three dishes was different and very flavorful. A bonus of the evening was that I got to sit at the counter by the kitchen. To my surprise, Chef Bayless walked out of the kitchen while I was eating my dinner. It was a great meal in a great environment. If you are in Chicago, go see for yourself.
