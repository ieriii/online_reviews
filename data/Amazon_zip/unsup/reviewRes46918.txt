Wow - a healthy, flavorful, organic option for food and drinks here in Chicago? I'm totally won over. They have a parking lot right there which is free and they have gardens outside of the restaurant. They also had outdoor seating where we sat to enjoy the last bits of summer to try out brunch. We tried their freshly squeezed juice (grapefruit and orange) whereas others in our group got their coffee (one in which came with a shot of whiskey) and their bloody mary. And we started with their sweet potato fries which came with this fondue dip - YUM! The hubby got their chicken burrito which had scrambled eggs, mixed peppers, chihuahua cheese, cumin crme, in a spinach tortilla with smoked chili sauce on top. The burrito was HUGE - practically the size of a Chipotle burrito and he swears that it was the best breakfast burrito he has ever had. One of our friends got the Melt which was eggs over easy, nueske black peppercorn bacon, cheddar-ale cheese, organic spinach, on black bread. I opted for the baked potato skillet which had eggs, roasted potatoes, bacon, peppers, and green onions. Really delicious and huge portions, too. I definitely can't wait to come back again with the great service that we got, too. It seems like a family friendly place for brunch and we heard some rave reviews for dinner which includes live music, as well.
