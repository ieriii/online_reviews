The lobby is decorated a bit tacky, but overall the hotel is nice, and pretty inexpensive considering the location. The concierge was absolutely wonderful, and the guy at the front desk was pretty awesome, too. Rooms are a little small, but the view was nice. There is also a bar around the corner - Houlihan's. The drinks were, (obviously), less expensive than the hotel bar most of the people were locals - you get enough interaction with the tourists in the hotel. Although not 4-star worthy as their website indicates, it was a nice hotel - I have no complaints.
