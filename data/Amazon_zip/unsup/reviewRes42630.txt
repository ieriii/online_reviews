A shinning beacon of hope in a city populated with tourist traps and inferior slices, Art of Pizza is a mecca for great pizza. I was introduced to this place a few years ago by a friend and gave them a holler on my caller to order an Art's Special Deep Pie one fine afternoon. Cubs game was on, I had a few beers, and wanted great pie. It arrived hot and ready and when my mandibles sunk into that first slice I was transported to a magical land, a land of colors and sights never seen before by human eyes. All my senses seemed tuned to the very essence of the cosmos, at that moment I was one with the universe and my God, I COULD SEE FOREVER! If you want deep dish that isn't Loop fare for tourists, order this pie. You will not be disappointed. You have Dirtball's seal of approval I give two thumbs up and an around the world snap.
