Eggnog- Pedro Ximenez, Benedictine, bourbon - The portions were amazing, we walked in hungry, but left full, but not overwhelmed like after eating at an Italian restraunt from all the cheese. -Since I can't drink, they whipped up some amazing non-alcoholic beverages that have names I couldn't remember. I asked the waiter to introduce me to the chef, however, the waiter returned and told me that the chef was to busy for autographs, so he instead suggested we leave our address, and he'll send us his autograph. :DFurthermore, the service was amazing, no more than 2 minutes between dishes, my glass was always full, new silverware every course arriving on pillows, never had to move a muscle to move the dish, very knowledgeable/skilled.
