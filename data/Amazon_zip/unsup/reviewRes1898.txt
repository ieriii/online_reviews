There were many times where I passed by Hot Doug's and saw the line outside wrapping around the building and thought, "Man, that's intimidating." The day I decided to go to Hot Doug's was this past Saturday during 2pm. Not only was it extremely hot outside, but I felt like I should have brought a folding chair with me. Luckily, there was an ice cream man selling water outside so no one was getting dehydrated! When we finally got to the counter to order it was like a relief. What's so cool is that the owner, Doug Sohn, is there to take your order and he is so so so so nice.  Once my almost 2 hours of waiting outside was done and we finally got our food, I was starving. We ordered the Celebrity Sausage of the day which was a Smoked Shrimp and Pork Sausage with Cajun Remoulade and Goat Cheese. This was my favorite because the sausage and remoulade had a nice spice and the goat cheese smoothed that out nicely! Another delicious pick was the Blue Cheese Pork Sausage with Sir William Pear Creme Fraiche and Roasted Almonds. Lastly, we finished our hot dog adventure with the Swiss Cheese Smoked Knackwurst with Smoked Paprika Mayonnaise and Smoked Provolone Cheese. This was a good smoky taste, but I didn't like this one nearly as much as I liked the other two. Since it was Saturday, of course you have to get an order of the duck fat fries. They were good. I don't think they were as delicious as the hot dogs we had, but you have to try them. There was so much food at the table that the fries couldn't be finished.  I had a great time, despite the hellish line. Next time, I will remember to go during the fall and bring a chair. :)
