Absolutely wonderful!!! I was born in italy and still visit once a year. I mean it truly when i say their ingredients are some of the best in the city. The combinations you will find here are the same you might over in italy. They don't like their pizza to travel and i like that. much like great lakes pizza just down the way they have a respect for their craft. the fact is that their pizza is meant to eat immediately.
