My wife and I nicknamed Garcia's "El Pollo Loco" for no other reason than endearment and affection. We discovered it the first night we moved into our Lincoln Square studio as they have these quesadillas for a buck to a buck fifty that are STUFFED, and I do mean STUFFED FULL of cheese and either meat or spinach. They're not heart healthy, they're not lo carb and they're not the best quesadillas you'll find but for a buck fifty you quite literally will not find a better deal for so much food. Four of those, split down the middle between spinach and chicken with some salsa verde and a side of frijoles con queso fed me for under $6 and believe you me, I'm not an easy guy to fill up. Their burritos are also quite impressive altho the Taco Burrito King #2 down Western near Addison is better. However Garcia's makes up for this with the Burrito Suezo, slathered in ranchero and cheese. Suddenly what was an alright burrito becomes a really, really good one. Funny that. Behold the power of cheese.
