I'm been to India House both for lunch (buffet style) and dinner and love it every time. Their chicken tikka masala is one of the best I've ever had and I'm always comparing other restaurants to theirs. If you're new to Indian food, I would recommend coming here for lunch for their buffet to try a great variety of food to figure out what you like and dislike so that you can order it for dinner. Every table gets fresh nann and a plate of tandoori chicken and you get everything else at the buffet. YUM! I've heard their mango lassi and ice cream are phenomenal but sadly I'm allergic so have never tried it. My native Indian friends/colleagues have tried the various Indian restaurants in Chicago and say that India house is one of the best. India House is a must try for good Indian food (get that chicken tikka masala).
