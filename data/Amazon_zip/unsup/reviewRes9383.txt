Very unique menu! We absolutely loved it! Great place for brunch!! I got Rabbit Waffle (I know i felt really bad for eating a wabbit :() but it was soooo good! and my fiance got croque madam and the seafood omlette...everything was delicious! You have to ask the waiter for a more detailed explanation of the menu because not every single ingridient is in the menu. we asked our waiter for his recommendations and he was very helpful. I also asked them for a cocktail and they made a concoction for me which wasn't on the menu - which was also pretty good!  Will definitely come back here and bring my fellow foodies with me!
