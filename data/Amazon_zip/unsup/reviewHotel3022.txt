-Good size room -One side of the hotel has really nice views (I did not get that side unfortunately, but we know that view is gorgeous from waiting for the elevators) -Convenient to the beach, navy pier, bike riding up and down the shore. -NOT convenient to the subway, 7 block walk. It gets tiring if you are running back and forth from the hotel. -Walking distance to N. Michigan Ave, like 4 blocks. -The Acura Experience is ONLY available from 12pm-7pm - a lot more limiting than you think. Spots also fill up fast, so make sure to book at least a few hours ahead. To use it, you have to go by their schedule. We only got to use it once. The entire "experience" is a sales pitch. Not that I care cuz its a free ride, but just sayiinnn.. -Okay guys, those bathroom windows into the room are not THAT weird. -Love the bliss products in the bathroom!
