I spent New years Eve at The Purple Pig. How appropriate I thought since the new year signifies new beginnings and hopefully fresh new experiences. The Purple Pig IS a new food experience- a vacation of sorts- kinda of like eating your way through Italy Spain and Greece but cheaper and no need to for the depressing Euro exchange, Capisce? The decor is of course Mediterranean inspired and reminded me of some cool places I have been in Florence. The food is delicious, interesting, and comforting. What I tried and really enjoyed- Marinated Olives, Salt Roasted Beets,Whipped Feta with Cucumbers (simple and so damn tasty), another simple dish I enjoyed that had lots of flavor were the Charred Scallions with Romesco Sauce. TRY the Sardines and Lemon Jam and the Pigs Ears with Fried egg and Calabrian Chillies I was really impressed since I have never eaten Fried Pigs Ears! I would eat the Wagyu Sirloin Tip with Bone Marrow Vinaigrette on my next visit did not get enough of that plate! The Cheeses I enjoyed were the Blu di Bufala and the Manchego and the really friendly guy who set up our wine pairings was on the money the wines paired were really enjoyable and I even ventured out of the Italian/Napa Valley Red comfort zone and tried some Spanish Reds that were fantastic! From start to finish the service was good and the plates were artfully prepared and really had great depth of flavors. Yup- 2010 the year of the Fried Pig Ear:)
