I think this might be a regular joint for me if I lived in Chicago but I live in DC so it's a two-times a year place for me. Great staff; classy and attentive. They feature a great beer list (the Delaware-brewed Dogfish, etc.) and heavy pours on the glasses of wine. The have many different courses and everything I've eaten there (onion soup - interesting presentation, risotto, wild sea bass, salads, etc.) has been very good and well-prepared. I imagine there might be better restaurants in Chicago but I like the location (walking distance from the W and other nice hotels on Adams), the staff, and the ambiance.
