Yes, we're idiots for not realizing that this place probably is more suited for TO GO orders. We came in and sat down. And realized it was tiny seating. And that the order (3 extra large pizzas, 1 chicken dinner, garlic knots) would take forever. Like I said, illiterate, incompetent fools. So that part wasn't fun. The counter guy was great though. Kept conversing with us, asked us how we found out about this place and why we thought it was dine in, which of course, was his gentle and friendly way of suggesting that we really should have called before coming so he could have warned us about the nature of the beast. Lesson learnt. So we decided to go to a friend's place with the pizza and some beer and soda after the pizzas were finally done. And they were great. No lies from all the yelpers here who've already reviewed it. I'm still not convinced avocados belong on pizzas, but I'll take your word for it when you said it was your most popular pizza, counter guy! I'll stick to my six cheese and the other awesome pizza with the mushrooms, thank you very much. So I can't say this was the greatest experience ever, but that was mostly our fault. But the pizzas were good, and I'll be sure to try take out or delivery next time.
