The hotel staff was attentive and quick upon check in. After having trouble with the internet they were also eager and swift to help. The rooms themselves are clean but out dated. They feature the usual ammentities and an old fashioned television set. The location, however, is great. It is walking distance from a lot of the popular Chicago attractions: shopping, Grant Park, Milenium Park, just to name a few. There is no room service but I recommend take out from Yolk, a nearby restaurant.
