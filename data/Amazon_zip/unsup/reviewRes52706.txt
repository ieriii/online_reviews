I went here for a business dinner, as did everyone else [apparently] in the restaurant. Tables were full of business men (note- there was a huge imbalance of the women to men ratio) with clients in town. SO, the service was great and very attentive. Even when I had my "meat button" showing "no thanks," the servers still came around to me to make sure I had enough beef. Seriously though, how much meat can one person eat? And more importantly, why would a person want to eat so much meat? Thank goodness I wasn't paying because I most certainly did not "get my moneys worth." I also have a problem with mixing meat- you know, beef, pork, shrimp, chicken- I tend to think its like alcohol. The more you mix, the sicker you'll feel. The salad bar portion was very good. There were a lot of fresh options and not too many incredibly fatty choices. I loved the platter full of asparagus. The music was a little insane. They lose half a star for playing Paris Hilton's new song. They lose another half star for only offering chicken legs. Can't they give me the option of a chicken breast or just something other than a leg? And what is up with the sausage on a skewer? I guess it was chorizo since we were in a Brazilian restaurant. The red accents made the place quite romantic, as did the lighting, however its not really a date place since a) there is a buffet, b) men walking around constantly with skewers of meat and c) said men look like they are in acient times with their outfits. They almost looked liked warriors or something. Those things alone make it a novelty restaurant to go to with your friends/co-workers and not your lova (unless they LOVE to eat massive portions of meat, in which case you should tell them its bad for their health). All in all, it is a place to go to when you crave meat. I think my iron levels are back to normal now.
