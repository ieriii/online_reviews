I returned to the Purple Pig for the 3rd time last week. This time I came with 5 friends on a Thursday. Still supercrowded. (sigh) But this time I was a big flustered by the wait because the waitress said 15 minutes and we ended up waiting 45 minutes. The food makes this place worth the noise and the wait! Really! FOOD: - The CHEESE platter is THE BEST DEAL on this menu, and I've tried tons of things at this place. It's a must-have for groups!! They served generous amounts on a rectangular platter with your choice of a spread Ask for more bread!!! They only serve like 5 slices of bread at first. Their cheese selection is great! Our friends randomly picked 5 cheeses including waitress's recommendations and we loved all the selections! - I think this was seasonal but we had an amazing Butternut Squash dish - perfect dish to warm your belly in this cool fall weather. We were all raving about this dish. - of course we had the usual must-haves such as the beets in goat cheese, milk braised pork shoulder and Deviled Egg - I've reviewed these selections in the past already. Honestly, i prefer the outdoor seating with the heating lamps because indoors you can't even talk to the person across from you without yelling Even with the canopy, sit close to the heating lamps or you will freeze!
