I haven't had better eggs benedict anywhere, but I don't usually go out for breakfast or brunch, so my experience is somewhat limited. If you don't mind waiting a while for a seat in a madhouse full of families and screaming children with very good food, then Yolk could be for you. I feel like I've been there and I doubt I'll be back. I guess that says it all.
