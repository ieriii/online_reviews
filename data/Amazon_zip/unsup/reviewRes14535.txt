Man. I went here for lunch the other day, and it was excellent. My girlfriend and I went halvesies on a lechn and a ropa vieja sandwich. I'll concede that the lechn was a bit drier and less seasoned than I've had in some Puerto Rican restaurants (maybe it's supposed to be?), but the ropa vieja was really juicy and flavorful. I also had a tasty side of tostones, and tried some of my friend's fried yucca, cut like french fries and topped with vinegary garlic. That was really, really good. Also, all of the staff was exceedingly friendly. I'm going back a lot.
