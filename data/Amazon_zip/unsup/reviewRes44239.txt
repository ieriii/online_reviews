Loving Wakamono lately. More so, because the last time I ordered for delivery, they asked me if I'd like any wine or beer with my dinner. Any place that's willing to deliver me some booze wins my heart! Godzilla roll is a must. It's similar to the White Dragon at Coast but I can honestly say Coast does it a little better. I enjoy their spicy tuna but only if it's made without the spicy mayo - sometimes they use the chili oil which makes it pretty unique IMO. I'm also a fan of their Mexicano roll but sometimes they overdo it on the cilantro but overall, a personal favorite. Pieces are fresh. Service is generally pretty good for the most part. And actually, this place does have a liquor license which is why they can charge you a corkage fee.
