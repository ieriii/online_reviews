Excellent Excellent. If you are looking for a very fine dining experience and dont care to spare the cash, this is your place. The ingredients are top notch and the meats is seasoned to perfections. If your going with a group and you are not a meat eater, the salad bar is top quality selections better than the other Brazilian steak houses and I have tried others.
