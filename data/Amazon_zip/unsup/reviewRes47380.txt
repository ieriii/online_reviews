Okay first, 5 stars for a burger and beer place? I don't mean to say Lockdown competes with Alinea or L2O; what the 5 stars mean is that I doubt you are going to find a better burger and beer place than Lockdown.  The burgers are fantastic! From a menu full of unique burger options, I've become addicted to The Bootleg- a burger topped with kimchi, bacon and a fried egg, and served on a pretzel roll. The menu also offers burger flights, so you can try three different burgers. The fries are good, but you can also opt for the decadent mac &cheese.  Lockdown is a beer drinkers paradise - dozens of craft brews and hard-to-find imports to choose from. Surprisingly, the service is accommodating, friendly and efficient; not what you might expect from a place that is decorated with skulls and shows Iron Maiden concerts in their entirety on its many flat screens. Lockdown is spotlessly maintained, well lit, and frequented by everyone - young and old (remember, "Run to the Hills" is 30-years-old).  The Mob Rules, and so does the Lockdown.
