must say, i have heard so much about this restaurant in the past years, that we finally got there last Saturday. we had to wait at the bar for a table, but we did not mind because the drinks are so good. everything we ate was the freshest quality you could find. service was friendly. the place was packed but still had a good vibe to iti would be happy to go back
