New menus and pricing! Turns out I haven't been to Irazu in almost 6 months. The front counter even got a face lift! I couldn't believe that I had gone almost 6 months without eating at one of my all time favorite places for cheap eats and BYOB. As usual we started off with the Palmito Salad. I found it to be a bit smaller than usual and the hearts of palm were now sliced. Delicious nonetheless.  Audrey went with the always yummy Veggie Sandwich. It was yummy! Completely outside of my normal ordering patterns I ordered the Chicken Burrito. Now I have been to Irazu probably 25 times and have only ordered the Milanesa, the Milanesa Sandwich, or the Chicken Casado. The burrito was good, but I will probably get back to the usual suspects on my next visit.  We washed it all down with a large Horchata. Yum! The interior is a bit fancier than before, but I'd still file Irazu in my whole in the wall folder.  Please keep in mind I use "whole in the wall" as a compliment in the case of Irazu. The service can be hit or miss, but was solid on this visit. I am a big fan of Irazu and hope to make It back more frequently. I don't know what I was thinking! 1 Palmito Salad 1 Veggie Sandwich 1 Chicken Burrito 1 Horchata --------------------- $21
