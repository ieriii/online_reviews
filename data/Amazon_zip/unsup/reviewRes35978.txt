I absolutely adore this place! A few of my friends and I have a weekly brunch here and the food is just amazing! The portions are very generous and it is great quality. I highly recommend the: -stuffed apple or strawberry french toast -emerald isle skillet -berry cobbler crepes -gouda omelette -margherita panini I mean honestly you can't really go wrong. I had the crab cakes benedict once and that was very disappointing and a friend had one of the wraps which was just typical. I would stick to their breakfast, personally. And the other reason they only got 4 stars is that some of the hostesses that they have are not very polite. It looks like they hate their job or something which really shows. However, the waitresses are extremely friendly and I have never had a problem with any of them.
