I had expected a little more from this place based on the reviews I read, but I really found it to be very mediocre. The service was decent but the overall atmosphere was a little too stuffy for my liking. The goat cheese appetizer was pretty good and they had a decent wine list. However, my "medium" filet was probably the bloodiest I've ever seen. And it was barely lukewarm. I really should have sent it back, but I always have reservations about doing that. The side of smashed potatoes we'd ordered were also pretty cold. Based on the experience up until that point, we declined dessert. Maybe I just went on an off night, I'm not sure... but based on my experience, I'd pick Morton's, Gibson's, or Ruth's Chris any day.
