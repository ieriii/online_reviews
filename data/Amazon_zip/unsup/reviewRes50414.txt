Recently relocate from Lincoln Park? Did you miss one of the other 15 Bar & Grill's permeating Division St. serving $15 cheeseburgers? Do you like LOTS of LCD T.V.'s? Overpriced drinks served in FUN cups? What about Boneless buffalo chicken wings and brain-dead shitty servers with their sunbaked fake tits hanging out?! Then look no further! All snarkyness aside, this place is about exactly what you'd expect it to be...boring and overpriced. The burger was good, but impossible to eat and there's something about paying close to $15 for a cheeseburger and fries that just doesn't sit well with me. If you're as tired as I am of uninspired Lincoln Park transplant Bar and Grill's that are increasingly popping up, do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.
