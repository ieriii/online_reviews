I wish I had more room in my stomach so I could try every single one of their amazingly appealing hot dogs. I decided to go with the game of the day, an antelope sausage with garlic sauce and cheddar cheese, and was not disappointed in the least. The easiest way to get here from the L is to just hop on the 77 and get off at California.
