this place doesn't look like much on the outside, but man does it produce some of the tastiest cuban food i've ever eaten!! one bite into those caramelly sweet plantains and you're transported 90 miles from here, that's for sure. i'd been dying to try this place forever, and finally had my chance last weekend. one of my girlfriends and i were going on a costco run, so we decided to head here for a quick bite beforehand. we traveled to miami together a couple years ago when i ran the miami marathon, and cuban food has been our special thing ever since. 90 miles hits the spot. i could eat here every day. (i'd be very fat, but very happy too. ha ha!) we both had the plantains (of course!) and the media noche sandwich - it's the cubano, but on sweet egg bread instead. melt in your mouth delicious! and sooooo filling - which was perfect because you can go overboard when you shop at costco, and we definitely didn't need to be shopping on empty stomachs :) i can't wait to ride my bike here in the summer months for a snack. yum yum yum. oh! and they have a second outpost on armitage...near california?...in case this locale is inconvenient for you.
