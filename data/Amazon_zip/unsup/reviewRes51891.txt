I would try to defend this GREAT pizzeria from some of the negative reviews I just read, but I don't see the point. Everyone has an opinion and their own taste... but I can tell you for certain the people who gave this place a negative review are CRAZY!!!! The dough here is cornbread based (same as Uno's), but that is precisely why it is some of the best pizza anywhere. The dough is sort of hard and crunchy on the outside, but gooey and soaked with the juices from the ingredients on the inside. I personally think cornbread based pizzas are much juicier and flavorful than their flour based brothers. This trip to Chicago was brief, so I did a small frozen "Meaty Legend" to go. The sausage is super flavorful, the sauce is incredibly balanced and the cheese is just the right amount. I thawed it for about 4 hours prior to cooking in the oven, but it came out amazing!!! The restaurant itself has allowed people to write on the walls since its beginning and is all over the decor... which I think adds unique character. Gino's East & Uno's have long since been my absolute favorite Deep Dish pizzas, followed by Giordano's & Italian Fiesta for thin. There is nothing touristy about these places and they taste the same now as they did when I was a kid and all the time inbetween. So if you find that you don't like one of these pizza's, you might want to go get your taste buds checked. This is authentic Chicago pizza at it's best!!!
