We wanted to try a new pizza place and so we decided to give la villa a try. We love thin crust pizza from little Italian places and it sounded like la villa was just what we were looking for! We placed our order and our pizza came in about 45 min as told by staff. Our pizza arrived HOT, which was nice on a cold night. We decided to get a half cheese, half la villa special pizza. We thought it was delicious! Very cheesy and lots of veggies. They gave us a big portion of meat and veggies and it felt like we got a great deal. We really enjoyed and will order again. It was a nice change from some of the other places we order from!
