You must understand I grew up on La villa and RC cola. Taco pizza was what my brother, sisters and I craved on Friday night. We also loved the cheesy beef on Garlic bread! SOoo good. It is still good! oooo and a special treat was the linguine and clam sauce! When we called and gave our last name they would say which one (my g-ma's address or our address!) My whole family loves this place and we have had several family get- togethers here! It isn't much to look at but the food is classic Chicago Italian!
