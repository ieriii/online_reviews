In Chicago, there are only two top contenders for best Brazilian steakhouse--Fogo de Chao and Texas de Brazil (Brazzaz comes in third). So which of the two is THE best? It's hard to decide. Texas de Brazil wins for ambiance and decor--AND they have an acrobat swinging from wires in the wine cellar (floor to ceiling windows)--you can't beat that! What better way to encourage you to order wine than to watch the "wine fetcher" do flips and swing her way up to fetch your bottle of wine. Texas also wins for best salad bar, they have fish and pasta and soup and lots of other real food at the salad bar, not just salad. However, Fogo beats Texas on the meat (while the meat was good at Texas, it was all a tad too salty) and drinks (caipirinhas) did not taste good. And unfortunately, service was better at Fogo too. So on meat and drinks and service--Fogo wins. I gave all three steakhouses 4 stars, you decide which is better. But if I had to choose one to go back to, I'd go to Fogo because they had the most flavorful meats. This review either helped you or made you even more confused and now you don't know which Brazilian steakhouse to go to--sorry.
