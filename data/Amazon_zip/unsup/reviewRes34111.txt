We have been to Yolk a few times already since we are live just round the block. It is especially popular during the weekends (lunch time).  Pluses: - Generally good service. - Quick service even when it is crowded. - Generous serving. Minuses: - Afterall, they serve breakfast food only. Options become limited after a while. - Quality of food is average. I must say the production is as efficient as it can get for a restaurant like that. A lot of waiters zipping around without missing a beat. From sitting down to finishing the meal takes us just half an hour, even during the busy time.
