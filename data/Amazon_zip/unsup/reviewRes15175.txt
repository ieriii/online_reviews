Yes, the bacon fat popcorn could not be avoided. $4 for something you will not see anywhere else. I found that their brews closely mirrored other well-known beers in taste. They were, however, very reasonably priced. I tried the arugula pizza which was refreshing and filling with a HEAVY dose of arugula - felt like I was eating the whole garden. The atmosphere was comfortable, if not a bit cozy. Parking was fairly easy as there is not a whole lot north of there on Milwaukee Ave. The menu had a lot of "heavy" options which made me want to return on a cold winter night.
