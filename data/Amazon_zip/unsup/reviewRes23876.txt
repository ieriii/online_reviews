We are regulars at Lao Sze Chuan. During the past few years, we have been there at least once every month, as a couple, with a group of friends and with family from out of town. Our favorite orders are the Sze Chuan Wontons (which may not be on the menu by that name, but the server usually knows it) and the chicken fried rice. The fried rice has on occassion been slightly over salted, but otherwise tastes great. Stay away from the chilli fish curry - it is too spicy to eat, we literally had to eat just the pieces of fish with no sauce. We went there when I was pregnant and they gave us a really huge table for the two of us so I did not have to wait in the cold. I thought it was pretty nice of the young host.
