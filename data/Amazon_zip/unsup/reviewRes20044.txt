I love sushi, but I can't muster up that much excitement for Coast Sushi. My main gripe is that their basic sushi just isn't that good. Sometimes all I want is a piece of fish on a little rice! At Coast I have been disappointed in both the quality of the fish and the portions. I do have to give them credit, all of the fancy, super expensive rolls that I have tried have been pretty tasty. But, $15 for a fried veggie roll!? That seems a bit excessive to me.
