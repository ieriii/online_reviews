I'm in love with their harvest sandwich at the deli in the back of the market. It's vegan. It has mushrooms, spinach, avocado, tomato, cucumbers, ...I don't remember what else, but it's delicious! I've had it for two days straight for lunch. :) Total cost: $6.57 (including tax, if you only buy the sandwich).
