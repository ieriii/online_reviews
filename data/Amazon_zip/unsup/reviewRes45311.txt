First time eating here was last night. The place is loud and crowded -- typical restaurant/pub atmosphere. It's definitely casual, but has an upscale vibe. I had the fish and chips -- good, but the portion of fish was small and the presentation was not good. The fries were pretty average. I enjoyed my food, but I've had better. My dinner companions all seemed to like their food, too -- but man, our service was less than great. It took *forever* for the waitress to take our order, and then when three of my friends ordered side salads, they didn't come out until right when our entrees did, so no one really ate the salads. The waitress also never refilled any of our drinks throughout the meal. All in all, the food was adequate and the service was sub-par. I would come back, but if I had another mediocre experience, that would probably be my last time here.
