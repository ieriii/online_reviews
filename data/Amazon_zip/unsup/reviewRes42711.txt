I'll tell you what crazy is: 1/4 Brazilian Charbroiled Chicken, 2 sides, and a drink for under $6. That's crazy. Don't forget to dunk the pieces of chicken in the salty chicken fat that collects at the bottom of the plate. The black beans are filled with pork fat and garlic. The mashed potatoes must have heavy cream in them. The pita is dipped in butter and grilled. These Brazilians know their fats, and they know how to use them. The awesome people at Fogo sent me these corrections: 'As far as the chicken and sides, here is some info for you. We use milk in the potatoes, just made fresh twice a day. And we don't do anything to the pitas but just grill them with the chicken when the order is placed. The marinade from the chicken (we throw the pita on top) adds some flavor to the pita. We buy fresh bacon, and sizzle it in the pizza oven, then add that bacon to the slow cooked black beans (along with lots of fresh chopped garlic and other spices).'
