I was visiting a friend who lives in Chicago and we, with our other friends, went to Giordano's for an early dinner. My stomach can't handle heavy food, but theirs could so I was lame and ordered garlic bread and a Greek salad while the rest of them ordered a deep dish cheese pizza. When our food arrived, the waitress put the salad in the middle of table, assuming that we were going to be eating it before the pizza, but alas, I told her, in a defeated voice, that it was my meal and she looked surprised. I guess people don't exactly go there for salads. The Greek salad was....a Greek salad. It came with anchovies, which I love and was decent. The garlic bread came with marinara sauce and was not all that garlicky. As soon as my friends got their pizza, they dove in. I bravely tried a small piece and found it to be absolutely wonderful. The smell and taste of the pizza was nothing like I had every had before. It tasted rich and fresh and definitely put any pizza I've ever had in DC to shame. I did not have an entire slice however, fearing for my digestive well being, but if my stomach somehow turns to steel, I will gladly come back next time I am in Chicago.
