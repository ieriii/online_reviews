This is a reasonably priced crepe place on a busy corner in Andersonville. The sign faces the middle of the intersection so you might not even know it's there unless you're a bad driver. Middle Eastern Bakery is right around the corner, and around the other way you'll find all sorts of cool shops. Inside is a little haven. Comfortable seating, capeted walls, middle eastern music and the most pleasant wait staff you'll meet. You settle down just going in there; the street life through the windows is a bonus. We've met the owner, who I would describe as gentle, kind, happy, friendly and the staff is as pleasant as you'll find. The whole experience is calming, from the Turkish coffee carafs to the staff, the decor, and of course the excellent, nicely sized, and beautifully presented crepes (I had the Icosium with salmon, she had Icosium with sausage without crepe but as a salad) .
