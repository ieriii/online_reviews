Since I'm around people who love tea as much as I do (for once in my life), we all thought it would be a great idea to have high tea one weekend. The Drake Hotel offers just that for $31. I originally thought the price was a bit high, but after going, I think it's well worth it. When we arrived, we were a bit confused on where to go. There are signs pointing the way to the tea room, so be sure to look for them. I did not see them and god knows how long it would have taken for me to find the area. I usually just wander. Anyway, once they took out coats, we were seated right away. The tea room, while large, was incredibly crowded. I didn't think having tea like this was popular, but apparently it is. I ordered the Irish Breakfast Tea, and it was wonderful. We were brought these large tea pots that were refilled with hot water constantly, as well as finger sandwiches, scones, and a variety of desserts. The finger sandwiches originally didn't look very good, but after trying a few I thought they were amazing! The scones were so-so, but the desserts were terrible. We spent almost 3 hours there, and I was completely stuffed by the time we left. I would definitely recommend this place for tea lovers!
