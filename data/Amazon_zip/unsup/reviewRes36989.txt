Loved Hopleaf. Amazing beer selection, great atmosphere, and of course great food. They are currently carrying a limited release Two Brothers beer that is one of my new fave beers (Diversey & Lill(e)), which is really hard to find. For food I had the almond butter and fig jam sandwich and homemade chips and definitely cleaned my plate. Delish. I'll be back for sure, just wish Andersonville was a little closer!
