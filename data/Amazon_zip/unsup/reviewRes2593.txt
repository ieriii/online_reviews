I signed up to Yelp just to write a review for this resturant. Not only is the food worth the 2.5 hour (+) wait, and the mile (+) walk there, but IRL Doug takes your order and treats you like you just walked into a spa. I hope I can visit Chicago again and try other "famous" hot dogs, but I will still make my way to the outskirts to stand in a ridiculous line for Hot Doug's Chicago dog. If I could have changed anything, I would have gotten there earlier because the girl in line behind me became increasingly annoying after the first hour.
