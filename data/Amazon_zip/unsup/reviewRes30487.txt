The longevity of this perfectly fine diner is a testimony to how basically good it is - for what it is... if you want really good vegetarian food you have a teeny few restaurants to choose from - or opt for the best choice: MAKE IT YOURSELF at HOME! ALSO please note: There are (mostly) TWO reasons why vegetarianism is slow to catch on: 1.) Dry and flavorless - this can be remedied (a little at least) by dousing any/everything with a few dashes of extra virgin olive oil (the best you can afford - it does make a difference...), GARLIC, fresh herbs(or dried in a "pinch") and if you are not totally Vegan - CHEESE (any kind that isn't spoiled) can solve almost any food related situation. 2.) As Liz K. pointed out, "meat eaters LOATHE faux (aka: FAKE) meat-imitation dishes... I jagree - and I just don't get it:: if you still crave a meat dish - no amount of seitan or tofu is going to change that no matter what kind of meaty-tasting stuff they dress it in. Good quality Veggies are DIVINE! Just go for it/them and don't ever forget how good you feel when .... Never mind. Er - as they say - "you can lead it to water - but ya can't teach it how to drink..."
