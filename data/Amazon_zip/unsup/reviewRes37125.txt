Don't go for brunch on a Saturday! You've been warned! We went for brunch at around 11 am before our touristy boat tour, and were pleasantly surprised to find such a nice place right before the pier. We were seated immediately and given menus that looked really interesting. When we were about to order, a couple next to us began to get up and leave muttering "This is ridiculous, absurd!" Then she leaned over and said "Good luck getting your food, we'be been waiting for over an hour, and we still didn't get anything."  So we told the waiter we needed to be on the boat in an hour and half. He said, "No guarantees, right now the wait is about 45 mins to an hour for food because the kitchen is so backed up." He suggested we ordered non cooked food for faster service.  We ended up ordering fruit and pastries, the fruit was about 5 slivers of cut up canteloupe and honeydew, 4 blueberries and 3 blackberries each and came to $4.99 each. That to me, was ABSURD. My cinnamon bun was delish, but the croissant wasn't authentic. Our bill with two coffees and the above came to over $25.00 and we left hungry. Compare that to two coffees, two pastries and a fruit cup at Starbucks and I'm still short $10.00.  Will never go back for the cafe, but the grocery store part of it seemed nice enough.
