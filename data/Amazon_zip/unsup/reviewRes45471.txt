We'd been planning to go to Wilde for quite some time -- mostly because of the name to be honest -- but on the day we happened over there it was a "shit, what are we going to eat? Oh, hey, Wilde!" decision. First of all, as an aesthetically inclined person, their outside decor is GORGEOUS: it's dripping with tactfully combined decorative shrubbery and flowers. Inside they've got a library. I'm sold. It's really (really) loud on the inside, but on the night when we went, it was loud with the Scissor Sisters and Lady Gaga, so we were good. We got one of the round "see and be seen" sort of tables, and a friendly, attentive server who didn't mind that we were giggly and dancing around at the table (note: we were not drinking). The food was a little bit hit or miss, hence the three-star. It's not fantastically Irish, but it's okay: it's got curry chips, the staple of anything masquerading as a pub, and they're as good as anywhere else in the city, and my salmon plate was delicious and fresh with really good brown bread (which was half the reason I ordered it.) My girlfriend didn't love her Bosie Burger, and their menu is short on the vegetarian offerings (who knows, maybe they're just making a statement about Oscar's proclivities), but otherwise pretty decent. Dessert was a little hit and miss too: I liked my blackberry pie, the gf had a sticky toffee pudding which was a little weird. We'll probably return (especially with fellow Wilde-loving friends and/or family, especially if they like alcohol with their meal - the drinks sound good and I don't even drink), but I'd probably head to the Grafton or similar first if I was really craving Irish food.
