I went to this upscale grocery store, and boy oh boy, did this place win me over. It's not as pricy as everyone thinks because the quality matches the price. For $15 I got 30 slices of 3 types of salami, 3 small blocks of gourmet imported cheeses, dried apricots and figs, and a crusty loaf of fresh french bread. It was enough for 2 large charcuterie plates. The cheese man was pretty knowledgeable and recommended some amazing cheeses based on what I told him I liked.
