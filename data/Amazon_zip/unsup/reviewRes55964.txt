This is a great little out of the way authentic Italian restaurant that just makes my mouth water to think about.My wife and I dinned here on the Saturday night before Valentine's Day. We arrived at 6pm and took that last two-top. Four couples came in behind us and had to wait; the place was packed. She had the Salmon on Linguini and I had the Chicken Parmesan on pasta. The pasta was super fresh and obviously home made, the meal was fabulous and the service was impeccable. Cara Mia is one of our top five restaurants in Lincoln Square.
