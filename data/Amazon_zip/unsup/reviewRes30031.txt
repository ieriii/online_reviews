It was cinco de mayo and we were out looking for a nice place to eat and we came across this place. Nothing says cinco de mayo more than Thai food. Really the Mexican restaurant close by had a ridiculous wait so we made our way here. The service was super slow making me question the decision. We sat for at least 20 minutes before anyone came to take our order. I was absolutely starving so I ordered some fried tofu to kick things off and it came with a nice peanut sauce. Then I asked if they could make this broccoli dish meatless and substitute tofu and they were fine with this. I really should have read the menu a little closer because it came with the same sauce as my app and basically the only difference between the two is that my entree came with broccoli. Despite this error on my part, the food was decent overall. I would give it another try and come more prepared for the BYOB as well as reading the entire description on the menu as to not double up again.
