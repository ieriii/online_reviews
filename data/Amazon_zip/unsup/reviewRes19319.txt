Underwhelmed by the experience and the food; it way okay, not great. Came here with a group of girls on a Friday night for a 7pm reservation. The decor was nice; typical for sushi spots around town that'd I've been to. We ordered a bunch of apps to share, but I'd probably skip them next time. We got ceviche, that I wish had more flavor, beef wrapped asparagus which was ill designed as a sharing plate, and some dumplings which were good. The miso soup was good, and I though it was cute how it was served in a cup meant for sipping. After the apps we ordered a bunch of rolls. We each ordered our own but shared as well. i got the special a summer roll. It was pretty disappointing that my roll came out a 5 minutes after someone else's summer roll and a good 15 minutes after the first round of rolls were ordered...not good timing for the delivery of our food. The rolls I sampled were good. Promptly at 9 we were asked to leave as the next party was waiting for the table. We were told this ahead of time when we made the reservation so it wasn't a surprise, but it was a new experience for me. Overall, there are other BYOB sushi spots that I'd probably pick before Coast next time.
