What a gem this place is! Fresh fish abounds - a choice of 16 varieties every day. I most recently had the Arctic Char with diablo shrimp sauce, which came with fresh squash and peppers, along with a delicious potato pancake. I also had the sensational clam chowder, all for $21.95. Our server (Shama?) was wonderful, efficient and hilariously funny, making our visit one to be remembered. And the bananas foster put us over the top. Being "fish people", we will be working our way through all 16 fish items at this charming little place! I hear that the weekend breakfasts are not to be missed, so we will be going for those very soon too. Very small, so be sure to make reservations!
