For under $6 you actually get a great sized meal. Well prepared superdawg with onions pickles mustard hot peppers tomato on top of the box stuffed with the superdawg they fill it with as much fries as they can. The Flavor is there. Its a juicy dawg and the condiments just put it over the top. It gives you an enormous mouthgasm. I would've never expected this from a superdawg!! Drinks: had the pineapple malt and I didn't know i could get 2 mouthgasms that fast!! So good u can feel your life shutting down which is the usual sign that it's might delicious. Next time I come to Chicago this is the place I'm going to right away!! Hands down 10 stars!
