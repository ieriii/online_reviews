I can't really say anything here that hasn't already been said. Simply put, my experience at Alinea was incredible. Every bite had SO much thought put into it. From Black Truffle Explosion (yes, it really is as good as they say), to the Balloon dessert, every course was perfect. As we were leaving, I found myself immensely jealous of everyone still dining who didn't know what courses were to come. I wished I could rewind the clock 3 hours and do it again!
