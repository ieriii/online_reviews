This is a gem of a place, but I highly recommend going at off-times if you plan to talk with the people in your party. The noise level when the place is full leaves my ears ringing in a manner normally reserved for rock concerts. With that said, the food really is rather fantastic. I've been to Mia Francesca many, many times and never had a dish that didn't make me swoon. Their appetizers are especially delightful.
