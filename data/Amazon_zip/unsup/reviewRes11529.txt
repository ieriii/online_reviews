O.M.G. Be careful how much you eat here. The food is so good and rich that I think someone could seriously eat themselves to death here. Went here this morning with a group of friends and besides the longish wait (1hr) it was so good! My whole table split the red velvet pancakes, BLT eggs benedict, and the chorizo, potato omelet. First, the red velvet pancakes. When I tell you that these were the richest most fluffy pancakes I've ever had, please believe me. Wow. They were simply delicious and the fact that they weren't too sweet really allows you to enjoy their flavor. I, like many people love anything red velvet, and these pancakes did not disappoint. But the star of the show was the BLT eggs benedict. They were cooked to perfection AND come with spinach and thick cut apple smoked bacon. I think that's pretty much all you need to know. The omelet with chorizo, avocado and potatoes was huge. The home fries it comes with were spiced just right. I'll definitely come here again when I'm next in Chicago. If you haven't been, do your taste buds a favor and go!
