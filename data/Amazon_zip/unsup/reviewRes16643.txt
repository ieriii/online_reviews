Love Carnivale! It's an amazing space with gorgeous color! I adore the entire vibe there! Some favorites (don't have the official names memorized) -Braised beef on a plaintain chip with a yummy zingy sauce drizzled on top -The skirt steak with rice and a bunch of different sauces pooled on the plate allow for great acidity -Mango margarita was thick and tasted amazing but a bit strong on the liquor (a pro if that's your preference) **The mojitos are pushed by the restaurant but my mother had one and it was so full of leaves she said it felt like she was drinking out of a puddle and it was sort of gross..maybe it was whoever made it that night so look around to see if anyone else has one (they surely will) and go from there Great place for dinner or after work drinks...great for groups!
