i've been here 3 times, so it's about time i review. this place will always hold a place in my heart a) because dale is my favorite top chef b) the first time i came here was for my 29th birthday and c) because dale is my favorite top chef. dale and i have a special relationship (unbeknownst to him). i've seen him about 10 times in the past few years. that's more times than i've seen my sister. no, i'm not stalking. and of course as soon as i walk into the restaurant for the 3rd time, he is standing at the front of the house at the host's podium. i've had awkward conversation with him and i'm hoping he forgot all about that. im SO AWKWARD around celebs. my bff's bday cele (a soPHISticated celebration, that is) and my 3 gfs and i ordered 2 appetizers to split (licorice [salad] and the foie gras). this was first time ever eating foie and i was SO HAPPY. omg. best thing i've eaten in a long, long time.  we all got our own entrees (1 duck, 2 short rib, and i got the pork). the first 2 times i got the short rib and was ALWAYS happy. i mixed it up this time, but i really wished i would have just stuck with my guns and ordered the rib. the pork was good, not awesome. i like my pork at 140deg, a little pink. this was well done. we ordered 2 desserts (corn and apple) to split. i've had the corn before, which was amaze as usual. the apple was great, too. they ordered a bottle of red, too. great place to come, not AS trendy and crowded as you'd think. it's romantic, lovely, and i guarantee you'll see dale - you can make awkward convo, he won't mind.
