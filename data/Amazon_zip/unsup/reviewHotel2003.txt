Love this place!! Had a huge corner room w/ wrap around balcony w/ views of millenium park. Smells new, very clean, which is a huge plus! Husband and I just stayed the night and used almost all the amenities. Drinks in the lounge area, next to the gorgeous fireplce...very relaxing. Dessert in the filini bar, then hot tubbing in the pool area. I also used the gym in the morning, and thought it was the best hotel gym i have ever used! Very reasonably priced, even w/o the groupon price we paid. Also, we parked @ MIllenium garage, which is literally a block and a half away, for only $24, instead of the hotels $46. Would love to return someday
