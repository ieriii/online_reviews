Why do people go out to breakfast? This is a question you may ask yourself, as I have before. I believe that 85% percent of people go out to breakfast because 1. They are hungover or 2. They have off on the weekend and are bored to the point of hunger I went to breakfast today because I was visiting my boyfriend in Chicago and we both decided to avoid manic Monday (yea, I know...I am not adequately represented by my own non-scientific statistics). After being seated promptly (yay Monday), I ordered one of the specials - the brown sugar brioche French toast with warm vanilla bean cream, fresh strawberries and bananas topped with graham cracker crisp. I remembered the whole title (in case you were wondering) because it was the most creative, delicious French toast I have ever had! It tasted like a mixture of angel food cake, creme brulee and uh..french toast! My boyfriend had the breakfast burrito which may seem quite boring at first. However, he was very quick to note how delicious it was, and also he remarked on fresh tasting ingredients. Even the complimentary home fries, seasoned with rosemary, were exquisite. They were the best home fries I have had in Chicago! This place is wonderful and if you are worried about a wait, go on a weekday! Though many might go to breakfast because they are hungover or bored, I will be going because of the Bongo Room!
