Anteprima is probably my most favorite italian restaurant in the andersonville/edgewater neighborhood. It's small, cozy, kinda rambunctious atmosphere is perfect for small get togethers with friends or family. Perfect for a date if you don't mind the close quarters and cacophany of mingled conversations. The food definetly makes up for it. The wine list is fairly full and looks complex if you're unfamiliar with italian wine terminology. Servers have always been patient to explain them or offering recommendations on similar wines not on the list. Most servers have asked if we've dined there before, but there have been a few times when the server just plops the menu down. For the most part the servers are attentive, weekends or busy nights you might have to make extra effort to be noticed.Their dinner menu changes often seasonally or whatever is available from organic and local growers, which makes the experience almost new if you haven't been in awhile. But if you're like me and order the same thing, many of their main dishes like the sliced new york strip with arugula are unchanged and for good reason. Fish main courses constantly change, as I've seen porgy, sea bass, monkfish, and dover sole on their menu. Many of the dishes and appetizers have what appears to be an unsual combination of food stuffs, but when tasted you can tell a great amount of care and effort is given by the chef to make the dish interesting and pleasant, the deviled eggs with lobster and pesto for example. Their dessert menu is small and unspectacular, many of them having a slight tartness in flavor which is actually kinda refreshing to finish off a meal. The restaurant can be busy on almost any given night, so definetly make a reservation online, very convenient. I frequent this place quite often and am always very satisfied with the quality of food and the service has been great most times.
