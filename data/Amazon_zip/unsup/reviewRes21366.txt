One of my top 3 Chicago dogs. Even though the pickled tomato wedges "violate" the standard Chicago dog, I love it -- it's one of several touches that makes Superdawg unique. What the hot dog lacks in "snap" (I don't think they use natural casing for their dogs), it makes up for in beefiness. Man -- the hot dog has a ton of flavor. So tasty. The fries and shakes are top-notch, as well. I love the retro vibe -- Maury and Flaury on the roof, the drive-in service, and the 50s (I think) design of the building/decor...all good. The only downside (and this is the downside to any popular spot) is that it gets pretty crowded.
