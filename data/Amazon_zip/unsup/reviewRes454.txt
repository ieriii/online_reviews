Did the 23 course tour and it was the best dining experience I've ever had. It did take 4 1/2 hours but every dish was unique and something I've never had before. Every dish was an adventure. The presentation was outstanding. Service was superb. Also did the wine tour and tasted some of the best wines I've ever had.  It was expensive but you're paying for a 4 hour experience and adventure in food that you're not going to get anywhere else. Well worth it!
