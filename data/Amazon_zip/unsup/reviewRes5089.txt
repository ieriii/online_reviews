A perfect lunch dining on swine and wine! i am sold! The 45 min wait was really a 20 min wait and our waiter was attentive, prompt, and had great recommendations. We picked the perfect courses to "pig" out on.  1. Pig ear with egg and kale---fried ear smothered in an egg yolk, it was delish 2. Eggplant caponata with goat cheese---our favorite dish!  3. Milk braised pork shoulder w/ mashed potatoes---pork as soft as the potatoes, tasty 4. Mussels--this is a pig restaurant, it was okay but i'll stick to pig next time Something I was eyeing on other people's tables was the MARROW. Next time, next time, I promised myself. Our wine (a Riesling) made everything all the more enjoyable. The atmosphere was busy and bustling!  All the dishes look so tasty so be bold, take chances, and please do NOT make the timid sad mistake of ordering a PANINI (two paninis!) like the table next to us.
