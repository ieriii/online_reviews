Tourist trap. When they first opened the staff seemed miserable. Good enough reason to avoid it, although they are supposedly good for fish and chips. A year later, the bar staff seemed normal. Progress indeed! Sadly, the food was LACKING. Gastro-pub blah blah, everything on the menu is way heavy. Not a single half-light or slightly forgiving option. Heart attacks indeed. Love - egg appetizer. Not intended to be healthy and gosh, YUM. I can forgive a lot just for that delight. But..... Why was my sausage dinner so miserably heavy? I don't know what I ate cause the sausages weren't defined. Worse, they were FRIED for service. Same with the mac and cheese. Not deep fried but still seriously fried for service warm up.  Really? Anytime I can taste the oil for prepared food someone has cheaped out or otherwise jacked up innocent local delights. Shame on them. Two stars cause of the sausage treat and happier-appearing staff. I'm being nice.
