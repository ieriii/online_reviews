Wonderful experience all around. The service and atmosphere were top notch and the food is delicious. We sat at the sushi bar and the sous chef michael really took care of us. Our server Nolan was professional, warm, and very attentive, great explanation of the menu. We ate the dragon roll, lobster and wagyu roll, and baked seafood roll. I am now addicted to the dragon roll!!!! YUM. I can't wait to come back!
