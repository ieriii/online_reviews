Cons: -Their taco shells are fried. Come on? Can you think of anything unhealthier than this? Maybe it's just me but I don't like it. -The catfish REALLY tasted like fish. I'm talking about memories coming back from my teenage years when I would catch fish from the lake and eat it only to discover it tasted... well... FISHY. -The floor is disgustingly slippery. You'll see.  Pros: -Everything else is really good. Mole is delicious. They give you a little appetizer and chips/salsa in the beginning of the meal. -BYOB and great service.  Pros are enough to keep me coming back. I've been here many many times and it's still enjoyable. I'll skip on the tacos and catfish entree next time and try to wear shoes with a lot of grip.
