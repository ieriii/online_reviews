I went here for a special occasion recently. We went on a Weds. to try and avoid crowds. That didn't work as we had to wait about an hour and a half. We half expected this, so it really wasn't a big deal; however, the hostess' were pretty unfriendly\rude. The food was great. I had the Weds. special, which is suckling pig. I've had suckling pig once before in Spain and it was gross. Here is was most excellent. Very tender and flavorful. Others in my party had soup, tacos and fish. Everyone liked there food to varying degrees. The prices were reasonable for a restaurant that has such a reputation. There are sooo many Mexican places in Chicago, that I'd like to try a few more before I crown this one the king. Don't get me wrong, my food was very good, but it wasn't the best I've ever eaten or anything.
