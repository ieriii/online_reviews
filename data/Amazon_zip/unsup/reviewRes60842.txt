I was a ZED451 virgin until this past weekend. I was throughly impressed with the staff, the atmosphere and the amazing salad and cheese bar. The meat selections were fabulous and any foodie HAS to try this place. I'm anxious to return and try their infamous brunch-- I hear the eggs benedict are the best in town!Also, the wine selection is great.
