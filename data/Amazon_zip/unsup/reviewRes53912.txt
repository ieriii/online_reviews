I know that what I am about to write has all been said already, about this gem of a foodie heaven... But I feel like I need to express my heart felt feelings for my [gushing] NEW LOVE.... ohhh purple pig, I want to scribble your name all over my notebook like a blushing school girl.... I am often in Chicago for business, so try hard to get a taste of the dining scene as much as possible. .. I heard about this semi new place last week when I landed, and I had tunnel vison about coming to try it...I finally got the chance on a Sunday for lunch. The look right away made me like I was going to love the place... communal tables, wine barrels, & pigs everywhere. The bar had hand painted looking pottery with forks, knives and spoons in them, which added to the home feel. When I looked at the menu, I was slightly disappointed that some of the items from the on line menu, were not present. I was looking forward to sheep's milk ricotta with gravy. What we did order was the sardines, bone marrow, quail, cheese platter, pigs ears, & baby artichokes. Everything was to die for, I wanted to order more but honestly was so full I couldn't even eat past the pain. Though I do like the pigs ears from Michael's genuine food & drink in Miami better...I also now have a new love for La rossa, Italian beer.On my second visit ( one day later! ha) I only went for some drinks at the bar.. I decided now might be the only time I actually would have room for dessert.I decided on the panni that had nutella, marshmallow, and banana. My first bite immediately transported me back to my childhood... I'm 9 years old and my grandmother just made me a peanut butter, banana, and fluff sandwich.... ahhhh good times.Anyway, I hope to go to the purple pig at least two more times while I am in town...  But after that purple pig.. I will only see you in my dreams...
