My husband and I had a fantastic time at Mastro's last night! We arrived an hour early so that we could sit at the bar (beautiful back wall made from sorted color alcohol bottles) and have a drink. We ordered Manhattans and they were quite large (score!) and delicious. The bartender was very attentive, filling our glasses every few minutes. The restaurant attendant found us when it was time to move to a table, and we ended up sitting in the back corner in the bar area; it was so cozy and romantic. The food was excellent! We ordered: *Oysters Rockefeller *Smoked Salmon *12 oz. Filet (great crust on the outside, tender and juicy inside) *24 oz. Porter House (this was a huge cut of meat!) *Scalloped Potatoes (so cheesy and delicious) *Sauteed Asparagus (with a hint of garlic) *Butter Cake Dessert (OMG - this was outstanding and worth the trip alone - the warm cake and the cool ice cream rocked my world) As you can probably guess from the massive list of food above, we left feeling very full and satisfied. The bill was a bit steep (about $240), but in my opinion, totally worth it! I'd recommend this restaurant for a fun date night with your significant other. Enjoy!
