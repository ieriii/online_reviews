Las Tablas has excellent Colombian food including the fabulous "Matrimonio" dish witch includes chicken, steak, gineo, yuca and platano....its excellent! My girlfriend brought me here and it was fantastic....and they also have a full selection of liquor! Very good service....Just too crowded sometimes...
