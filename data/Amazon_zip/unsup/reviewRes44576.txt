Delicious pizza. Fast service. Friendly staff. We ordered a Stuffed Chicago Classic which was cheese, sauce, mushrooms, pepperoni, onions and green peppers. We added sausage. Savory sauce flavored with oregano, basil and pecorino. The crust was crisp on the sides and chewy on the bottom. It was not in any way soggy or under cooked. Plentiful amounts of meat and vegetables. Incredible amount of cheese, thought I'm not complaining. I love cheese. Delicious. No complaints at all.
