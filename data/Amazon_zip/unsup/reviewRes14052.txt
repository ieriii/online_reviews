A group of friends and I were in town for the homecoming game of our alma mater, which sadly, ended in a devastating loss. Happily, we drowned our sorrows in Revolution's craft beer selection and noshed on five of their pizzas. My two favorites were their Autumn Harvest (butternut squash, goat cheese, cauliflower, and a molasses gastrique) Twice Baked Potato pizzas. Trust me, we all fought for those slices. It's places like this that make me miss living in Chicago.
