I can't tell you how excited I am to be moving less than a block away from Simply It. The food is consistent, authentic, and you have to admire how passionate the owner is. The last time I ordered in, I was surprised to find a little clamshell of fresh fruit included along with a nice letter from the owner thanking the community for their support. A few times before that, they threw in a free smoothie. I've still never been in the restaurant so the five stars is based solely on delivery. Food is always delivered within the given time frame (usually earlier) and hot foods come piping hot. I still wish they offered a larger selection of noodle soups but I understand that this is more of a higher end Vietnamese restaurant, not a down and dirty noodle house.
