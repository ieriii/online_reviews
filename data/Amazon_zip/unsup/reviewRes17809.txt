I took the advice of a few Yelpers and ordered the pork shoulder. Wow were they right. Absolutely delicious. As a side, I split the mac and four cheese which was also fantastic. It was definitely big--could have been an entire meal. I tried my friend's barramundi which was very good, and I'm not really a fish person. Overall I'd love to come back!
