Loved it! I'm so glad this place opened in the neighborhood--it reminds me very much of my favorite whiskey bar/gastropub in SF (Alembic). Four of us went on their second day open--food and service were amazing. We arrived around 6:30-ish and were told the wait would be about 30 minutes. We got some drinks and hung out over by the kitchen and 30 minutes later, our table was ready. Since it was their second day, I was expecting service hiccups. Nope! Our apps, mains, and dessert (you HAVE to get the choco/banana bread pudding) all arrived perfectly on time and tasting great. Food highlights: scallops/oxtail/gnocchi, kobe burger, sweetbreads...YUM! I need to come back for the bone marrow for sure. I can't wait to go back to try everything else on the menu.
