Shaw's really did a great job rolling out the red carpet for my birthday.  I think they were more excited about it then I was. I love to celebrate special occasions with seafood, it really makes me feel decadent. Even better, I get my mama to pay for it! Going to shaw's made it feel like I was cheating on my favorite lover, Joe's stone crab. It has a similar feel in the main dining room. Our waiter was very enthusiastic and explained the menu throughly. Although his spiel was scripted I felt that he was really was devoted to my seafood needs. I had the oysters Rockefeller, a seafood platter consisting of sea scallops, garlic shrimp and crab cake. They even threw in a free creme brulee for my special day. What impressed me the most is that my mom didn't complain about a single thing, which is amazing because she is such a harsh critic. Hmm, maybe i should get her to join yelp.
