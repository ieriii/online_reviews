RJ Grunts is becoming one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. I order the same thing every time I come in, ribs and chicken wings. I'm not sure what they put in their bbq sauce, but it's sweet and tangy. It always hits the spot and I only order things on the menu that use it. I have never had their salad bar, because there's not time to eat greens when their ribs are fall off the bone tender and their wings are crispy and big.  Also, I always order the cup of soup that is priced at the outside temp. Each on if their soups are great - tomato is the best. If you like dessert, the cookie sundae thing looks great. I'm always too full from meat and beer after a meal. Their prices are reasonable for the food quality and portions. Be ready to wait in line any weekend. Finally, if you happen to come here on a Sunday, get the bloody marry. They have specials on it all day and it's damn good. Bring your buddies, grandma, friend, whoever - this place is for everyone.
