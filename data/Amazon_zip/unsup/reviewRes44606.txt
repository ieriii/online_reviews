the goodies are pretty much all delicious, with a few standouts amongst the crowd (key lime bar OHMYGOD). there's outdoor seating, as well as an adjacent room where people can drink their coffee &/or get themselves stabbed if they forget to silence their phone. alliance's dine-in clientele are bookish at best, zombie-like at worst, & that side room is a MORGUE OF SILENCE where the slightest cough can elicit A THOUSAND YEARS OF STINK-EYE. speaking of stink eye, it would seem that they've recently hired on a slew of new baristas, a couple of whom are working on their masters in 'TUDE. really? your conversation on doggie biscuits was that vital? oh, fret not. you totally got me good with this warm "iced" coffee. i'm feeling the passive aggressive burn, don't worry. i'll never interrupt again.  my visits here have become fewer & farther in between since the new hires came, as i really don't enjoy being treated like a troll that just crawled out from under a bridge. but those key lime bars...well, at least i've cut down.
