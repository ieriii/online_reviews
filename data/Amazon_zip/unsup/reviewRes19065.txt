The beer list is AMAZING! The price of the entrees(burgers and sandwiches) is decent as well. The wine selection is very limited and quite expensive for the pour. The french fries are grand. They can be topped with different flavors. The veggie burger selections looked much better than they tasted. It also fell apart upon the first bite. Don't think I'll go back for a meal but might go back for the fries and a beer.
