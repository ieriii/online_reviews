First time at Mastro's. Food was delicious. I had the halibut and my date had a filet. We ordered a few sides but the cream of corn was my favorite. It was so tasty! The we had the butter cake......it is heaven! If you go, you have to get it!  Our server was really nice a helpful with the menu. The only reason I won't give this place a five star was the bussing. Our table sat with empty drinks and wine glasses that we did not use. When I went to the bathroom, the garbage was overflowing and paper towels were all over the floor. A place as nice as this should have someone checking the washrooms. I will go back again for sure!
