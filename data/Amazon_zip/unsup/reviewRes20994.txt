I was in town for the 2009 Chicago Tri and stopped in here based on a suggestion from the concierge because I couldn't access my Yelp!!! Great choice for a lunch spot. The atmosphere was sophisticated yet relaxed and our bartender, Chi (sp), promised us that he had been eating the mussels at least twice a week for 2 years straight. After trying my first Fat Tire and allowing us to sample a few other new drafts we ordered the mussels, the steak salad and chicken salad. My lunch was the steak salad which was cooked a perfect medium and was served with mint and watermelon. This was one of the most interestingly delicious salads I have had that catered to both my sweet and salty taste buds. When I first saw the mussels on the menu I kind of blew them off because we were in the middle of the country and I've never heard that Chicago is known for its seafood. My girlfriend's dad said they were the best he has ever had! I got to sample a few and they were really, really good but I'm still partial to some others. The chicken salad was also a good lunch order but the specifics escape me because I didn't eat it but did get to sample the chicken, which was very tender and tasty. Overall, because of the level of service we received, the free beer that someone accidentally poured wrong and the multiply samples we also were allowed to taste, this place made my day.
