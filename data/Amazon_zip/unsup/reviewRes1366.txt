Even on a Wednesday, two hours before closing, it was a packed house w/a 30 minute line out the door.  Ordered: 1 Classic, very good, but without the nice 'snap', awesome fixin's 1 Duck, very good w/the gouda. 1 Antelope, OK, spicy sweet, cheese overpowered.  1 Goat, the loser of the day, the Caribbean flavors were totally off & the Pepto color was off putting. About $25 for all the dogs plus a soda on tap, weird no bottled water or unsweetened iced tea. I guess those are a little too healthy for an encased meat joint? Wait, I take it back, add another $40 on top for the roundtrip cab ride from the hotel. Hours 10am-4pm, Duck Fat Fries are only served on Fridays & Saturdays. May be able to avoid lines w/a phone order, minimum $25. I liked this place, I didn't feel heavy at all and loved the pillowy soft bun! Doug works hard w/a smile, holding down his fort & taking care of biz.
