I accidentally ran into this place during the Do-Division Festival and it was a very pleasant surprise - especially for a girl who is very indecisive about breakfast! So, imagine to my surprise a breakfast/brunch menu item called The Indecision! A great combination of eggs (any way), sausage/bacon/ham (I suggest the sausage), a crepe (chocolate please!) and a slider-sized stuffed french toast. The Wild Berry french toast, but it was probably enhanced by the loads of chocolate from the crepe. Overall....muy bien!
