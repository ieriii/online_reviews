Now I know why my coworker from Chicago isn't to fond of deep dish pizza. I watched show, after show praising this style of pie, so I was eagerly anticipating my first slice. It tasted just like any other mediocre pizza I've had, but with more cheese, and a bigger crust. The only other time I've had a deep dish was from a pizzeria in my hometown, and it was 10X better than this. It definitely should have been the other way around. Next time, I'll look elsewhere. Hopefully I'll change my mind.
