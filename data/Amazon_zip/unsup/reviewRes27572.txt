I came here on a recommendation from the people at Pilsen's 2nd Friday art crawl, and I was not impressed. I've heard such good things about it, that I think maybe I just ordered the wrong things, but I had a few different dishes, and I just didn't like the food very much. The waitstaff was nice and the meals came with some kind of stew as an appetizer, but I just wasn't crazy about the food.
