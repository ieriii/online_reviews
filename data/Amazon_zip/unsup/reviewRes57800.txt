At first I was so excited to find a decent brunch place in Bridgeport that I didn't worry at all about the prices. Stuffed french toast and delicious variations on eggs benedict? Perfect! But I was a little disappointed that I paid so much for such a tiny glass of apple juice - especially when the Mexican restaurant down the street offers three times the amount freshly squeezed juice for the same price. BUT the atmosphere is great, and sometimes that can make all the difference. I can't wait to try the dinner menu everyone is raving about!
