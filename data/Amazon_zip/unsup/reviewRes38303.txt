Words can't properly describe how I feel about this bar. It's the equivalent of my beloved wife in a restaurant...nearly perfect in every way. This is seriously my favorite bar in the world. The only way they could conceivably improve would be to ban smoking. I would consider this a gastropub; the caliber of its food is amazingly good. Best mussels in town and a nueske ham sandwich that will blow you away. Oh, and the fries are also among the very best in the city...served thin and fresh with delicious garlic aioli. Did I mention that it has the best Belgian beer selection in the city too? On tap no less! I cannot recommend this highly enough...you must, must go here. Immediately. Oh, one addition: everyone says the apple fritters are really good and they're only just ok. Skip them and get another triple karmeliet.
