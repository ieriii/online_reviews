Everything is very well done, from the food to the decor to the drinks to the fact that tables of four get to eat in little faux pens fenced off from the rest of the dining room. While the dining room itself is quite impressive, the attraction is obviously the food. What I was most impressed with: -Hamachi crudo: I will admit that I did not notice the "chocolate persimmon" that i now see on the online menu as a part of this dish. Nevertheless this was a beautiful piece of rich tuna, enveloped in a crisp citrusy glow with the freshness of cilantro on the tail end of your bite. This dish is a huge winner -Scallops: An absurdly novel concept; they sear scallops and serve them with some pickled carrots and onions, on a cumin-spiced hummus. The three components go together very nicely, with the sour vinegary crunch of the vegetables playing off the creamy chickpeas surprisingly well. -Brussels sprouts: I'm not sure how they cook these, but they shred them and dress them with a lemon vinaigrette and toss them with parmesan and other vegetables before serving them on top of a nice rich piece of burrata. I am confident I would not have recognized the brussels sprouts in this dish if I didn't know what I had ordered. We also enjoyed a broccoli dish with quinoa, a sampler of oysters, and a beautiful fatty piece of pork belly. If there was one miss at our table, it was, disappointingly the aged ham served with goat butter. We had the quercia rossa ham (the mildest of the three, basically a fattier prosciutto), and while it was delicious (and the goat butter absurdly rich and creamy), I found the peasant bread it was served with to be a clunky accompaniment that was too thick to really enjoy a single piece of ham on. Thinner pieces of toasted bread would be an easier pair. Still, they do pork and seafood equally well here, and I can't wait to come back for a more expansive taste of the menu.
