absolutely wonderful--went last night with a few people. wine list is, expectedly, fabulous for an enoteca. they are pretty good at helping you select a wine if you are wanting to get a little more adventurous. then, the food! delicious--had the ricotta/honeycomb (as good as everyone says, addictive--couldn't stop eating, but there was so much to follow!), the truffled egg toast with asparagus (yum, but anything with truffles wins in my book), the pork ragu with creamy polenta (so delicious), the pizza with truffles (again--amazing), risotto carbonara (delicious, but sadly at this point i was running out of steam) and the linguine with crab and sea urchin (i really liked it a lot, but other table members felt that it was the least impressive.) it's a small plates set up, so come ready to order a few and share. it's actually quite affordable and the bill came to about $20 pp + tip (for all that including some alcohol) and you leave stuffed. i found the food to be filling but not fatty or greasy--more like very light and fresh, even with the dishes that would be heavier (like the polenta/pork ragu).  regarding the service, i found it to be attentive, fun and informative--our waiter did a great job helping us sort through the different choices. we were checked on regularly, but in an unobtrusive way--the way it should be! and to make an already amazing experience just that much better, the lovely waitstaff brought over a selection of liqueurs for us to try...on the house. and then left the bottles for us on the table to sample further. :) totally unexpected and tons of fun. apparently one of the owners thought we were having a lot of fun and wanted to make sure we had an even better time? who knows...but i know i definitely plan to return! :)
