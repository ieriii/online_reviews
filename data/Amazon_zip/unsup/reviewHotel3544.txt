Room and location was adequate. Would not call it a four star judging by the nicer hotels in the neighbourhood. The service was fine. It is noisy from the hospital, but it's downtown I expect noise. Big PEEVE was that they charge a dollar a minute for LOCAL calls. Really? I expect more in a four star. I'm not going to use my cell phone to call and make ticket reservations locally.
