I had been wanting to try this place for awhile after reading all the positive reviews here and I wasn't disappointed.  My margarita was delicious (and strong) and the server was very nice about making my pregnant friend a virgin margarita (he even suggested getting a flavored margarita to her since the traditional would have been pretty sour). I had the #1 combo which included a taco, tostada, and a cheese enchilada. The taco and tostada were outstanding, the enchilada was pretty good, although I may have just been too full from the rest of the food by the time I got there. I will be back to try the patio in the summer.
