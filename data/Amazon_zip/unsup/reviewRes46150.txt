I don't know about you guys, but I loved i!!! I went here for the first time recently and want to go back. It made me want to recommend this place to my friends and family. It is a great place to have dinner for a special occasion. I ordered the Sunday Night pasta (no mushrooms) it was delicious. My significant other ordered chicken royal it was super delicious. *yes I love to take food samples from my boyfriend's plate. Who doesn't* Anyways for dessert we had this huge sundae like cup. Oh my gosh I want one right now. The Whip Cream was nice and thick, the ice cream was phenomenal, and the chocolate fudge was so rich yet not too sweet it was perfect. oh and it came with caramelized nuts. This sundae is to die for. So all in all.... pros: Large food portions Great service Nice decor Good Food cons: Long wait on weekends NO Reservations can be made on weekends.
