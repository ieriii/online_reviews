First visit (01/09) - had empanada, raspberry mojito, arranchera, guatamalan chicken and brownie.  The empanada was incredible.  The arranchera was as good as it gets oh and the roasted brussel sprouts were incredible.  We got there ahead of opening and watched the bartenders hand squeeze so many limes my hands were hurting.   Second visit - (02/09)since we had not tried the guacamole,looked incredible, we decided we had to go back.  The guacamole was even better than we expected.  It was as good as we have had in Mexico.  The kona ceviche was to die for.  My husband had the pork belly special coated in quinoa, which was tender and delicious.  I had the churrasco, which was the best I have had.  To top this all off we had blueberry tres leches cake with basil cream.  It was so delicious and fresh.  I don't know how to explain this place other than to say it is great.  I would recommend it for a special occasion or just a date night.  Oh, Monday is mojitos night and Tuesday guac night - we will be back. **another great visit to Carnivale.  We finally brought our sons for a gentleman's evening out, which included my 4 year old in a t-shirt and tie.  The kona kampachi never ceases to amaze me.  It is soooo delicious.  I had the chuleta, which was just the right amount of salt and sweet.  Husband had the arrachera, which is always awesome and son had pollo billy, which he loves.  We also tried two of the cheeses, which is a new thing on their menu.  We had the little darling cheddar, which is outstanding and the mount enebro, which is the best goat cheese I have ever had.   I am still loving this place!!!!
