The Purple Pig was soooooo good!! We loved it here! They had an awesome Muscato Wine that I was very happy with and lovely food options!! The cheese selection was fabulous and I really enjoyed their pate as well. I am not sure what made their bread amazing, but it was so tasty and went well with everything! I have to say that I fell in love with their American Waygu! Simply amazing! It was so delicious and melt-in-your-mouth amazingness! Thumbs up! Five stars simply to their yummy steak! Whether you are here for a night out, dinner, first date, dessert and drinks - The Purple Pig will satisfy everyone!!
