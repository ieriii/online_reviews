Short, sweet and to the point: Excellent slices; great quick lunch; my only gripe is that they tend to overdo the cheese. If I were ordering a full pizza for delivery I'd ask for "easy cheese." They deliver during the lunch hour - not always the case with pizza joints, even those that are open during lunch. I hope they pay their delivery people well because these folks are definitely appreciated (and probably have the tips to prove it)! The counter guy is just so cool, and refreshingly free of 'tude!
