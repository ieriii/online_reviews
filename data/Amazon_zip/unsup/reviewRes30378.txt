Me = carnivore. Chicago Diner = vegan, gluten-free restaurant Yet.... I love this place. We managed to beat the dinner rush and were seated right away upon arriving at around 5:30 on a Friday evening. By the time everyone in the party had arrived (around 6:30), the place had filled up, with a fairly long line outside the diner. Our waiter was very nice and very patient and the food was great (even without meat!!). We got the nachos and chips and guac as appetizers, and I got the portabello caesar wrap as my entree. There weren't as many mushrooms in the wrap as I thought (and hoped) there would be, but it was still very tasty. Their black bean burger, gluten-free enchiladas, and mid-eastern platter(?) were delish as well according to my friends. Then came.... the dessert menu. Cheesecake is my weakness. Chicago Diner's cheesecakes are wow (I highly recommend their chocolate chip cheesecake. Hands down some of the best cheesecake I've had in awhile). Despite not getting my daily fix of yummy cholesterol-laden meat, I still thoroughly enjoyed my experience at Chicago Diner. Everything there was very flavorful and well prepared and their desserts are to die for. That and the waitstaff seem to genuinely enjoy their job and are there by choice - not circumstance. They're helpful and nice (and some are kinda cute =P). If you're ever around Boystown, stop by for a meal, or at least grab some cake to go! You won't regret it.
