Yum! I went to Sprout last weekend and had an amazing dinner! I got the foie gras, ono and beet and also got the wine pairing with it. Amazing flavor combinations served in a different way. Decent portion sizes, by the end of the meal, we were stuffed! The ambiance was great and our server was nice and knowledgeable. I'm a Top Chef fan so seeing Dale by the bar smoozing with patrons was also kinda fun. I'd highly recommend this place and can't wait for the opportunity to go back!
