Great authentic food, friendly staff, no complaints. The place is a bit small but I never felt like I was overcrowded in there, in makes for a nice intimate environment with friends or family. Besides when it's warmer out they have outdoor seating, but regardless once you taste the food I doubt anything else would matter.off top, my favorite items on the menu is their Ceviche, I also like their onion steak, and their finger licking Tostones with the warm authentic homemade warm fresh garlic sauce (when they delivered it once the sauce was cold, not as good though)They are one of my favorite go to spots in Chicago, I recommend.
