I came here on Tuesday for their half priced burgers and IT WAS WORTH IT. I had a prior engagement so my boyfriend and his roommate went beforehand to reserve a table. They don't let people in unless the entire party is there. Okay, that's fine. They ordered their burgers and waited for me. Upon arrival, my burger was already waiting for me. I had ordered the federales burger. It's a beef patty with chorizo, peppers and an egg. I couldn't finish it all. I had half and I quit. Haha. I cut it into quarters and it was still difficult to fit it into my mouth. But overall, it was very good. The fries were nice and salty. The beer was cold and the backyard patio had a good atmosphere. The service was alright. Nothing bad. Just standard. I would definitely return here again for their burgers.
