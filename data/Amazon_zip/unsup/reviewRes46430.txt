I am a big fan of the food here! The portions are massive, and the food tasty. I went there with one of my friends, and we managed to get a window table right alongside Michigan Ave...what a view! I had the chicken breat dish...which was good, but it was so large that i could not finish it! I had to knock a few starts off this review because of the waiting situation at this place. It is simply chaotic in this place waiting for table. They need a larger waiting area, and need to streamline their process a bit. We just waited outside on the street...but had to stand around for about 45 minutes. But, the wait was worth it!
