Came here on a Thursday night for dinner with three other girls. I'm a fan of the Rockit venues and this was my first time at Sunda with pretty big expectations.Friendly staff. Great enviornment. Great decor. Amazing food.Grabbed a drink at the bar first, around 6pm. Drinks are delicious, but not very strong. About $12 or $14 bucks, don't remember, but pretty average for the area.As for dinner...Rock Shrimp Tempura, Baked Snow Crab Handroll, Sunda Rainbow Roll and "The Number Ten". We shared everything and it was all amazing. Literally my mouth waters just thinking about "The Number Ten".. Some of the best sushi I have ever had..We also had a bottle of wine and edamame.Came out to about $40/$45 each without tip.Which is about $20 less than I was expecting to pay.Anyway, I will be back soon, that's for sure.
