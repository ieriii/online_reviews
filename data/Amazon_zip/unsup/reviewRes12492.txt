I finally returned to Piece last night! The Octoberfest beer is great! I've been here a few times now and I can say that the food here is consistently good. I love their salads too. The field greens salad is delicious. I'm not a huge fan of gorgonzola but theirs is so creamy and not super sharp. This night we had two pizzas: one white with tomatoes and basil and the other sausage and ricotta. We couldn't decide which one was better - they were both great.  We arrived a little after 6 pm sat at the bar for a drink (I was lucky to find one seat) and had one drink before getting seated. There are many tvs located throughout the room so that we could catch the hawks, bulls and baseball playoffs while enjoying our meal. I would caution that if you have a problem with crowds friday night is not a good time to come. Our table was again closer to the door and there really isn't much space to wait for tables so we were a bit crowded by people standing in the area of our table. I decided last night that people watching is all part of the experience and adds to the fun of Piece. I also want to note that the owner did contact me to respond to my previous review which I thought was great customer service. I feel bad that I took so long to try it again!
