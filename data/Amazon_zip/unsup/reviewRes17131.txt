Disclaimer: First time I ever ate Indian food. Apparently this is the best Indian buffet in the city, but I did not care for it. $20 bucks after tax and tip to eat the buffet was pretty pricey. They had three meat options, which were not that meaty. The best thing I had was the mango ice cream. I also get the pleasure of smelling like Indian food for the rest of the day. I probably won't go back because I don't think Indian food is for me.
