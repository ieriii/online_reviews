Biggest disappointment in a long time. Schizo atmosphere. Lots of LA wannabes quaffing good beer they could get at half the price somewhere else. For good beer skip this joint, save a pile, and go to the map room, clark st. ale house or the longroom. For good food AND good beer go to the hopleaf. Seriously. Our server said the ham was the signature dish. That is what we got. 33$ later we got 3 slices of bread, some butter, and 3 ounces of ham. 1/3 of that was the thin sliced equivalent of "the waffle house" salt pork, only saltier. And, if you want service in a reasonable amount of time, go someplace else. Look around and you see lots of people wondering where their server is. I know they are only a month old, but it felt like opening night; no signs that things are going to come together soon. In summary, no matter what you are looking for, this place doesn't have it, go elsewhere.
