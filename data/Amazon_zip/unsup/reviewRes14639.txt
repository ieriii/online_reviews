A week in advance, I booked a reservation for 15 on a Friday night. Seeing as though I had only heard great things, but never been inside, I was making a reservation to be cautious and courteous. I never knew this place was as large as it was!  I walked up to the host desk at 7:45 pm and was told "It's not 8pm yet." That really left a bad taste in my mouth. You could sense the host's frustration over a busy night. Nowadays, you'd think a restaurant would welcome any business! In the meantime, til about 8:40, our party of 13 stood in the front waiting room, even witnessing a man not get service in a front table and leave. It was an odd feeling, I don't like being able to read that the servers are overwhelmed. Any who, we were seated in the very back room around 8:40. By then we were anxious to eat and aggravated at how LOUD this place was. Food began to get served, we had clam apps and the french bread pizza that is served to the tables, all were talked about as tasty! Several different things were ordered including salmon, risotto, the gnocchi special and chicken marsala and vesuvio. My dad is obsessed with Chicken Cacciatore and said he was so pleased with his meal! (that's rare that someone gets it just right to his liking!) It's a double edged sword, it's such a long wait and so noisy because people pack the place in and really enjoy the food. If you're looking for quiet and romantic I would stay away from this place on a peak weekend night! If you're open to the challenge of yelling over other people and being in a dark room, check it out---- 4 stars for food 2 stars for host service at front desk 4 stars for waiter service/personality. Overall, I'm giving it 3 stars---
