Amazing Food! Seriously Rick is the man when it comes to Mexican! I love that he is always at the restaurant and that he is so hands on! I grew up in Texas and my friends from home all think that I am crazy because I brag about this place being better than some of their favorites. Then when they visit and I take them they are all believers. This place truly is amazing and if you have the chance to go you are a fool if you don't take it!
