Maybe my boyfriend and I just came in on an off night, because I'm trying to figure out why everyone is falling over themselves talking about how good this place is. Because really, it's kind of disappointing. I had the burger and fries. The fries were wayyy too salty. How hard is it to make tasty fries? How hard is it for the chef to try one before he sends the plate out? The burger was quite yummy, until I got to the last 3 or 4 bites which were very peppery. I'm talking about chunks of black pepper in those last few bites. Bleh. That was too bad, because that perfectly pink burger was delicious until I got to that part. My boyfriend had the scallops. He said they were incredibly tasty scallops, however all that was on his plate was 2 verrryyy tiny scallops. 2 ridiculously small scallops for $12? C'mon, get off your high horse Longman & Eagle. I wouldn't recommend this place, even though I really wanted to like it.
