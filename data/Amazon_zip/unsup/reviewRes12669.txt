I've been to a few different Brazilian steak houses over the years and I must say this might be the best. The cuts were all delicious and perfectly seasoned, the sides of mashed potatoes and plantains were amazing, and their salad/antipasti bar has so much variety there's something there for everyone! Oh and a little secret: if they have it, their lobster bisque is the best!  All the servers are very attentive and friendly, I never had to ask for my glass to be filled once! And the decor of the restaurant is very elegant and cozy at the same time. One nice attraction is the wine racks and the aerialists. If you can ask your host to sit you near the wine racks it'll add to your awesome experience at Texas de Brazil. Be prepared to pay a hefty bill but for a special dinner with great company it's well worth the price! One tip: sign up for their email list, they will send you awesome coupons like a free meal for your birthday and wedding anniversary!
