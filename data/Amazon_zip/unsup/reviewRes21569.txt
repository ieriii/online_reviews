I have only eaten here once, so I guess take this review with that in mind. I had the pepito sandwich and a lemonade. The sandwich was just OK to me, I found nothing remarkable about it, other than the amount of time I had to wait to get it. Though I did not try the soups, I have heard those are what people really like. In any case, if you are walking by XOCO and are tempted to drop in for a 13 dollar sandwich, I would say skip it, eat at your Mexican hole in the wall joint or one of the more authentic places.
