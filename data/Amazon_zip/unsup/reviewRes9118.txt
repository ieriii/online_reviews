yum! if it wasn't for me being post-GI distress, i would have gone crazy at this place. everything was quite delicious. my friend and i got rib eye and chicken with dill rice, and our 3rd party got green beans cooked in saffron and cinnamon and all sorts of other delights. both were delicious! also, the new decor is quite inviting. the owner was going around making sure everyone was happy and slightly drunk, but our waitress was kind of absent. we had to wait 25 mins for our bill! that is my main gripe. food wise though, this place is a winner!
