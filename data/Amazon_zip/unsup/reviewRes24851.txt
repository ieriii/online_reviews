This restaurant came highly recommended to me and it did not disappoint at all. I had never tried Costa Rican food before but after my meal here I became a quick fan. We started with the guacamole appetizer which was a huge portion and very good with tomatos and crushed jalapeno salsa on the side. For my entree I ordered the steak tica, which came with steak, onions, peppers, tomatos, plantains, rice and beans and cabbage salad. The steak and rice were incredibly flavorful, and the combination of different textures and salty and sweet on the plate made it hard to stop eating. The portions are huge and I took half of it home. For dessert I ordered the oatmeal shake based on the rave reviews it got...it was delicious. Overall a wonderful inexpensive meal.
