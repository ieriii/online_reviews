Excellent food, friendly ambiance, cheerful staff, clever concept and menu. That's how I sum up XOCO. I ordered 2 tortas to try. First was their saturday's daily special, Goat barbacoe with pasilla-tomato salsa, avocado, and cilantro. Second order was Ahogada pork carnitas with black beans, tomato broth, and spicy arbol chile sauce. All I can say is they're both super delicious. I enjoyed the texture, the flavor, the salsa, the pairing, and the presentation. The price may be a little intimidating for some but you can't compare something like this to typical sandwich chain restuarant. I think it's well worth the price for ingredients and work they put in. The seating is little cramped and the place is small. The line could get quite long during lunch hour but the food was served quickly (less than 15 min when I visited). That's pretty good considering a busy hour. I'd definitely stop by XOCO again to try their caldas and pastries. This is an awesome place to visit if you are looking for a different kind of Mexican or a sandwich alternative in Chicago.
