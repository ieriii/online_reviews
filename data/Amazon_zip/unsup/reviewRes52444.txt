I really want to give this place more stars. The food is great, or at least the meat is. the service is SPECTACULAR, really a model for the city. And the manager was just the best. All that unfortunately does not compensate for the decor (Denny's) and the salad bar (Wendy's). Take the meat, the waiters and the manager and move it to a better location and you will have a 5 star churascaria. I would still highly recommend it to any meat eaters who think of decor as unnecessary and vegetables as garnish. you will LOVE THIS PLACE.
