I was shopping along Division Street and spied Alliance Bakery. I had always meant to try it and after an ill-fated trip to Hoosier Mama Pie (in which I came away empty handed because they were sold out of everything), my sweet tooth was calling out to me. I didn't go too overboard with my ordering because Alliance was uncharted territory for me and they have to earn my spending lots of money. Based on the two things I tried and their beautiful selection of pastries, there is no doubt that much of my discretionary income will be earmarked for Alliance. It was hard to decide what to choose because everything looked delicious. In fact, it looked so good that I was skeptical that it would taste as good as it looked. I opted for a blueberry scone and a lemon cupcake with strawberry buttercream frosting. The scone (which may or may not have been vegan) was positively bursting with blueberries and had a nice crumbly texture. I tell you what - if this was vegan, it was pretty darn good, and if it wasn't, well, I'd still get it again. The real kicker is that I just polished off the cupcake because I forgot about it. It literally knocked my socks off and it was three days old! I wasn't expecting much, but it was incredibly moist and light and the buttercream tasted just like fresh strawberries. The cake part was lovely, with a faint lemon flavor. I've had some bad lemon cupcakes in my day (think Lemon Pledge) and I typically don't order them anymore because most of them taste artificially flavored, but this one made a believer out of me. And again, it was three days old! If a cupcake can be that good after three days, they've more than earned my business. Can't wait to go back for croissants, tarts and other delectables!
