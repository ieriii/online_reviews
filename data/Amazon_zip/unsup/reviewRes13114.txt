This place was recommended by family during our stay in the Windy City. Little did I know E was going to propose to me on our walk after dinner there. With that said, this place is truly special to my [now] husband and I! Okay, enough of the mushy stuff... We were greeted by a gracious hostess and seated in front of a huge wine display. The wine aerialist entertained us as she swung, flipped, and twirled to retrieve the bottles from the giant wall of wine.  I am not much of a meat eater, so I enjoyed my share of the salad bar. E enjoyed the variety of meats that were brought by our table on skewers. Sweet fried bananas were delivered to us to "cleanse the palate". I ate both of ours and the server had to bring us more a couple of times during the meal.  The only thing that irked us during our dining experience was we felt we were tricked into their signature after dinner drink. At the end of our meal, our server asked us if we would like to sample the fruit-infused dessert wine. (Of course, we would like a sample!) She poured us each a small amount, which tasted like peach moonshine. Yummy, however we both decided to order Irish Coffee. When the check arrived we were charged $8 each for the "sample" of peach moonshine, er, I mean, the signature after dinner drink. Grr! Overall, we had a great experience...from the entertainment, to the attentiveness of the staff, to the tasty food. Try it, you'll like it. Just don't fall for the "samples" of the after dinner drinks like we did.
