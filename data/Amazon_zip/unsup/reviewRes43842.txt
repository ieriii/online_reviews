Happy hour here I come! Kinzie Chophouse is great for happy hour because their appetizers are discounted or free. That's right....free. So you can buy one martini, sip it for awhile and enjoy a free appetizer, which are quite tasty too. I've enjoyed the mushroom gorgonzola cheese tart, the calamari and other things I can't remember, because it's not available online, haha. I think the happy hour ends at 6:30, so you need to do your best to get out of work on time. No go people. It's 5 pm. Chop chop to the chophouse (lame, sorry).
