Solid lil place. I was there for dinner on a Wednesday and had some very tasty Blue Tilapia. The veggies accompaning this were phenomenal and the potatoes were good as well. I would call it a tad high on the price maybe but its definitely good food. Im still going to go back. One downside is that the inside is small and though I was at a table for 2, my table was touching to the left and had a 4" space to my right....meh it works
