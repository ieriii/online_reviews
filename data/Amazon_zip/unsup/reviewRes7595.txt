Wonderful! We were here for lunch. All the meat was great and we got to try everything and ask for more of our favorites. I had a filet mignon that would have been $30 alone anywhere else. Tender and cooked to perfection. I had some Italian relatives visiting and they heard us speaking Italian and two of the servers tried to talk to us in Italian. Mind you these are guys whose job it is to bring meat on a skewer, and here they were chatting with us in Italian and being in general fun and friendly. The service really exceeded expectations. I hope they share the tips! All the food was incredible. We even had a guy bring us some beef ribs that aren't on the menu and insist we try them despite our discs being flipped to red. Sure enough they were fantastic, almost melting in our mouths. Wonderful experience on every level. Come here!! Lunch is just as good as dinner, less expensive, and less crowded.
