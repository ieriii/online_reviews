My husband and I have been to the Diner over two dozen times since we moved to Chicago last year. Only twice have we had "slow" service which basically amounted to our being out of water for several minutes, which is hardly a horror. All of their food is interesting and most of it is incredibly tasty. Their peanut butter cookie dough milkshakes are the best I've ever had dairy or vegan. Their raw options are usually fantastic and a better option than some wholly raw restaurants in the city. Their wait staff is pleasant and attentive-Peter is my favorite, he always remembers me and he's great. There's even parking on evenings and weekends. EAT AT THE DINER.
