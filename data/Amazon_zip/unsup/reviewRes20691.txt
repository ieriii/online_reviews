I went here last night with my lady friend for her birthday. It was both of our first times at this sushi place. The ambiance was superb coming in from the chill, and a disappointing loud establishment prior to Coast. We were welcomed and seated promptly to a romantic nook. The wait staff were swift, and kind. We started of with the shumai, and miso soup (of course). We did not bring wine to this BYOB place, and were fine. (Yes there is a corking fee, a wine and beer limit, but we didn't needing a drink tonight.) We had a the large sashimi plate, the Maine maki, seaweed salad, and followed it up with a few more makis after. Then as a topper (I did say it was her birthday) we had desert; mango ice cream toped with minced mango with a single candle, chocolate covered strawberries, and a fried banana with dark chocolate. I am sure we'll be back for more.
