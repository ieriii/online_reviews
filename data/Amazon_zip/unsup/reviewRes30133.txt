GREAT Gold Coast brunch spot. Went to 3rd Coast for the first time and loved it! The prices were very reasonable, the service was friendly, and the food was delicious! Not to mention it was about a block from my house and I had no idea! I'd call if a hidden gem if it weren't for the crowd (don't be scared off- the wait goes faster than you think!). Definitely recommend trying their bacon and the yummy hashbrowns.
