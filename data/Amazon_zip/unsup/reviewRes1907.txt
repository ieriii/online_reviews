Best Hot Dog/Encased Meats place I've EVER been to. Whatever I got, it was a special ... and it was a while back that I went. What's great about Hot Doug's is that the brilliant owner creates the perfect combination of meat, cheese, and condiment. All of the flavors are wonderfully complimentary and you literally come away from this place feeling like you've tasted something you didn't think you would ever taste. It's simply delicious. We've all been to restaurants where you walk away and feel satisfied. "It was good." But whatever you ate didn't permanently alter the chemistry of your brain. And we've all been to a few restaurants in our day where that does happen ... but how often is it a neighborhood hot dog stand? The line goes around the block pretty much every day there, and although I live in Los Angeles, the first place I think of to grab a bite when I come to Chicago ... is Hot Doug's. Delicious. Wait in line. Spend the money on one, two, what the hell - THREE of Doug's specials for the day and chow down. It is well worth it. Oh and the fries are good too ... and I have yet to try the Duck Fat Fried Fries. Keep meaning to go in when they're served, but I always miss it. :( Go to Hot Doug's!
