I've been here 3 times so far. It is relatively new. It's in a great location overlooking grant park. The decor is very modern and clean. The breakfast menu is excellent. I've had crepes, which were a bit on the heavy side. The skillet my way is a huge bargain. You get 3 ingredients you choose with potatoes and 2 eggs plus pancakes or toast. The pancakes are some of the best in the area. I hope they will have a outdoor area in the summer. If you go here on Sunday, expect to wait. The wait is worth it though.
