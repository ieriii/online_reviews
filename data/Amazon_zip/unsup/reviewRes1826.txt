Hot Doug's is: -The only restaurant I'll stand in line for, except when I'm at sporting events or amusement parks -The only restaurant I'll spend $24 on hot dogs, fries and a drink -The only restaurant that serves things like cherry pork sausage and apple salsa with fancy French cheese -The only restaurant I'd eat two hotdogs AND duck fat fries and not feel TOO guilty about it -The only restaurant that seems like it's too crowded to find a seat, but works like a machine, turning over tables -The only restaurant I've ever had my order taken from the owner himself -The only restaurant I'd go to when its doors open
