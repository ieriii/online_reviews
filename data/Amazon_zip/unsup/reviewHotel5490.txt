I hate places with all the add-on fees. Parking is $45 per day. Internet is $10 per day. Want ice? You can only get it thru room service, so get the tip money out. No vending machines. Want coffee? Call room service. Fitted sheets would be nice - theirs keep coming off. I can go to a Hampton (or many others) and park for free, get free wi-fi, etc. Just like the airlines, please just charge an honest fee and skip all these extra charges. Pluses: good beds, large bathroom, staff was nice, very good location if you like the "Viagra Triangle" places.
