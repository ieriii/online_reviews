If you haven't been cancelled on at least once, then you haven't fully experienced Schwa. Call it the art of seduction. They like to play hard to get, put you through a chase, but once you dine there you'll realize it was all worth it. All that extra wait probably makes the food taste better anyway. For what it's worth, the chef and staff were extremely apologetic about the cancellation. We were thanked more than a dozen times throughout our meal for coming in despite the fact they had cancelled. Service was excellent. Our wine and water glasses were never empty. When one of our wine glasses were 1/4 full the staff quickly came over, apologized, and refilled it. Even though we didn't bring any beer or white wine, the kitchen brought some out when they thought it would pair well with the course. I can't begin to describe how good the food was. Michael is a genius. He belongs on Top Chef Masters. There wasn't anything I did not like, but my favorites were the baked potato (velvety soup, garnished with potato skin nubs, creamy cheddar, with just a hint of sour cream) and pork belly. The quail egg ravioli came as an extra course and we were instructed to eat it in one bite. Imagine warm, buttery egg yolk melting in your mouth. The roe dish: passionfruit jelly, violet foam, and tempura roe. When you eat it all together, it's supposed to taste like fruit loops. Amazing. Schwa is meant to be a fun, unpretentious experience. The staff and chef talk and take shots with you. I didn't partake, but the bf certainly enjoyed himself. I wouldn't go for a romantic night or bring my parents (as they really aren't the "lets do shots and hip-hop loving" kind), but definitely for a good time. As if the food and atmosphere weren't enough, they even comped a more than generous amount off the bill. Anyone with deep pockets can dine at Alinea, Charlie Trotters, or Tru; however, only the committed can indulge at Schwa.
