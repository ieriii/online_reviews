Meh. My first visit was disappointing. The deep dish pizza was pretty bad and there was waaaaay to much of it. It just tasted like really bad processed cheese. The second time was much better though...I have no idea what changed. There's nothing spectacular about the pizza but if you're one of those people that have to go to Giordano's, then good for you. I'm sure you can find better deep dish elsewhere. Be warned, you have to wait 30 to 45 mins before you can nosh on your pizza.
