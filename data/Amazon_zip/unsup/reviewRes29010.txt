Apparently I offended the guy working the register today. It was my fault. I had the audacity to want to order food here. He flipped me attitude when I asked to place an order to go. He seemed offended when I asked if there were any lunch specials. God forbid you include any napkins or chopsticks with my order. Then, after eating my way too spicy food, I had to curl up in a ball to deal with the stomach cramps. Opart, there are way too many other Thai restaurants right by you for you to be such jags. Spoon, Thai Room, Sticky Rice, Thai Oscar, etc. will now get my business.
