Uncommon ground is right up my vegetarian/vegan/sustainable food-loving alley. I visited this location with a group of five and we were lucky enough to get a table outside on a gorgeous day. If I lived in Chicago, I would find my way here at least once a month. Probably more often that that actually. Everyone in my party liked their lunch/brunch. I ordered a special - which was a quinoa burger with grilled peaches and chipotle sauce on top. Sounds odd right? Well, it was awesome. Also, the bloody mary wasn't too shabby either. Other highlights were the breakfast burrito, the scramble and the sweet potato fries. I can't say anything was bad, except maybe the service seemed a little slow especially since it wasn't very busy for the time we were there. The coolest part? The roof garden where they grown their own vegetables as well as the greenery surrounding the outdoor seating area. I won't lie, I might have stolen a few tomatillos that were ripely hanging off the stalk. Oh, and I stole a mint leaf too to freshen my breath after wards. Maybe stealing isn't the best word - sampled is better. All in all, I really love this place and wish more restaurants would follow suit.
