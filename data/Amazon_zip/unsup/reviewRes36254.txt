Breakfast lover's dream! No matter what you order here, it is always amazing. Not your average breakfast diner. The food always has a special something, and is very rich. I love their seasonal dishes, such as pumpkin pancakes, cinnamon french toast. It is pricey for a breakfast place, but well worth it for what you get. Truly a treat. If you're expecting IHOP or Palace Grill, this is not your place. Be prepared for a long wait.
