Well since my friend can never be on time, I am happy to say chicago diner is open late in the summer...we actually arrived for dinner at 9:45 and they were still able to seat and serve us (they stop at 10:30). Overwhelmed with so many options on the menu, we finally decided to try the bbq "hot wings" and the avocado toastadas and the hoagie like sandwich with seitan. WOW! The "wings" were pretty flavorful with the right amount of spice...the sandwich was HUGE..and very tasty. The tostadas had quinoa on it which were pretty good as well. We had the lemon coconut cake for dessert which was good but seemed a little on the dry side. Service was friendly and quick and our waitress was very helpful. Portion sizes are pretty big so if you go here either come hungry or bring a friend that can share.  Prices are very reasonable for the quality and quantity of food. Definitely will be back!
