The Art of Pizza. Tides ebbing and flowing are what best can characterize the harmony which the Art of Pizza creates. Golden crust that speaks to the heart. Wonderfully seasoned sauce is as satisfying as a mother's milk to a babe. A cheese that every cow dreams of making. Toppings suitable for none other than a king. Picasso. Warhol. Bob Ross. Art of Pizza.
