I adore this Italian joint! It's the perfect place to sit back with good company, enjoy a bottle of wine, and - of course - a delicious Italian meal. It's a fun go-to, although reservations are definitely recommended! It's always packed on a weekend night. I tend to gravitate toward their raviolis... particularly the rich and creamy dishes, like lobster ravioli. Everything I've had there is wonderful, though. It's always nice to have a place where you can't go wrong with whatever you order. They've got an amazing Caesar salad, as well!
