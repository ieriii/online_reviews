We came prepared to wait 90 minutes for a table, but ended up only waiting 45- so that was definitely great. Appetizers: I LOVED the Asian nachos. they are very sweet, and delicious. The calamari and rock shrimp were good too. Entrees: I had the shrimp scampi- loved the shrimp, but the pasta was a bit dry and had a very strong lemon taste. I had expected a more garlic taste, so i wasn't wowed by this dish. My husband had the salisbury steak. He said it was ok- and since I don't really like beef, i didn't bother to taste it. We ordered a box of the chocolate chip pecan cookies and these were definitely a hit. Warm, and chewy! I agree that this place is a bit overpriced but overall it was a good dining experience (the drinks were good and strong). Definitely recommend it to tourists who are doing some shopping on Michigan Ave.
