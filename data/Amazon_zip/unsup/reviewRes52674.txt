Apparently Chicago now has a Brazillian steak house district, as this place is a short walk from Fogo. However, I think this place is better. I went here for a buy one dinner get the next half off and we had a great time. I ate 2 of every animal that night. I give this place the edge over Fogo on meats and the salad bar also looked better. Didn't try it at either place--because that's how they get you! But if you're into that sort of thing, this place is better.
