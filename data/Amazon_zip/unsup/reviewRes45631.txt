I like Wilde, been several times, the atmosphere is great very warm and lively while big and a bit refined. The food is also always good, I do find it to be a little bit overpriced for what it is, but everything I have had has been good. My favorite thing though is the dill ranch dressing, good on everything especially fries. Ask for a side of it, you will be hooked. My one gripe with this place is the ever present abundance of small children, I am talking stroller riding, diaper wearing, screaming children. wtf? This place is more of a pub/bar than anything else why the hell do all these people bring their kids here? I mean if I had a kid I would definitely drink heavily but I would never bring them out to a place like this especiaily on a weekend night. It definitely brings down the atmosphere somewhat for me.
