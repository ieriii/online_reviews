They have a patio out back and it's very nice! Most of the entrees here consist of the same inside ingredients, just with different shells and sauces (I suppose that is most mexican food). I got a burrito with shredded beef. It had a green mole sauce on top and avocado slices. It was a pretty tasty burrito and it was huge. Nothing out of the ordinary; very good service.
