So I went in today with my girlfriend along with my cousin and his family and had a much better experience this time around.  Good things to try that you don't see too often at other Thai places: Appetizers: Tiger cry beef - beef tenderloin with a sauce that is like a combo between soy sauce and lime. It's SO good...a must try! Noodles: If you are a pad thai type person, try the Woon sen pad thai. It has thinner noodles than the normal pad thai. SO good! Entree: If you like garlic, get the garlic chicken. It tastes way better than the Chinese version of it. Dessert: It's seasonal but the mango with sticky rice sounds SO yummy!
