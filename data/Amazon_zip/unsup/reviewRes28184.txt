Ooooohhhhhh....once I smell that mole, on anyone's plate (my table or elsewhere), I start to salivate in an almost dangerous (think potential drowning.) I should just order extra mole ahead of my meal. An appetizer is included with your meal (chicken soup to cure anything) and the salsa(s) make for a most certain over-eating-so-full-so-happy ride back home.
