I've been going to Lockdown since they opened, and I love it. It's a blend of four of my favorite things: awesome food, metal music, sports, and drinking. They are known for their burgers, but between my friends and me I think we've tried everything on the menu, and it's all fabulous. They have a great beer selection, and they always seeem to have both drink and food specials going on. The staff is super friendly, and since it's on Western it's easy to get to. It's definitely not a "sports bar" (it's cooler than that), but there are TVs everywhere, with at least half of them tuned to sports. Like I said, it's pretty much the best of everything. The downsides are the music can be a little loud (even if you like metal), and on certain nights (half-price burger Tuesdays, for example) the seating situation can be more than a little tight.
