The scenery was great! As soon as I walked in I was taken aback by the amazing decor.   The wine acrobatics were impressive and the service was good. The alcoholic beverage selection was very good as was their wine list. The meat selection was average and the quality was slightly above par. If anything the atmosphere makes this place an exciting venture.
