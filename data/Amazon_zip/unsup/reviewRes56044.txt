Just came back from a business Chicago trip. Somebody recommended this place as Chicago Iconic. Well, their hot dog was good, the toppings and sauces were great but their fries were the worst I have ever eaten. There was no flavor in fries, no taste and they felt like paper. Next time we'll try something else or just the hot dog without fries.
