Carefully crafted drinks in a cozy, quiet, intimate atmosphere. The bartenders know what they're making, mixing ingredients (some home-made) to concoct the perfect cocktail. I love this place dearly. In my opinion, it's the perfect bar. The music is always good, the drinks and little foods are always good. The service is friendly (and many of the bartenders are enthusiastic about their creations) and chill.
