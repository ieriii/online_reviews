Talk about Italian tapas at their finest! Davanti Enoteca is a cozy wine bar with rustic decor and friendly service. The spot is only two months old, but a wild fire of buzz is spreading about the restaurant.  The wait on a Saturday night is one hour before 6:30 p.m. After that time, expect a 2 hour wait but worth the cause.  First, the wine list varies. There is an array of flavors and prices. The wine list is presented on a ginormous wine bottle. An order of cheese & meats is recommended to start off due to this strawberry with basil jam that accompanies the platter. As a salad, we recommend the roasted plum tomato with /ricotta + anchovy salad. It tastes like a roasted, warm capri salad. The giant ravioli with ricotta and spinach was good but is made to eat solo. The strip steak tapa with sea salt and arugula was tender and full of flavor.  The best was saved for last which consisted of a cannoli sundae.  Dessert heaven! Pieces of cannoli shells with chocolate mousse in an ice cream cup. The reason for not scoring a 5 is due to the portion of the pasta tapas relative to the price. Might I add that the music selection was perfect. It's pleasant hits from the late 80's and 90's with songs that vary from Erasure to Journey.
