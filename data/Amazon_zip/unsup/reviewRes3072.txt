As a Korean person, I hold Korean fried chicken near and dear to my heart. After hearing great things about this place, we decided to check it out. For a Friday night, it was definitely super busy and bustling in the early evening. We ordered 10 Crisp BBQ wings and a Baby Buddha bowl (bibimbap). The wings were spicy but not too spicy, I would say they were more sweet than spicy. The wings were ginormous - I would say splitting 10 wings is more than enough for 2 people. The Baby Buddha bowl tasted pretty good, but it was missing something. There were 4 toppings but not a lot of them! That was kind of lame. All in all, we got a ton of food for $26 and we had leftovers to take home. The taste was good, the wings were delicious and the atmosphere was friendly. I'd definitely come back!
