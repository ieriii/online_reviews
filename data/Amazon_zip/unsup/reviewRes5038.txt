Friendly staff, although not very knowledgeable about the wine Big wine list, although the vast majority of it is only available as the bottle (cannot buy just a glass). Fairly loud seating area, and not a ton of seating or space, meaning servers were always flying by RIGHT next to you and bumping into your chair. I will say there were some outdoor tables that looked nice, although all taken. We all tried different wines, yet the server used the same measuring glass for each one. No wine flights available.
