Stopped in for lunch on a Friday. It's a nice restaurant bar with decent food. The Southern Tier & 312 were both good beers (although I liked the Southern Tier better - more hoppy). Appetizer: House PoutineWildBoar,StewedVegetables,CurdCheese,Fries - The meat was good. It reminded me of fries & gravy. Entrees: 1) Seared Sea ScallopsButterLettuce,GrilledRedOnion,LemonVinaigrette - pretty good 2) "The Regular" Burger - a little salty according to my sister, but overall wasn't bad 3) Roasted Woodland Mushrooms (with watercress, radicchio, pecorino, truffle aioli, filone) - loved this sandwich. It came with some good slaw as well. 4) 16oz. Natural Aged American RibeyeParsley,Garlic,Tomato,SartoriReserve - it's not at the level of a steakhouse, but is okay for this kind of establishment. The server was attentive and the food came out within a reasonable time.
