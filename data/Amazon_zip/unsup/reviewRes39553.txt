We came for dinner on a Saturday night and this is definitely no-nonsense type of place. We were seated after about 15 minute wait and all of the food came out almost immediately (literally 2 minutes after ordering). Lots of food for very low prices too! We totally over-ordered for 4 people and the bill was less than a Bill (including tax and tip).  Service has no frills (so efficient its kinda scary - we also got long angry explanation from the owner of why this was not a BYOB facility even if we were willing to pay corkage fee) and the tables feel a bit cramped and very smoky!
