The food here is awesome. Be prepared to eat! the salad bar is very extensive and anyone can find something they like. The soups are great too. As for the meat, it was really good. Understand that its not the best steak/chicken/pork your ever going to eat or have eaten, but overall your trying everything together as a buffet style meal. The bacon wrapped steak and the house cut were my favorites. Some of the food was a little over salted, but expected. Waiter was a little awkward but not awful. The place was very busy as it was a Saturday and they had a acrobatics performer behind a large wine storage room. That really set the mood for this place. Average cost per person was about 70 with wine. Well worth it for all the cuts of meat I had. Would recommend and will probably go again.
