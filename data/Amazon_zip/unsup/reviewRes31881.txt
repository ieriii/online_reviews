Came here for restaurant week, where they had a $22 for 2 offer- the best I had heard for restaurant week. I went with a number of people, and so we got to taste everything. The sambusa appetizer stood out the most, but then I also loved the lentils, the beet salad, and the tomato salad, in that order. We got the platters, I must say that I wasn't the biggest fan of the all-veg one, the veg and meat ones were good though. Tons of flavour, none overlapping and more injeera than we knew what to do this. We tried the fruit medley, the flake pasty and the ice cream for dessert. I liked the uniqueness of the fruit compote, but the ice cream stood out too, thanks to the sauce that they used with it. Oh and we washed it all down with cinnamon spiced tea- delicious. All in all, a great experience! I'll be back Demera
