I wanted to spend the night downtown with my man for his birthday so I hot wired a hotel. We got this one. The hotel itself is in a perfect location if you want to experience all that Chicago has to offer. Close to Water tower, The Hancock and all the bars and restaurants. Upon arrival we were greeted by the staff who were very friendly. At check in I could see a look of concern cross Derrick's face and I knew there was going to be some drama rama with the fact that we booked through hot wire. He said the room I had booked was not available , however, he was able to upgrade us to a better room which I thought was very nice of him. I do question why I am able to book a room but not actually know for sure that I have it. Derrick advised that we book direct in future which I understand but the whole point of Hot wire is no get a better deal right? The room itself was nice, very large four poster bed, although I think someone may have swung from them as they were a little wonky! The sheets were lovely quality and so comfy. The TV was kinda old school but was fine. Overall this was a nice hotel and a good value. I like that it was small and "boutique" and close to the action.
