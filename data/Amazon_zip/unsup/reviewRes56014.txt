It was Chef's Week this weekend. I knew I came to Chicago for a reason. And The Gage was the best choice for a restaurant on Saturday night. We got there late, but the elegant restaurant was still full and the staff were warm and inviting.At the candle lit table, we had two big glasses of Domaine de la Solitude Cte du Rhone - c'est fantastique! Not to mention a certain waiter with a smokey voice had an extensive knowledge of the wine list AND spoke french. We purred.Be sure to ask for Justin at The Gage. He's as good as waiters get -- very attentive, charming, and knowledgable about all the drinks and dishes offered. If we needed anything or were even thinking about ordering another glass of wine, he was right at our side. We liked that.The food? Orgasm in my mouth. Not joking. I had quail (I think it was roasted) stuffed with house made sausage with thin slices of potatoes and sauerkraut. My friend had roasted chicken with a type of squash sauce and crunchy brussel sprouts with apples and goat cheese. *Salivate* Overall night -- just perfect. It was the best dining experience I've ever had.
