I came here Monday night for dinner with four others. We discovered the place searching online for a new restaurant to try. Parking was easy and the restaurant was easy to find. Our server Maria came over as soon as we were settled in to take our drink order. Drinks arrived at the table fairly quickly. Their lemonade is homemade and delicious. The empanadas (we got chicken and cheese) were delicious. For entrees, we got chicken, the house speciality steak, grilled calamari, and the stuffed chicken called Pollo Relleno. The steak had a wonderful marinade; but even though it was ordered (and came out) medium rare, it was a little on the chewy side. The calamari had a very good flavor, as did the chicken. The stuffed chicken was mouth-watering. One of my table-mates tasted it and rightfully described it as astounding. Dishes are served with potato, yuca and fried plantain, and the Relleno was also served with a salad. The potato, even with its seasonings, is underwhelming but not bad. The plantain is cooked perfectly. A couple of us split the coconut flan for dessert. This too, was fantastic. The bussers were there to immediately clear garbage and plates from the table without being intrusive. Waters were refilled long before they were empty. Server was attentive but never hovering. She was great. Prices were right for the quality of the food. The entrees take a while, even on a slow night, but quality takes time. I would definitely come back.
