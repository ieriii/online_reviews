Davanti Enoteca was great! Going in a party of 6 was a smart move because we were able to try more of the menu items.  Our server was friendly and informative. All of our wine and our favorite food orders were her recommendations. We outstanding dishes included the ricotta and honey comb appetizer, the foccasia, the prosciutto and arugala pizza, and the egg toast. We ordered two pastas which were both good. The grilled octopus and the pork belly appetizer were both good, but not as good as the other things that we tried. All in all, we had a great experience and would recommend to anyone wanting a good experience in Little Italy.
