My daughter lives in the neighborhood and we'd been there twice before and had good food, even though it was a bit pricey and there was a wait. But that was okay, we enjoyed it. But we went in again recently on a Saturday afternoon, and there was no wait at all... we found out why when we saw that they jacked up the prices after being featured on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives! Yes, we know it's ORGANIC. But...we'd ordered 2 plain coffees and an iced tea and then saw the menu prices and decided to go somewhere else. Those plain coffees and iced tea were over $10.00. C'mon... $16 for a burger???? $18 for a Cobb salad? Really? You're in Bridgeport, not Paris! If we'd have stayed for breakfast it would have been over $50 for 3 people, not including tip! I'm not a tightwad, but times are pretty tough and the last thing I need to do is pay $50 for breakfast.
