We heard such great things about this place. I'm so bummed at our experience. Our server seemed really rushed and didn't spend much time explaining the menu even though we kept asking for advice. I'm not too familiar with Latin food but I'm always open for anything. There were four people in our party, our bill was over $300 and the food really wasn't good. Appetizers were ok, but my steak was over-done, chewy, and gristley. It just seemed like a really cheap cut of meat. The desserts were just ok. The passion fruit ice cream was awful! Also my drinks were really weak......Sigh. I really don't like giving bad reviews but it is what it is.
