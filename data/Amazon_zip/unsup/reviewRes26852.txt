We came for breakfast on a weekday and was seated quickly and served even quicker. We ordered apple pie empanadas - free from the waitress, warm & yummy hot mexican chocolate - ok, seemed watered down guacamole - watery & light green with no seasonings whatsoever machacado con huevos - very chewy shredded stead in the eggs huevos con chorizo - good, very heavy The whole experience was lightning fast, and we were done in 1/2 hour. However, we both had terrible stomach pains when we reached home. Too heavy for breakfast?
