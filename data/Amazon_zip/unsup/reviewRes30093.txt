Took my West Texan Vegan cousin here for dinner tonight while she's in town. I think she'll probably stay in Chi for at least as long as it takes to eat everything on Chicago Diner's awesome menu. As for me: Vegan Reuben. They use Daiya cheese, which is undoubtedly the best of vegan cheeses.'Nuff said. ...Wait, no, also--awesome staff... ...and really delicious iced tea.
