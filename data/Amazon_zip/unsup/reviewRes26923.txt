What I like about folks on yelp is that no one's going to rain fire down on me for not loving this greatly-loved pizza place. I made reservations for 15 a week in advance, but a few extras showed up. No matter, because the area for 15 they had reserved for us really only fit 10 (no, we're not big-large folks...yet...give us a few more years of beer and pizza though), and the manager was uber-rude when I asked for some help to accommodate my whole party, or at least the original 15. His response was essentially, "This is what you will take and I will not help you," Luckily 2 small tables opened nearby.  The server worked her ass off and we were not left without food or beer the entire time, but it just wasn't great pizza to me, except the slightly burnt cheese on the crust...that was yummers.
