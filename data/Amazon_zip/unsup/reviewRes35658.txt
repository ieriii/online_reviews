I have been going to this place for years with my family before I moved to Chicago. This place is awesome. Yes it's not the cleanest place.... neither is my kitchen and I still eat there. I've been going for at least 10 years and in that entire time I have never gotten sick from there food. Ok... on to the tastiness. They have the best food other than Chinatown. I eat their Chinese noodle soup with Wontons and BBQ Pork... it's heaven. Best hangover cure. The pork with the crispy skin.... oh god... no words it's amazing. Everything I've had at Sun Wah is awesome. As far as the decor... I could care less. I go to a restaurant to eat not look at fancy pictures. The people that go there make the restaurant too I think. When I go there, I usually find huge families or big groups of friends eating. It's great!
