I have heard great hings. It is BYOB which can save people money but it is very expensive for Italian. I mean very like $25/ person for the feel of a strip mall feeling Italian place?? The food is really good. I enjoyed it the first time and as leftovers. I am torn over the place because it was good but also because I think it cost a ton for what we got and Nothside Italian!! I am not cheap but after seeing $100/ for 4 meals, no drinks or apps I was annoyed. I like atmosphere at restaurants and this place lacks but has good food. I love Sabatino's and would check it out too because it is so fun to eat there and the food is of the same caliber and priced better.
