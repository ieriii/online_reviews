"Ambition is the last refuge of failure" or so said the original rock star Oscar Wilde. Graham Elliot is an ambitious restaurateur. His work is akin to the music of an American Idol wunderkind, which is to say it's wildly popular and momentary successful. Unfortunately for Graham Elliot, I think his ambitions are not to be an American Idol so much as the culinary version of Joe Strummer. The Clash, Graham Elliot is not. Bottom line: If you are not a fan of the Clash please disregard my 2* rating and go and enjoy the bliss of taking part in the pop phenomenon that is GE, it's "Fabulous!"
