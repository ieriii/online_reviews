We went here to celebrate our friend's bday. The food was so delicious. Everything including the apps tasted so fresh. I have to say this location was the perfect spot for an intimate dinner with friends. We had nine in our party and the dinner just flowed so well. We staged our meal with many appetizers followed by our entrees. The bday girl took charge in ordering the apps so I have no idea what was ordered.....only that we had a few different ones and everything was wonderful. This place is BYO....such a fun way to keep your meal cost down. Only thing is that BYO can be dangerous when with a big group.....the drinks just keep flowing.
