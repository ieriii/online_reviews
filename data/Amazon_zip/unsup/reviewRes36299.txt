I stopped in here the other day for lunch, without knowing anything about the place. I didn't order breakfast but it did look really good from what I saw on the menu and the orders being delivered around me. I was in shock at how fast I got my food. They had to be one of the fastest places I have been to in awhile. I ordered a wrap with the pasta salad and eat every last bite. It was delicious! If you was looking for something different for lunch check it out! The service is great. and the interior was very well designed.
