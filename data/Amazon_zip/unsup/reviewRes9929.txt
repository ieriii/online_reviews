I don't know why it has taken me this long to try this place! Between visiting a friend who lives down the street and going to Richard's Bar, this is probably one of the staples of Chicago's Restaurant scene.  We had a tasting menu that my friend won from a charity auction. What a great Experience. The breadsticks alone in the bread basket is an automatic tell of what a delicious dinner you're about to have. The highlight of our dinner was the Ravioli. It melted in your mouth! To be honest with you each coarse had a wine pairing so between the wonderful company and wine I forgot what the meat coarse was. Ha! Whatever it was, I absolutely loved it! Dare I say it...it reminded me of the meat served on the Big Mac coarse at Next! I was perfectly tender and flavorful. That alone will make me come back, considering I will never experience Next's Big Mac again! When we eat at places we always consider if we would bring out of town guests here. This is definitely a place we would bring out of town guests. If they're lucky (or unlucky) they'll get a trip to the lovely smokey dive bar that is Richards. After of course they get more drinks in them.
