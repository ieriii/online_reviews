With so many reviews why even bother. Concordantly, I'll remain brief. There's a consistently good menu; however, nothing really stellar. The service is great. They should skim the fat off the chicken soup they serve and there's a dearth of vegetarian options, though that's somewhat expected with Mexican food. I like this place, a solid 4/5 stars.
