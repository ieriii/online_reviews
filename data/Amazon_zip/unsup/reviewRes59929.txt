Generally disappointing. I am a sucker for any place that has espresso drinks and croissants - my husband and I enjoy this for a leisurely breakfast. I won't be going back to Alliance for this. The barista was generally unpleasant - not outright rude, but ignored me for several minutes then took my order without much in the way of eye contact or interest. The cafe is in a separate room, but to get there you have to go outside, meaning you have to deal with two doors - not easy with a pastry in one hand and a cappuccino in ceramic in the other (I spilled half of it). The cafe itself was dirty, the tables crowded together cafeteria style, and the chairs uncomfortable.
