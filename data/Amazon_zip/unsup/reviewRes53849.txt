I don't even eat pork and I love the purple pig! Small but cute inside (albeit there are always a fair number of tourists given the location on Michigan ave) but still love this place!This is a great place for a leisurely weekend lunch with wine. We've never had to wait very long for a table in the late afternoon.Best meatball slider ever. Order it. I also love the octopus. And then the whipped feta.I like the portion sizes because you can try a lot of things.
