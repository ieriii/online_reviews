If you were not 800 miles away from decent pizza, there would really be no use for this place. Pizza is okay. Brewery (come on, brewery?) pub (nothing at all like a real pub) is more of a crowded sports bar with witless staff at the door. That said, it's the best your going to find for pizza in flyover country ...
