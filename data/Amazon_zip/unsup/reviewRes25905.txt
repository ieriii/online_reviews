First off, incredibly beautiful, open, warm space . the lighting was perfect. music was pretty good too (spotted too many tracks off previous Hotel Costes compilations, which is NEVER a bad thing :P) -1 star, because we finished 2/3 of our pitcher of sangria (the seasonal- which was very tasty) waiting 45 minutes to get seated after our 9PM reservation. The GM offered a round of cava for the trouble though, nice gesture :) Once we were seated and orders taken the food came out quite fast, almost too fast even (we had a fairly small table :P) . My ultimate favorite (from a previous visit) were the bacon wrapped dates, AMAZING. Loved loved LOVED the baby squid cooked in its own ink +glass pasta (beware of INKY TEETH !!!!!), as well as the croqeutas. great, original take on the patatas bravas and gambas. Baby octupus was unreal, so tender and such a balanced, incredible flavor. Besides the wait, we had a great time !
