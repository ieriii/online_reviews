i finally went here after wanting to for some time. It was okay for me. I had : Rocca Piquante-pretty good but not as flavorful as I thought it might be. Chicken Riganatti: I liked this quite a bit. the vhicken was juicy, tender and well seasoned. TIt was served with a side of potatoes and roasted veggies which were also good. I washed it down with a Moscato and ordered two desserts to go, the Valrhona Chocolate Mousse and the Hazelnut Praline. I can tell you that the Valrhona did not disappoint! I'll get back to you on the Hazelnut Praline. the waitress who took care of me was nice enough. Overall, I had a pleasant experience. Although I wasn't floored by it, I'd certainly return.
