The food here is very consistent and the service is always good. The Ahogada is my favorite on the menu along with the lemongrass hibiscus iced tea.  On the other hand, I was not very happy with the chocolate flan I ordered. I think it was over seasoned with the cinnamon on the top and the chocolate sauce was way to sweet....
