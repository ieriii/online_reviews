One of the original Brazilian steak houses in the Chicago area, from what I'm told. I went for my birthday and had an awesome experience. Unfortunately the whole Brazilian steak house thing has gotten played out with the clones floating around. I don't know which are better, but Sal & Carvao are quite similar and I love them both!
