Mmmm.... great deep-dish pizza! I have only heard wonderful things about this place, yet have never tried it until last week when my friend ordered take out for us. We had the spinach pie and it was phenomenal. This, coming from a person who thought she liked Chicago-style pizza when she first moved here... then realized she didn't... and now does again. (Okay, so I am not a fan of Giordano's or Gino's. But then I discovered Lou Malnati's (YUM) and now The Art of Pizza.) So, yes, if you are in the mood for Chicago-stuffed pizza, try the Art of Pizza. It is different than Lou's, and I have to still decide which one wins the prize (to my heart and stomach), but it is a close competition. (Behind Piece, (my all-time favorite), of course!)
