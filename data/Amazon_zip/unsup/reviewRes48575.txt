Loved The Publican more than Blackbird. Everything, from the food to the ambiance to the drink menu was absolutely fantastic, and a few items on the menu completely surprised me. Oysters were delicious, as were the pork rinds- they're not that spicy, they just have the right amount of kick. The mussels were amazing, and really huge-- they can easily feed a few people. Everything else blew me away. The fries with egg over easy were unbelievable-- the best fries I ever had! Then we tried the sweetbreads- I believe the word "foodgasm" is the right term. We ended the meal with a glass of maple sugar whiskey. Sipping this sweet, smooth whiskey was the perfect way to end a perfect birthday dinner.
