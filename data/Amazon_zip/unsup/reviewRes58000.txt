I love Mia Francesca! It's loud yet cozy at the same time. I'm usually not a fan of loud restaurants but it was great service, high quality food and a decent price.Who cares if it is a chain? In fact, I wouldn't have known it if my dining companions hadn't pointed it out and then I looked it up.Tasty
