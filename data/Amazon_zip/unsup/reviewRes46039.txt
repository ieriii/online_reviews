I went here last week for a Bday. Good times, good food, fun location off Mich Ave. If you've been to cheesecake factory, same "type" of food, and they are owned by the same parent company. Be careful though, because this is a tourist trap. Brunch on weekends is nearly impossible, and they do not take reservations. The only complaint I had was the freaking slowwwwwwwwwww ass valet service. You could have built a car by the time it took them to literally walk next door and get the car out. It took over 20 minutes for my car to be retrieved, and it wasn't even busy. The whole point of a valet is to get your car easily in and out from a restaurant. Save the extra $2 and self-service the valet, yes, it's an option oddly enough.
