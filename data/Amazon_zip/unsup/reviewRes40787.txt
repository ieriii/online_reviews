I tried the Carne Asada burrito after a concert this weekend and it really hit the spot. I heard this place has really flame tacos too, as well as everything else on the menu. The only thing I was surprised about was the fact that the burrito was almost $8. I was expecting a little cheaper for an authentic mexican restaurant but it must be because of all the hipsters in the area ;)
