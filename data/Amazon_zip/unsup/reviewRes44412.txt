I love this place. i love the cookies the sandwiches the coffee.. i love the every changing cast of characters behind the counter that are sweet and annoyed simultaneously. Im glad they redid the everything in trhe cafe side.. it was u g l y .. it is now nice and cozy and totally unoffensive. but my favorite part is the sitting outside on a spring or summer day just watching division go by. i dont know. i wouldnt guess that i would want to sit on division, but there at alliance, i truly don't mind...
