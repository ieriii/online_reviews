Although the restaurant is small, if you come with a bunch of friends to eat, drink (BYOB) and catch up, it's pretty fun. I love how you don't have to worry about being too loud and disturbing the people around you. The atmosphere is very comfortable. Their Buddha bowls are pretty authentic and very good. As for chicken, I've only tried the Original and Sassy. I liked the Original better because it didn't have as much sauce but they were both quite tasty.
