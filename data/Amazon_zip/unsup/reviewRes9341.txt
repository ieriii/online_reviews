Very unimpressed! I went here for my birthday recently with some pretty high expectations based on what some coworkers and friends had told me. I thought the food was average to above average at best. We ordered 2 apps, 2 entrees, and a dessert and shared everything. The rabbit was actually wonderful with the gnocchi. Nothing else really stood out. The salad was very bland and the tuna tartare app tasted too fishy and all around weird. On top of the just ok food was the ambiance as atmospere...or lack there of. We got there at 7pm and were literally the only people in the whole place. By 730pm the patio had filled its 7 or 8 tables but the demographic was a little older. Minus myself and my sister the median age had to be 50 years old. Just not a fun or happening place to be. Maybe I just went on a bad night but based on this experience I'd need go back and chalk this up as a very forgettable meal.
