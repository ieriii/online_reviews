I went here this past Sunday with a few co-workers after a meeting. Many of us are vegetarians and some vegans, so it was an obvious choice. They were very accommodating for our party of nine. The food was very delicious. We ordered a few appetizers that we shared. I personally loved the Mediterranean platter. For desert, we tried the raw mango cheesecake, and it was AMAZING. I never knew cashews could taste like cheese!!! I will definitely go back here in the future. And I would not hesitate to take my meat eating friends. I feel like everyone can get something here that they'd like.
