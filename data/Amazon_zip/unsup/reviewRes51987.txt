Giordano's was packed, and Gino's was right next to our hotel. So we gave it a try to compare it to my SO's beloved Pizzeria Due. It's true Chicago pizza, with that yellow cornmeal crust and sauce on top. The crust was lighter than the other pizza I tried, but it was still pretty hefty. Two of us got one small pizza and that was plenty. The spinach topping was good. I've learned that Chicago-style pizza really isn't my bag. I don't hate it, but I'll never crave it. But Gino's serves up a pie with quality ingredients with decent service. We'd ordered an appetizer but it never arrived (but also didn't appear on our bill). That was okay, because the pizza was plenty of food, as it turned out. A small completely satisfied our hunger. My dining companion is a Chicago pizza devotee, yet he'd never eaten here. He said it is now his favorite place for Chicago-style pizza, so I guess I'll be back.
