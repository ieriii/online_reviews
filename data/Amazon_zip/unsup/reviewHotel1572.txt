I've stayed here twice. First time, I fell in love. It was December, cold and the hotel was sexy warm. I opened the drapes and fell in love with the view and moonlight shining into the great room. Room was quiet and bathroom was luxurious. I had a big FUN king size bed.  Second time, I booked through a website. I stayed on the 26th floor, not updated room and no real view. I was close to the elevator and the bed was ten feet from the door so I could hear people discussing everything. I again was dead tired and could have upgraded to another room on the water side for $15 after I talked to the front desk. But I decided to just get dinner and call it a night. So they would have accommodated me.  So if you book, check where the room is and etc.  I love the area and the whole downtown Chicago vibe. Of course, parking is expensive but that's norm for any big City downtown stay. You are fairly close to the West Loop and other great areas that has some very hip lounges and eateries.  I will stay there again when I return but will just be sure that I get the updated room side of the hotel.
