This is a pretty good north side Chicago restaurant that is quick on delivery and great on service. Once a week, I order Thai food, and this restaurant is pretty good about delivering it fast. The drivers are always courteous and friendly. As for the food, it's yummy and tasty. I'm not one that enjoys spicy Thai food, so they are pretty good about custom-making my order the way I like. Favorite dish is the Rama Chicken, smothered in peanut sauce. I think they close around 9 or 10, so don't come by last min, or they will all ready be getting ready to close. Great Food.
