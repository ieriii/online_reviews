Yay! Even though it took me 8 years to make it to this place, I"m so glad that I finally did. I came here with a large group and they were so accomodating. They were about 30 minutes late seating us which wasn't a problem since a few of our party were about 30 minutes late. They ushered back through the restaurant through the courtyard and into a small backroom that only had one unsuspecting couple finishing up their meal. Lucky for them they were leaving soon as we were quite the boisterous crowd.  To make up for seating us late, they sent out some comped appetizers that were delicious. My friend and I split the pasta with mussels and the mushroom and cheese stuffed pasta with mushroom sauce. I think we agreed that the sauce on the mushroom dish was amazing but the pasta itself wasn't. Not that it was bad but it was just eh. However, the mussels and the spicy marinara sauce was so good. I ended up taking home the leftovers of both along with my friend's dish and ate for a few more days. The only thing that concerned me was the oil that set up in my leftovers that you know is there but you don't want to see. Then you have the dilemna of whether you should pour it out or mix it back in when you reheat it.  The service was fantastic throughout the entire meal. All in all, it was a great experience and I will definitely be back.
