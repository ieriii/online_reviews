This weekend, I finally got the chance to visit the infamous Meli, and to make things even better, I didn't have to wait in line! After an early morning trip to Isaacson & Sons fish market, my husband, father-in-law and I were hungry and ready to get out of the sleeting cold. We were seated right away and greeted by our friendly waitress. I had a cappuccino and the feta/tomato/spinach scrambler. I'll start with the only bad news -- the cappuccino. I should preface this by saying that I love espresso and, in my opinion, there is nothing worse you can do to an espresso than mixing it with skim or 1% milk.  That is exactly what they did. Boo. A cappuccino needs fat, which means that it needs at least 2%, if not whole milk. But, really a minor infraction and the next time I go, I will simply request my cappuccino with whole milk. The food was outstanding and the portions are huge! My scrambler was fantastic, with tons of tomatoes, spinach and feta. The wheat bread was very "holey" and sucked up the butter and jam just like it should. The homemade jams are also a nice touch! My dining companions also loved their food and thought the service was great. I can't wait to go back and try the 100 other items on their menu!
