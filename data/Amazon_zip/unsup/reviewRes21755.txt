Really Rick Bayless? Really? $4 for an ounce of guacamole and far too many chips for said guacamole? OK...whatever. I'll forgive you that for the amazing Pepito torta. Yummy braised spareribs with an equally yummy tomatillo sauce. But really? Again. $12 for a torta? I know I should expect this, being a Top Chef Master restaurant and this being Chicago, but it still pains me to think about paying this much for an extremely casual dining experience. And this is based on Mexican street food? Could you have priced your Mexican street food with comparable Mexican street prices? Granted. A little too much to ask but your killing me. I'm torn. Great food...painful pricing. Next time I'll have to lure someone here on false pretenses that the tortas are WAY too big to eat alone and we'll have to split one so I'll only have to pay $6, although I can easily scarf the Pepito down all by lonesome.
