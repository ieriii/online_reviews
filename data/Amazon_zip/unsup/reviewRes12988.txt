I was so excited to go to this place because I love both Cuban and Mexican food and I had heard such great things about it. Then along came a Groupon - how perfect! Although I thought the service was great and it would be a great place to go hang out and have a drink - I did not like the food. I thought the best thing was the bread and butter (sort of sweet and spicy). We had the taste of Cuba appetizer - I wasn't a big fan of but it was ok. For dinner, I had the honey jalepeno pork chops which is one of their specialties. I really did not like the pork chops - they were overwhelmingly sweet to me (though I know people that love them). I was hoping for some spice from the jalepeno to help with the sweetness but there was none. I tried some of my boyfriend's food (steak with black beans and rice) - it was just okay too but it was drenched in lime (which is crazy for me to say because I put lime all over everything).  I really wanted to like this place and appreciate the great service, but especially given the price, I would recommend going elsewhere.
