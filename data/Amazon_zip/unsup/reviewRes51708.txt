For some reason I had abandoned this restaurant. Years had passed since I had been here. When a friend was visiting from Germany last week and wanted to eat Mexican we headed over there. It is so close, no reason not too. I think it has been 5 years, maybe longer since I visited. Anyhow, the waitresses haven't gotten any friendlier or more timely, but they do have fish tacos made with deliciously cooked Tilapia, so I am probably going to go back a little sooner next time. You really can't beat $2.50 for a fish taco either. Even if it is served with a bit too much attitude and disdain.
