My husband and I came for a romantic dinner this weekend. What a mistake, but that was entirely my fault! I've had better fondue and certainly more reasonably priced meals, but the ambience here was just lovely. I liked the dcor and enjoyed the live music on Friday night. The wait wasn't terribly long and our waiter, Jason, was fantastic.  The food was good, though the chocolate left something to be desired, but still we left stuffed.  And therein was the problem with our *romantic* date night.  We were too full to do anything but roll ourselves into a cab and melt into the couch at home.  If you know what I'm saying... And I think you do.
