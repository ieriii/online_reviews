I tried this place twice over the last three weeks. The first time, I really liked it. Our waitress was really sweet and crepes were flavorful. So, on our second visit there, we took a friend with us--wasn't impressed at all. The place was crowded and the seats were badly arranged-while the booths that sit 4 were all occupied by couples, they made us squeeze on a two top, which wasn't enjoyable. After a long wait, we got our food--though the ingredients were definitely flavorful, my crepe was cold, and the soup bowl that came with it was 1/3 empty! I also didn't like the fact that they charged $1.00 extra for the bread, and $1.50 for the olive oil to dip. Keeping the prices of the menu items reasonably affordable and then charging for those small things that should be complimentary is just not right. Our waitress was very sweet but wasn't really so helpful when it came to making up for the kitchen's mistakes, and I don't like being served by wait staff who wear sweaters with soup stains and salad dressing on them.
