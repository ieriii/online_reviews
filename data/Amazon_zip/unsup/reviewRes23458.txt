I have been to this restaurant a few times, and it may be my favorite greek food in town BUT the many issues I had last night deserved to be written about. I went to dinner with my mom and her boyfriend, and since there was a 15 minute wait, we went into the bar to order a drink. It took 20 minutes to finally get the 1 bartender to serve us, which went very slowly as well. When we finally got our drinks and got seated at our table, we began to order our dinner. My mom and I tried to order stuffed peppers - they are out, stuffed tomatoes - they are out. Then, my mom's boyfriend tried to order one of the nightly specials, whitefish - they are out, then tries for the BBQ lamb special- they are out. When we told our waiter (WHO WAS AMAZINGLY NICE - ask for Danny to be your waiter!!!) to please get the manager, the manager began to argue that it's Sunday night and asked what we expected. Not only was it disrespectful to argue with your patrons, he didn't seem to really care about the fact that we were displeased and offered nothing to fix the situation. Great food - terrible management. They may have 100 people on staff at each service, but I think they need 101 and add an extra in the bar, and tell the manager to take the stick out of his butt and make your customers enjoy their overall meal.
