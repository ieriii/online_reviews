The pizza itself it great. But their delivery service is awful - they quote an hour within Lakeview and both times we ordered it took longer than an hour. Last weekend it took an hour and 40 minutes! I'm not sure if the problem is disorganization or just a lack of manpower, but they really need to work out those issues. I don't think one pizza, no matter how good, is worth waiting nearly 2 hours for.
