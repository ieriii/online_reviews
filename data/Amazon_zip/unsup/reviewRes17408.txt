Let me start by saying, this is my new homefield. Theres plenty of deusche-bag bars out there where you'll pay 12- 15 dollars for a simple friggin manhattan. This place is definately not one of them. Although drinks are all 12 bux here they really go the extra mile in every standard that other lounges could only try to live up to. This place blew my socks right off. If you want to go on a really great date somewhere go here and you will seal the deal, guaranteed.  The drinks are all creative and delicious. I was impressed when Henry, my super bartender, scoffed at me for asking him if they use sour mix. He kindly learned me something when he shared that they use the original technique for sourmix of eggwhites, sugar, and something or other. Whatever man, this drink rocks.  The music in the place was great and was low enough to enjoy effortless conversation. Something about the environment there seemed to put everyone in a good mood. Sitting at the bar I probably chatted it up with everyone in a 20 ft radius. Once the juices got flowing we started swapping and that was it. SOLD.  I love this place. Everything about this place was awesome. Whats that? they automatically give you fresh cold ass water? Jumping Jilickers Batman! Check this place out. Ill be back for suuurrrreee
