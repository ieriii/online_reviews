Ohhhh, from the bottom of my pure beef heart, they should change the name of this place to SPECTACULAR DAWG! The chocolate malt has never been done better by anyone, anywhere. And those crinkle-cut fries... to die for. I know this might sound like a stretch, but Superdawg is a place where I would likely have my last meal, if given the option.  The ambiance can't be beat - this place has not changed a bit in the 20+ years I can remember. So much nostalgia and authenticity... a real, American drive-in. There is nothing like a summer night, shooting down Milwaukee Ave, and pulling up to this fast-food mecca. It can be a bit of a scene, but it's a good kind of scene. Really, it's as if time stood still here and the world changed all around it.... definitely an authentic Chicago experience.
