Top notch service! The kind of place where they pull all your parties plates simultaneously and replace all your utensils so they are specific to your next dish. Lots of surprises and palate cleansers between meals. It looks at first like you're gonna be hungry right after your meal, but you actually leave pretty satisfied. The food was creatively presented and everything tasted very good. An awesome experience i would definitely try again!!
