i wanna know why this place got so many good reviews ? it sucks especially the dogs that come in a box with fries im wonderin am i payin for the box too cause there prices for a hot dog and fries is insane and there dogs are just average if that nothin special and the service is slow !! granted the outdoor 50s style drive in decor is kinda cool thats why im gonna give it two stars !! gene and judes or jimmys on grand are way better , quicker service and cheaper on there prices !!!
