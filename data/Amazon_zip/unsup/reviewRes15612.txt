Finally decided to come here with the gf on her birthday following a delightful meal at Coast. Walking in here is pretty badass. Took awhile to find the hidden door, we were creeped out by the near pitch-black curtain room and the intimidating door guy. Once you're in you feel like a VIP. However, the hand-crafted libations and descriptions are a bit gimmicky. Some of the drinks here just aren't that tasty - no matter how good the alcohol is. I don't see why more people don't go to the Drawing Room in Streeterville, which has drinks that are equally as good for cheaper. Also a cool ambience there. Thankfully, we came here on a Tuesday - even on the night in question it was near capacity. I could only imagine how packed it gets on weekends. All in all, this place was worth visiting, and I will be back - but it really doesn't live up to the hype people give it.
