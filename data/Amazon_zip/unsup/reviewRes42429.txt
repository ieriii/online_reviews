Best meal we had in Chicago and we went to Longman and Eagle the night before, where unfortunately we got a little attitude from our server. This place is just about my ideal. I did not have enough stomach for all the things on the menu I wanted to eat and drink. My wife and I ate at the bar. The service was great--attentive but unobtrusive. The blond bartender with the tattooed arms took care of us. I'm sorry that I missed her name because she was great and I'd like to give her some props on here. Both bartenders were BUSY and remained poised. The menu was dynamite. We tried a few different reds by the glass and they were all good. We started with roasted garlic/olive oil dip because it had been recommended to us by friends and because we were starving and needed food stat. Great. For dinner, I had the pork belly and my wife had the bolognese. They were both delicious, but I have to say that the pork belly was close to the best thing I've ever eaten. Amazing. Sweet, and smoky because of a few light touches of char on the meat. Perfect. The bartender suggested the coconut mocha pie for dessert after a brief discussion of our preferences. Perfect. Not too sweet. Not too dense. I really liked everything about this place. It has hip staff, funky decor, and is dead serious about food and beverages. I should also mention that I admired their beer list. They had some of my favorite California beers, IPAs in particular (Green Flash, Bear Republic). This place has its priorities in line. Wish we lived closer because we'd be regulars.
