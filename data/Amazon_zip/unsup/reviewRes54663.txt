Let's start with walking in the door. My family (all adults) and I, had a reservation under a fairly common last name. We were seated in a really nice area, away from the crowd. The maitre de TOLD US that he thought we were frequent diners, which we were not. WHY would you tell us this? After letting us know that we weren't his preferred customers and seating us away from the masses, he sat the next FIVE tables in our section.The restaurant is completely over-staffed. The waitstaff was literally gossiping 4 feet from our table and really had nothing better to be doing. Fine, but do that outside of the dinning room and more discretely, please.I agree, this place is not for kids, but you sure couldn't tell by the looks of the crowd. There is no formal dress code enforced and kids were running wild. Who in their right mind would take a child to a $50+ entree place? If only I had that kind of money...The food was good, but we left hungry...all of us. Even my 5' 100lb mother who only eats to survive. The filet was good, as were the crab cakes. The scallops were gummy, in my opinion, and the shrimp was so hard to get out of the shell it was cold by the time I finally got it to an edible state. The wine selection by the glass is weak. I LOVE Chianti and the only option they had by the glass was $12.99 and not even something I would recommend (I lived in Italy for 3 years).This place must really think it's something special for the prices they offer with the food that they don't. DON'T go hungry, you'll be gnawing off your arm by the time you leave. The only moderately priced items on the menu are the apps and desserts -- so head to those maybe. The dessert sampler was good.Not planning to return. You can actually afford and enjoy crab a lot of other places in the city.
