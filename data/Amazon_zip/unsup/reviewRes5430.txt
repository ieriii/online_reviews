Amazingly good... Tapas with a twist... I love to graze and taste different dishes. We arrived about 10pm on 9/1 0 the place was packed with a 35 minute wait list, we got seated in 10 minutes (we knew a guy !) when we left at 11:30 it was still packed so plan accordingly get ready to wait. Sat at the bar in front of the kitchen, four of us ordered appetizers; Pig Tail, Sardines, Bone Marrow, Pork Shoulder, Olives and Almonds in garlic, Fried Manchego, Raw Corn Sald, the dishes were fresh, creative,  flavorful, executed perfectly and were all unbelievably good I mean really lip smacking delicious and thats coming from a serious foodie and a chef. I will go back as often as I can, the athmosphere was very hip and you could almost touch the energy in the place, not a large restaurant you can eat outside at least for now that will change in the winter of course. Service tended to be a bit patchy, had to wait a little too long for wine refills, that can be corrected which it should be to make the overall experience a Wow ! I would highly recommend The Purple Pig to anyone who enjoys great food.
