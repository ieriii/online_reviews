Best burger I had in a long long time! Had the Mahalo, the grilled (smoked?) ham made it! Not too sweet. Good balance. My wife had the 'Ole Imperial' she loved it but not on the English muffin. Good fries. Awesome beer list. Cheese curds were really really good. They would rival a Wisconsin county fair. However, not enough of them for the price. Will definitely go back and have a drink in the game room. So glad that this is in the neighborhood!
