Was here because of the marathon this past weekend, and this was perhaps one of the best dining experiences I've ever had.  Like a previous reviewer stated, great blend of hipster feel and great food and drinks.  Everything that came out was great, we said "hmmm" at every bite. We had the oysters, hamachi crude, pote, loup de mere, pickles, sarana ham anda few others things. And of yeah, the beer selection is amazing here. We ended up with the Apple Crumb and Brown Butter bread, really nice ways to end the meal. Wait staff was also one of the best experience. It seemed like every time we finished a water glass or plate, someone was there to help. And our waitress had no attitude, down to earth, knew the menu, and was very helpful with suggestions. Definitely a spot I will hit every time I come back to this fun city.
