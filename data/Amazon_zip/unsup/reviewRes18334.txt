YES!! not really lots of options for vegetarians but i still recommend xoco. they tweaked a torta for me, offering many tasty options for replacing the chorizo - very cool! AND the sandwich was totally delicious. the system they have in place is a little confusing at first visit, but it gives you a reason to return. here's what to expect; wait in line to be given a table # (this might involve waiting 10-40 min, depending ont the day/time), order + pay at the counter, eventually you're seated (drinking beers while waiting is encouraged) and you can relax + wait for your "mexican street food-inspired cuisine" to arrive at your table. DEFINITELY order the chips, guacamole, and salsa.
