Delicious food and awesome mojitos! I visited Las Tablas with my wife and another couple for dinner on St. Patrick's day.  At the recommendation of our friends and the waiter, I started out with a mojito. You could tell that the ingredients were fresh, and it was certainly one of the best I have ever had. For an appetizer, we enjoyed the Empanada Combination Plate. The beef, chicken, and cheese empanadas were excellent! For my main course, I ordered the skirt steak and pork loin combination. The skirt was ridiculously tender and perfectly cooked to mid-rare (hard to do on a piece of meat that thin). The pork loin also did not disappoint. The dish was served with sweet plantain (oh, how I love thee), yuca (uniquely outstanding), and potato.  It is not a matter of will I be back...it's when!
