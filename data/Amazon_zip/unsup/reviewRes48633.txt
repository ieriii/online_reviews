The Publican is definitely going to be my go-to restaurant for entertaining out of towners from now on. We ordered, well, a little bit of everything, and everything was delicious. The beer list is no joke. My only complaint was our pretentious waiter. Give me a break dude, it's just pork. Delicious pork, yes, but just pork.
