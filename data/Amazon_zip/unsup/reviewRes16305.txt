A dark, quiet speakeasy bar that I personally found a little bit stuck-up. I enjoy expertly crafted cocktails however I went here with a group of classmates and before we were even served I felt the waiters looked down on us a little and definitely talked down to us (in our early- to mid-20s we were easily the youngest ones there). After a drink or two and a few appetizers we left to find a bar that was more our scene.
