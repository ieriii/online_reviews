This place rocks!! Whether you're in the mood for full-on KBBQ or just want a quick hot stone be bim bap, there is no place better to get your spicy-fix or sate a comfort-food jones. If you're unfamiliar with the cuisine, maybe try a seafood pancake and the marinated short ribs to cook at your table. Bring a few friends, order 1-2 portions fewer than you have people and eat until your tummy is happy! The servers don't all speak much English, but everyone is very helpful and good at deciphering questions.  This is also a fantastic place to bring kids, even the very little ones. The proliferation of little dishes and different flavors will keep them entertained, and their little fingers will have no trouble with the chopstick-ready presentation. No kids - it's also good for sitting back, drinking a few beers, and grilling lots of beef!
