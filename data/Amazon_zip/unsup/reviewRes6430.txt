you jus felt good when you walked in... slightly open kitchen so you can see and hear mostly everything... so my friend and i started with an appetizer.. **truffle toast with fontina cheese and asparagus--yum. main course.. **risotto carbonara with pancetta and peas--double yum. dessert.. **blood orange sorbet with vanilla and hazelnut gelato--omg yum. nothing negative so far except the prices..it was a bit on the expensive side, but i loved the food and the atmosphere so much...it doesnt matter :) i mos def recommend this place to enjoy good wine, food, and company..after all, "one cannot sleep well, love well, or live well unless one has eaten well"
