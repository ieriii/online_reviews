After saying to friends that I don't think there's much going on in Logan Square aside from copious numbers of restaurants (that I have yet to try) we decided on Revolution Brewery and I cashed in my Chicago dining v-card.  I showed up at 7:30ish on a Saturday and was kind of overwhelmed by the swarms of people in the waiting area, let alone at the bar, dining at tables, and jockeying at the host stand to see where they were on the wait list. Friends informed me we wouldn't have a table for another 1.5 hrs. Situations like this clearly call for beer(s) so I was in clover. I'm dumb and usually order beers by the appeal of their name, and at the time Let's Have a War (LHAW) sounded good enough. How to describe LHAW...hmm...if Tang and beer had a baby, this would be it. Oddly orange-y, really carbonated, hoppy, but good. Astronauts would love this shit. After drinking half of it, I realized that a)said beer has an 8% abv and b) I'd had nothing to eat since noon. Hellllllo, instantaneous buzz, happy to see you here! Later I got one of the guest taps called something something 400lb Monkey something...dislike. This choosing by name thing occasionally leads me astray.  After waiting eons and continuing to drink (whoops) we got seated, and ordered right away. I got the mustard herb chicken sandwich, friend 1 got the same, friend 2 got the fish and chips, and friend 3 got the pulled pork. The food arrived way fast and not a one of us was disappointed. I got the mashed potatoes on the side and I will say this: I have never had strong feelings either way about the lowly mashed tater, but HOLY HELL these things are mind blowing. Colors were brighter/sounds were clearer/it may have been the booze but I'll give this round to the potatoes. Final thoughs: nice beer and good food. If I had been mentally prepared for the crowds and the wait, I'd have enjoyed everything that much more.
