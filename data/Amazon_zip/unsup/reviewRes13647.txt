Saw this place on Check Please, so put it on my long list of places to try. The boyfriend loves seafood and checked it out solo and raved so we went a week later. I must say I was overwhelmed in a good way. There were too many fresh fish types to count, so I wimped out and got what I knew, stuffed catfish with shrimp stuffing. I devoured, $22 well spent. I barely got a bit of the bf's tuna (because he ate it without looking up within about 5 minutes) but what I had was good, perfectly cooked medium as he requested. Can't comment on the atmosphere since we ate outside. Took a little longer that necessary for our waiter to come over, but after he did the first time he continued to check in regularly. If you have room, I'd say totter across the street to Margie's candies, that was incredible as well.
