I've been here once and always remembered how much I loved their vegetarian burrito. I live in NYC so I haven't been back but I definitely will next time I'm in Chicago! I didn't appreciate having to wait for a table though, but in all fairness, we were a large party and it was a weekend. It was worth it though!
