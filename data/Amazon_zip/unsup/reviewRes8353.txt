Wow! Excellent pizza for those who'd like thin crust for a change. Not quite as good as pizza in Italy itself, but by far the closest thing I've had in Chicago.  I had one of the specials when I went...white pizza with italian cheese, forest mushrooms, and truffle oil...to die for! My husband had something more traditional...spicy sausage with mozzarella, tomato and basil. Still to die for! I think the best thing about this pizza is the absolutely perfect crust! It's chewy, light and wonderful.  The only downside to this restaurant is the wait. Forget about going on the weekend. We went super early on a sunday evening and still waited over 45 minutes. But it was totally worth it!
