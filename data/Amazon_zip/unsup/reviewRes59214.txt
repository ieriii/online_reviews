I live in Champaign-Urbana and haven't been up to Chicago often, so I just learned that Sun Wah has moved to a new location which has a bigger and nicer setting. I ordered Wonton Soup with BBQ Pork and it's delicious as always. Soup was well balanced, not bland or salty. BBQ Pork came, however, with a bit of smell. Wontons were hugh and they were stuffed with tender ground pork and shrimp .. yummy!Great price, good food!!!
