Texmex is famous for burritos and tacos and this is exactly what you won't find at XOCO, unless you want to miss out on an incredible torta (Mexican sandwich). XOCO's tortas are filled with a great subtle flavor that succeeds quite well at staying close to its roots without tasting generic. Indeed, the combinations are praiseworthy for being so original. If not ordering tortas, churros become the appropriate option. This Latin American dessert is just delicious, more so if served with chocolate. Seriously, there is nothing not to love about this place. Maybe if you don't like avocados...
