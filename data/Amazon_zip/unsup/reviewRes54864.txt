Looks like I'm one of a small few who were not overly impressed by my experience at Hopleaf.The positives: The building is absolutely amazing - great structure and overall vibe. Good beer selection and bar area.The negatives: We were sat upstairs which overall I have no complaints about. Sadly our waiter up there did not help our experience. When my girlfriend asked about a particular dish he seemed uninterested and somewhat bothered by her asking. I believe that one should stand behind there products and seem excited about what they are serving; at least recommend something else if it's really that bad.Overall the atmosphere was good but the food and service could use a facelift.
