Ever since this restaurant was featured as One of Chicago's "Best New Restaurants of 2009", I've been meaning to stop here. I used to pass it all the time but kept going because the small parking lot always looked packed. This time I made the call, reserved at table, and, even though the little parking lot was still clogged with cars when we arrived, the restaurant was empty. Strange. Piccolo was full by the time we left. We joined them for the Chef's Week and the $35 3-course menu.  I took the beet salad. I'm not a big beet fan, but had a beet salad recently at Topolobampo and loved it. In that dish, the beets were highlighted and accented by the other ingredients. At Piccolo, though, the salad had huge 3/4" cubes of 3 beet varieties and the other ingredients were overpowered by the beets. I know, I know... what did I expect. For my entree I had the Braised Short Ribs. They were very tender and flavorful but the sauce was a little overpowering. It wasn't bad but it also wasn't extraordinary.  The thing that really set Piccolo Sogno apart for me was the "tagliatelle di castagna" or pasta with boar ragu (my wife's entree). This was absolutely delicious and I highly reccomend. Also, the desserts were excellent. We got the housemade sorbet trio and the chocolate lava cake (I can't remember what they called this). The lava cake was the best I have ever had with a huge amount of gooey chocolatey goodness surrounded by a thin delicate chocalate cake shell. Mmmmmmm.....
