Great place for dinner, even better place for a date. The fondue options are surprisingly affordable and there's something about cooking your own food that lends itself nicely to conversation. The wine list is comprehensive, so you'll find something to suit your taste. The service is great and helpful if you have any questions. Sitting in a booth worked out nicely for our party of four, but I'd say a table is enough for a party of two. We ordered two meals (with the cheese and chocolate fondues in addition to the main course) and two a la carte and it was more than enough food, so order wisely.
