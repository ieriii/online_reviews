I love the pizza here (I always order the bufalina, simple and tasty).I adore the buffalo mozzarella and prosciutto appetizer!!!!But darn, this place is really overpriced and it's the only reasons I didn't give it a 5 stars. I still love going there for the pizza and I typically choose not to drink any wine or take any dessert or the bill would be outrageously high.$16 for a individual pizza (bufalina) is ehm...quite expensive.Anyway, I'm happy with my compromise, quality over quantity.If you can, avoid busy hours on Friday and Saturday night...
