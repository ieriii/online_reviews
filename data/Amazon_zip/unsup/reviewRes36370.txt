Not only did Edgewater need a really good Asian restaurant to offset some of the shady ethnic eateries in the hood (there are some other safe bets, but I won't go into them here); but now it has an exceptional one in the Indie Cafe. I've eaten here about seven times now and it has yet to do anything short of satisfy. The sushi is always very fresh, well constructed and served with an eye towards artistry and flavor combination. The hot Thai (and even Chinese) dishes are really good too and you can tell that much care has gone into the preparation. They also have the BEST crab rangoons that I have tried in the city. Made from paper thin wantons, the homemade appetizers are light, flavorful, and addictive. I highly recommend this restaurant for a comfortable meal that will please someone with "downtown" quality expectations.
