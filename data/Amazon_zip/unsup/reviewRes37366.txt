This is how I discovered beer. No, I'm not kidding. American beer is by and large, bitter swill. Even the good stuff, produced by microbreweries scattered across the country, are hardly palletable for me, thanks to overactive bitter taste-buds. But a guy from work understood my pain, offered me one of the wonderful brews carried at Hopleaf, and I was forever hooked. Victory, thy name is La Fin Du Monde. But it gets better! This bar literally has walls stocked with obscure imports from all over Europe, including *mead*. Even something as obscure and difficult to obtain as Trappistes Rochefort 10 flows like water here. This bar is seriously a Belgian lover's paradise. At one point they actually carried Westvleteren, quite possibly one of the best beers in the world as rated by ratebeer and beeradvocate. They only stopped offering that rare treat when the Westvlereten monks restricted sales to the abby itself. How's that for going the extra mile? The appetizers are similarly famous. Few can complain about consuming a large pail of Mussels while downing frothy meal-like beer in glasses specifically designed to accent the flavor. Take a group of friends, sit back in one of the booths, and relax!
