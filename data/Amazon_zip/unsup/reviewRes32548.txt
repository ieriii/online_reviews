Ya know the old saying that some of the best places to eat are often the little known, inconspicuous, 'hole in the wall', mom and pop ones? I think the Chicago Diner is definitely a contender with it's Vegan exclusive menu choices. My first time here, I was very skeptical because I'd never been to a vegan restaurant before but one bite of the 'pot stickers' with their accompanying tangy soy sauce and I was hooked! I had three different entrees and be warned that EVERYTHING tastes different but in a creative way.  The service is also excellent, every server is jovial and polite and don't even get me started on the Shakes... I would have NEVER thought a vegan shake would taste better than one from Oberwise but I was way wrong and best of all, I don't spend an hour with stomach cramps after I have one of Chicago diner's shakes. My only quibble is the location, where the limited parking is off an alley way where your car might get dinged. Also, If you're having dinner, get here before 5pm, because the dining space is small and get's cramped when busy.  I'm looking forward to trying their brunch at some point, I've heard their breakfast food is good!
