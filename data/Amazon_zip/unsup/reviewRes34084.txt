Its been years since my last visit, but now that I am back I am going to use Sultans as an excuse to avoid cooking often. I value having healthy good tasting food, that is affordable and never disappointing (even cold the next day) right around the corner.  Also, to add to the consensus: Their Falafel cannot be topped.
