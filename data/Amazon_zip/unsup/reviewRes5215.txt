Cheese. Swine. Wine. That's all I needed to hear. A gated entrance made way to some communal outdoor seating and even though the weather was nice I felt, as a loner, I'd be better suited at the bar. And I truly was. I ate food so good I'd roll around in it like pigs roll in whatever they roll around in (I think you know). Pig ears with pickled pepper, crispy kale and a fried egg, pork liver terrine with thick slices of bread doused in butter and toasted. Although the mantra pushes wine I opted for two Gulden Draks, an utterly perfect complement to my rich dishes. This was a splurge, calorically and monetarily, but probably the most enjoyed and memorable meal of my mini-vacation.
