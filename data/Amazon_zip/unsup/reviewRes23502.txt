My husband and I went to Icosium for the first time last night. I have been saying every time that we've passed this place for awhile now that we should go and boy am I glad we did! I thought that the food was good and the little details were fabulous.  For $8.50 you can get a yummy vegetarian crepe w/ a bowl of soup. For a few dollars more you can add some meat. You can build your own or you can choose from a list of sweet or savory crepes. I had savory for dinner -- the Icosium Crepe. My husband had something w/ apples and brie and it too was very good. I don't think the food was mind-blowingly good (hence not giving it 5 stars) but it was something I would definitely come back for.  I loved that the crepes were vegetarian and there was nothing about them that made me feel like I was missing out on something by not eating meat. I also LOVED the fact that they had vegetarian soup to go with the crepe (but they also have meat you crazy omnivores!). I don't know why that's such a big deal, but it makes me feel loved. So often it's those things that are overlooked for vegetarians.  The decor was okay. I didn't have the strong response that some of the earlier reviewers did to it. I thought it was fine -- not over the top.  I REALLY got a kick out of the cups that our tea was served in. Yes -- the little things are the most important sometimes. They were little see-through glasses and they were so delightful (and came with little spoons that fit into the wee glasses). We had the mint and honey tea and it was mmm-good. I also enjoyed the cucumber slice in the water. It gave more flavor than I would have thought and that flavor was good.  The service was friendly, but slow once we had our food. Since it slowed down only after we got our food, it didn't royally piss me off. But, I might have liked a *little* more attentiveness. In short: good comfort food, very tasty, not a terrible price, WILL return.
