So, I'm a total carnivore, but I was in the gayborhood and wanted a salad and decided to eat at Chicago Diner. Plus my friend had never been there and I always like introducing new places to people. Anyway, I ordered the GREEN MACHINE with organic feta, no grilled seitan, and lime-cilantro dressing on the side. I enjoyed the dressing very much. The rest of the salad was something I could have made at home.  My friend and I wanted to order the humus, but our server told us they had just ran out (3pm on a Wednesday). Sad, but she talked us into ordering the Nachos which were pretty delicious. We could have used more chips because Chicago Diner was very generous with the toppings, but I was surprised how much the "chorizo" actually tasted like meat.  One more thing, I loved our waitress. She was quality and I wish I would have asked her for her name. I will definitely go back just because of her.
