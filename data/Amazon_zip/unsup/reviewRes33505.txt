Not sure what all the hullabaloo is about here folks. Even yelpers giving it 5 stars note the long wait and average food. I don't get it. Saturday at 1pm. 2 people, About a 35 minute wait. Place is hopping, loud, looks pretty clean. Check out the menu while you wait, because you will be waiting. B+ South Beach. Half pineapple with yogurt and fruit and granola. So'kay. nothing special here but it was refreshing C  Pancakes, Eggs & Meat..  average, average and average.  The pancakes were tough, heavy and oversweet. Eggs were terrible: I asked for over medium and got the runniest eggs I've had in my life. (that happens everywhere though, no-one seems capable of over-medium). The bacon was really fatty; but being bacon still delicious. And the sausages were ok but not to my taste; too fat and moist, I like them thin and crispier on the outside. A-  Blueberry Muffin. Nice and warm and great. B+ Service. Friendly and just fine all around. A-.  Bright and clean and roomy.  Want to go for real treat for Brunch? I suggest heading a few blocks away to Tempo Caf.  You'll wait twice as long but it's actually worth it.
