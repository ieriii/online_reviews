This place is tight, crowded, and there's generally a decent wait for a table, but once you get in and start pouring you BYOB this place is like heaven. The food is excellent (kalbi and cheyook bokim were superb) and the side dishes appeared to be endless - my party of 7 departed feeling full and elated on an inexpensive $120 check.
