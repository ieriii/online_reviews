I love chocolate!!... but I didn't like two of the drinks I had here (Barcelona and the one with almond milk). It's probably my taste buds talking crazy. The free self-serve water was awesome, though. I had the milanesa torta without hot peppers or onions (simply because I don't like them). It was okay.. and then, all of a sudden, I thought maybe it would be better with avocados. The guacamole was delicious so I figured I'd want some of it in my torta, without taking it from my chips. My request sounded crazy, it took a few minutes before they knew how much to charge for some slices of avocados. For 50 cents, I received almost half an avocado! The 'ehh' torta turned into 'yummy' torta! I would definitely get it again.. and order a side of avocado. The churros with ice cream were so good... a bit too cinnamon-y, maybe, but still delicious! Note: go there early or don't go at all, that line is ridiculous. And if you're thinking 'well I'll wait in line while my friend gets a table'---forget about it! They seat you... and only after you've ordered. In fact, they won't let you order until they find you a table.
