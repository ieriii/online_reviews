Dangerous place, the Pasta Bowl. It's right in the middle of LP, with an awesome lunch special ($6 for a huge serving of pasta & pop!). I am a creature of habit and always go with the farfalle pollo or the mac & cheese. Certainly not ideal if you're trying to eat light/healthy, but exactly what you're looking for if you want some delicious, inexpensive comfort food!
