I finally made it to the Windy City last week to check out Greektown...From this site it seemed that i should definitely check out Greek Islands Restaurant from all the great reviews. I will first say that this restaurant was not as good as I had hoped but still earned 4 stars from me. The restaurant was very clean and had great atmosphere...it was rally buzzing inside. One thing the restaurant lacked was a greek band...that could of earned a few extra points in my book. I ordered a greek salad, cup of egg lemon soup and had Greek Lamb Kabobs with Sokolatina (Greek Chocolate Cake for dessert). First the greek salad was a disappointment given the feta cheese was not crumbled on the salad and the salad did not have any red onions...which was a huge mistake in my book. The egg lemon soup was very good however...it didnt have any chicken. The Lamb kabob was okay but it was not as tender as it should have been and the sokolatina was not as good as I have had at other greek restaurants. The portions were pretty large and the prices were very reasonable. Would I go back again? Yes...my friend had the pastitso and I thought it was amazing...I think it depends what you order here. Ill give it a 83/100
