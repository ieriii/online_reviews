This place is cozy, inviting and quite tasty...all the good qualities of a favorite neighborhood Italian place. I'd highly recommend the eggplant parmesan and whatever gnocchi they're offering that day. I read somewhere once that gnocchi means tiny pillows in Italian, and if that's true, then that's exactly what they look like! Plus, you get lots of food...enough for lunch the next day. Also, it's a BYOB...what's not to love!?
