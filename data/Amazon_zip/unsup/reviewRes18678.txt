Mahalo burger you are so good! love it! I suggest Asking for a side of the vinagrette to drench the burger in. If you are looking for an alternative burger spot, where you dont have to listen to heavy metal thrasher music and wait at least an hour to get seated...this is the place to go to! Bad apple is a tad more family friendly, can serve groups larger than 6, and the music varies and isnt over bearing so you dont have to yell at your date just to have a decent conversation. I went with a group of 7 and was able to talk to the person across the round table.  I have tried 4 of the burgers, Mahalo, Hangover, Big Texan and Slow Burn. The mahalo has a sweet cilantro vinagrette which i was surprised at how good it was and combined with the pineapple slices and thick cut bacon. (i love bacon it makes everything better).  If you have a big appetite and don't mind a burger full of meat, the Big texan is the way to go. Definately felt gluttonous once i was done eating it. Its a burger with pulled pork, (i thought it had had ham but menu says otherwise) all on texas toast...bbq-licous.  I didnt try the vampires revenge but for all you garlic lovers im sure you will enjoy it. i could smell it from the table next to me....WOW. Besides the burger I havent really tried anything else except for a few beers. THEY HAVE A VERY EXTENSIVE BEER SELECTION...it can be overwhelming! I just wish the wait staff was a little bit more knowledgeable but then again that is a lot of beer to brush up on. It was nice to see they had a coupleo f ciders as an alternative to beer. I want to go back adn try the midwest snake bite! Ill let you know how it is. OH one last thing...seeing that my group was 7ppl. the waitress kindly (without us asking) rung us up on separate tabs. Defiantely made collecting money very easy at the end! Thanks bad apple! never had a bad experience here.
