Great pizza - never dined in, but always get it delivered. You want toppings? This place is probably king for toppings because its toppings overload, but that's a good thing. If you want sausage, I think you can order the wheel of meat (layer of meat), or have it crumpled. I've always have either the pepperoni only (a couple of co-workers are touchy like that) or the SMOG, which is the Morton Grove location's abbreviation of Sausage, Mushroom, Onions, and Green peppers. Compares nicely with Lou Malnati's and Gino's East as far as deep dish pizza is concerned, but still hold its own as being unique, so I can't say its better or worse than, say, Lou's. Otherwise, the pizza is such that you can get full from one or two pieces, regardless of size of the pie, and the taste is grand with the pizza sauce, cheese, crust, and the purposely burnt edges which is cheese - don't like the burnt cheese, take it off. Delivery is almost always good, as they will get it to you within 60-90 minutes; such is deep dish pizza for the long times but worth it. People taking your order is pleasant to deal with, though the web site is a bit spartan. Recommended for pizza lovers! Oh yeah, this location has been renovated from a fire, so it should be nice and up for business already.
