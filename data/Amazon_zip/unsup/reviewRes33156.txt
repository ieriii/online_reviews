I finally got to try Yolk and I wasn't disappointed. The hubs and I got there around 8:30am Sunday morning and they were on a wait by 9. Food was really good - red diced potatoes were so yummy! I got the cheezy egg bagel sammy thingy (not the official name) and Eddy got the southwestern omelet. Both were very good. Service was ok - not super friendly. Coffee cups were empty on occasion. All in all I would go back but if there were a long wait, I may just try to find something else. P.S. Do they really need like 7 people to work in the front cashier area? Way overstaffed.
