Ok, I guess Doug doesn't really need another review for this place. He knows it's great, and if you look at how many reviews and the star rating... you know it's great too. I worked across the street at Midway Games for two years and this was the default lunch spot for most of the company. They serve up brats the Wisconsin which is the only real way you should eat it. Meanwhile the hot dogs are all Chicago, you can even spice it up with the fire dog. If you're the adventurous type Doug is more than willing to assault you with the sausage of the week. Who knows what kind of animal it used to be, I just know I've had rattlesnake, elk, and probably a couple endangered animals. All are tasty with his custom condiments. Doug is super friendly and so are his staff. Despite having a line wrapping around the building they'll remember your name if a regular. Speaking of the line... I know it's daunting at first but it moves quickly and it's worth it. I only wish they were open a little longer because where I work now is way far.
