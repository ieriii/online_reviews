Rolls are good and all, but the true test of a good sushi place is the Sashimi. I was not impressed with the quality of fish at Sushi X. It wasn't terrible, but I've definitely had better and there are better choices in the area. We got one of the rolls that the menu called "giant". It should have said "too big to eat". Sushi is meant to be eaten in one bite. These rolls were so big and packed with stuff that I had to eat it in 2 or 3 bites and they just fell apart all over my plate. Some pros are the small and laid-back atmosphere. I get tired of stuffy sushi places, this one is cool and unpretentious. I also loved the spicy miso soup.
