Great catering services here! I called in for catering for a party of 25 in celebration of my friend's upcoming birthday and we decided to try this place out. The man on the phone took my order, wrote it all down confirmed with me two days before and it came promptly the day of the party.All of it was unloaded off a van with brown heating boxes which tells me they care about their food keeping warm. all the guests loved the food and asked where we got the catering from. Luckily the boxes were supplied with extra to go menus. I'm happy and all the guests were happy too, additionally my wallet was kept happy! lol!
