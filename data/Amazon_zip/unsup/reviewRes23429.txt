GOODS: Easy to find, good location in Chinatown A/C Has a 2nd floor that was less crowded. Lots of water refills Good cabbage, good wonton soup. Husband had the special Tony's Chili Chicken and I had the Sole in Black Bean Sauce. The chicken was very good dipped in the sole sauce! Upstairs bathroom was clean and had a green light! BADS: Sweating and sticking to plastic chairs. Food took a long time to come out. Charged extra for rice (I hate this so freaking much). The special we ordered was dry - would have ordered up some more veggies with it if we knew. Will be back and will try more!
