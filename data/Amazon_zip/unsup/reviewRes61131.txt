Better than Giordano's. Everything tasted real and home-made, not like it could have been a frozen pizza. The cheese sticks were divine. Great service. Long line, but worth it. We got the four-cheese deep dish and it was exactly what we were looking for in our first-ever Chicago deep-dish pizza. Will be back!!
