This place is really top notch. The food is excellent and the wait staff is fun, friendly and so attentive, and our mixed drinks were deliciously potent, even after all the heavy food in our bellies! We came here to celebrate our anniversary, which we mentioned when making our reservation online, and they brought us a happy anniversary desert at the end of our meal! From past experiences, I didn't think any restaurants payed attention to those notes in online reservations so I was shocked to see a big bowl of sugary yumminess with "happy anniversary" spelled out on the plate make its way over to our table. Even during our meal, a few of the waiters said Happy Anniversary to us as they walked by. It really made the experience for us to be in such a welcoming atmosphere. We've been to a couple brazilian steakhouses like this in Chicago, and this is by far the best!
