Today I went to Alliance for the first time, and tried the "Chocolate Hazelnut Shooter." It was very tasty, and kind of expensive. A lot of the pastries are expensive, but then again, I'm a college student--everything is expensive to me! This place is great if you want to try something different, it's not your typical bakery. The cakes in the window are really cool. I liked the outdoor area seating, where I enjoyed my shooter and the view of Division Street.
