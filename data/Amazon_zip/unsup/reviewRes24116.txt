I can't believe I have not reviewed Icosium, since I have eaten here numerous times. We live up the street and walk down here on the weekends, when we get a craving for breakfast crepes. I have to say I stick with the eggs and Algerian sausage in my crepe and then get either the Belgian dark chocolate crepe or the Nutella crepe. Sometimes, when I am feeling extra greedy, I start or finish with their cappuccino, which is fantastic. I love the potatoes they serve on the side with the savory crepes too. All round wonderful eating experience, every time.
