Suit Up! Grab your billfold! Clear the next four hours on your calendar! TRU is a special restaurant that pleases on several different levels. Right off the bat I felt like I was dining in heaven. There were no windows to the outside reminding me I was in Chicago. The white curtains that cover the walls from floor to ceiling let you know that you are in the world of TRU. Table for two? Make that two and a half because the lady's purse gets its own seat too. Take that coat check girl! Owner and executive chef Rick Tramonto is the master of the amuse bouche and you definitely get to experience his skills from the first course to the last. While it is possible to order a la carte I don't know why anyone would want to do so at a restaurant of this caliber. If you are going to go you should go big and get the Sommelier's Collection or one of the other grand tastings. Let's face it, how often do you get to eat caviar off of a glass staircase or sip soup from a Versace tea cup? The service at TRU is perfect. Attentive, polite and friendly. It's so easy to be intimidated by a restaurant of this caliber but the staff will make you feel welcome and appreciated. There are no too-cool-for-school wannabe actor types at TRU. TRU has always managed to deliver some surprises. Whether it's an impromptu meet and greet with the chef of a little gift bag of goodies for later, I always leave TRU feeling very special.
