We had ordered the roasted sucking pig tostada, which came with this green sauce that was in the basket. Some of the sauce had spilled onto the sandwich while being brought to our table, which normally would never be an issue, but this sauce was something else---- The sauce knocked the wind out of me. Seriously, it knocked the f****** wind out of me, I couldn't feel my mouth/lips for almost 10 minutes. I don't know whose idea it was not to warn us about this crazy devil sauce, but man that got me winded. I must say that I'm from an island that loves everything spicy, and I've never really had an issue with food being too spicy until this. I couldn't even enjoy the rest of my tostada because a.) my taste buds were paralyzed for 10+ minutes b.) my lips were of F I R E c.) the sauce had spilled on my tostada and there was no way I was risking that AGAIN. The spicy mexican drinking chocolate was really good, and the churros were crunchy, sweet, fried amazin goodness, they almost made up for the crazy tostada freak accident that happened earlier.
