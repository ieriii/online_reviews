There is something magical about this tiny little place located just off busy Milwaukee with the blue line roaring by in the background. I'm pretty sure the magic springs forth from either the oatmeal shake, which sounds strange but is scrumptious, or possibly the plantains, but either way this place is really stellar. I was so excited to go here after all the good reviews here on Yelp that I did my research and decided days in advance what I was going to get (yes, I know, I'm a dork). The Costa Rican sandwich, side of plantains and an oatmeal shake. The sandwich was pretty good, but reminded me a little bit of an Italian Beef sandwich, which I'm normally not a huge fan of. My friend, however got the steak sandwich, which was awesome! The oatmeal shake, unusual, but if you like cinnamon, which I love, you've got to try this. It reminded me a little of a less sweet Thai ice tea. And the plantains were great, there was something special about them, just can't put my finger on it... The outside of the restaurant is very unassuming, the outdoor seating area (I'm thinking that's what it was) was really weird, an open concrete patio surrounded by a metal fence facing Milwaukee, but the interior was cute and simple, and very small. Service was prompt and polite, and as always extra plus, its a BYOB.
