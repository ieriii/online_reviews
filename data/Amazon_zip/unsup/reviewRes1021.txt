Gourmet hot dogs? Well, not quite. Hot Doug's is everything you want in a hot dog joint and everything you didn't know you needed. It's a classy little joint in a strange part of the neighborhood, but it's always buzzing with a long line so always remember to go about an hour ahead of the time you want to actually eat.  At first, the line might turn you off and you'll begin to weigh in whether it's worth waiting so long for some hot dogs, but then you begin to wonder why so many people wait so long for hot dogs and you take the gamble only to realize that it was well worth every minute of the anticipation that is satisfied by the creation of Mr. Doug Sohn. I made the mistake of asking whether the Pork Curry sausage was good and Doug simply replied to me, "Do you like delicious?" I carefully answered.. "Yes...." I almost wanted to reply with a witty answer, like, "Am I Asian?" In any case, Doug is a certified Hot Dog connoisseur and a funny man. Don't get overhyped with the food selection, though. They are every bit delicious, but remember one thing: They're still hot dogs. Don't expect 5 star gourmet food. I'd recommend the alligator and the regular hot dog. I thought the Duck fat fries were a little overrated, but they're still worth a try nonetheless. And don't forget to bring plenty of cash. It would be tragedy to have waited so long only to find out that credit is not accepted.
