I just could not understand the hype, the long line waiting at the door. If you do not know how to cook at all you might enjoy this place for their pancakes and french toasts. My Tuscan Fritata was tasteless so I could not eat it. My husband refused to eat his hamburger after trying it. Fortunately, they did not charge us for the hamburger when my husband said he would like it to be taken from our bill since he did no like it. I should have done the same.
