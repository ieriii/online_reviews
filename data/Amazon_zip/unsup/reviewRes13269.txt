Best brunch I have had in a long time. Everything was delicious. Started with the awesome mimosa's - that shot of triple sec and the sugar rimmed glass make it a favorite of mine and I know my mimosas! Had the Parmesan eggs - buttery, fluffy, light - ate the entire huge portion. Bacon cooked perfectly crispy and then there was the rye toast. Who would have thought rye toast can be that good. It is, I swear. Service is good, fast and friendly. If you want a great local place to have a Saturday or Sunday brunch, I highly recommend Glenn's Diner
