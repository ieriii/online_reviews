Every trip to Chicago involves a stop at Giordano's, were you are guaranteed a fine Chicago Deep Dish Pizza. You can find a Giordano's on many street corners throughout the Chicagoland area, but the one here on Rush is the only one worth taking a trip to. The pizza is always fantastic, I highly recommend pre-ordering, you will still have time for an appetizer before the pizza hits the table, if you choose. The only problem I ever have at this location is the servers could be a little more friendly and slightly more attentive... but I understand... it's a hot spot for sure!
