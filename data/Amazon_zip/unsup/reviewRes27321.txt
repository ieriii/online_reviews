The food at Nuevo Leon is spectacular and economically priced. Oh - and the entertainment is FREE: last time I was there, a rat appeared perching atop a light fixture right above a huge table celebrating a quincenara (the people, not the rat, were celebrating the quincenara). Chaos ensued, party dresses fled to the corners of the room. A grinning staff member came out, stood up on the table (he may have crushed a pink tiara somewhere in the mix), and hit the rat off of the light with a broom, and the rat went flying like a baseball into left field (a/k/a someone else's booth!) The rat, startled, took one look around and fled... back into the kitchen! Instead of screaming and making a scene, the whole restaurant erupted into cheers and clapping, and the heroic broom-hitter nodded and smiled before walking back to the kitchen, from whence rat came. Suddenly the mole-covered chicken was just not as appetizing to me, but I'm sure it was an isolated incident. Then again, that was a really plump-looking rat...
