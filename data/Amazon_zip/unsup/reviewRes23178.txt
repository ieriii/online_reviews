If you're ever in Chinatown, make it a priority to stop at Lao Sze Chuan. It is easily one of the best Chinese restaurants in the whole city. Everything is good at Lao Sze Schuan. Like the name implies, the food originates from the Sichuan province in China. They are known to like their spices, so obviously Lao Sze Chuan specializes in very, and I mean very spicy. The restaurant is two levels, and both levels are pretty spacious. The service is not good here, but don't expect good service at Chinese restaurants, only expect good food and fast service. You can order your typical Americanized Chinese food like mongolian beef, sesame chicken, general tso's, etc, and it is very good, but they have a ton of authentic Sichuan, as well as Mandarin and Cantonese food. I love their dim sum. Their house noodles come in a broth with chunks of ground meat, along with some spinach, and noodles. It comes with a little kick, and you can ask for it to be spicier if you'd like. The sesame chicken I've had here, is the best I've ever had. The fried rice is always tasty, I love their egg rolls as well as their pot stickers. Don't be afraid to try anything here, unless you do not like spicy food. Even their spicy cabbage appetizer they bring you is delicious. For the best Chinese food in the city, come to Lao Sze Chuan. They offer very good portions for their prices, and have the most consistently delicious Chinese food I've ever had. 5/5 *Head down over to Joy Yee Noodle for a smoothie afterwards, if you saved some room that is.
