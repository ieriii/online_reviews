Most authentic italian style pizza I've been to in the U.S. Was recently in Rome and had over my fair share of pizza. I can honestly say Spacca Napoli is the real thing :-) I usually go with my husband and we get an appetizer and one pizza. It is the perfect amount and we leave without leftovers and feeling just full enough. Great wine selection too. I've never had the desserts, but they look good too :-)
