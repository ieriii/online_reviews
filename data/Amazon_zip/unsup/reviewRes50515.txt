In short, good food and ok service and venue. I've been to both locations, here and the west loop. Pretty much the same, the west loop seems to be a little more packed at times.  The menu offers good variety, but it's hit or miss. It's mostly southern inspired dishes with a few classic breakfast/brunch items. There's some dishes I love, and others I'd pass on. Service is ok, but can be sparse when they get a little busy. Haven't had rude servers or anything, just nothing outstanding. Must try: Red beans and rice - add the chicken sausage on the side...really good! Crunchy French toast - normal french toast that's coated with cornflakes...nice, thick texas style toast, buttery and crunchy at the same time. Yummo!!! Cheesy grits - not a fan of grits, but add cheese and I'll convert. Falls short: Biscuits and gravy - biscuits were a little hard, and the gravy was just ok. Crabcake benedict - could be so good, but needs some extra southern kick in the seasoning the dish. Overall, good place for brunch, especially if you don't want to wait too long or if you have a big group. But I really only go here if I'm craving the crunchy french toast or the red beans and rice.
