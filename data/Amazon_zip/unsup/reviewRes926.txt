First time we went, the place just closed at 4pm, which was a bummer. BUT... we came back and it was TOTALLY WORTH IT! The cashier was very friendly and was fun to talk to. The Hot Dogs were worth the second trip back here. I had the original chicago dog. After the first bite, I didn't want it to end. It was that good! The only downsides are that its 1.) typically a long wait, 2.) only open until 4 and 3.) the CTA buses don't seem to go from the Blue line to Hot Dougs for some reason. But other than that its worth the wait!
