So I went to this place to have churros and a chocolate drink. You'd think these two simple things would be amazing here, right? I mean, with the Bayless and all. Guess what... they're not. I'd rather go to Starbucks and then the churro stand at the Navy Pier, as the food at those places is better, cheaper, and quicker to get despite having to get from one establishment to the next. Bayless is overrated.
