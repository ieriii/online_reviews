Headed here a few weeks back for our ritual week-night ladies night. Started off at the bar with their infused vodka - order it, it's awesome. One of the barbacks was great, made all our cocktails for us...even once we got seated. Leon, the host, was personable and made the effort to check in on our party during the meal. Those two made our night! Oh yeah we ate too :) Every time we dine here we can't get enough of the cow's milk foccaccia - amazing (yes, it's better than the version at avec).
