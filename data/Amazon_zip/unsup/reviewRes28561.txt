I came here when the winterscape party was a flop. Stopped in at like 9PM. Sat at the bar. Ooooo, I like the scene in this place. The bartender gave us a drink list and I usually do wine but I decided to try something different. I just find that usually the drink list is all sweet gross drinks. This actually seemed no different but I decided on the pear one. It was pretty good. My friend has something pink and it tasted really sweet...YUCK. Anyway, I was slightly annoyed because the bartender didnt ask if we wanted anything to eat or to even see then menu...he just rang us up and handed over the bill. I did ask to see the menu because we were thinking of getting something small since we were unable to get anything to eat at the party...YIKES, disaster. Anyway, he was like, let me see...I was like, weird....its only like 930 and there are clearly people still eating....is the kitchen already closed? He said it was fine and handed over a menu. It looked really good but nothing that we really were in the mood for right then. We were kind of looking for something like a really good app but didnt see anything that caught our eyes. So we decided not to order. Alas, the bartender gave us truffle popcorn....YUM! It was great. I will be back some time for dinner but I just wasnt in the mood when I was there. Overall, it looks like a good restaurant. The drinks were pretty good and reasonable. $11 each, not terrible for downtown area.
