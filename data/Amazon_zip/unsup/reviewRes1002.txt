Fresh off my successful venture to find Chicago's spiciest burger, I can now die happy that I sampled some of Chicago's finest hotdogs. After the requisite wait outside, we sat down with some equally food savy patrons at a table. I ordered the duck sausage dog with foie-gras, alligator dog, and chorizo chicken dog with mole. The duck sausage and foie-gras was absolutely sublime. I don't remember what sauce was on it but it was ridiculously rich and decadent. The alligator dog was well done and the star was definitely the alligator meat which was surprisingly slightly swampy. I think the mole on the chicken sausage was probably the best sauce out of all three. It was a very interesting mixture of different spices that somehow didn't get muddled out all together. After seemingly eating my body weight in hot dogs, I stumbled out of the restaurant in a meat induced trance. I have no idea or recollection of how I drove home with that degree of food coma setting in but the entire experience was perfect. If you come here, absolutely try their specialty dogs although their normal chicago dog is pretty damn good as well. Also, Doug is probably one of the nicest people you will meet in chicago.
