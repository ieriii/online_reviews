This place is very Alice in Wonderland-ish, specially the high-back chairs. Yes, a bit pretentious, but it is wicker park after all. The view-restricting velvet drapes add to the anticipation and mystery while waiting in line for your table, but the space falls short once you're inside. It felt empty and unfinished? This might be to the lack of light inside though, they probably don't want people falling over random furniture. It is THAT dark. Even though the dress code is a well known fact, i did see a couple of guys with t-shirts and ripped jeans inside. If they're trying to keep a standard, they should stick to it. Overall this place is great for a special date or occasion. I don't see myself waiting in line for hours every weekend just for the drinks or food. But if you're willing to treat yourself, definitely make it out one night.
