After reading about how great this place was, I decided to have a medium three topping pizza and a six-pack of coke delivered to my house. I couldn't have been more disappointed. The pizza arrived cold and they charged $9.00 for a six-pack of coke. What a rip!  The bill was over $40 not including tip.  The pizza after I reheated was okay, but by far not the best. It's not even in my top 10. Maybe it's better if you eat it there.
