if you eat meat and haven't been here, what's wrong with you? come on. there are only 2 things that could possibly be complained about: cash only, waiting in long ass line. yeah, there's always a line. but it moves pretty fast, and if it doesn't go all the way down the block consider yourself lucky. the food's amazing. i try to get something different every time, which isn't hard because Doug is always cookin' up somethin new.
