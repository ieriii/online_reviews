The Gage is such a try-hard. There are things about it I loved, and things I really didn't like at all. Drinks were excellent, but pricey. House champagne, $21 a glass. Our server (an Englishman with highlights and heavily tattooed arms), was hamming up his Englishness to 11 on the ham-o-meter. He reminded me of Bill Nighy's aging rock star in Love Actually, and was constantly trying to sell us on the priciest drinks while patting me (literally) on the back. The most expensive bottle of wine, and the most expensive draft beer were both his "favorite", and the "best he's ever had". On the cocktail side of the menu, the hot hard cider and the sidecar from the seasonal cocktails menu were both very good. The food was mixed, with a menu full of exotic meats: bison, elk, goat, etc, arranged seemingly arbitrarily into a four course menu. We tried a selection of appetizers. While beautifully presented with a quail egg, the bison tartare was not good -- it was much too coarsely chopped, and the large cubes of meat were still joined together by stringier pieces, giving it a very unpleasant texture in the mouth. I suspect someone needs their knives sharpening. The scotch egg was good -- I'm amused to see that picnic food has now become gastro-pub fayre, and even more entertained to see that "authentic Irish curry fries" are an entity (though the fries themselves were good and crunchy). The brussels sprouts were okay, but I don't think were well complimented by the milky, cheesy (brie?) sauce they swam in. Like the tartare, the mushrooms again suffered from a blunt knife -- several slices of a very large mushroom still connected at one end, which when cooked to a rubbery consistency, made them unpleasant to eat. I would try The Gage again for an entree, or perhaps another cocktail, but doubt it would be a destination. We spent $300 between four of us, for a few hours of drinks and a handful of shared appetizers.
