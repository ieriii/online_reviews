It was ok. It was a hotel. Robert Plant overlooked our toilet and bed. I hated the shower, as it was the kind with an opening to the bathroom, half a wall of glass- no way to retain heat, or double up on bathroom use if necessary. Check in and out were smooth, valet service nice. Wish we had had time to go from floor to floor checking out memorabilia.
