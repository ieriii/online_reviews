Finally got to Carnivale and soooooo glad I did. Wonderful experience. My fiance and I ended up getting the ropa vieja (AMAZING - MUST TRY), the trio tasting of serviches (shrimp, scallops and kampachi - All fantasic), the churrasco (possibly the best steak I've ever had) and the carnivale cake (very good and extremely TALL). Drinks, service and decor were absolutely fantastic. The prices aren't the greatest, but everything else is wonderful. Its a must try if you haven't experienced it.
