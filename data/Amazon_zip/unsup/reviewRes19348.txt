Tried Coast last night for the first time and was IN LOVE with it! I went with a group of 7 and the low bill at the end of dinner was such a pleasant surprise. Our waiter was wonderful and we took many of his suggestions for things to try. I tried the Angry Salmon appetizer as well as the sesame crusted scallop and both were fantastic. ESPECIALLY the scallop. For sushi we ordered about 10 rolls and had a taste of everything. My favorites were the Philly roll, the White Dragon roll, and the Alaska roll. My least favorite was the salmon skin roll. I love good BYOB places because you get so much bang for your buck. I will definitely be going back to Coast!
