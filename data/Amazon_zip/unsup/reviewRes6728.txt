BBQ/Smoke Lovers Heaven in the City!!! What an excellent dinner we had last night a Q. My parents have been a few times (Which says a lot, as nothing gets them out of the burbs...) Both my Mom and Dad love the place- My Dad is an BBQ/Smoke addict and my Mom as well as loving the food, loves the ambiance. It really is the perfect male/female compromise!!! Excellent masculine menu in a setting that is casually beautiful. As far as my "Gluten Free" needs... There was plenty to offer on my GF menu. The Kobe Brisket was delicious!!! We had a party of 16 and we were well accommodated in our own private room up front. Our server was Otha, and he was really on top of everything as well as being truly enjoyable to talk to. This was the perfect place to host my parents 60/40 birthday/anniversary party. They LOVED it as well as all of our guests- Thank you Chicago Q, we will definitely be back!!!
