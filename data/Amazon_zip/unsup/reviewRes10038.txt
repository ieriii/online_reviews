I can't say anything about the patio that hasn't already been said - it's just plain lovely. I lucked into what might have been the last warm evening of the season here. Can't think of a better way to send off summer.  It sounds like some reviewers found the food iffy, so perhaps it depends on what you order, but I enjoyed everything I ate. The recipes seem simple and familiar (in a good way) but they were extremely well-prepared and flavorful. I'll have to try it again this winter, minus the "patio experience" to compare the two! The milk-braised pork shank actually fell off the bone when I cut into it. My side of kale was served with pancetta (and what isn't better with bacon?). My dinner date ordered the seafood pasta (frutti di mare). He'd had it before and highly recommends it. We split the oxtail stew with veggies as an appetizer, and I might come back for that again when it's cold - it was like a hearty winter stew (but fancier, in a good way).  The service was extremely attentive. My water glass was always full. Always. No matter how much water I drank. It almost became a challenge to see how much water I could put away between pours. I gave up when I began floating in my seat. The wine list is mostly Italian (naturally), but with other regions represented too. The staff is knowledgeable and can make good recommendations. When my companion didn't like his first choice they offered him a substitute he liked much better, and they didn't charge him for the first glass.  Just don't ask me about dessert! We split the ricotta (I think) cheesecake with berries, which I definitely enjoyed, but I'm not generally a fan of Italian desserts (outside of gelato) so I'm a poor judge of them.
