Good experience overall. Had reservations but they weren't ready to seat us until 30 minutes after. Stood around awkwardly for 25 minutes until a spot opened up at the bar. Ordered a drink and was seated at our table as soon as we got our drinks. Had a few more drinks the rest of the night. Drinks were all good and the bartenders seemed knowledgeable by the way they were mixing drinks. Our waitress was very friendly and helpful. Although she forgot about our garlic noodles. When we reminded her (after having already finished everything else we ordered), she made some excuse about the kitchen still preparing it... - Crispy Brussel Sprout Salad ($14) - best dish of the night! very unique taste. recommended by our waitress, who said, "if you don't like it, I will give you $10." - "Toast and Jam" ($15) - crispy shrimp toast & spicy tuna jam. also very good - Rock Shrimp Tempura ($15) - too bland. I would pass on this - Garlic Noodles ($9) - nothing special - Rainbow Roll ($16) - average I would come back for the Crispy Brussel Sprout Salad, Toast & Jam, drinks, ambiance, and to try the other items.
