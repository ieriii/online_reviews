If you like meat on a wooden slab, this place is right up your alley. A big group of friends and I went here last weekend after failing to get reservations at Tango Sur (we called two weeks in advance. That place is crazy). We loved our experience here, though! BYOB fee is fairly cheap, $8, and very good service. Ole.
