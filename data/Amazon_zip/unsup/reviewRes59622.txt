I went here with high expectations based on several friends' reviews, and left not merely disappointed, but disgusted. The location was dirty and the service poor. I can overlook those problems if the food was good enough, but this was the worst tacos I've had in Chicago. Cheap, fatty meat with little flavor, bland tortillas, and lousy salsa all make this place somewhere to avoid. Eat at Lizard Tacos futher down on Ashland, or at some place in Pilsen like Nuevo Leon instead.
