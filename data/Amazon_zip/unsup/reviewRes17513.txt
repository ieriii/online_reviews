Perfect cocktails and incredible atmosphere. Finally, a place where you can drink well *AND* hold conversation. It's costly, but worth every penny. I love love loved the Red Derby and i NEVER order whiskey drinks. The el diablo was also nice. The only downside is that the music was pretty lackluster while we were there.
