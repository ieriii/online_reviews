Okies-I am going to call myself a bit of an expert here. My fiancee helped open this place as the lead/head chef, hired by Glen himself. (The menus used to mention his name). He left last summer (2006) for a bigger restaurant and so my opinions may be a bit skewed since I haven't been back to eat in almost a year. I was a big fan of the food while he worked there. The kitchen staff was hard working, most of them in or just out of culinary school. The wait staff was usually decent, but they knew me-so I got average service. The owner helped to open Nick's Fish market (in Evanston), left the business for awhile and came back when he opened Glen's. That is why the fish he has is so fresh-he knows his fish and seafood. I highly recommend the applejack encrusted tilapia (usually on special). The burger there (with the ham and thousand island dressing on it) is extremely yummy and well worth it's weight in gold. My only complaints? The place is very small and quite crowded on weekend mornings. It used to be a BYOB (now they sell liquor) and I think losing that lost a bit of it's character. All the neon beer signs in the window takes away from the feeling of finding a different kind of restaurant.
