Worst service I have had in a LONG time! Better service at Taco Bell! Davanti Enoteca is a place that makes great traditional food TOO COMPLICATED and messes it up. Our snooty waitress was too busy cleaning wine glasses to bother with our service. She took our lemonade and didn't return with a refill until we had our check. What a mess this place is! The food was bad....BAD! Do they pay people to give this place 5 stars? Will NEVER return! Horrible food and worse service. My review in one word.....YUCK!
