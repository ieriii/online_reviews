Excellent service. From entrance to exit, everyone was grand. The menu's not terribly inspired, nor is it particularly veg-friendly, but frankly it's the pricing that's a drag. Confusion arose when some of us received very large portions, like sandwiches, and some very small portions, like mac & cheese, which weren't indicated on the menu nor could they be surmised from the price of the plate. This had some in our group paying out and leaving hungry. The sweet potato fries were good. Without the remoulade, that's what's vegan, so be it. The beer selection is decent and the wine specials seem to be popular. The cocktails are all right, but certainly not for $10 each. With Big Jones and In Fine Spirits so close, UG doesn't make sense for cocktail hour.
