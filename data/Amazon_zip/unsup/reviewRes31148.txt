It's pretty hard for me to give a restaurant two stars but it wasn't that difficult in this case. #1- Get double doors! It was freezing the day I went and every time someone opened the door, the whole restaurant felt it. #2- The waitress forgot 3 items from our meal on two separate occasions. After the busboy forgot our order of tea, she asked about it and didn't bring it out for another 15 minutes! It should have been a priority since example #1.  #3- Food took over 30 minutes to come out. That's unheard of in the breakfast industry.  #4- Food wasn't really that great. The home fries had mashed potato consistency on in the inside and a soggy outside.  Sorry to Nana. I really wanted to like it since it's relatively close to me. Decor is nice and food is okay but I would rather wait the 30 minutes down the street at Meli's.
