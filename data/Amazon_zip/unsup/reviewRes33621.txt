Short and sweet: The spicy falafel is soooo good. Basically everything I've tasted from here is good, and what any of it might lack in "mindblowing" it more than makes up for in "cheap" and "fast". Tips: If you want dolmas, get them from the salad bar *before* you go up to order from the guys behind the counter. And they have cups for water in the backroom.
