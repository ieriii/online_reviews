I went there with a group of friends for a girls night out. There are many good things about this place, and a couple of bad, which bring down my rating. The Good- -Great decor -Fantastic service from the waitstaff. Our waiter was awesome, very sweet and knowledgeable, also fast. We also got a free shot of sake when they found out one of our party was leaving for Australia. -Excellent food. I really loved everything we tried, but The caterpillar roll and oxtail potstickers were the faves. -Granted, I was with 5 other people to split the bill, but I thought the prices were pretty reasonable. $60 each, with a really good tip. We had plenty to eat and 2 bottles of wine. Maybe I have been living in the city too long, but I found this reasonable for a special occasion Now, the not so good -The noise. It was so loud I was literally yelling at my companions. It was so loud, I couldn't here the waiter form across the table. -The hostesses. I don't like it when I receive eyerolls when asking a legitimate question.  One of my party was 5 minutes late. They refused to seat us until she arrived. When she did arrive, I was told we would be seated immediately. 20 minutes later, we had not been seated. When this was questioned, they were very short and somewhat rude. All in all, great place, although the hostesses could use some training in manners. .
