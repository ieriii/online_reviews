I come to Chicago from LA, to try the famous Deep Dish Chicago Style Pizza. And it was delicous, the caseroul style pizza has many toppings and a big bite. It's definitly a flavorful pizza thats not all just bread, but filled with cheese and various toppings.  Its a really good pizza.... b u t ...... iv had an LA style of a deep dish copying the caseroul chicago's way AND we also do a pretty good job. I give a 4 star rating only because I believe the deep dish in california is better. Sorry Chicago. We have you beat on that one, You are amazing, your not a 5 star but I Will have to try again, just to make sure. you were Delicious, The end.
