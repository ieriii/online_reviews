This is an oddly mismatched kind of place...many things going for it....and several...well...not so much!  Location: Absolutely Great! In the Loop at the lower end of Michigan Ave., all the good stuff downtown Chicago has to offer is close by.  The hotel is trying to be an upscale boutique hotel. About half the rooms have been renovated and about half have not. The rooms are spacious in size, though maybe a little weirdly laid out. I had a renovated room, which was trying to aspire to the more upscale hotels but fell short in a few areas.  There is a 32 inch Plasma TV...and a glassed in shower with another TV in the bathroom. The desk is weirdly tall compared to the chairs if you want to work in the room as I did.  The staff was mostly very helpful, particularly the room service people and the meeting & event people, though the front desk people (although pleasant) seemed a bit clueless about the issues that people had to deal with while I was there.  The biggest issue for me (a business traveler) was that the internet in the guest rooms was down for 5 of the 6 days I was there! A major inconvenience! I was amazed that it wasn't fixed within 24 hours.  One of the 4 elevators didn't work the whole time I was there, and the restaurant was closed for renovation, so later guests will hopefully avoid these issues. Also the doorbell on our room went off for no apparent reason at 4:45 AM several of the nights we were there. I did see that some people who reviewed complained about noise...Our room was nice and quiet, except for the aforementioned doorbell, which appeared to be an electrical problem, not a prankster. For meetings or events, the Penthouse on the 39th floor is absolutely awesome!!! I held an event there and it was a great venue, and the staff very helpful.  Overall...a good place to stay....if a little random :)
