Making my way up north, for a change. We were headed to a show at the Aragon and needed to find a good spot for a pre-concert meal; I had an urge for Ethiopian food, so Demera was the perfect fit. The atmosphere at Demera is very bright and inviting; they have an excellent location, and a wonderful and very knowledgeable staff. Portions were pretty generous, and very flavorful. Food is served on the large, shared platter, with the customary flat bread underneath. Ample amounts of extra bread is also provided.  I would most definitely hit this place up again if I was in the area.
