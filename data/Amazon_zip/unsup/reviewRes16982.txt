I *finally* got to Violet Hour after wanting to go for some time. I'd heard stories of there being long lines but we waited only 5-10 minutes at about 9:30pm on a Thursday night. I loved the vibe and atmosphere of the place. It's dark, swanky, and a bit mysterious. The table and seats were itty bitty but the decor made up for that. As much as I enjoyed Violet Hour, I found the drinks to be a bit underwhelming. I don't recall the name of the one I ordered but I didn't love it. The drinks of the others were good but not amazing. Overall, I found the drinks at Aviary to be more complex (and therefore superior) to Violet Hour's. That being said, I enjoyed my drink and really liked the bar. I will certainly be back to try other drinks and I may find myself falling in love with this place in the end.
