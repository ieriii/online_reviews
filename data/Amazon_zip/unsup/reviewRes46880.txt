Uncommon Ground turns out a solid brunch experience, but it could definitely be more awesome. They garden on the roof. How cool is that? Unfortunately, though, they aren't totally excelling at the food just yet. It was good, but just not as great as the descriptions on their lowercase menu would lead you to believe. I had a winter scramble with arugula, mushrooms and Parmesan. The combo of veggies was good and the thin flecks of cheese were a nice touch, but the eggs were a bit overcooked (and I typically prefer my eggs somewhat hard). My companions had the spicy heuvos uncommon, which was tasty but arrived with some very greasy looking tortilla chips on the side. Really? Greasy chips with a breakfast dish? Methinks not. However, I loved my side of potatoes, which were the well done, cubed kind. As advertised, their coffee was nice, but my first cup came with some grounds floating in it. That and a somewhat awkwardly overbearing server perhaps set me up for a less than stellar experience. And the tab was more than $50 for three people so it's not your cheapest brunch option. I would definitely try UG again, though. They have several delicious-sounding coffee/booze drinks that would be perfect for enjoying near the fireplace on a blustery evening. Overall, I think all the elements to make it awesome are there--a commitment to healthful, local foods, a delicious-sounding menu, a friendly vibe and a cozy atmosphere--but they need to work on refining the details.
