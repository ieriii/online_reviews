Oysters were great, the chicken pate was delish, one of the beers Belgian trapers beers was so good. Sausages and the roasted half chicken was moist n full of flavor. Lots of people for a Wednesday night but great atmosphere. Although I feel that you sit very close to your neighbor which is fine unless you sit next to a some very loud ones. Overall great food and beer.
