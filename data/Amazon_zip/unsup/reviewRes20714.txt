Painfully slow to get your food and get a place to sit, but it's worth it. Our two tortas were amazing. Churros were amazing. Good beer selection for a small place. Guacamole was really good, but would have likes more. Yeah, the seating area isn't great but I'm sure you can unbend your vagina and deal with it for delicious food. Four out of five stars because of oppressive wait. Just food: five stars.
