This is the place I come to when I feel like ODing on meat. I've been to Sal & Carvao and Texas De Brazil, but I still prefer Fogo de Chao. The have a massive salad bar . They have gaucho's serving many different cuts of beef, chicken, pork, and lamb served table-side.  The meat will continue to flow as long as you have your card flipped to the green side for Go and the offerings will pause whenever you have it flipped to the red side for Stop. The bacon wrapped filet is awesome (I know, everything is better with bacon). They also bring you fried plantains and mashed potatoes. They are delicious, but whatever you do don't eat too much. I'd rather fill my stomach with more meat. The all-you-can-eat menu is about $30 for Lunch and $50 for Dinner (includes more cuts of meat).
