Fantastic pizza, microbrew's (Disfunctionale is my favorite), and atmosphere in a bar that opens right up to the street in Wicker Park. The staff has been great each time that I've been here, but it does get really busy on the weekends as a few people mentioned, so lunch time might be better here (plus there's a 10% FourSquare discount you can cash in on that way).
