Went to meet clients for dinner while in Chicago. This was the second choice, after Hub 51 had a 2.5 hour wait. I didn't pick it, and probably would not have picked it, but it was good nonetheless. The service was top notch, and the food was great! I could give all 4 stars for the single dish i had--lobster, spinach, brie penne. It was heavenly and decadent, and not over the top rich. Basically it was my dream dish. Sushi was very good, and very fresh too. It's a solid choice for great seafood.
