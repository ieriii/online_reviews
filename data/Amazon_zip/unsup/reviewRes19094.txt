Went for brunch, and was a bit disappointed after hearing good things about The Gage. My nephew and I like to check out different brunch spots on the weekend, and we had not been there before, so I was looking forward to something new and different. They had a fairly limited brunch menu, so I went with the Eggs Benedict. I liked the Irish Rashers they used versus Canadian bacon...but the "spicy" hollandaise was bland and left something to be desired. Also, the side item was "Crisp Brie Potatoes" which sounded yummy on the menu, but fell flat in presentation. My nephew got the Traditional Irish Breakfast, which was definitely the winner of the two dishes. The White Pudding was excellent. Kudos for the service from the busboys. Definitely attentive without being overbearing. Not so many kudos for our waitress. She was fine during the meal, but committed my number one restaurant service faux pas by coming by to pick up the signed credit card receipt while my nephew and I were still chatting at the table. Never acceptable to me at any time...but especially so when I'm sure she wasn't finished with her shift, since the restaurant had just opened when we arrived. Ah well. It might be worth a try for dinner some other night, to see what all the fuss is about. As for brunch...there are many, many better options in the neighborhood. I won't be back.
