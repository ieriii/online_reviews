Don't be fooled by its location and their name. it is hard to believe but after one year living in this area and I prefer to buy my whole daily shopping from here without a penny increase in our budget. Their Bakery are wonderful, finally I found a place in the US to buy a decent bread. their cheese selection, even their Veg,Fruit are more fresh and cheaper than Dominick!!!!!! The only section I can't buy is their butchery, but considering their quality, it worth to try on occasional situations. Their COFFEE are much more better than Starbucks, and you even cheaper. you don't believe that, try their streeter blend with a coffee cake or cinnamon swirl. As somebody else said I think their Dairy products are their weakest section. In general here is the place that would definitely keep me in this neighborhood
