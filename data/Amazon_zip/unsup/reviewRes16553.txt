When i went to Carnivale... I think it was when there was a conference for Restaurant entrepreneurs in Chicago... So there were a lot of... business people. I'm mentioning this because I expected more mixed crowd on the floor and I was surprised. Anyway, I'm giving them 5 stars and here's why. VALET: solves the inconvenient and expansive parking in Chicago AMBIANCE: beautiful. They probably spent at least a million for the space. warm and dimmed lighting, overall color pallets, surprising details with the interior space (ex. wine wrecks & mirrors, even the bathrooms) I fell in love with the space as soon as I walked in. It's an up-scale restaurant, but it's not intimidating at all. If anything, you'll feel so welcomed by the space. STAFF: I expected drop dead gorgeous stuck up staffs to be working... but they were all very normal people. They weren't afraid to joke around with you, laugh with you, my waitress almost felt like one of our friend by the end of the night. She was very calm, kindly guided us throughout the menu, answered every question perfectly and sincerely, She made us feel like we were home. Everything went so smoothly and I thank her so much for providing such wonderful experience. Their neckties were super cute by the way. FOOD: Unless you order too much perfect portion, perfect taste, perfect presentation, great quality. Dare to try 27 oz steak. My girlfriend finished it and ever since we do not treat her as a human. My seafood dish was absolutely amazing. DRINK: Delicious of course! Great selection of wines. PRICE: not cheap but definitely worth it. Rather than taking your lover or a romantic dinner, I would take my parents or family here. Strangely, I cannot see myself being romantic in this place. It's a very fun place to go. I believe the perfect size would be from 4 people to 6 people. Don't be afraid to share your food. They encourage you to do so. It's just another way to heighten your dining experience. so Carnivale you guys rock!
