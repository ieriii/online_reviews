Excellent food, ambiance and service. The menu is Latin American with an emphasis on Colombian/South American flavor - it was my first time trying Colombian food and I loved every bit of it! Mood lighting, high ceilings, airy atmosphere and heavy wood tables and chairs make you feel like you're in an old hacienda.. service was prompt and efficient. Huge portions.
