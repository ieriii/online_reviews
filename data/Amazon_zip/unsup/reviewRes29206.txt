This place is yummy. I've been here a few times with friends and I've never been disappointed. And their pad see ewe passes my pad siew test. Mmm. Opart is actually divided into 3 rooms (which are all connected) so it's a little confusing at first. I'm not sure how their whole seating system works but often I'll see empty tables but we end up having to wait anyway. Service can be slow as well and the staff isn't particularly friendly but they get the job done. I love one of their appetizers but I can't remember the name. It's beef on a skewer... tiger something? It comes with a dipping sauce and that sauce is awesome.
