My cousin said there was a "must-go" restaurant that she absolutely needed to take me to while visiting her in Chicago. Knowing that my boyfriend and I were big fans of Avec since the last time we went to Chicago in 2007, she definitely wanted me to try another Paul Kahan restaurant. And what perfect timing we had. The Cooking Channel's show called "Unique Eats" had a gastropub-themed episode the day before we had dinner reservations to the Publican, and it showcased the Publican's Paul Kahan and his love for oysters and pork.. It was indeed a delightful and mouth-watering episode and it made me even more excited to try the Publican! The restaurant takes on a German beer-hall kind of theme, with the side tables for parties of 4 that have swinging doors that enclose you and your fellow peeps in like little piggies, which is spectacularly fun!  Here's what we ordered: - Chef's Selection of 12 oysters: a mix of west coast and east coast oysters...divine! - Spicy Pork Rinds: surprisingly NOT greasy and tasty! - Bouchot Mussels: buttery, garlicky goodness served with a huge baguette to dip into the sauce..yum. - Taste of Three Hams: a plate of prosciutto heaven to me. - Suckling Pig: so flavorful and moist and the perfectly crispy skin was such a guilty pleasure! - Waffle dessert with berries and the Raspberry chocolate dessert: great way to end a meal! We also got a variety of beers that were waaay to hard to pronounce. Every beer that our friendly lady server recommended was great--everyone in our party agreed that we loved our beers that we ordered. I do remember that I got a German beer named Ayinger. Really smooth and tasted great with all the meats. Such a treat to come to the Publican! I'll definitely be back to visit when I'm back in town. One cool note: their bathroom has a circular-shaped sink that's totally trough-like...loved it. Also, even cooler: they have the cool Dyson Airblade hand dryers. I totally want one of those things in my bathroom.
