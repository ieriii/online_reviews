Best sushi for the price in Chicago. Can't count how many times I've been here. Love the Philly Roll and the Godzilla. The rolls BTW are ginormous. The staff here is always nice. You can't beat BYOB. There is a CVS at the corner if you forget to bring the booze. The inside is nothing special. Gotta love how they play Japanese movies on the wall. Nothing like watching Voltron and eating delicious rolls while drinking your own bottle of wine.
