I went to this place a couple of months ago. At the time, I was an aspiring vegetarian, now I'm an aspiring vegan as I've since gone vegetarian. However, that doesn't even matter because as a carnivore (I no longer eat the flesh of animals and witness little baby flesh having animals cry and suck their little paw thumbs because I ate their mommy and daddy and sister and big brother buck. I've been reformed) I really enjoyed this place. So, let me think of what I ate, oh yeah, that's it. Well, I had the black bean burger, with cheeze and avocado, and sweet potato fries. Hello, YUM YUM. The food was good. I have but one complaint, the cheese wasn't good. It was sticky and grainy and just not "good eats" no Alton Brown. I just scraped that cheese off and finished my black bean burger. I think this is a good spot for a quick dinner bite on the vegan tip. I'll return after I've done my initial vegan/vegetarian restaurant round in this city.
