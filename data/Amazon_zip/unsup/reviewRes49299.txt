I like Alliance a lot because it's close, they have great coffee, reasonably priced pastries, a friendly staff, and a nice outdoor patio to lounge in during the summer months. Their lemon scones are fantastic and if you get there early on Saturday they are still warm. I never really sit inside their adjacent cafe room, but there is plenty of seating and it's quiet enough to get some work or reading done.
