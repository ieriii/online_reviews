I just wanna say that you have to try the nachos they have. They melt in your mouth, and I get them without meat.There steak is much better than any of the meat they offer. There service is slightly better than ok, but they seemed annoyed that we arrived there a little before 230 when the place closes at 3 on Saturdays.
