I realized I am just a Yelp Hater. I only write about bad plaaces that I'm frustrated with. So I thought, "what do I like?" And Hot Dougs came to mind. Love the duck-fat fries, and the normal fries too. I also love the normal dogs... and the specials! Great stuff, a must have for a Chicago traveler.
