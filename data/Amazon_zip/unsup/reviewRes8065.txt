Best pizza I've ever had in Chicago (and I've tried a lot!). After Chicago magazine put out their Best of 2007 issue, my sister and I started chipping away at their list of the best neapolitan-style pizza. This was the first place we tried, since it was the winner, and we both agree! My sister got the pizza margherita, which she still raves about, and I got the pizza w/ white sauce and buffalo mozzerella. Mine was creamy with the most delicious subtle flavor--ridiculously good. Just writing about it makes me want to plan a return trip (I live out in the suburbs, so it's a bit of a to-do when i have dinner in the city). Definitely try this place! *2/2/08 UPDATE: finally went back for a 2nd try--LONG overdue! went traditional and got the margherita...delicious as always, cleaned my plate. but wait--this time went all out for dessert! one word: TARTUFO. large ball of gelato with hazelnuts, covered in cocoa powder (see pics). tremendous meal, so underpriced for the amazing experience .
