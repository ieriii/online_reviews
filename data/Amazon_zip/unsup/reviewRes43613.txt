My boss is very big on this place! Everytime he comes to town he makes sure that he stops here. He came in a couple of weeks ago to visit a client and help train a new colleague of mine so of course we had to make a stop in. Our party of 6 got pretty good seats near the back of the restaurant. We all took our time to scour the menu as there were a lot of savory looking dishes staring back at us. Since I am in a steakhouse, its a must that I have a steak! I decided on the 14oz Delmonico (medium rare) and a side of sauteed brussel sprouts. The Delmonico was one of the best that I have ever had! Very juicy and tender and was delicious all the way through! the brussel sprouts were pretty good as well. We also had some fancy desserts that one of my colleagues from San Francisco ordered... Our server was more than awesome as we has able to service a few loud, drunken corporate fools with no problem. We all had a good time and a good meal...I love this place!
