Love this place. The beer list is amazing and constantly changing. The burgers are great (also constantly changing), though admittedly do come on the well-done side of the heat spectrum. Fries are great (dont forget to truffle or garlic them!), ketchup is homemade (some see this as a negative, but I find it refreshing). Cheese curds are best in the city, and better than any I've had in Wisconsin. Fighting words, I know. Bring it, Badgers and Cheeseheads.
