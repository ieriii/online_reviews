I didn't eat here (the wait was over an hour and I wasn't already on the waiting list), but the drinks and service and atmosphere here were great! It was warm and cozy on a COLD December night, and our bartender was super attentive even though it was packed and she was definitely a little understaffed. I look forward to coming back again!
