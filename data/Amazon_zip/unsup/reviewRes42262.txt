To say this place is the best is laughable. They have a good location, if you stick them in the back. No customers will go. This place went down hill year after year. A few years ago, they play rap music, cmon now rap music?. Not the right place for that. Hoanh Long has the best pho in Chicago. While Hai Yen is the best in Argyle.
