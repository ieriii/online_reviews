I have a weird, dual-CHI/NYC-citizenship friend. She's originally from Chicago, but made the move to NYC half a decade ago. So she's technically Chicagoan.... but much more a NYCer. She loves her new city, but craves the (better) food of our fair city. She was back in town and wanted deep dish pizza. The tourist-usual wouldn't do, as we wanted local flare~ Hello, Pequod's! Waitstaff wasn't checking in on us too often, but we enjoyed that as it gave us girls time to catch up. The crust of their "pan" pizza is awesome. I was hoping for a bit more sauce, but the pie was good overall. We'll be back, P!
