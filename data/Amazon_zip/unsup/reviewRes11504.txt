Some of the best pancakes I have ever had. That being said, it's not worth spending an hour or more in line and shelling out a lot of dough for a trip over the weekend. I would suggest going during the week and getting a half order of pancakes or splitting an order with somebody (or taking them home and eating them cold!). And skip the egg dishes for the pancakes; you won't be sorry.
