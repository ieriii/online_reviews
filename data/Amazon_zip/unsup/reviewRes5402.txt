Went here for brunch, right when it opened. With 7 of us there, we basically tried the entire menu! My favorite dish was "Raw corn & heirloom tomatoes with arugula pesto" (not in the menu online). It was soo flavorful and delicious! I also tried bone marrow for the first time. The looks of it was kind of scary, but it tasted great with the toasted bread. Too bad I have the worse memory ever (of what I ate), but at least I remember they were all delicious! :D
