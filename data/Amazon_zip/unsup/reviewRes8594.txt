Gluttony thy name is Fogo! I've eaten here a dozen times and have never touched the salad bar. Every one of the meats have been impeccably seasoned and cook to perfection, the sides are not spectacular but in my mind going to this place for anything but the meat is silly. The caipirinhas are the perfect compliment to the meats and the desserts (iwhen I have saved room) make this place 5 star in my book. The wine selection is also surprisingly robust.
