Had a coupon and had been meaning to try for a long time. Husband and I went sans reservation a few months ago. Honestly, I cannot remember anything I ate! I think that's a bad sign. I remember basically enjoying the food, but nothing really stands out in my mind. The atmosphere was nice, but the crowd was definitely more my parents age. I was surprised by how large the restaurant was--it just keeps going around every corner. That said, considering I don't remember a damn thing from my meal other than eating lots of bread while waiting for the food to arrive. I think I probably won't be going back very soon, but at least it's not because I had a terrible experience.
