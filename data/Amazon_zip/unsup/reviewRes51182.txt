I'm not sure who the hater are here but clearly they are crazy or just have it in for this place. I have eaten there regularly for over a year and never had anything less than top notch food and service for fair prices considering what you get. For the record, my (sadly) ex-girlfriend, a die-hard veggie, counts this among her fave spots too because they are so nice and accomodating. Some people get off on trashing their local businesses, but what does that say about them, when it's a neighborhood favorite?
