I'm updating my stars to 5 from 4, only because I realize how few good pizza places there are in the city that have true Italian pizza. Great Lake can't compare to the quality of the pizza at Spacca Napoli. The ingredients, the simplicity, the fresh-ness all make Spacca my go-to place to get my pizza fix.
