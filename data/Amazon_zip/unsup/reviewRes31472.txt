Nana's is definitely the vibe that Bridgeport needed. The space has a very urbanized modern feel to it. The staff was very friendly and attentive which made me feel very welcome. I was very curious to see what their all organic menu had to offer. A friend of mine and I went to grab lunch there today and we were pleasantly surprised. We both had Panini's. I had a side of potato salad which was very delightful. It's a great addition to the neighborhood and am going back to try their breakfast.
