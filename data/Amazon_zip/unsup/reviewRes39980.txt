Hadn't been here in almost a year and got the itch today for some Korean. One of the best lunches I have had in a while. I like taking 2 hours for lunch, you and a friend can sit there sampling the saucers of amazing things... kimchee, sea weed, tiny crunchy fishes, potato salad (???) ... then socially grill your deliciously marinated meats. Their soup is out of this world. Great place for friends to hang out. Plan on spending some time here. I hope to be back soon. Language barrier can be hard, so be patient.
