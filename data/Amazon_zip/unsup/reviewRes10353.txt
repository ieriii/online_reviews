Yummy Yummy for my (big) tummy! First, I ordered beer....wait for it..... the "Camel Toe". It was delicious....no pun intended??? :P Not that watery crap from **cough cough** Flatlanders. I ordered a medium "white" pizza with bacon and red onions. Great combination! The menu says the pizza is meant to be for 2-3 people and it is pretty accurate. The portions are not small. Anyways, back to the pizza....the crust is thin and crispy. There are basically 3 sauces you can choose from. White, Red, and Original. The white is garlicy, olive oil, and no sauce at all. I ordered it without parmesan and it was fracken delicious. I would definitely go back to try the other two sauces. Pretty large open space filled with Wicker Park hipsters. :)
