went there and had a great experience. Marcus our server was extremely helpful and we enjoyed everything we ordered. we even ordered an extra dish (chicken on skewers) because the table next to us had them and they looked soooo good.  The atmosphere is warm and cozy, the music was a little loud, but we dealt with it.  the cheeses are GREAT and from pastoral. there was some yummy current spread that came with the order - really great compliment to the cheese and bread.  More later......
