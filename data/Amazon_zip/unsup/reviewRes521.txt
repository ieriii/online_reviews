What a wonderful, memorable experience. Emphasis on the word "experience." My palate, nose, hands and eyes were played with throughout the evening and I loved every minute of it. The timing of the courses was spot on. I never had to start looking around searching for my next taste, and I always had a new delicious wine coming just in time (yes, you should do the wine pairing). Will you absolutely love every course? Of course not. Half of the time you probably won't have much to say other than "interesting..." But that's the fun.
