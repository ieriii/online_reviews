This place is AWESOME, delicious, friendly, unique. However, it is VERY hard to get in these days. A year or two ago, there would be a line and you might need to wait 20 minutes to get through the door. Yesterday I went, and waited in line (going out the door and down a block) for 1 hour and 45 minutes before we could order.  And this was at the end of the day, too! That said, the dogs were DELICIOUS as usual. If it's nice outside and you don't mind a looooong wait, you can get in and feast upon delectable encased meats.
