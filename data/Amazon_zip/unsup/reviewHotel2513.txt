the good: -they take pets. -the location; There's also a park across the street for Fifi. -there were two TVs in my room. -easy self-parking for $41/day or valet for $45/day. the bad and the ridiculous: -Yes, I know, I know-- the lobby is effin' beautiful already, but is that where you're going to sleep?? Our hotel room was TINYYY and really awkwardly laid out. As a result, the furniture not only looked oudated but gawdy too.  -The TV was NEXT TO, not in front of, the bed. Looks like they just tried to cram it in there, because really, there was no space.  -There was no vent in the bathroom, so hot showers meant a cloudy bedroom. -Wifi is available for $12.50 a day, or $3.50 an hour... most hotels offer this service for free. It's 2008, dude!! -They nickle and dime you... I'm with Adam L on this one. Yes, $6 for an unrefrigerated bottle of water next to the TV. I know that the Hilton hotels target people with money, but do they assume they're stupid too? Tee hee-- Speaking of nickels, the Hilton Chicago has these tiny rooms shaped like a "5", if drawn solely with straight lines. A squiggly hallway connects the bedroom and living room. (wags finger) Shame on you for attempting to pass these as rooms!
