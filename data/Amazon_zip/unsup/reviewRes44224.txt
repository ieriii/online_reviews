Grabbed a half dozen different flavored cupcakes for a birthday and they were a hit. They all have the surprise centers (filled with frosting, or fruit, or whatever), which are fun. The passion fruit/meringue/lemon curd cupcake was especially delicious, as was the strawberry with strawberry frosting. The salt/caramel/chocolate was slightly disappointing but that didn't stop any of us from finishing it.
