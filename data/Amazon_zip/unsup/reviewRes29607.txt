Good prices, but the food is totally boring. I LOVE Thai food and have to say that Opart is a far cry from Aroy Thai on Damen Ave. I know Opart has many faithful followers, so I wonder if I happened to go on a night when the cooks were having a bad day. Whatever the reason, Opart is definitely not some place I would write home about.
