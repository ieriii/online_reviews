Gourmet Italian tapas? I'm a BIG fan. Came here with some wonderful friends after they'd picked us up from the airport and can't wait to go back. Broken down: The food is fantastic. The service is great. The wine is inventive. The atmosphere is modern but comfortable. The prices are, GASP, unbelievably reasonable for the caliber of food. You must get the ricotta and honey. Let me repeat that. You must get the fresh ricotta and honey. It will blow your mind. The pork belly melted in my mouth and contrasted well with the fruit preserves it was served with. The truffled egg toast on asparagus came with a soft egg yolk in the center that we beat before spreading the richness all over everything on the plate. Awesome. We tried a cheese plate and were fairly impressed with everything there, too. The winter squash and farro salad was one of my favorite dishes of the night, but mostly because it broke up the extreme richness of all the other dishes we ordered. The risotto carbonara was out of this world. My mouth is watering just thinking about it now. We had the cannoli sundae dessert (good, not great, but not reco'd by our server) and the hazelnut chocolate something (fantastic, and highly reco'd by our server). Service was friendly and good. The best part was that when we got the bill (after being absolutely stuffed), I was surprised at how little we'd spent for such an amazing meal. I love that feeling! I can't wait to get back here. If I lived closer, this might be my new favorite date night restaurant.
