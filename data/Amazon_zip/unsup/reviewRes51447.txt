I had higher hopes for Garcia's after seeing all the positive reviews here, but my food was so greasy and the place was pretty dirty, I just can't give it more stars. I had the vegetarian combination #2, which I thought sounded like a healthy option, but the little pools of grease on the tostada and around the plate proved me wrong. They were busy, so I can understand why everything seemed dirty, and since my husband loved his burrito al pastor I know we'll be back. I'll just have to try something different next time. Meanwhile, I'm going to keep searching for a better taqueria in the 'hood.
