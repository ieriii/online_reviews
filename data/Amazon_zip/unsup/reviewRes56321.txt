Came in tonight and was pleasantly surprised to see that they had a table open for us. On weekends, it's a lot busier than on the weekdays, which is when I usually come. I'm happy for the owner, Tuan, who says it's a lot more stable during the weekends than during the week days. Come on, Yelpers! Help this fine establishment out (me as well! I always need my fix of Simply It).Previous experiences, as well as tonight, have always been extraordinary. The service is wonderfully enthusiastic, the food is deliciously appetizing, and the atmosphere is heartwarming.As a regular, I would say that my favorite dishes would have to be the Simply It's Beef or the Shrimp Sate. However, I always like to vary my dishes every once in a while; none of them have disappointed, in portion size or taste. What I love about this place is that it's a steal. They offer value and taste. Definitely keeping up my daily routine with this place!
