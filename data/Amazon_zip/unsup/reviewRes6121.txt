HUZZAH! Made the trek to Davanti. WTF....2.5hr wait?! YIKES. Wasnt going to wait but then we ended up walking around and coming back....BEST decision ever! We sat at the bar for a little and they came around with complementary pizza to try while you wait...BONUS...because I was starving because it was 10PM on a Sat night. We finally got sat and it was SOOOO worth the wait. I cant believe I am saying that....its craziness. They have a pretty reasonable wine list, which is always nice....wide range for sure. Per server's recommendations, we got the corn salad and the truffle toast with egg or something....both were FREAKING DELICIOUS!!! I think I might have dreamt of the truffle toast last night. Then we had the swordfish and the ravioli....also, both were amazing!!! We were stuffed at the end so no room for dessert, but I will definitely be back. The price point was perfect....our whole dinner was like $80....so cheap!!! The vibe was super cool too....bustling, italian scene....PERFECT!
