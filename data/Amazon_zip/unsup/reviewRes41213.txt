I'll start with the good - my filet was perfectly cooked and delicious, although I don't care how hot or buttery a plate can be. Sizzling food reminds me of Chili's. I was underwhelmed by the seafood gumbo and the creamed spinach, plus the ambiance is too stuffy. Our condescending/weirdo waiter was the worst part of the night. He seemed annoyed that we were there for restaurant week. Um shouldn't they expect this? Everyone else around us looked to be there for the same reason. To top it off we were overcharged. Our bill showed $29 for each steak, and an extra $8 per person for the gumbo and desserts. The restaurant week menu says that the entire meal was $33. It was only a difference of $8 in total, not a huge deal, but annoying nonetheless. I didn't care to bring this up to the jerkstore waiter, so we just paid our bill and left knowing that we wouldn't be back. If you are looking for a steak house that does restaurant week the right way (and is just an excellent place in general) try David Burke's.
