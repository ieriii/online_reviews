As far as the Lawrence strip of Thai restaurants go, I'm a firm devotee of Aroy Thai - but it was closed on Monday, so I decided to wander down the street to Lincoln Square. I typically start new Thai experiences with their Panang Curry - my theory being that, much like Pad Thai, if you can't get the Panang right, I'm not going to bother eating anything else there. Their Panang was fair, though between my dining companion (who ordered the Red Curry) and I, we noticed that their spice level is pretty much relegated to "Very" and "Not". Ultimately, the best part about the evening was the wine, which I brought, and the conversation. Sadly, Opart was responsible for neither. All in all, not the worst experience I've ever had in Chicago Thai, but by no means the best. Definitely noticed, shall we say, insect life wandering around the picture frame on the wall. Not very appetizing. Really might want to look into that... Next time I'm craving Thai food on a Monday, I'll wait the extra evening, and head back to Aroy.
