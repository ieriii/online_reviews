I had brunch at Cafe 28 this weekend and it was outstanding. I had the southwest eggs Benedict with chorizo hash. It was amazing, the eggs were done perfectly. I asked for a side of salsa verde to go on top of my eggs. It was a nice complement to the dish. My husband had the salmon, cream cheese and English muffin special. His was a great price of $6. He really liked his meal. Great brunch option when you are craving Cuban/Mexican. They also have mimosas and mojitos at brunch time!
