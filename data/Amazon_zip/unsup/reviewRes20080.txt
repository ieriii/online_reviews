I had a flawless first-time experience at The Gage last night. I started with one of their signature cocktails, Grey Goose La Poire/Yuzu/White Grape. Fantastic. We started with the Gage Fondue, which came out in a small iron pot served with long crisp flatbreads. Delicious, and very rich.  I moved on with a salad which contained Three Rivers Organic Lettuces, Muscat Grapes, Raisins, Maytag Blue, and a Champagne Vinaigrette. I have to say this is one of my favorite salads in recent history. For dinner I had the Goat Cheese Risotto, again served in one of their tiny iron pots. It had a layer of Basil Puree on the bottom and contained 2 crisp escargot, it was like a little treasure hunt! Absolutely delicious. For dessert, the Chocolate Cherry Polenta Cake did not disappoint, but it was served with a couple of sugar-covered concord grapes that nearly stole the show! Overall a truly fantastic experience. Our server was knowledgeable and visibly passionate about the food there, which brought the experience up a notch. I have already made a reservation to go back next month!
