Getting nickel and dimed is an accepted reality on domestic airlines, but now I can announce this trend has made it to the hotel industry, too. They have a fitness center, but it costs $10 per trip and closes at 9:00 pm. WTF? Others have mentioned the extortion they charge for parking. You might not be surprised that they charge for Wi Fi, too. The lobby is ostentatious, the ceiling more Staten Island than Athenian. The rooms are on the small side, ugly interiors, and no apparent thought to the arrangement of furniture, TV, etc. The elevators are excruciatingly slow. If you're on the 19th floor or higher you have a choice of 3, so you can imagine how quick that is. The bathrooms were OK. There are a few stores in the lobby. Location is solid. You can do better.
