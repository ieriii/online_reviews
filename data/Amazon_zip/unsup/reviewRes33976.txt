I got the veal medallions, and true to Yelp reviewers' comments, it was fantastic. The pasta portions were huge and reasonably-priced, so don't be scared away by the multiple dollar signs! I actually really enjoyed the atmosphere--reminds me of a cute little place I used to go in college--and even though I went on a Saturday night at dinnertime, it really wasn't too loud to have a regular-volume conversation. Another plus: I made a reservation two hours in advance on a weekend night, and had no problem getting seated. Yay!
