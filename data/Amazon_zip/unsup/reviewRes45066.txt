All I can say is Wow. I decided to go here on recommendation for a father's day double date (how awkward). The hope was that the two dads would like each other and chat away while us young'uns exert less effort. Thankfully, the food was so good that it provided a great amount of conversation for the evening. Being the nice kids that we are, we decided to go all out for father's day dinner with the appetizer sampler, entrees, and desserts. The sampler was amazing with eight different tasting portions of their delicious appetizers. I thought the farro was especially delicious, and my dad drooled over the olives. I got the asparagus risotto for my entree - awesome move there. Not too salty but still had tons of flavor. The boyfriend had the bison, and he liked his plate clean. For dessert, I had the sorbet trio; the strawberry and lemon were amazing, but the mint was a little strong for my tastes. I really don't have anything bad to say about Anteprima. The service was delightful and the food was amazing. We did spend a pretty penny for the holiday, but I hope to be back for some appetizers and cocktails in the future!
