This place is by far one of my favorite places in the whole city. i have been going there for just about four years and have pretty much turned everyone on to it. Drinks are strong Staff is friendly pizza bread is worth fighting your date over gnocchi is the best thing you have ever had bill is low considering everything you get with the meal (pizza bread, reg bread, soup, salad, and entree) wonderful place...
