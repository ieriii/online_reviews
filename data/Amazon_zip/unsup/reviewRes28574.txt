The GF and I wandered out of the front door (River North) looking for a Saturday night culinary inspiration. She suggested we go into Graham Elliots ... and I had a smile on my face for the rest of the evening. They found us a table in the bar at the window ...on those cool leather cubes...and even though the tables were "communal"...it didnt feel like it. The music was outstanding (slanted towards 80s dark pop like the Smiths, Echo, etc)...and the decor is clubby and crisp...but certainly not stuffy. The service was great..."Greg" made some nice recommendations and was attentive without being annoying. Did I mention the food was superb? Truffle oil dusted herb popcorn? Bullseye. Artisan Bratwurst and Wisconsin Cheddar Risotto (with Cheez its, no less)...Scallops...it was all done perfectly with a whimsical flair. I found the menu a bit limited...but that is a bit "nitpicky"...overall...a really, really fun evening.
