Grand Lux Cafe is a great place to take everyone except impatient people.  Why? They can't stand the wait. For everyone else: - Appetizers: get the Asian Nachos. If you aren't splitting these, they are a meal unto themselves. - Entrees: All of the fish and chicken dishes are good. The Asian (yes, Indians are Asian too) in me prefers the Thai Caramel Chicken best. I don't usually order pasta as I feel it's a waste of going out, but based on my friends' comments, stick to the other dishes. - Desserts: great! I don't usually get dessert but the two that I've tried over the course of five visits have been superb. You should at least once try to get one of the made-to-order desserts that have to be ordered well in advance.  - Atmosphere: crowded but spaced out enough that you can have a conversation. If you're willing to wait and can get a table in the little round room that overlooks Michigan Avenue, you will be a very happy camper! - Value: best in the city! Where else can you eat high-quality food with great service at this price?
