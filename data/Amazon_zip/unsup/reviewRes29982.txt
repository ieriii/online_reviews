This place is a much needed presence in a neighborhood overrrun with franchise restaurants and fast food joints. The atmosphere is very charming. If you go when it's not crowded it has a wonderful homey and cozy feeling to it. The live music during the week is a nice bonus. The unique atmosphere compensates for the food. The food is slightly above average. But the coffee and wine list is more than adequate. I feel they are stronger at their appetizers, desserts and breakfast and weaker with their sandwiches, entrees, and salads. The service is pretty good. Can be slow at times. I think it's worth checking out, but best to avoid during weekend brunch hours when the line to be seated can run out the door and spill into Dearborn Street.
