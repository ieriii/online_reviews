I went here for the first time on Labor Day. I had some soup - chicken with vegetables and noodles (#67). I wanted to try the Pho, but I just wasn't feeling any of the Pho options. The soup was very good and PACKED with delicious vegetables - I recommend it! My friend had some sort of beef soup with noodles (#75), and the broth was out of this world - star anise and beef soup - who would've thought?!?! I also had a fruit smoothie. While it was very good, I don't know if it was actually made from fresh strawberries or strawberry puree...hmmmm.  My friend Amanda had a coconut smoothie which was delicious (and that I had extra sips of while she was in the bathroom - so sue me.) I have to say, and this is seconded in some of the other reviews - my friend and I were seemingly totally ignored when we first walked in. We waited for 15 - 20 minutes for a table while others (perhaps family members, friends, or neighbors, not sure...) were seated right away. I don't mind if you give preference to others who you see on a daily basis, but try not to make it so obvious. Knocked your 4 star review right down to a 3 star - not OK. If you haven't been to the area around Argyle and Broadway, do yourself a favor and go! It is really fun with all kinds of really cool food options - and please try the buns in the bakeries! So good!
