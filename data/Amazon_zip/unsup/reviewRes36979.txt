This place is my favorite summer drinking spot. They have a stellar beer selection and the ambiance is nice, too. They have indoor seating and a great beer garden in the back. I went there for dinner for the first time last week and was pleasantly surprised by their food! Everyone should try Hopleaf! That being said... if you come later in the night, try to come with a smaller group. It gets packed!
