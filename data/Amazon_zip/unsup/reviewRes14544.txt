I discovered Glenn's by chance while driving by yesterday afternoon (Election Day, and yes I voted). I was hungry and didn't have a taste for seafood, but thought I'd check it out anyway. It was a nice surprise finding a nice cozy seafood restaurant in a neighborhood not too far from my own "hood". Glenn's is in the Ravenswood area. I was approached by a waitress who asked me if I had a reservation. This was at 4pm on Tuesday. Hmmm? Found out that it was "all you can eat crab legs day". OK, she explained how busy it can get. I looked up on the chalkboard menu visible from all sections of the restaurant. I noticed that they had a $14.95 "Catch of the day" dinner deal. I tried the pan fried catfish with a delicious spicey Hollandaise sauce (suggested by my waitress), which was very tastey and lightly coated. The other choice would've been pan fried trout. The meal came with a choice of soup, salad, roasted red potatoes, and a julienned veggie medley. I had the delicious spinach soup with feta cheese. Yummy! The beautiful leafy green salad was wonderful with the house homemade Ranch dressing. Loved it. My tiny complaint was the potatoes were just a tad bit tough/undercooked slightly, but otherwise, DELICIOUS! My suggestion to the wait staff: Suggest dessert to your customers and give your name when seating people. I had considered dessert, but it would've been nice and good business sense to ask if I wanted to try something else before getting the check. Customer service is key, especially at restaurants. By not offering dessert, you're potentially letting money walk out the door. Also, when giving someone soup to go, please put the container in a bag, without the customer having to ask for one. Nobody wants to carry a small container of soup around without a bag. Just a thought. Nonetheless, I would go back and recommend Glenn's Diner and Seafood House to my friends and family.
