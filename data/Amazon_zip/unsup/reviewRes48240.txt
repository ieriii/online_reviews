I will grant that it is a slightly odd place to have a one's celebratory Birthday dinner-- it's loud, the seating is mostly at giant communal tables, and the food sure ain't haute cuisine. But Publican is one of the hotter restaurants to open since I last lived in Chicago and I can see why. It was worth the trip. The specialties are beer, shellfish, and pork. We tried some of each food group (actually regular fish instead of shellfish) and enjoyed them all. The ham sampler really is a revelation. Serrano ham has the mouthfeel and richness of sliced parmesan cheese. The more pungent hams are savory and fascinating and probably like nothing you've ever had before. The other dishes I had were also very good. The house-made pickles are tastier, more plentiful, and more interesting than most places. The turnips were nice, although slightly too sweet. The pork belly with cucumbers and harissa yogurt was just as good as I thought it would be. It's not the kind of place that puts Chicago on the culinary cutting edge, but it's really good eating. I was also impressed by the service. Our waiter had the patter and outfit of a carnival barker, and at first I was prepared to really dislike him. He also rattled through the beers too quickly, and too readily guided my wife to a tasteless witbeer. But then he recovered. On his next round by the table, he asked about how we liked what we had, and when he learned that he'd made a bum recommendation for my wife's beer, he came back with small tasting glasses of three very different beers, helped her taste them and figure out which ones she liked and why. He then comped the mis-recommended beer, brought her a new one more to her liking, and came by throughout the evening with other tastes and suggestions to go with our meal.  This is what should happen at EVERY good restaurant, but it is the first time I have EVER been to one where it actually did. Four-star food, five-star service.
