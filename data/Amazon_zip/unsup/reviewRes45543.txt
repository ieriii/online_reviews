Wilde is a great place to go with a group of friends before a night out. I'm a huge fan of celtic decor and they definitely paid attention to detail (the library reminds me of a pub I've been to in Westport, County Mayo). The restaurant tends to be a little loud and crowded so I wouldn't suggest it for a first date or a quiet evening with that special someone. If you're in the mood for a fun night and want to get it started right I'd start here. While I agree that prices are a little higher than average the portions are generous. Me and one of my friends in the group split the Roasted Chicken and a side order of Mac & Cheese (unreal!) and were completely satisfied. I didn't hear one complaint from the rest of the group just a lot of "mmmmm". If you're a drinker - you can save money by taking advantage of their daily drink specials including Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. Customer service is just OK. First time I went the Server said he could only split the check 2 ways. Being a former server who has worked on several systems - I absolutely know that is not true. Food and drinks came out in a timely manner but I did feel a little rushed. Overall not bad but I wouldn't rave about it. Overall, great place for a fun night with good friends!
