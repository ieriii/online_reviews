I had a ridiculously awesome experience here on a Sunday night around 9 PM. I will definitely return when I need to binge on carbs, cheaply. Our waitress was nice, funny and cool (yes all three!), I wish I caught her name. There was only one dish on the menu over $10 (Lobster Rav for $13), everything else was $6.95 - $9.95. My Farfelle Pollo was sooo tasty, and I had enough for a leftover lunch (SCORE!). Our dishes came out under 15 minutes. It was a little warm, but hey, they're cooking obsence amounts of pasta. Very casual, and there's a bar attached if you want to stay and hang out (which you probably will).
