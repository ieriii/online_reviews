Good food, good service! Went to La Villa for the first time with a large group of girlfriends (14 total). The place is decorated old-school Italian restaurant (dark, cozy, a little tacky). Friendly, efficient wait staff, never lacked for bread, water, drinks while chatting and viewing the menu. Menu has lots of choices. I had the lasagna, which was quite good. Food was brought to the table pretty quickly, considering the size of our group. So much food, everyone brought a doggy bag home! The place was full of people on a rainy Monday night, which shows that it has a loyal following. Many of the ladies I was with go there regularly and/or order their pizza for delivery. I would definitely go again!
