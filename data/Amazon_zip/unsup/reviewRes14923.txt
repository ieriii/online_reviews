If you are looking for a romantic dinner that is reasonably priced where the food is really quite good and they throw in 2 gentlemen that serenade . .and serenade . . and serenade . . this is the place. The food is always good. The pizza bread, hot crispy moist Italian loaves keep coming til you beg the server to stop. A nice bowl of soup and salad will always follow. Chicken Vesuvius, meat ravioli, chicken Parmesan, Ive had them all, for dinner and next days lunch. I'm a sucker for a good spumoni - theirs hits the spot. A good place to go for romance but I could see a girlfriends night out or taking my parents when they come in from out of town.
