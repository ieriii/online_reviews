some of the best pizza in chicago even though it's not chicago style deep dish. basically a slightly thicker than normal pan pizza with gigantor toppings. the mojo is in the caramelized crust though. forget that stuffed crust nonsense, this is probably the only pizza where the crust is the best part. also pretty tasty delivered but i would definitely dine-in if possible. i'm not sure what the panty-faced whale logo is all about, but he makes a good pizza pie nonetheless.
