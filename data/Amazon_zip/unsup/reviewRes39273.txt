I like most of the food at this place. The DIY style is fun especially when you have people who never have done it before. But it wears off unlike the smell of smoke in your hair after you leave this place. Negatives They really don't refill your pan chan, The wait is long and I see a huge difference in treatment when I go with one of my Korean friends ( my dad is form Korea my mom is white I look ambiguous) positives pretty good Bulgogi good array of panchan good duk guk soup good yukajang over all 3 stars ps. My grandma doesn't like this place that much
