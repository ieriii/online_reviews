Torn. I'm so torn. 3.5, I guess. In short: long wait (2), pretty great food (4.5) and typical fitting Wicker Park decor and very small dining room (3). Here's my full story. So some lady friends and I planned to go around noon on a Saturday, so fully aware of wait times, one who lives nearby went about hour early to put our names in. They told her it'd be about an hour and a half, so we decided to meet and share mimosas at her place before heading over. We headed over at the appropriate time and were told it'd be longer. Other groups of different sizes in a non-seemingly logical way were being called (couples, then groups of 6 etc), while our group of 4 continued to wait. We were thankful for a nice day but urged the original friend to go back in and ask about us. Apparently the host had not forgotten about us and when he finally sat us, we got apologies and two pancakes on the house. So the food was pretty great. The free pancakes were the famous pretzel hot cake and a pancake with cinnamon apple business going on. They were good. Very dense and unlike fluffy pancakes I usually get. Super sweet and perfect for sharing while we waited. I ordered the beef tenderloin Benedict, which had great flavor. Unfortunately, I found the meat a little tough to cut. House potatoes were good. They came with all the meals, and all of us friends enjoyed them. Is the menu seasonal? I wish the waitress explained, but I assumed so since the menu said a big "fall 2011" on the top. That could be interesting. I'd like to try the South Loop location to see if it's bigger size is more reasonable with wait times... the pretzel pancake was good.
