Short and sweet; the banana bread french toast was A-MAY-ZING. Really and I was RAISED on Martha's homemade stuff. They serve it with peanut butter just like ma. wow. It's a big place, with a big wait for a table and big noise inside. Prices are not Waffle House-cheap, but reasonable. One more time: Banana Bread French Toast...go...now...
