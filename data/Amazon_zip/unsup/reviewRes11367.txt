The Bongo Room was the first Chicago restaurant I ever patronized. I loved it! We had just arrived by train and were famished. We each ordered croissant breakfast sandwiches- my bf got the egg & bacon one and I got the veggie. The veggie was excellent, according to Jim the egg one was just OK. Then we decided we had to have round 2 because the pancake selection looked so intriguing. The waitress (very nice) let us know that we could order them individually, so we got one caramel white chocolate pancake and one slice of the ginger pineapple french toast. The pancake was good, but the french toast absolutely blew it out of the water. It was like...revolutionary. It came with a scoop of ginger ice cream. I wish I didn't live so far from this french toast! I want more.
