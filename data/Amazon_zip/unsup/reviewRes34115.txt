eh. it was ok. i had heard nothing but amazing things about this place, but i have to say it was a bit of a disappointment. maybe the build up killed it? and the bread was...bread. i read some of the other reviews about how great the bread was, but it was just plain bread. my pasta had a decent flavor, but seemed one dimensional. i was tired of eating it about 1/4 of the way through. the pasta sauce also had a weird texture to it...slimy almost? i don't know how to describe it, but i have not encountered it before. definitely not the best italian in town and nothing even to write home about. i would have been very disappointed if i had had to wait to be seated, which i was even counting on, but the place was absolutely deserted.  i doubt i will be back and definitely not if i have to wait like everyone else has to, apparently.
