Definitely the most authentic Cuban food in Chicago. All the dishes are very authentic and does feel like mi abuela made them. I didn't try the sandwiches, but the dinners were nice. Black beans were not the best I've had in Chicago, but all the sides, like Yuca, Tostones, Maduros, and Croquetas were spot on. Steak was ok - your typical pounded Cuban steak, Lechon was the strongest dinner dish. Bread pudding was outstanding. The milkshakes are ok - a little more creamy than fruity. I can see why everyone likes the owner, he's pretty nice, and gave out Cuban coffee to everyone. A nice touch. There is a sort of weird Cuban or want to be Cuban groupie thing going on there, but its fine if you don't know what I'm talking about. =)
