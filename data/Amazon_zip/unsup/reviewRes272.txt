I still laughed at myself for being a poor girl having a $580 meal by taking the Halsted bus which drops us right in front of the restaurant. :-) Comparing our experience at Tru, Charlie Trotter's and Everest, Alinea really tops it all for their innovative and still tasty food, the all-senses experience, impeccable yet not snobbish service. However, that was also the most expensive meal compared to the other 3. Well worth it! Now that I've had Alinea, I don't know where we should go for our next special meal? Afraid that no restaurant will live up to the standard Alinea has set.
