I am for sure the pickiest eater in Chicago.My fiance looked on yelp for a mexican place to eat tonight, he picked Mayan Palace and I had low expectations for a random mexican place in Lincoln Park. I thought it would be heavy and greasy and quick and I'd leave stuffed and feeling gross... BUT!!!This is the best mexican place I've ever visited! My fiance is a total food snob, KNOWS mexican food, and he loved it too. We were greeted right at the door by the friendliest wait staff who asked our names and sat us immediately. Also, the tables aren't loaded with extra stuff (ads, plates, etc... I hate sitting down to an already crowded table!). It is truly a place where you feel like they WANT your business, they are there to provide great service and great food.The food is light (I had quesadillas - NOT heavy and greasy!), the guac is very smooth and light, tastes like it was JUST whipped up in back. The sodas are big and refillable (from a fountain!) and the salsa is PERFECT, spicy but mild and a great consistency. My fiance had ceviche, and said it was super light, like a healthy salsa with protein added...Like other reviews have said, our server introduced us to the other wait staff, everyone working there got along really well, and everyone eating there was raving about the service and taste of the food. They called us by our names when asking if we wanted refills and when they brought our food. I think thats sweet, and a personal touch, and it impressed me.Our perfectly filling dinner was about $30 with soda and a beer, and I left a big tip. It is without question our neighborhood place now, and it is light enough to eat there often, not heavy and greasy like we've found most mexican places to be. Can't wait to have drinks there in the summer with the windows open!Special thanks to Alejandro!!
