I waited an hour and a half in line at Hot Dougs, which is a lesser than usual wait. This place is totally worth it. I had a crayfish plus something sausage, which was AMAZING. The entire menu was amazing.... I didn't realize that you can get so creative with sausages. The Selma Hyeck dog had some large lumps of fat, so there were two bites that weren't all that enjoyable, but everything else was just amazing. You can taste the really cool meat combinations in each hot dog. Service was sooo friendly and warm as well. While I probably won't go regularly because the wait is a killer, it's worth it to go at least once to try and also again if you have out-of-towners visiting and want to show them amazing dogs and sausages.
