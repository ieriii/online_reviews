This place is exactly the type of restaurant Bridgeport needs to help bring back the neighborhood. We've been there three times and every time the food was quick and delicious. I especially like the Nanadict. The earlier complaint about it being too expensive is not right. If you want a $15 dollar breakfast, go to McDonalds or Scott's Hamburger Heaven with your family. If you want great organic food, served with a smile and maybe even a nice conversation with Nana herself, come here. You won't be disappointed.
