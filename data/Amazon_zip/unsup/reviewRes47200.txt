We went last night (Sat.) around 8:30 and were immediately seated on the patio for our party of 2 (and 1 dog), which leads me to my next highlight, they are dog friendly. I've been wanting to try this place for some time, and as read in reviews, it's nearly impossible to not make the comparison to Kuma's - the style of the venue and the tasty similar burgers. Looks like Kuma's opened around 2005-2007 and Lockdown was in 2008-2009. Irregardless, Lockdown was amazing, great beers on tap and the burgers were high quality (and massive). We had the Lockdown Warden and the Citizens Arrest (self order), both were good - but the Warden almost had too much going on with the flavors next time we go back I am definitely going to go with the Bootleg, and enjoy the minimal wait before getting seated.
