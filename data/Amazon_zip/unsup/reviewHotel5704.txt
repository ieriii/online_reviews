My stay at the Chicago River hotel was very pleasant. Besides its convenient location to everything I could possibly look for in the city, the staff were all friendly and prompt with service requests. The free wifi and self-serve water bottles in the hallway are added bonus. I stayed at the Intercontinental down the street during the latter part of my visit and they did not have the same perks. The guestroom I was in is set up for business stays-with reading lights and a decent size desk. The bathroom is adequately equipped with magnifying makeup mirror and large shower stall (not bathtub). I deducted a star for the tiny TV monitor mounted on the wall that is barely visible if you were to watch TV from your bed. Also, we requested a queen bed + pull out sofa bed guestroom, but got a queen + roll away bed.
