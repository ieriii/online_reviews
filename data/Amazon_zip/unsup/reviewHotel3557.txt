The Drake is now our home away from home. Not only can one walk out the door and arrive at Oak Street beach or the hub of Michigan Ave. you can stay at the Drake and listen to the Cabaret sounds and shtick of Nan Mason and Terry Higgins. The Drake is the city...an intersection of old & new Chicago. Our room which looks out onto to water is open and full of light and makes our stay full of possibility.
