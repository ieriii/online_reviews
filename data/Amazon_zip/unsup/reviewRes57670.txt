I have been coming here since I was a baby. If you are looking for a truly authentic cheap mexican food this is place for you. It is BYOB and there is usually marachi music blasting from the juke box and tacky Mexican decor all over the restaurant. This place gets packed after a Sox or Cubs fan. Everyone just piles in drunk with cases of beer. I recommend the $5 combination (taco, tosada, mole and tamale). You really can't beat the price. Also the nachos are to die for!!
