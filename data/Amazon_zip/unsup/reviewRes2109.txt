Thank you for Hot Doug's! This place is phenomenal. Don't think just hot dogs, think "encased meats" as Doug puts it. I had a duck sausage with smothered with a fois gras sauce. It was rich and amazing. Also had a boar sausage that was really good. Dogs like these are on the specials board, but they serve plenty of classic dogs and sausages too. The Thuringer is the best classic on the menu...absolutely amazing and what I usually get. The duck fat fries are awesome too, but are only served on Fridays and Saturdays. Only open for lunch only Mon-Sat.
