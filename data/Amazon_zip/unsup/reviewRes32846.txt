This is not just a restaurant for vegetarians and vegans. I've brought some of the most diehard carnivores I know to this place and every single one of them loved it. In fact, I don't think I've ever had a bad experience here. I loved this place even before I lived in Chicago; it's quite simply the best vegetarian restaurant I've ever been to. Regularly rotating specials and some of the most innovative dishes I've ever seen. Their vegetarian takes on classic meat-based sandwiches use delicious seitan and they have a very decent drink menu. I haven't been as impressed with their brunches, although I've heard others say good things. Not sure if they still have a patio or not and the washroom is a little scary but service, food, and overall facilities are top-notch. It can get pretty busy on weekends but I don't think I've ever waiting more than 15 minutes for a table. Prices are remarkably low for how much food you get (but, then again, it's a diner). Highly recommended.
