I walked in here last night with my husband not really knowing what to expect. It is a tiny little place with a great patio and decorated with pictures and newspaper clippings. I loved it, it's quirky and fun. We ordered two dinners, one steak and one pork. They each come with white rice, black beans, and sweet plantains. We also ordered 2 beef empanadas. We ordered to go and arrived home ravenous. The food smelled so good in the car that my mouth was watering and I was tempted to start eating before we even got to the house, but alas, I waited. My husband opened his pork dinner first and before he could even get a chance to take a bite I swooped in a grabbed a piece of the shredded pork. Holy muther. It was as tender as my heart and melted in my mouth, I think my eyes even rolled back into my head as I pointed at my husband's meal urging him to take a bite. He still had the look of horror on his face from me stealing his food but then he took a bite and all was forgiven, more likely forgotten. They forgot the black beans which was a strike against them (luckily we had some at the house). I can't comment on the plantains because I really don't like them and my opinion wouldn't be fair.  I had the steak and it was fine. I was wishing I ordered the pork or tried the chicken but oh well, we will be back for sure. Oh, the empanadas were good too. We will definitely be back!
