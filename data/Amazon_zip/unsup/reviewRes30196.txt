Sunda is pricey, but you're paying for the atmosphere. Soaring ceilings, pretty people, pan-Asian decor in a huge space. If you want to save money, go to a pan-Asian place that's less trendy. Recommend the saketinis, shishito peppers, rock shrimp tempura, beef lollipops, Asian grill NY strip steak, brussel sprout salad. Sushi - if you are knowledgable about sushi, the combinations here can be irritatingly, overly elaborate, especially when the server pushes them on you. "Creamy lobster" just sounds gross. Wish they had simpler, classic rolls with less unorthodox stuff in them for sharing. Service is attentive but beware the upsell! The servers are trained to suggest more expensive/elaborate items and give the same shpiel to everyone. Just stick to your guns. All in all a nice experience though and a fun night out with good food.
