This was on my "I must eat here while i'm in Chicago" list and I am so happy I got to try what they are known for: churros! My boyfriend and I arrived at the restaurant on a late Saturday afternoon before heading over to the Navy Pier. I was nervous upon arriving to the resturant because after reading many of the yelp reviews, I did not want to stand in line. However, to my surprise there was hardly a line and a hostess greeted us at the door and asked what I wanted to order. I told her I wanted some desserts to go and she led me to one of the cashiers who was very helpful in making additional decisions to my order of churros. I left happy with a bag of churros with the chocolate dipping sauce, an iced Mexican chocolate drink and my boyfriend got a Mexican vanilla ice cream with bacon and caramel bits. The churros: very fresh! warm, crunchy, not to sweet, good amount of cinnamon and sugar. It also tasted corn, like it was fried in the same oil they used to fry taco shells. But it was so good! the chocolate dipping sauce was very rich. not your typical chocolate sauce since it is a Mexican chocolate. It almost reminded me of a Filipino chocolate that i used to eat as a child. This Mexican chocolate was also in my iced cold drink that sweetened my sweet tooth. The ice cream: My boyfriend devoured this dish. The combination of bacon and caramel bits with the vanilla was so good! My tummy was very happy with all the deserts and the only disappointment I have is not actually eating non-dessert items on the menu. All the food looked so GOOD while the waiters passed me by with the dishes as I waited for my 'to go'. So although I did not try anything else to eat on the menu I would highly recommend to eat here anyway. Its Rick Bayless' resturant!
