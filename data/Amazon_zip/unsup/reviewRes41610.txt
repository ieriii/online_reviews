If you like pho, definitely come here and get the Tank Pho Noodles. The bowl is huge and broth is tasty. I usually don't like to order pho (not huge into cilantro), but will always try a small bowl from when my husband orders one. And the pho here is by far better than Pho 888, which is around the corner.  I got the crispy egg noodle dish (I think it was #113 or #116) and it was really good. I even had someone at the next table ask me what I ordered so he could order it too!
