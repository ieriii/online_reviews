Don't try the cookie dessert! I should've known better because it wasn't served in a skillet, which usually guarantees that it's freshly baked. However, this cookie was SO hard and definitely seemed like they warmed it up in the microwave. Some other not so good things: I told our server I'd like the salad bar with my burger, so I wait and wait and wait and she doesn't bring my plate/bowl so I can go get my salad and soup! Finally, I think she remembers and just brings it over and doesn't say sorry she forgot or anything. So I decide to just cancel it altogether. Good thing, cause our food came out 5 minutes later. I just like to enjoy my salad with enough time before my food comes out, that's all. And I know I know I used to be a server too, and things get busy and you forget, but apologies are nice. The burger was pretty good, nice and juicy. The special cottage fries aren't anything great, just really crispy potatoes. All in all I don't think I'll be comin back.
