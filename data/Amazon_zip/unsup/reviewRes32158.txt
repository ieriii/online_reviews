I went to this restaurant for the first time a few months ago. Not sure what to expect as I have never eaten African (specifically Ethiopian) food. I started off with an Ethiopian white wine (very similar to Iced Wine). It was very sweet and aromatic. My friend had a very traditional Ethiopian beer and he said he was good as well.  Since neither me nor my friend had ever had this type of food, we relied on our waitress for assistance. She was very helpful and provided us with food that met our needs. I enjoy spicy foods while my friend enjoys mild selections. Everything that came out was flavorful, nicely arranged, and quite delicious. The only thing that might take some getting used to is the bread. (Very spongy in texture). Not much flavor but very useful in scooping up our food. I would definitely return to this restaurant.
