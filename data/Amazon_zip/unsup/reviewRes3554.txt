Crisp has very good food that's inexpensive to boot. The main attraction is definitely the chicken wings, which are fried to perfection and covered in various sauces. I would go for a 10 piece wing platter, this way you can sample a few flavors. The crisp BBQ and soul sassy are my favorites. They also have another Korean staple, Bi Bim Bop. The toppings and flavor are good as well in this dish. Staff has been helpful and friendly every time I've been.
