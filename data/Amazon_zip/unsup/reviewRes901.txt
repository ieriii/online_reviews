Was this place worth waiting outside in the frigid Chicago weather for 45 minutes until we finally get to order worth it...YOU BET YOUR ASS IT WAS!! Divya M and I were visiting our friends at Kellogg and we thought this would be the perfect Saturday breakfast/lunch. I refrain from calling it brunch because I usually consider eggs a necessity for the term "brunch". Our friend Ben S. drove us, so I can't be of help in terms of how easy this place is to get too without a car. It's cash only by the way, so come prepared.  We obviously got the duck fat fries and they were outstanding! For the hot dogs, I got the foie gras hot dog, the rattlesnake hot dog (game of the week) and the Spicy hot dog (named after an actress that I am forgetting the name off).  Hands down the spicy hot dog was the best. The rattlesnake hot dog was right up there and so was the foie gras dog, but the spicy hot dog was the clear cut winner. The foie gras dog is rich and delicious, but I would recommend splitting it because by the end it's a bit too much. The rattlesnake dog was amazing and although I am not sure if I was actually eating rattlesnake, I like to think I was...and I loved it!  The service here also needs to be mentioned. Doug is the nicest guy and very excited about the hot dogs you are choosing. The busers are extremely friendly and they are the ones who bring you the food, so you should be nice to them as well. Lastly, we ordered hot dogs to go (when placing our original order) and Doug just told us to let him know 5 minutes before we were leaving (we ate inside) so he could make sure the order was hot. Seriously, I hope this place is here forever...I am thinking of making more trips to Chicago to just eat their hot dogs...not to visit my friends, but to eat at Hot Dougs!! Sorry Ben!
