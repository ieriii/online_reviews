My wife and I went to Mercat based on a Taste of Chicago tv review in our hotel room - which was only a block away. The atmosphere was open and the dinning area large with many tables. We got there early, around 5:30. It was jammed by the time we left. We picked 5 dishes to start. My wife hates green beans but she really liked the jam and green bean salad. It had a great flavor. The few other dishes we had were favorable but not top notch. Some of the food was only warm, not hot. I just remembered that the shrimp appetizer was really good. I guess if you are at one of the south loop hotels, this would be a good place to eat. One other thing, our waiter never asked me if I wanted another drink?! Even though I was done with it before the 3rd plate arrived.
