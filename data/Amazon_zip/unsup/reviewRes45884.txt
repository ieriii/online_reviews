We stopped in for lunch on a Friday. The place was really busy but we got seated quickly. I had an avocado chipotle burger, my wife had the club sandwich and our son had the Grand Lux breakfast sandwich. Our food was all great and we made a couple of substitiutions with no problems at all. The portions were huge and we had to take some home with us. The best thing about our experience was our waiter, Kevin L. He was courteous and friendly and very professional without being snooty. Ask for him and you won't be disappointed.  The desserts looked amazing and were also huge! We will have to return to try some of them!
