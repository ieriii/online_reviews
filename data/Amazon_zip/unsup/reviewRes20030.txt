I think the place is slipping, or maybe they're just holiday tired. The food is not a crisp as it used to be, and the service is certainly not as fresh as it used to be. I'll see again after the holidays, but the last couple of times has been less than expected. May be time for a shake up. Oh, and they took the donuts of the dessert menu--criminal.
