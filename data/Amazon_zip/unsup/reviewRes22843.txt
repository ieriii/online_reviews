I love the spinach pie appetizer. And I always come back here for the avgolemono soup. I recommend the fish specials of the day. I really enjoy their seabass and whitefish. The lamb here is always good. Last night I had lamb with Greek-style square-shaped pasta covered with rich tomato sauce and melted cheese. Lamb was tender and the portion huge! More than I could finish in one sitting. I like the yogurt with honey and walnuts for dessert. Tangy, sweet, and crunchy.
