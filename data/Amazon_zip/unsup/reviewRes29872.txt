I've been coming here for 8 yrs and Opart is as good as it gets in the Chicago land area. This restaurant reminds me how Thai food should taste like and how awful so many other places are. You can't go wrong ordering any of their salads, soups, curries, or noodles. The one and only dish I've ever ordered that didn't make me say "Wow" was the fried whole snapper. It was over cooked and pretty puny. Also, I'd keep away from their Shrimp dumpling appetizer. They're tiny and probably pre-frozen from a bag. I doubt they make them there. Other than that, their food is well above and beyond all other Thai places in Chicago. (except for Sticky Rice, they rock too.) They do an interesting "fusion" take on the fried banana dessert here. Not exactly the most authentic of dishes, but it's definitely notable and worth saving room for. They wrap a banana in cream cheese and coconut, then roll it in an egg roll wrapper, then deep fry that baby. It's served covered in honey and sesame seeds. It is hefty and definitely share-able, unless you want to be a glutton and get a stomach ache. Your call.
