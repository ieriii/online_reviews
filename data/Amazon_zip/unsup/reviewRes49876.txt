oh boy....note to self: stick to wine and you'll be fine, go with booze, you're sure to lose. Not because they're skimping, thats for sure.  Everytime I go to the Fiddy I end up on some hilarious adventure of epic proportions. Catching a game? TV's galore.  Looking for WickerPark/Ukie friends? Chances are they have popped in for some of the kick ass specials. Literally there is a food, a beer and a booze special every day. Service is friendly, adorable and awesome. Bathrooms are remarkably clean. Food is delish and portions are perfect size. And yes, they will modify a salad six ways till Sunday and not bat an eye.
