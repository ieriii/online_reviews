I have only eaten in the restaurant once and remember it being really good.  I ordered delivery tonight and was really, really impressed. I got one maki roll and it was huge! Usually, maki rolls are thin with barely any sushi, but Indie's maki rolls are huge with lots of sushi in them. The nigiri pieces were also really large and very fresh. The suzuki (sea bass) was delicious.  I would definitely recommend delivery for sushi from Indie. Everything came quick and was very nicely presented for delivery.
