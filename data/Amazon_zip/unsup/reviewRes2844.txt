The presentation: Inspirational. The service: Attentive and pampering yet oppressive and stifling. The ambiance: stark. The food presentation: A beautiful work of art. The staff's knowledge: PhD. The taste: Just not as good as it looks. But, far above average. Would I return? Not really. There was NOTHING wrong with this swanky spot in Streeterville. It is a definitely a food-lover's delight for the eyes as well as for the taste buds. But, expect to shell out a pretty good wad of cash (especially if you enjoy your wine lists). And, if you are looking for a lively and fun dining environment ... well, not so much. You'll have to look elsewhere.
