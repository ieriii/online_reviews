Great atmosphere, great food, excellent service. You can't do any better than this place. Great food without the 'stuffy' restaurant feel. I found them on Yelp and thought, hey, any restuarant that has over 500 reviews and still has a 4+ star rating has to be good: everything was perfect. Try to get a seat upstairs if you can. They initially tried to seat us downstairs but the table was a little cramped, so I ask for a better table (I am usually not 'that guy') and they took us upstairs where the atmosphere was vastly improved with beatiful french windows and a open air feel.
