Went again and this time greasing the door man didn't work. I think he was with another person who was anal about procedures so I had to stay in line for over 30 minuets. I didn't really care because I had already got hammered with Big Star Margaritas across the street. Once I was able to get in, I had 3 different kinds of whiskey based concoctions. I must have done something unusual because the 3 drinks somehow induced time travel and disintegrated the cash within my wallet. Even though these drinks were excellent and well worth it, I wish I could remember the order I had them in so as to keep anyone else from accidentally entering this wormhole. Good luck.
