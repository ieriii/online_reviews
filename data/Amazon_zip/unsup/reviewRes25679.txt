Providing a star rating for Pequod's is tough. I've had some great pizzas here and some disappointing ones. For the good pizzas, I would give it four stars, but for the disappointing ones, I would give it three stars. In the past year, I have had more disappointing visits than positive ones, so I must rate accordingly. However, my last visit was a good one and I'm hoping they're back on track so I can change the rating soon. The caramelized crust is a must-try, if they're on good run. I recommend adding garlic to your pizza for some extra flavor, especially if they're on a bad run. When it's bad, you need the extra flavor. I don't recommend the thin-crust, as the crust is not caramelized and doesn't have much flavor. The pan at least always has a charred crust, and on good days it's caramelized. I appreciate the local-leaning draft beer selection, although I wish they varied their Half Acre option more frequently, as it's usually the heavier Over Ale. With a pan pizza, I would prefer a lighter ale like the Gossamer. The appetizer options are pretty standard for a pizza place, but are not especially good. Overall, if Pequod's is on a good run, it's great pizza. These past two years, they have been a little off, but maybe they're heading into a good season based on my last visit. I hope so.
