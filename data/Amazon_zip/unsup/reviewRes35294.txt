I like this place so much that I decided I wanted to try & have a fun, casual wedding rehearsal dinner here. I called to see if I could make a reservation for 35 people for a Friday night and get details on any minimums, deposits, etc. The woman who ultimately took my reservation was a little hard to understand and later, when I called back to add 3 people, she didn't seem to be able to find my original reservation (but took my new res again). Confused, I stopped by in person a few days later and talked to Kelly to confirm the event. She was wonderful! She said that they actually have a policy to not take reservations for large parties on a Friday night (*note to readers!) but since I'd already made the reservation she'd make an exception. She then told me to email me the food I wanted to order a week or so ahead of time so they'd be sure to have enough. I perused the menu with my fiance (mouth-watering the whole time) made calculations and considerations and finally emailed our order to Kelly. Less than 24 hours later I get an email back from her not just to confirm my order but also to make suggestions on where I had too *much* food or too similar dishes! Who does that??? The night of the rehearsal dinner went off without a hitch as well. She was attentive, helpful, friendly and not at all annoyed (outwardly anyway) that we were a big rowdy bunch taking up a third of her restaurant. She even made sure to put all of our tables in the alcove/corner so we'd have a little privacy. Awesome place. Awesome service. Kelly, in particular, is great! :)
