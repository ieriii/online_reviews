I've been here for 2 birthday & a wedding rehearsal. it's a great space for all types of events!! def order a frozen white sangria, you won't regret it! I've had lots of things ranging from the empanadas, tuna tar-tar, ceviche, guac & even indulged in their desserts. i've never been disappointed in any of their food. it's a must try if you live in chicago. although it is pricey, so save it for one of those special occasions!
