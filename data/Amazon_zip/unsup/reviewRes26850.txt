This place is all hype and reputation. If this place did not have the Rick Bayless stamp on it then it would probably not do too well. The only positive I can mention about this place is the drinks... which were all refreshing and unique... but pricey. My friends showed up at 5pm to put our name in... they told us it would be a 3 hour wait for a table. Simply ludicrous. I ordered the Brisket Fundido tacos. They were so greasy I could literally spoon grease out of the skillet that it was presented in. The grease was dripping down my hands and all over my fingers. Not exactly attractive when you're with a large group of friends. Mexican food is should be simple, not complex. The novelty of this place will wear fast on you.
