Stopped by for lunch the other day and had the carnitas torta. It was a a little overpriced, but pretty good. Also tried one of the chocolate drinks, which was pretty intense. It's definitely more a desert than a drink. I think this is actually the best of the Rick Bayless places in terms of meeting it's potential. As you move up the scale, the other restaurants get way overpriced when compared to food quality, this was merely a little pricey. The restaurant is pretty loud and crowded around lunch time, which is to be expected, so it might be better to get the food to go if you're in a hurry.
