Disclaimer - this is getting 3 stars (3.5 if I could) because the service was impeccable. The food was a little underwhelming. Maybe my hopes were too high!? For such a renowned chef, I expected more but don't get me wrong... it was decent and if I lived in Chicago, I'd probably go back on a day I didn't have to wait for a table so I can try other plates. We started with the sunrise cocktail which our waiter totally sold us on when he said that one of the components was only made for the restaurant. It was deliciously refreshing.  For appetizers we got the short rib taquitos and chorizo-topped queso fundito. Both really good and full of flavor, but then again, when is anything fried, cheesy or chorizo-topped NOT good?! My friend and I got the mole enchiladas and the steak tacos. This was my first time having mole so I figured, what a better time then to try Bayless' mole!? Not my cup of tea.. but it could have been anyone's mole and I don't think it would have tickled my fancy. Not big on the sweet factor. The chicken was also pretty spicy and I'm a wimp when it comes to spice. My friend LOVED it so I assume for mole fans, it's the business.  The steak for the tacos was good. Great marinade and spice, cooked to medium-rare. They came out as a build-your-own sort of deal. Not big on that either. I can make my own tacos at home. If I'm paying for them, I'd like them already prepared for me in the way the chef intended me to eat them. Also, we never got chips and salsa! What up with that!?  Now as far as the service goes, our waiter could not have been more friendly and honest in his opinions of the food. We were constantly paid attention to and water was filled up at the appropriate times. Good time-span between the apps and entrees too. My advice: make a reservation. This place isn't worth waiting an hour for.
