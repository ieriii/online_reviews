Fabulous BBQ. Nothing more to say. Yes the building is cool and the decor is wonderful and the service is spot on but at the end of the day it's just some really good BBQ. You can taste the care that goes into this food - the sauces seemingly simple but each unfolds slowly on the palate revealing it's complexity. The smoke is neither overpowering nor timid. Smoked grape tomatoes on the salad? Sublime. A decent whiskey list with some gems that might go unnoticed by the dilletante rounds out a great experience
