You are guaranteed to make a pig of yourself (pun entirely intended). All prior warnings of wait are warranted. It is well worth it. Even when our names had been put in for a 12:30 p.m. seating on Saturday--a day that is guaranteed to pull in every tourist in town--we did not take our seats at the communal table until 1:15 p.m. Right when you are ready take your leave, don't pull the trigger. If it is your first time, it will not be your last; give it a chance. There were 7 of us, all looking for a mid-afternoon bite of small plates,, but all present foodies had big appetites and were ready to sample the resident delicacies. We tried the roasted bone marrow; the purple pig platter (assorted charcuterie, grilled bread); four cheeses; salt roasted beets with goat cheese; braised baby artichokes; prosciutto bread balls; pig's ear; pork liver pate; pig's tails; milk braised pork shoulder; chicken thigh kebabs. We were not leaving one of the top 10 restaurants in the country without having a hoof to mouth experience, literally. We covered nearly every part that makes up a portion of the namesake. It was hog heaven. Even the cocktails were sips of the sow: Pig's Nose Scotch. The aroma was something only the most refined lover of swine could appreciate. From first sample to the last, our palettes enjoyed every morsel. So rich and delicious was every selection that you felt ashamed for indulging in them. I am normally a healthy diner, eating more along the lines of raw produce as opposed to fried pig's ears. Please forgive me, but Purple Pig is such a decadent treat for all that they may even convert the most strict vegans. Slip a bit of marrow on a grilled baguette slice, and you may think you are enjoying the sweetest honey. I was like a bee to it. Sweet breads, indeed. The food is not the only important talking point here. The service is spot on. Right when you swallow your last sip, one of the four individuals floating the floor will be there to refill your water, ask if you want another beverage, or kindly remove the glass if you are finished. They are there to remove any empties when the plates are licked clean. I guarantee they will be--either by you OR your neighbor.
