WOW, what an awesome place. My new favorite spot in Chicago for chicken kebabs -- better than Reza's, Andie's, Pars Cove (my old fave). Awesome (and free!) feta/parsley/onion platter. Hummos is top-notch; it's fairly creamy, compared, say, to the thicker hummos at Pars Cove. And can't go wrong with the Persian Tea, complete with the traditional sugar cubes. And, given how busy it always is, the service is the best among Middle Eastern restaurant in the city (although Pars Cove is also great, but it's not often very busy), especially compared to the always apathetic servers at Reza's.
