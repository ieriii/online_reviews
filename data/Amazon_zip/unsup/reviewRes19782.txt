So I had some high expectations for this to be like the best, but it fell a bit short. The atmosphere of the line and then seating is just really bad. There's not very many places to sit and because of that a host will seat you, but you may share a table with people you don't know just to be accommodated... why would they set this place up like this? Its just bad flow to a restaurant really very cramped in some areas of the seating. The mexican sandwiches are truly delicious and savory. I can't not argue with that being the reason I will return. The chip and guacamole was good, but not great the chips were a bit salty.  All and all I'm going back when its warm to take out and get some desserts too next time around.
