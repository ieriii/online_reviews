Went here based on Yelp recommendations. I ordered the Tako Su salad to start - seaweed salad with octopus on top. Got about halfway through the very enjoyable salad... when a bug crawled out from the bottom! Took the salad up to the counter, and they promptly replaced it. Just not very appetizing after that... Still stayed for the sushi. Not bad... but I believe my overall experience was tainted by the extra protein. Although cordial, they NEVER actually apologized by saying, "I'm sorry that happened." Disappointing. They offered free dessert - chocolate cake - but we turned that down politely. Not sure if we'll go back based on this.
