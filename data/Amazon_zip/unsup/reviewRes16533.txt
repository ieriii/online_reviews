Ate at Carnival for the 1st time last Saturday. Everyone in our party enjoyed the experience. That is really what Carnivale is, an experience. The bar is crowded, difficult to get a drink and you are constantly getting bumped into. It is busting at the seams with 'scensters.' The main dinning room is awe inspiring. it is the same dimensions of the main room at its predecessor, drink. The high ceilings and loud colors jump out at you and hit you smack in the face. We eat at a table in the back room down a few stairs near a fire place. I really liked the table, it was definitely out of the way and very intimate. The food was great! Not 5 star, but at a place of this size I was very impressed. Overall, not a place I will go to all the time, I will however be back again. Nice work Jerry!
