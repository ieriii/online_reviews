I stopped here for dinner before seeing a show at Shakespeare Theater. We allowed for extra time since it does take a full hour to experience authentic Chicago deep dish pizza. I'm not a fan of the deep dish zah. I am more of a super thin crust kind of girl. We were entertaining out of towners so we splurged and got the deep dish. We ordered the sausage patty deep dish. Our pizza arrived and it was so sinfully good. I loved the extra sauce on top and the crust. I wasn't a fan of the sausage fatty patty. Yeah, it was full of fat but what sausage isn't? Huge lines of people waiting to get in for mediocre pizza. The graffiti on the walls is somewhat tacky. My heart is partial to Lou Malnati's, I think they have better deep dish but it's good to try them all. Our server was kind of lackluster but he has to handle the droves of tourists so I really can't blame him.
