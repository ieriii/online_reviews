I had the worst experience here this morning. This was my favorite go-to veg restaurant in Chicago for the past 5 years, but they lost me. I took my husband and daughter for Valentine's Day brunch this morning. Our server was really friendly, but the kitchen staff horribly disappointed me. I ordered Huevos Rancheros, favorite dish I order most times I have brunch. The first plate came out with burned eggs. I mean burned black on the bottom. Did they think I wouldn't notice when I took a bite? Second round was totally bland, basically barely cooked scrambled eggs with un-melted shredded cheese thrown on top. Really unappetizing. At this point my husband and 4 year old are done eating and I STILL haven't received a palatable meal. The server confesses that they had run out of eggs after a busy Saturday and had to buy cage free eggs at Jewel. Yeah, I could taste the difference. So I order the Chxn Caesar Salad to go, because I can't really expect my family to wait, yet again for a third go round, but I'm starving. I dig into the salad at home to find the seitan is a bunch of big blocks of rock hard seitan- not at ALL what it looked like the last time I ordered it. And the "caesar" dressing tasted like straight-up vegan mayonnaise. They're out of raw cheesecake, because once again we're told it was a busy Saturday. I guess the diners who actually come in ON Valentine's Day don't count? I'm really not certain that whoever was cooking actually tasted any of their dishes, or cared what they sent out. I don't think it would be possible for them to disappoint me further today, and I am really sad that I've lost my favorite restaurant.
