i've been here twice in one week - first by chance, second by choice. the homemade pasta and friendly, knowledgeable service is incredible! i was blown away by the tagliatelle with morels and an amazing alfredo sauce. i was even more impressed with their signature lemon panna cotta! the atmosphere is so relaxing, charming and warm...the food is excellent and the service outstanding. i can't wait to go back for #3!
