Outstanding, from start to finish! Cool decor, amazing speak-easy bar downstairs to get a pre-dinner drink, and impeccable food and drink. Service was also good and they didn't make you feel rushed. Great place, too, to take people from out of town...very trendy.  I believe Maude's liquor bar is also owned by the same people...both excellent, but this edges it out due to atmosphere.  Go...you won't be dissappointed!
