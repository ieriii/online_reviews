Recent pig-out consisted of us grubbing on the following: 5 orders of duck fat fries 1 order of the marty allen dog 2 orders of the [house original] dog 1 order of the keira knightley-fire dog 1 order of the spicy beef hot link coca-cola bbq & applewood smoked cheddar 1 order of the spicy smoked alligator sausage + cajun remoulade and smoked blue cheese 2 orders of foie gras and sauternes duck sausage + truffle aioli, foie gras mousse and sel gris 1 order of the three-chili wild boar sausage + chipotle dijonnaise and smoked cumin gouda cheese 1 order of the cherry-apple pork sausage + curry-lime mayonnaise, rum-soaked dried berries and roasted almonds Nothing has changed with Hot Doug's in the last few years. Dogs are still stellar, staff is still unbelievably friendly, it's still cash only, duck fat fries are still a greasy addiction only offered on Friday & Saturday, lines are still way down the block, and the buns still suck and offer nothing to counter the craziness that's piled onto each and every creation. I still go through the jot down on the imaginary yellow legal pad of pros and cons kinda thinking when figuring out of it's worth making the trek with the lack of a convenient CTA stop in the area and waiting in 1 1/2 hour line bombarded with tourists while locals are just trying to grab a yummy meal (no hate, I love you guys, thanks for loving our beautiful city!). And honestly, most of the time I vote against going to Hot Doug's strictly because of those 2 things -- inconvenient to get to unless you feel like driving and the unwillingness to wait in line. And it's not just any line. Every major spot that has got its 15-minutes-of-TV-fame has a line in this city. And it's just a little more difficult to calculate when the non-rush periods will be at Hot Doug's.
