I was not impressed by this place. the location is decent, but that's about it. It is a hike to get to an el-stop, to transfer on busses would be easier said than done as well. The things that stood out to me were the lobby, which was welcoming though it was a bit dirty for me, and the Chicago Burger Company. Ken M wrote that CBC was disgusting but I think I'm going to have to disagree as my bleu cheese burger was cooked great and the fries were awesome at the time. I would have to visit back for another assessment but from what I've experienced so far, it wouldn't stop me from trying out again. As for the rooms...standard room.
