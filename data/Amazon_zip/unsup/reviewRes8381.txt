I love this place! I moved out of Chicago last year, but still make a point to stop for pizza here whenever I'm in town. Ingredients are fresh, dough is yummy, servers are friendly, what more could you ask for? My parent's favorite (and they're pretty picky eaters) is the black truffle on foccacia (it's not on their regular menu, it was a special once and we order it every time now)
