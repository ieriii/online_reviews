Great night with potential business partner. Took a chance last week and did something different than the traditional stuffy steak house business dinner and brought guests to Sunda. While I typically prefer quieter settings for dinner meetings, our table was private and the general noise covered our conversation and allowed great business discussion. Most importantly though the service and food broke the ice and helped start what may be a very profitable future relationship. Can't say enough positives about the food and service. Service was very knowledgeable and recommendations were spot on. We ate food that we would not necessarily have chosen and were thrilled by it.. Food itself was awesome - in both presentation and taste. I will be back.
