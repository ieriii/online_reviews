The world's best crab rangoon. No, I haven't tasted all of the crab rangoon in the world, but if you're looking for a more accurate frame of reference, it's a challenge that I'm willing to accept. They actually use real crab in their crab rangoon- not "crabstick" and not only cream cheese like so many places are apt to do. It's the the real McCoy here. People - do yourself a favor and go get these NOW. I've been known to eat an entire order by myself.  I've only ordered the Thai food here (no sushi) but it's always been very good. Rumor has it that this place isn't BYOB anymore, which makes me sad. But who really cares when you can just order another crab rangoon? Fortunately for my waistline, this place is a hike from where I live. Otherwise, I'm fairly certain I'd be ordering crab rangoon every day. I wish I was kidding about that. For now, I'll just have to stop in when I trek up to visit my friends who live in Wisconsin...I mean Edgewater.
