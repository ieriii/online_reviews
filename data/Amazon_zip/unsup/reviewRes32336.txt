We were enticed here with a Yelp Deal discount. The food was ok, and similar to other Ethiopian places. The appetizer messob (an assortment of sambussas) was a nice starter. The veggie/meat messob for two was a decent value (3 veggies and 3 meats) for $28. The mild beef entree (#43 I think) we had for $13.50 was small, and not a good selection, and not the fried beef we thought it was going to be. Demera is distinctive for its nice decor and ambiance, the best we have encountered for Ethiopian. I also liked their beer selection which included Guinness, and Two Brothers' selections (I had an Ebel Weiss).  My personal advice in eating Ethiopian style is to finish your meal while the items are still warm. I've found the eating near the end is not too appetizing when everything has cooled off and the food has been spread out every which way. Of course, the opinion can vary depending on how hungry one may be!
