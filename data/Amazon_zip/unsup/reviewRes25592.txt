There's little to add, but I'll just note that this place was founded by Burt Katz, who went on to found Burt's Place up in Morton Grove. If you're not fond of "traditional" Chicago style deep dish (I'm not) try this place anyway - the Pequod's/Burt's style is a fantastic, unique twist on Chicago deep dish. Most importantly, this location has pizza that is nearly identical to what you'll find at Burt's - the defining characteristics are the caramelized crust, a thick, cake-like crust, and comparatively thin layer of cheese. The procedure for eating here is not nearly as challenging as it is at Burt's. I've been to this location a number of times and have never had to wait for a table. Also, try the garlic bread. It's incredible.
