Downgrading my review by a star. I made a reservation for 24 for dinner with my friends and some parents. I still really like the food, but service was terrible. 1. They did not refill my water. I stole cups from my bf and parents because I was thirsty and they weren't filling my glass. 2. They got our order wrong. We ordered pea shoots and got pea pods instead. 3. They forgot our fried noodles for one of the tables. 4. When we talked to them to correct something, it took forever before something was done about it. Overall, I still like their duck and would come back for it, but as someone who has visited Sun Wah three times and received poor service during each visit, it's starting to get annoying.
