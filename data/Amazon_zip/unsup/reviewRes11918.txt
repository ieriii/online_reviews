I'm from Connecticut originally, and believe me when I tell you that Piece is the closest thing you'll find to real New-Haven Style pizza. It's amazing! I spent my first two years in Chicago trying pizza after pizza, searching for something that could even compare. Piece does it right - the crispy thin crust, the tangy sauce, the great toppings - I feel like I'm home again! Yes, it's crowded so if that's not your thing, then don't go on a Friday or Saturday night. If you're looking for authentic, delicious thin-crust pizza in Chicago this is definitely the place to go.
