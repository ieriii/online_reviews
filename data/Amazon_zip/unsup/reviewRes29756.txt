Impressively tasty Thai food at very reasonable prices. I found nothing extraordinary on their menu but all of the dishes were well prepared and served in a timely manner. The atmosphere of the place is pleasant too. This joint takes #2, just below Siam Noodle & Rice, on my list for best cheap Thai eats in Chicago.
