My husband and I have been here multiple times for dinner and have always been pleased. The wait staff is extremely knowledgeable and experienced in romantic dinner etiquette (they keep an eye on us but never interrupt our conversation or rush us). In fact, the first time we ate here our waiter brought us our wine and then pointed out that a cozy booth had opened up and offered to re-seat us in the corner. For a restaurant to give up a 6 person booth to a table for 2 on a crowded Saturday night, that let me know that we were being treated like family even though it was our first visit. In fact, after having such good dining experiences, we recently held our wedding reception in their 2nd floor private banquet room. The decor may be a tad dated, but a month later our guests are not critiquing the room but rather they're still raving about the how good the food was (guests choose from an abbreviated menu) and how many courses we had (6, I think)! The staff was incredibly helpful. Enzo and Angelo both fielded with grace many frantic calls from this bride, and their laid back attitude about everything reminded me that the entire affair would be both personalized and problem-free. Our party lasted long into the night--probably even longer than they wanted us to stay :) (I was there with the groom for over 9 hours...and the bar was still open when we left)--but we had the best time and I would suggest their services and dining to anyone looking for fantastic Italian food and hospitality!  PS-Order their tiramisu, it is phenomenal.
