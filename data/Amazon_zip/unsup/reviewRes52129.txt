I have to admit this review is really a 3.5 star, but I will be nice since the sauce was great! It was going to be a long wait to be seated here, but since we took a tour, we got a pass for priority seating. What a great idea! My party was still seated about 20 minutes later, and we were told that the food would take about an hour. We placed our orders for two deep dishes- The famous cheese and sausage, and the meat lovers. The cheese and sausage has a disc of sausage in the middle, and its almost a reverse pizza (I think this place was featured on the food network- Best thing I ever ate- pizza!). We also ordered garlic sticks and cheese bread. The first to arrive were the bread. The sauce that accompanied them was SO GOOD!!! The cheese bread was super cheesy and the breadsticks were better than Ive had in some time. After a long wait, the deepdish arrived. The layer of sausage was perfect!!!! It was really saucy, but personally I like it with the sauce! I really enjoyed ever bit of the pizza - I think a single slice was like 1000 calories, but I had almost two it was so good. Although i will admit the crust was average. I didnt like the flavor of it as much and I was expecting more bread. But for my first true deep dish, I thoroughly enjoyed it.
