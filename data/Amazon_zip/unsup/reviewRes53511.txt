I know lot's of people have strong opinions about this place. I just wanted to add a few things.Great stuff. I always try to get their very early and found this adds to my experience. I am not a fan of waiting Try going on a Tuesday or Wednesday. Additionally, Doug is a personable independent owner operator and I am pleased to support his fine joint!
