I tried Xoco today with a group of friends from work and I could not be happier! We had heard about long lines so, planning ahead, we arrived around 11:30. Even so, we had about a 15 minute wait. They will not take an order until they have a table available for you, so the wait is up front. The upside is that you are not wandering around a crowded room looking for a place to eat the yummy sandwich heading towards you. They really handled the lines extraordinarily well. We ordered several orders of chips and guacamole and chips and salsa for the table. The red sauce is smokey and nicely spiced. The green salsa is milder but still tasty. Loved the guac! Chips were quite good too. My sandwich was the Ahogado. Pork carnitas, black beans and pickled onions of an amazing crunchy bread soaking in a bowl of tomato broth. Amazing! I am definitely going back!
