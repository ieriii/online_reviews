This was quite a dining experience. The food was awesome and the colorful interior definitely kept me entertained during our 70 minute wait. On a Tuesday night. Wow. The guac was amazing, definitely the best I've ever had, it was fresh and chunky and just perfectly done with lovely presentation. The Topo margarita was great too. Amazingly smooth and tasty. I'm not a big tequila fan but this was great. I had two and felt GREAT after. For food, my meal of chicken, mashed potatoes w/aged Cheddar and beans was great but my date's meal the steak with plantains and guac was by far better. That will be my meal next time. Overall, it was a great time and great food. I would definitely go back next time just for dessert!
