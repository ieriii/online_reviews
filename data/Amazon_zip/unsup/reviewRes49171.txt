Meh. I had a carrot cake cup cake and it was good but it wasn't amazing. The chocolate chip cookie and oatmeal cookie were good too, but again not something to rave about. The place is kind of a dive which gives it charm. Nice ambiance, although it would be nice it they played some old school jazz music etc as background music. Free wi-fi makes it a nice place to bring a laptop and relax.
