Excellent hot dog and fries. If not the best one around. Service is very good but that also means you need to be a customer. The quicker you decide the better service and experience for everyone. Just have a clue what's happening around you and be courteous. However, parking and crowd can be a problem which sometimes dampens the experience. Try going at different times and days.
