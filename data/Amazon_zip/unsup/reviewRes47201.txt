My husband and I took a friend to Lockdown today for lunch and we all really loved the burgers! There was no wait at all (Sunday afternoon) either! I had the Punk Bitch and it was beyond tasty. The pretzel bun that they serve their burgers on was super amazing as well. Overall it was a great experience and we'll definitely be going back
