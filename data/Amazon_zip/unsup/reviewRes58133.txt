Let me start off by saying that I have NEVER written a bad review about a restaurant. Generally speaking, my thoughts are that things happen and for the most part my past bad experiences at restaurants have not warranted such an extreme act (as I see it). I like to focus on the positive. In this case, I can't get past the service. I am giving this restaurant 2 stars because the food was pretty good and the atmosphere was cool and interesting. However, the service needs some serious help. Our waiter was clearly disinterested to say the least but he's not the reason for my beef. During our meal (albeit towards the end of the meal) a manager actually had us move tables so that they could sit a larger table. Again, this alone is not my beef.  Who really cares, I can stand up and move tables if that helps them out. I thought the request was odd but it really didn't bother me much. The last straw was the REPEATED subtle checks by the hostess to see if the bill had been paid (within about a 20 minute time span). Then when we paid and stood up from the table the immediate (and I mean immediate) pounce on the table running over one of my party members while getting to the coveted table. Pushing patrons out the door is not a good business practice--plain and simple. We were there for 2.5 hours, not excessive especially for a tapas restaurant. I will not be returning to this restaurant as there are too many other wonderful establishments in the Chicago area (case in point, BOKA which I was at last night which provided stellar service (and awesome food)!). It goes without saying that I am not recommending this restaurant to any of my friends based on the service experience. Call me old fashion, but service matters. In a word my experience was...disappointing.
