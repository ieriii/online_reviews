The Chicago Diner is a dining mecca; the unofficial "holy grail" meat free experience that is always a must-go for the traveling vegan / vegetarian / ovo-lacto. The vegan milkshakes have a cult following, and the Diner is known for its healthy, but ultimately delicious brunch and dinners. Locals love it too- and meat lovers, never fear. My omni gentlemanfriend enjoyed immensely the Egg Biscuit Sammie, perhaps due to its respective condiment: cajunnaise. He may have licked the little container clean, and definitely didn't balk at the seitan sausage. We both agreed that the herb flaked biscuit was superb. Standard breakfast fare is also abound- the portions are large but not too large, if you get my meaning. Coffee comes in huge cups and they're very generous with refills, a necessity for an establishment with "diner" in the title. "Seitan bacon" (although it's more fun to use the incorrect spelling) tastes nothing like bacon and everything like smoked tofu, just how I like my fake meats. We also tried the vegan cinnamon roll-- OmniBoyfriend said "this tastes nothing like vegan food." I'm pretty sure that means: tasty. Although this Belmont staple is usually pretty crowded, the waitstaff won't rush you. Our almost overly goofy waiter said we had earned "some chill time" when he brought the check. Personally, I'd prefer the fake soy "cheeze" on my scrambled tofu.
