Dear Graham Elliot - don't lie to potential customers and claim to be vegan-friendly when all you are prepared to do is send out a plate of grilled zucchini for $25. Pathetic! Look, I don't expect much from a "fine-dining" establishment in terms of catering to vegans - but that is why I call in advance to ask if they are vegan-friendly. You'd be surprised at how many reputable chefs and gourmet restaurants will embrace the challenge. Graham Elliot certainly talked the talk but then walked a painfully pathetic walk. When the plate arrived I had to hold back from laughing. The decor and server were nice - hence the two stars. However, the two non-vegans at our table ordered from the menu and both got appetizers and entrees (pork loin and bison skirt steak) and weren't excited about their food at all. I obviously wouldn't come back.
