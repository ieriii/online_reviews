We went there for breakfast on memorial's day. The restaurant is excruciatingly slow. The waitress showed up 10 minutes after we arrived. We waited over 55 minutes after ordering and are still waiting for our brunch. It could be that this was a Holiday and they had more people than usual to deal with, but it was still too slow.
