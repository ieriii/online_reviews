As my nickname would imply, I am indeed a dj and this first weekend in October had me booked all weekend - not that I'm complaining - but in need of good, filling Sunday food, before closing it out and starting the week anew. I met up with a friend who is also a dj and paid a visit to Revolution Brewing FOR THE WIN! All Good Errthang.
