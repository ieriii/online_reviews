DEEELISH.  I finally decided to come here after much anticipation.  Beautiful murals adorn the outer walls as well as the enclosed patio walls. I saw the guy painting these -- there is a lot of love here. I ordered the vegetarian meal which consisted of sauteed red peppers, yellow and green squash and portobello mushrooms with a side of white rice, black beans and fried sweet plantains.  This dish was filling, and spot on. My gal pal ordered the steak on white bread.... and my roommate ordered the steak on a thinly sliced fried plantain. The chef came out and explained that in Cuba, wheat and flour tend to be expensive, so the plantain is used in a variety of ways. I tried a piece and it was delicious... We also shared an order of plantain chips with minced garlic.  YUM. A great part of the experience here is the outdoor patio.. I ADORE outdoor seating. On the south side of the patio are palm trees, to the west and north, flower baskets and to the east, the mural (my favorite part is a woman seated comfortable on the sand, legs splayed with a skirt between, a fat cigar between her lips. Hot sun, good food and great atmosphere. I will deeeefinately be back at the 90 Miles Cuban Cafe.  And bonus for me... it's just a few blocks from mi casa!
