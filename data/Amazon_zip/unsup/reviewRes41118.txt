Of course, can't go wrong with Ruth Chris no matter where it is. Only downside is that it took more than 20 min to get our food, which resulted in massive bread consumption. Ordered their petite filet (8 oz., I think regular filet is 10) and it was more than enough. We even splurged and ordered shoe string fries and the potatoes au gratin. Since we were already knee deep, we thought what the heck and ordered the apple tart for dessert. If we weren't so full to begin with, I would have enjoyed the appetizers and dessert more, but don't get me wrong - they're still amazing and would get it again next time i come.
