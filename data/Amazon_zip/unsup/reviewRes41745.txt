I'm actually between a fan and not a fan. Pros: 1. great pho, great meats, great pork with rice and sunny side up or with chinese sausages, 2. considered cheap for a great size of meal. 3. the serving is quite fast. cons: 1. when it's rainy, the place gets dirty, and I've noticed they didn't put attention in maintaining the building itself 2. somehow, they just got to train the waiter. My husband liked to eat pho separately from the broth. We always go there almost every month, and it's not possible if they don't know us, regular customer. how hard for them to remember that we have different order from others? 3. love the food, love the price, but not love the parking spots. especially during weekends, you just got to wait to get near parking spot to the restaurant if you're lucky or you have to walk pretty far because you're not lucky to find any nearest parking spot. but still, i think the food outweighs the cons.
