My husband and I came here for dinner on Saturday night. From the yelp reviews we'd read, we knew there would probably be a long wait. We arrived around 5:15 and parked in the convenient lot across the street. We lucked out and only had to wait about 10 minutes for a table. We started with the grilled romaine panzanella salad and the foie gras/hot chocolate small plate. The salad was great, but the foie gras stole the show. It was so delicious and paired perfectly with the hot chocolate and funnel cake. I could eat that dish every day. For our entrees, I had the pork belly and my husband had the beef short rib/marrow/foie gras plate. Mine was tasty, but my husband's dish was amazing! While my pork belly was tasty, it was a very large piece of pork belly, and I feel like one can only eat so much fatty pork products. My husbands on the other hand had such a variety items all in one plate. There was this perfectly cooked beef tenderloin underneath a beef short rib, and on top of all that was a piece of foie gras. To the side there was a marrow bone, filled with horseradish mashed potatoes, and on top of that was a little piece of toasted marrow. So delicious! Luckily my husband let me have some of his. It was fantastic! While you'd probably think we'd be stuffed by this point, we still had to save some room for dessert. For dessert we had the gruyere donuts. Yum! The perfect ending to an amazing meal. We will be back to try the wild boar sloppy joes and the fries.
