You would be surprised at this following statement, but I am quite spoiled with Pho that I get in Denver. It's pretty much set the bar for me as far as pho goes, so it is hard for me to find a place that tops my all time favorite Pho 95. I am in town for the holidays and one of the things on my list is to try Chicago pho to see how it matches up.  I was steered towards this place both from Yelp and a number of friends who also suggested this place. I headed up with my friend Jen W who was a pho virgin til last night. The space is pretty big, and even at 4 pm it was bustling but we were still able to be seated right away. I decided to order #43 which was beef and flank. My friend was delighted to see that they offered several veggie options as well. They brought out the plate of garnish and sadly it was kind of scarce. I had to ask them for more limes. I mean, two slices? That's all we get? On to the pho. It came out quick and piping hot which was able to cook my rare meat. Sadly the meat to noodle ratio was way off, but it was still all very delicious. The broth had a flavor to it that I couldn't quite put my finger on, but whatever it was, it tasted magical. My friend also loved her Pho and swears she will be back. I'm looking forward to coming back and trying other pho places in the area.
