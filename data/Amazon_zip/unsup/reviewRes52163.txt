First of all, what is up with the looooong line outside? Oh, I know! Maybe it's because your waiter tells you the deep dish pizza takes about 40-50 mins to make, but it ACTUALLY takes about an hour and a half plus? Yep. Maybe the Original Gino's East is better, but I don't know... My friends and I agreed the crust tasted like corn bread... It even looked like it too. The cheese was good though. But all in all, it was a bit disappointing, for many people had told me Gino's was one of the top must-go eateries in Chicago. The interior was fun with all the random graffiti on the walls. Oh and the caesar salad was good.
