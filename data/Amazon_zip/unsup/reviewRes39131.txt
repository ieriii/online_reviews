So hipster. I love it. This place is really close to where we live so of course, we have been there a few times. I like going to L&E as a reward for either 1) a riotous night of drinking and dancing or 2) completing a race - even if it's only a 5k. Their food is on the salty side... but thankfully, I do like salty. I try to avoid it because of such formidable things known as high cholesterol and clogged arteries. Their menu uses some fancy shmancy food terms that I'm not familiar with - that's usually a red flag. L&E was able to win me over despite terms like "confit" and some others that I have not committed to memory. All of their breakfast items are good, good, GOOD! I am particularly fond of their burger with fried egg though. Noticing a trend in my burger preferences?  I found their servings to be of good proportion - not overboard, but not measly. The chicken and waffle platter was very savory as well. All in all, I can't wait to go back!
