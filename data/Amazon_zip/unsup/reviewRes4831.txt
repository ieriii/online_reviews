Yes, please. Needing some dinner of course and not cooking for ourselves half the time, my friends and I went to Purple Pig for the first time. We knew the wait would be long perhaps, but somehow we got seats at the bar area even though the place was pretty crowded.  Inside of course the place is pretty nice. Modern, casual, but nice. We all ordered some good, small plates and dishes, none of which were bad at all. My favorites were probably the Serrano and the Bone Marrow smear. Really, don't even get me started on Bone Marrow. That stuff was so good, and even served out of the bone. Great stuff! The Tuna appetizer was good too, but nothing amazing. Looking for dessert, the guy behind the bar recommended the Iris and said it was amazing. I texted Ryne D and asked him too and he said it was the best dessert he's had in Chicago. Well, it was very very good, although I wouldn't call it the best in town. Maybe top 5 for me, but still up there. It has ricotta in it, which was a great touch! Really, this place is pretty great and I plan on coming back more. Very good!
