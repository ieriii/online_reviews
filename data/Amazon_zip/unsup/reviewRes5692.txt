great bar/small plates atmosphere.  definately bringin' the animal fat. tried bone marrow for the first time. felt awful afterwards...it's just like terrible butter. i've never had marrow before so i can't compare. BUTTERNUT SQUASH WAS AMAZING THOUGH. pigs ears were bleh. the steak was a little tough. the pork braised in milk was very tender, but everything here is (obvi) heavy. another pork chop we had was pretty good. slowish service for large groups, and i got rained on by the server. it's really loud so you have to enunciate, so forgivable, but very unpleasant.
