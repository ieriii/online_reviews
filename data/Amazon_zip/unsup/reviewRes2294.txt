Most definitely one of my FAVORITE spots in Chicago. I love trying the specials, which are like gourmet hot dog creations, and the duck fat fries are SO good. Service is fast, everything's reasonably priced, and this place never fails to please. I make sure to stop by Hot Doug's at least once every couple of months, and I totally want to befriend Doug who seems like the coolest guy.
