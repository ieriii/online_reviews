Pequod's Pizza sets the standard for deep dish pizza in Chicago, as far as I'm concerned. I've tried other, perhaps more iconic, pizzas, and they do not compare. The taste and texture of the crust, the quality and quantity of the toppings - there is nothing left to be desired. The venue itself is usually crowded, and perhaps not family-oriented (their sign and t-shirts feature a whale with a thong on its head, though my somewhat tight-laced parents didn't mind), but it's perfectly possible to get a table with little notice given.
