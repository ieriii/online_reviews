Drive in hot dawgs where the waitress come to your car! Classic. The only thing missing are the roller blades. Great juicy and fat hot dog with an annoying useless tomatoe. However, there is not much to say about hot dawgs other than It being the greatest and the milkshakes are really good as well.
