I really like this place. It's a hot dog place where you can get everything from your standard Chicago-style dog to exotic meat products. The duck fat fries are pretty good but I wouldn't call them awesome. Plus it's a fun quirkly little place that's kinda off the beaten path but well worth going to. But be prepared to wait in line out the door.
