One of my favorite restaurants of recent months. The service was impeccable and our waiter knew every dish inside and out. He was extremely likable, which is good because you do need to rely on them heavily as the menu only hints at the dishes, while the wait staff can give you the full low down. Get the shortrib while they still have it. It was unbelievable. Also get the chocolate dessert. I'm serious. Get it. It reminded us of the chocolate table at Alinea and those of you who know what I'm talking about will already be opening up OpenTable in another tab to get your reservation. It is like heaven on earth, covered in chocolate.
