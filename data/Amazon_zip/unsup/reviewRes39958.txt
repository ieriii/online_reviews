I'm becoming a gastopub-ophile. I love these places and if they keep on being as good as Longman & Eagle I'll keep going back. The layout and decor are pretty slick. If you want to just go for drinks (which they have a great beer and whiskey selection) the front space is for you. There's a good amount of standing room and the bar is pretty large as well. If you're dining there are some tables in the front area but we were seated in the back which is all dining. The mostly wooden decor is very nice and make sure to check out the ceiling too. Our food was excellent. I started with a whiskey flight and would recommend the 12 year Elijah Craig to anyone. I then had the white asparagus salad which came with a one hour egg. This egg is cooked in a temperature controlled water for an hour and this makes the yolk and white have the same consistency. It was like a custard and was amazing. My wife and I then shared the Gnuddi (which I would eat 20 more of if possible), the scallops which were great, and the fried clam bellies which I wouldn't recommend as they were pretty gritty. We finished with the poached apple on french toast. The french toast was the star of that dish. Seeing as they're going to be serving brunch soon, I can't wait to check that out.
