I've been really disappointed by XOCO lately. Yes the churros and hot chocolate are still good, the tortas are still yummy and the soups good but the salads have taken a turn for the worse. Lately the chicken is now breaded Y-U-C-K and the pork equally blah in the salads. I don't understand if this is a cost cutting measure or what but I would not recommend getting the XOCO salad here anymore (I used to worship them). Stick to deserts and tortas.
