I was very excited to find a vietnamese place in my neighborhood but I can't say I'll be coming back here. The food was good. Got the beef pho and it was tasty and had plenty of meat. Shrimp spring rolls turned out to be very small considering the menu indicated 4 pieces.. It was really like one giant spring roll cut into 8 bite sized pieces.  What really turned me off here was the service. Maybe it's just not my style, but it seemed like they tried way too hard to cater to the yuppie crowd. I am vietnamese and you can tell by looking at my face. Our server made it sound like I had never eaten pho before in my life and was explaining to me what the bean sprout and herb plate was for. Excuse me, get out of the way and let me eat in peace! Then at the end of our meal he tried to convince us to get pho with meatballs in it for a good 5 minutes. Sorry bud, the last time I ate soup with meatballs in it I was 7 years old. And he kept pushing even after we were clearly not interested. Argyle is still your best bet for the best vietnamese food in Chicago. (Tank Noodle is my favorite).
