"What A Wonderful Dining Experience" I took my family to dinner at Ruth's Chris Steakhouse in Chicago and we had a magnificent meal. The ambience was a bit too loud, and the service was good, not outstanding, but the food was fantastic! Kudos to the General Manager: Jeff Carter, the Managers: Casey Owens, Michael Schultz, and Jason Snelson, and most importantly to the chef, Chef: Jorge Fernandez. (I thought enough of my experience to actually look up their names!) The wine list was not the best in town, but it was certainly better than average. While the steak was what one would expect from a top-notch steakhouse in Chicago, tender and cooked to perfection, I was pleasantly surprised by the non-steak items on the menu, particularly the seafood/lobster tail. The salads were crisp and fresh. The creamed spinach, broccoli and other sides were a bit rich, but quite pleasing to the palate! For desert you MUST try the Caramelized Banana Cream Pie and Warm Apple Crumb Tart. This fine-dining establishment's longstanding ranking as one of Chicago's top 5 steakhouses is quite well deserved.
