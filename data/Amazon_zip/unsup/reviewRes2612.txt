I remember it was a Friday. I was hungry.....I needed some meat!!!! So I decided to I break my Hot Doug's cherry all by my lonesome. But I didn't mind my "alone time". I got there and was the 8th person in line outside. So I was at the counter in just under 20 minutes. Atomic Ribeye Dawg and some Duck Fat fries......oh I couldn't wait. The dog was really good! Unfortunately I was disappointed with the duck fat fries. I love fat, and I love duck....but this just did nothing for me. It tasted like a normal batch of fresh cut fries (which are good...but not mmmm'mmmm campbell's soup good). I defintely will go again, but will open it up to the rest of the week, since I don't have to order the DFF. Honestly, and I hate to name drop, but am going to do it anyways: Sweets and Savories' beef tallow fries are so much more tastier......But their hotdogs don't have shit on Doug's (not even sure if they do have hotdogs).
