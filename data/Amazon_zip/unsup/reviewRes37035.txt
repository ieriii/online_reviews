I would give you no stars if I could - I'm looking at you CAFE.  I was here as a group of 4 ppl. Saturday the 24th of March, things were busy but we were seated in the cafe right away.  It took our waiter about 15mins just to come over. The hostess in the meantime approaches our table with a tray of water and forcefully tells us "go ahead grab them".  Finally, our waitress takes our order....... 2 bowls of soup, 2 sandwiches..... 40 mins later our food finally arrives. We didn't see our waitress from the original point she took our order, until I had to get up.... and find her to get us our check. Which at the point - I just said we need to leave can you get our check to us - her response was "I know". I wish I could have gotten her name, but their service is terrible - she didn't introduce herself, so I don't know.  We were not offered refills on our coffee or iced tea. It was miserable. For a quick lunch before a movie... we were seated at 12:00 - and didn't leave till 1:30. INSANE. I was fuming mad. We thought - plenty of time before a 2pm show - GRRRR  The worst was the food was only luke warm. The waitress was awful. Most tables we noticed near us - just left before even placing an order.  I looked like a total ass in front of my friends - as I suggested this location - which I might add have never has a problem like this. I'm totally disgusted.
