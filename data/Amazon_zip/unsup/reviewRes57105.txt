Checked this place out with a couple friends today. The atmosphere is very cool. The food was very good. I ordered the Flemish Beef Stew which was delicious. Also tried the wings and the fish and chips. The wings had a good flavor with just the right amount of kick. The fish and chips was pretty good, a little more breading than fish, but still tasty. I ordered the Pale Ale first, but got the Workingmans Mild by mistake. I'm not one to waste a beer, so I gave it a try. I wasn't a big fan of that one. However, the IPA was very good. Very flavorful and strong, but not overpowering. It's not cheap, but you get a decent amount of good quality food. I will definitely be back.
