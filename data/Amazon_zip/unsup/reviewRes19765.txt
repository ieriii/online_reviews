This is an incredible drink and appetizer place! The bloody mary was outstanding! We all loved our appetizers, but the entree's were very forgettable. I had a steak but it was completely overdone and the thing that turned us off the most was the fact that we went during restaurant week. My wife and I both do very well , but once they figured out we were there for restaurant week we literally got little to no attention! PLace has potential, but needs a few fixes
