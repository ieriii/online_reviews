XOCO Opening Day + meeting Rick Bayless + delicious pastries and coffee = FIVE stars! For breakfast, XOCO reminds me of a quaint little bakery. Immediately upon entering there is the enticing smell of coffee coupled with the smell of fresh baked goods including muffins, mexican brioche, and churros creatively arranged on colorful racks. The breakfast and lunch menu hangs above the counter and is handwritten in chalk on a blackboard. Such little touches to make XOCO feel laid-back and fun. Even though this restaurant is 1 day old, it already feels like it's been here forever. Chef Rick Bayless was at the restaurant today....standing at the end of the counter enjoying his opening day and saying hello to the customers! Casual and laid back himself, he embodied the feel of his restaurant. I am so excited that XOCO is finally open and I look forward to many return trips!
