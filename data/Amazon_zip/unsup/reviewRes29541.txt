Went to the Chicago Diner the other day. Well, I guess I should first say that I'm not a vegetarian or a vegan so I'm not sure whether I should even be reviewing this restaurant! I did go there with a friend during one of their primetimes and it was just way too noisy for me. I couldn't hear my friend very well and for this simple reason, I would never go back. Our waitress was very attentive so there was definitely no problem there. My friend had the "reuben" and they said it wasn't as good as they had expected having seen this restaurant on "The Travel Channel." They said if they ever returned to the Chicago Diner they would just try something else. I stuck with one of the items on their menu that was "real" food and it was ok. I don't eat seitan or tofu so I would definitely never return!
