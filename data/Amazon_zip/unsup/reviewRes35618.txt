This is one of my favorite restaurants in town. Nearly every dish I've had from here has been extremely flavorful - especially anything duck and the soups are amazing. Then add the fact that the service is very friendly and that the prices are beyond reasonable, and you've got a winner. Can't think of many other restaurants in town where you can absolutely stuff everyone at a table of four with food as good as this for around $30. BYOB is a plus too.
