Walked in this place by complete accident: I had planned on going to the SOUPBOX. Instead, the fried chicken sandwich board, and a friendly looking crowd inside, were enough to lure me in. I sheepishly grabbed a menu, and stood on the side. Facinated, I crept toward the exceptionally friendly Derrick and Julia (Hi, Pia :) and fessed up, that I was a CRISP virgin. Intrigued, like that WILL N GRACE episode where neither of them could decide if a mutual love interest was str8 or gay, They BOTH lept in and offered suggestions. They are both adorable and I didnt want to side with either one, so I did exactly as they both suggested. HEAVEN! were the really meaty (read NOT fatty) plump, and THEE most flavorful chicken wings I have ever tasted! I asked for bread to sop up the sauce from the paper, and Julia suggested I order some fries or rings (next time, Pia) instead, I lapped it right up! I also ordered the BAD BOY BUDDHA, with beef and just WOW! I have never felt so satisfied eating so "healthily" (just like Derrick suggested). I was eating just so I could taste the delicous flavors.  I would CHECK PLEASE this place and LIKE them on fb. And Ill def'ly be back! BEST WINGS HANDS DOWN IN CHICAGO!
