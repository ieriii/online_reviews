I had some really good and affordable food here. We got a bunch of things to share in one of their cute booths - falafel sandwich (yum!), lentil soup (not quite as good as I'd heard), rice with tabouleh, and stuff from the salad bar (so good - some completely delicious filled green tomatoes (?), grape leaves, and so on). I'll go back sometime when I'm in the neighborhood, though it's not the best I've had in Chicago.
