Piece was very good, but then again who am I to judge.....I like Pizza Hut. I got there on a Tuesday night before the rush which was good. Ordered a medium spinach, bacon and black olive pizza and it was HUGE. I had plenty to take home. I forgot my ID (my stupid fault) :/ so I wasn't able to try any of their beers and the guy at the door marked my hand in SHARPIE with a big dumb ass X that was hard as hell to wash off. Really????? I would definitely come back WITH my ID.
