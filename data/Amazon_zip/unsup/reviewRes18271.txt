The Bad Apple has impressed me a bit more. I went there for a first date and it was nice. We split the trio of mini burgers (we got the waygu, the Elvis' Last Supper, and one I forget, doh) which I don't even think they have anymore. The burgers were better. Cooked to order and juicy. The beer selection is nice and affordable. The fries were good. I went back another time with J. He got the Elvis' Last Supper and I got a burger that wasn't very memorable but not bad. Again, the burgers were a good quality and tasty. Still not as good as Kuma's but not nearly the wait! :) He got the chipotle flavored fries and there was nothing "sweet" about them...only heat. Maybe too spicy for his taste. I was a little upset with the service this time....we had the bartender serving us until halfway through our meal...the switch was never explained and there was a while in there where really no one was taking care of us.
