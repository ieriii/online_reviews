Sunda's atmosphere was amazing! My first thought when I walked in was "this place is beautiful". It's worn hardwood floors and eclectic dcor give it a very classy and trendy feel. The seating is unique. It has the standard dark wood tables, but also has long narrow and high bar style tables and seating. It also has long couches paired with wooden chairs. The service was great! Our server was adorable. He was friendly and attentive, and also was willing to be playful with us. He was quick to bring refills and clear away unused dishes. He also was happy to give recommendations.  The food was great. I got the New York Strip sandwich while my friends got the sushi. It was delicious. It was also a smaller portion, so there was no worry about over eating. My friends think the sushi was a little expensive. However, I feel that the price of my sandwich was very reasonable.  I highly recommend Sunda. I would also recommend a reservation. It really filled up before we went.
