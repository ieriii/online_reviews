I thought this place was nice. Stayed here for 4th of July weekend last summer because I had family in town and we didn't want to mess with the public transportation after all of the firework madness. The location was good, it is right on the river. It does take some walking to get to most touristy locations, but if you're that lazy then TAKE A CAB. Anytime you are downtown you should be prepared to walk anyway. It is practically across the street from Harry Caray's, and the bar downstairs has a nice little courtyard to enjoy a smoke in. I found the concierge very helpful and prepared with a train schedule to get me back to the 'burbs when I was ready to check out. There is an Einstein Bagels a couple of blocks away that is convenient for breakfast.
