I always thought the best Vietnamese food was when my mom, dad or grandparents would cook dinner...Sorry family! Tank Noodle has won my heart and stomach. I have tried so many items off their menu and this is truly the only place you want to eat Vietnamese food at. I'm from Southern California where there is a large Viet population and a Viet neighborhood (Aka Little Saigon). Who would have thought that I would have to come to Chicago to find best Viet restaurant?
