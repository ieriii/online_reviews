This review is for the catering service offered at Nuevo Leon. I chose Nuevo Leon for catering because the food is good and the price is reasonable however the delivery and service was terrible. They called me three days before the event to inform me that they could not deliver because they had another event and there would be a conflict in time. I asked to speak to the manager because we had a big event and we were not only having the food delivered but I was also paying for servers. Besides my signed contract stated delivery and servers so. The manager did not call. Instead another server called and said not to worry that the food would be delivered. Well on the day of the event the food was supposed to be served at 5:00 so I imagined they would get there before to set up. Time passed I called and they said they were on their way. Then they called and asked for directions. 5:30 and no food and hungry guest. They arrived around 5:45. Did a sloppy set up. Ran out of plates and cutlery. It was horrible. The servers looked sweaty and sloppy too. Again this review is for the catering only. The food is good but their service gets THUMBS DOWN!!!
