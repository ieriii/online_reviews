Be ready to wait, until the fad has ended. The brewed beer there is okay nothing special, or needing to come back for more. The service was good, but the food was eh! Nothing really stood out, they have the same bar food type choices as any other of these higher end bars. With a few novelty items on the menu. Like i said you go here once, and you really don't need to go back.
