What a treat! Dining at Frontera was toppermost of our must-do list for our weekend visit and it did not disappoint at all! We started with a couple Spring Green Bloody Marys (WOW - we even make these at home, they're so good) and the sunfish ceviche appetizer. Just divine, would definitely order that again, A++. For my brunch entree I had the skirt steak tacos - the beans on the side were fantastic, with a smoked pork taste. The steak and tortillas were nice but I'd probably try something else next time, it was good but didn't really "shake my soda", as they say. The guy had chicken enchiladas in a mole poblano, it was very filling and definitely rocked his world. I don't know how we ate all that food plus the green bloody marys (Maria Verde?!) but we left Frontera very happy! Thank you Rick Bayless - another trip to Frontera, and also a meal at Topolo, are both on our list for the next trip.
