I had been here a few times and was a bit underwhelmed by their pizza by the slice, but after hearing suggestions that you need to order a fresh pizza (so f'n obvious!), we gave this place a try and I am glad I did. We ordered a pan style pizza with sausage it was excellent. The pizza itself was extremely fresh and loaded with nice flavorful chunks of sausage. Took the leftovers with me on the long flight to Stockholm.
