I came here because of my friend's recommendation. I think this place is good. I went there on Saturday 8 o'clock morning and the sore was almost packed. I had SPAM omelette, and my parents had salmon omelette and king's french toast. They are all good, but maybe I was not that hungry so I could not say it was amazing. I like their colorful juice photos so I tried banana and orange juice. It is ok. I'll try something special if I go there next time.
