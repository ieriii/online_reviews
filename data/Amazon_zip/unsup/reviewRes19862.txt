Although I liked The Gage, I wouldn't make a special trip to dine there. The Gage was a convenient meeting place near my friends' office (& Mil Park & The Art Institute). If you're in the area and looking for a moderately upscale place to lunch or dine - then, by all means check it out.  Service was outstanding, very proper and polite - almost formal. I only had a couple apps - a pint of shrimp and the asparagus, both good although the later had a bit too much butter.
