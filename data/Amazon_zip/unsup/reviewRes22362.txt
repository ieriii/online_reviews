I came with some friend and we ordered the sesame chicken, Peking style noodles, and the (super-d-duper spicy mother-load) boiled beef in spicy szechwan sauce. "Wow", is what I can say about their chicken. It melts in your mouth and it wasn't even soggy after half an hour. The noodles were very good, sorta "mushroomy" tasting & it reminded me of the Korean Jajangmyun noodles but less saucy and salty. As for the beef, oh wow, this dish is pretty big and it is so delicious! However, it is not MEANT for those who cannot take heat. It is literally covered in chili flakes! But all scary spiciness aside, the beef is very tender and it is served on top of cook Chinese cabbages with the spicy sauce (kinda looks like soup). Very glad we visited this place and this is the place for anyone who loves spicy food! Oh just a head up, the service might be a little slow but the food is worth the wait. After all, great tasting foods takes time to make!
