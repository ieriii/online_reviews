Yum, this place is amazing! We called ahead on a Saturday night to see how long the wait it for 4 and were told 30 minutes. We got there to find out the wait was really 1-1/2 hours so we decided to grab a few beers and then find another spot for dinner. The beer was delicious! Between the four of us we tried Cross of Gold, Iron Fist Pale Ale, Bottom Up Belgain Wit, Anti Hero IPA, Baracus and Triple Fist. They were all pretty good, but as a pretty girly beer drinker the Bottom Up Belgain Wit was probably my fav. We had seats at the bar for about 30 minutes and were getting ready to leave when the waitress flagged us down and said our table was next. We were seated in one of the booths right in front of the tv - yay, more good luck. We ordered the Pretzel and Sweet Potato Cakes for apps, both amazing. For our meal we were so full from the apps my husband and I split the Workingman Burger and also a side ceasar. The burger was cooked perfectly and was juicy. Our friends got the fish and chips, and even my husband, who doesn't like fish, was digging on them. Definitely worth the wait! Just don't come too hungry.
