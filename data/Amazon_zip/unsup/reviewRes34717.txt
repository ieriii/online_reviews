I've been to Sultan's Market now a half dozen times in the last six weeks and have found the food to be consistently fresh, tasty, and filling. The falafel sandwich is a great value - a pita stuffed with hummus, Jerusalem salad, and falafel - so good. It can be ordered to three levels of spiciness. I like it extra spicy. Today, I tried the spinach pie. Fresh out of the oven, it was absolutely delicious! (kg) The hummus is fresh, too, with not too much garlic or other errant spices and a nice creamy consistency. In addition to having lots of vegetarian and vegan options, they have lamb and chicken shawerma, a salad bar with dolmas, roasted veggies, and other delights, and a coffee bar with a few sweets. Oh, and it's also a grocery store so you can purchase the comestibles necessary to make falafel and other Middle Eastern dishes at home. Note, it's cash only, but they have 'conveniently' installed a cash machine in case you forget. Highly recommended.
