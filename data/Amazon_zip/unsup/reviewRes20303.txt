I haven't eaten an actual meal here, so I'll just focus on my experience at the bar.  Simply put, top-notch! The bar has an extensive selection of scotch (my favorite libation) and a pretty formidable drink list. I had a glass of Laphraoig Quarter Cask and the Chicken Livers...excellent paring!  The Gage is great for a quick drink or a boozy afternoon on Michigan Ave.
