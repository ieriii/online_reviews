This is my all-time favorite casual middle eastern food restaurant. Their falafel is the best I've ever had - the chick pea mixture is the perfect consistency and they are delightfully fried crisp on the outside without a hint of greasiness. The falafel sandwich is made on delicious pita bread and has all the right ingredients. Their other food is great too. Rice and lentils, chicken shawarma, soups... you can't go wrong.
