Good Middle Eastern/Persian Fare, a little pricey but nice portions and Super Fast delivery make it a winner in my book, Good filet mignon skewer, Solid chicken skewer, and an Awesome Salmon skewer and im not a Salmon eater! Nice grilled veggies and plenty of rice, if your looking for good food and your willing to shell out some bucks, you won't be disappointed.
