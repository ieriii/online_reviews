Many people have difficulty with a lot of the rules at the Green Mill but they should all shut up. The reason that I say that is its brings more to the event. The Green Mill does not care what you look like and they don't care to hear talk on the cell phone. I recommend that you go for the music or do not go. There is a reason that this place has been around for long time it is a lot of fun.
