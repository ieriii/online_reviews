Hands down my favorite sushi in all of Chicago... Some of the best salmon rolls I have had to date. Some of my favorites include (obviously) the salmon roll (sake), the honey roll (mmmmmm....), the thai stick, the spicy tako and spicy scallop rolls, the yellow jacket (mango!!!) and the double stack...a meal in itself! Ok, so I might as well say the whole menu. THe only complaint that I can come up with is no sashimi...although we are guilty for order a couple of extra rolls and eating them as pieces without the rice and seawood!! Can't go wrong.
