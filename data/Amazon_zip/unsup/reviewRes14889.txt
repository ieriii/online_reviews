3 time's a charm. i've been trying to get in here & monday night was the lucky night. only a half hour wait for a table. and an empty bar stool oh joy. i ordered the flight of beers so i could try them all. a golden ale, a light low-alcohol lunch brew, 2 pale ales (of course) and a nice choco-stout. i was surprised i liked the golden the best since i'm a belgian ale junkie. i ended up drinking triple karmeleit-a very generous pour-for $10. i will wait until the next round of brews. that's the beauty of a brew pub. we decided to stick with apps since we weren't too hungry. we had the meat plate with house cured ham, 2 kinds of german style sausage, and the best pork belly sashimi in truffle oil i've ever eaten. i'm still thinking about that fat melting in my mouth. then we got the applewood smoked wings which were perfect & served with a mound of outstanding potato salad with chunks of bleu cheese in it. delightful! and the mussels in bleu cheese cream sauce (we were told the chef loves bleu cheese. we love him/her) with cider, leeks & fuji apples. to DIE for. we had lots of sauce left over, so i took it home to make soup with it. too good to waste. ended with the beignets & mocha. unfortunately i spend a lot of time in new orleans & think the pastry chef should visit cafe du monde. they were very dense (should be airy & light) and very heavy on the cloves. they tasted like gingerbread, which i don't really like, but that did not seem to bother the staff or my partner. i did, however, like the mocha nip on the side. i LOVE the interior-gorgeous light fixtures, exposed brick, high ceilings, very clean lines. it's very uplifting in there & there's room for people to wait for their tables. i noticed a waiter even took drink orders in the wait area. the service is excellent. i am looking forward to eating my way through the menu. and walk home afterwards. i never imagined an actual brew pub would one day exist in my back yard. joy.
