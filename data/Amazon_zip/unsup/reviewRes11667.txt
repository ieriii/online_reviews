I have seriously had too much deep dish pizza lately; I almost forgot the joys of thin crust. The thin crust pizza here is fantastic. I like the white pizza, which is a blend of parmesan and mozzarella with garlic and olive oil. It's good with mushrooms and sausage OR spinach, mushrooms, and artichokes for you vegeterians out there. Their draught brews are pretty good, esp. the fruity Full Frontal. I just wish they had Chimay on draught. The decor is nothing special but it has a homey feel.
