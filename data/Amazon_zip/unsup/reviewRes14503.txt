This place is quite the gem! My boyfriend and I went there recently on a Saturday afternoon to grab a quick drink and some light food. Once we walked in, we realized that a light snack was not going to do it. Everything smelled amazing! We split the bruschetta, both ended up getting burgers- mine with bacon and bleu cheese, his with some special sauteed onions- they had a great selection of beers on tap, and I tried two new beers that I've never had before! The new beer that I liked best was a light belgian wheat- I think it was called golden cross or something, but either way, it was delicious, refreshing and perfect for the summer. I'm so glad we have places like this so close to the L. My life is better because of revolution brewery!
