3.5 I've been to some bars in L.A. where bartenders have told me they were inspired by the cocktails at Chicago's The Violet Hour. I've read some articles about this bar and it was my #1 cocktail bar I had to try. After dinner at Moto, we headed over and experienced a brief wait. It wasn't too terrible but some jerks were also waiting and causing a ruckus. It seems the three misters were drunk and/or high. And if we hadn't been let in at the right moment, I would have spoken to the bouncer as one of the house rules at the Violet Hour is not bringing anyone you wouldn't want at your mother's house for Sunday supper. These three were definitely not welcome guests. I lost track of them and perhaps they were let in after all. I saw someone with a baseball cap on and it was clearly against their house rules. Still, the Violet Hour speaks of a certain genteelness and charm. The highbacked chairs reminded me of the chairs on the Haunted Mansion ride at Disneyland. They afforded privacy and perhaps a few secrets were exchanged. Although they didn't entirely block your view. The booth next to our table was clearly on display and vice versa. The cocktail menu is short but the book of liquors was quite heavy. I opted for one of their signature cocktails since we weren't at the bar. I tend to like to sit at the bar and chat with the bartender to get a custom cocktail. The one I ordered from their list was fantastic. Alas, we only had time for one before we disappeared into the night. But considering the pub crawl we had the night before, it was probably for the best.
