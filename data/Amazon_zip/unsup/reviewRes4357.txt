Ummmm, you simply have never been to, or don't live in Chicago if you have not yet been to the Green Mill. People, The Green Mill IS Chicago. Overpriced? Yes. Smoky? Yes. Dodgy area? Yes. (Which is part of the charm, by the way- Would it be the same jazz club if it were in Naperville??? NO.) Listen. I will simply say this. Assuming you haven't been there already, if you want to experience something that is quintessentially Chicago- a place that embodies it's people, it's culture, it's SOUL, you must go to The Green Mill.
