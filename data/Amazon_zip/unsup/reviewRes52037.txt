Sausage supreme deep dish was amazing. Wife and I split that, a house salad and had a few cold beers and were beyond stuffed. Neat atmosphere. If you want to make your mark on the place with grafitti, bring a container of whiteout. Supposively there is a Walgreen's right around the corner from the place. They don't provide it. Deep dish does take nearly an hour to bake though, so give yourself plenty of time.
