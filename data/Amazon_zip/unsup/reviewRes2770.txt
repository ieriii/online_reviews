Although the staff was extremely friendly and accommodating, I did not have a great experience at Tru. It had all of the ambiance of fine dining, but none of the flavors that go along with it. My dining partner and I walked in and were immediately greeted by staff and escorted into a waiting area. The dining room, although mostly full, was silent and remained so for most of the evening. The atmosphere was very uptight. That said, the waiter and the rest of the staff was attentive and helpful throughout the meal. My partner had the lobster; it was a little tough and bland. I had the jidori slow cooked chicken and it wasn't just bland, it was bad. The chicken was rubbery and had no flavor. Since the menu lacked anything interesting or risk-taking, I assumed it would be the basics cooked to perfection. Unfortunately, it was not. There wasn't anything about Tru that lived up to its hype. Tru is a place you'd take your parents to show that that you have a real job now and are no longer eating ramen for dinner. It's not a place you'd take someone looking for interesting flavors or food combinations.
