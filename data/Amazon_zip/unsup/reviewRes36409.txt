This is totally a brunch place, nothing more than that, and it is a bit pricey for a brunch too.Also the parking is limited you have to pay for the meter parking which is $0.25 for 15 minutes, so you better have some quaters handy. Meli's cafe has a greek style appeal to it since it is located in the heart of "Greektown." The menu selection is all about breakfast food and lunch you can get a nice sandwich or a savory omelette. The pankcakes look good, but I didn't try it. I had order the denver omelette "huge," and it had ham and green peppers and cheese all the fixing I like in an omelette, and it came with a side of toast too. It was very delicious. The service was nice, nice as in nothign else better to say about it. The waitress was very friendly and I was sastified with their food and service, I would return to that restaurant only I would walk there not drive, because parking is a huge pain in the rear.
