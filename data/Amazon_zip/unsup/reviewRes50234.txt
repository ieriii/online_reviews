I liked this place. The food was tasty and the service was good but not for the price. $80 for 3 people to eat brunch is pretty steep. This is Andersonville not the Gold Coast. This is a southern style cafe. I don't remember anything being this expensive when I lived in the south. For about $16 I got a what was their version of an eggs benedict which were served with popovers instead of english muffins and a tiny crabcake. My husband's shrimp and grits were good but the portion size was very small as were the shrimp. Again, the food was tasty and I'd try it once but it was way too expensive for a basic brunch, "southern" or not.
