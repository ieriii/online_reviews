Wow! What a beer list and the prices too! I'm told that there are no beer specials ever b/c the prices are kept low. This is like a less crowded Kuma's where you can actually hear your conversation and not have to listen to heavy metal in the background. I ordered the Red Spruce Spingsteen - really good except for the bun. ATTENTION - SERVE ALL BURGERS ON A PRETZEL ROLL! Noticed on the way out that there is a side bar with shuffleboard! Staff were friendly and attentive. I will be back! P.S. Get rid of all the for sale metal art on the walls - $3000 for something that looks like it came out of a junkyard? Come on.
