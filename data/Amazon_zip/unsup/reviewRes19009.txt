I went there a few weekends ago for a birthday party. We had about 20 people with us which is hard for the staff of any restaurant so I don't want to complain about the service too much. One thing I will say is that we only had 1 waitress so we waited and waited for drinks. We are a big drinking crowd and we would have spent a lot more money had they given us another server. We ordered a bunch of appetizers and everything was just "OK" the food came out and everyone at the table got their burgers and nobody was really impressed. It was just OK. I will say that I loved the fries though. After dinner we went into the bar area which is so much nicer and well decorated that the dark side room we were in for dinner. I loved the hi tables with the benches - everyone got a huge kick out of them which was fun. Here is the part where I am going to sound old - but I swear I'm not!! I love to go out and have fun - I prefer to stand instead of sit that is my personality but this place was SOOOOO loud it got to the point where I couldn't even stand it anymore. It wasn't loud because of guests it was loud because of the music - it was so loud after 2 drinks we all had to leave. I have never left a place before because it was too loud, ever! We didn't want to leave because we loved the benches and it wasn't crowded but honestly the insides of my ear drums were starting to pierce with pain. There are loud bars and then there was this - a totally new level of loud. Maybe that is why the place was empty? The whole gang went to the bar next door which was just an average bar but we were so happy when we got there and could hear the music and each other talking. We even saw some people in there that had been at the Bad Apple beforehand. New place, maybe they just need to figure out the kinks? Average food.
