More people need to go here, and then yelp it with 5 stars - because 4-star average is an insult. My room mate's colleague at work told him that he grew up in logan square and that this place needed to be checked out. so a bunch of us went there last saturday and it blew our minds. Really amazing stuff - have a cup of Cuban coffee (some amazing espresso) while you wait for a table. BYOB - check. $6 for a pitcher of mojito mix - bring your own rum and make your own while you eat! I almost forgot - they put MINT in their ice water - extremely refreshing. Although as my friends realized - those with less sophisticated palettes can't enjoy it! HAHAHAHA
