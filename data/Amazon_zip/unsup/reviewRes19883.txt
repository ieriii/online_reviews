Okay, I'll admit it. I've never been inside coast so I can't really judge ambiance or service or anything like that. Since they deliver to my door, I have no reason to leave my apartment when I want to eat some decent sushi. Everything we've ever ordered has been delicious and fresh tasting. The delivery service takes generally somewhere between 45-60 minutes, so keep that in mind when ordering. Also, they always magically give us the right amount of chopsticks for the people eating... I don't know how the do it!
