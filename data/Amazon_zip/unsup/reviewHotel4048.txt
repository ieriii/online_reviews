This hotel is HUGE. Stayed 3 nights for a convention and there must have been at least 7 other ones going on at the same time.  PROS: - room decor is decent - beautiful atrium in the main lobby - great staff: professional and courteous. Most notably, Tamika Y. from the catering group who really went above and beyond to help me when I was in a bind, and Eric from the business center who was just great and also went above and beyond in helping me take care of my shipments. - very centrally located in DT Chicago - room service food was pretty damn good AND quick; 20 minutes tops and I ordered twice. CONS: - there was a union strike with the housekeeping staff which made the atmosphere generally uncomfortable and ps I hope what I read abt the Hyatt's treatment of their staff was untrue! - I echo another Yelper's review here: my room was right next to the elevators too and wow...the best way I can think of describing the noise is to think of planes flying overhead ... It woke me up a couple of times ... - the bathroom smelled ... Like ... Mildew ... YUCK. The tub had black stains in it, super yuck. - the water pressure in the bathroom sink was annoyingly low. - the bed was neither here nor there, not the most comfy but not terrible - the wifi in room is a friken joke. Connection is intermittent and slow. You receive a code every 24 hrs and if you lost that code you're screwed. Oh and it ain't cheap either. OVERALL: - it wouldn't be my first pick for a hotel but it's a decent place and I would stay there again...sans elevator noise and pick lines.
