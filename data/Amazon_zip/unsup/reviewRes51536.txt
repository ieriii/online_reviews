I've only been here once but I will return again. The service wasn't excellent but it was good enough. The waitress was a little curt and harried but we were waited on quickly, the food and bill came quickly, and all 5 of us got exactly what we asked for so that's good enough for me! The food didn't have remarkable taste to it, but I was satisfied with my tostadas and everyone else enjoyed their burritos and nachos and at the end we were stuffed, with a lot left over to bring home, and the bill was only $36! (We did not order drinks though, just food). If I were to put all my emphasis on the quality of food and service than I'd probably give them a 3, but since I generally focus a lot on the price and quantity of the food as well, they get bumped to a 4.
