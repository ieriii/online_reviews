Here are some words to describe L&E: Pretentious. Curt. Small portions. Over-priced. Crowded. Hipster. I've been there a few times and was totally disappointed with the food each visit. It's super salty (as at least one other reviewer notes), and just uninspired. I understand the concept of small portions and high-ish prices when the food is excellent/sustainable/local etc, but there is nothing special about the menu. My friend got some kind of soft shell crab dish and it was fried in what I swear to god tasted exactly like McDonald's fish fillet batter. Maybe they've worked out a trade with the McDondald's down the street to reuse their old oil.  I think L&E should scrap the restaurant and focus on cocktails & whiskey. You can do way better over at Telegraph around the corner for your meal.
