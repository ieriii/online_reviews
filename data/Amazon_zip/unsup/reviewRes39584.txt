Ahh, the experience is worth it. Never-mind if some of the 22 dishes of random fixins were somewhat palatable, the choices make it your own fault if you don't enjoy this place. I mean YOU cook it, YOU mix it together, if you walk away unsatisfied, slap YOURself. This was a unique and fun place to someone who has never had Korean BBQ before. Next time I'll be sure to come with a group of people and avoid their unappetizing appetizers (soft shell crab was strange). I'd give this place four stars if it didn't print out my full credit card number on the receipt, shame on you San Soo Gab San, respect my privacy.
