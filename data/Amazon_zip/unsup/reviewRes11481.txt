Great Pizza - Check Great Beer - Check Great service - Check Interesting ingredients - Check(Mashed potatoes on pizza? Learn about it!) The only downfall to Piece is that its always super crowded..but that just confirms the quality of the product they are slingin. I'd suggest going during "happy hour"..Design your own individual pizza for a reasonable price and there is usually open seating.
