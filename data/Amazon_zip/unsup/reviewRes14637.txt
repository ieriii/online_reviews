Great cuban cafe. I've been here only once and had a cubano and some yuca con mojo. I used to live in south florida so I'm always excited to find a good restaurant in the midwest to get my cuban fix. I tried my friend's tofu sandwich, which had a creole black bean sauce on it and was likewise very tasty. They have a lot of other interesting options on the menu; i look forward to going back and trying some of their other vegetarian options as well as their sweet plantains.  The place is tiny and feels like a proper hole-in-the-wall. Which is exactly where I expect to find great food for a great price!
