Longman & Eagle is good, but not that good. NOT michelin worthy and I am still in shock about that. The beer and whiskey selections are awesome, their burger is good, the wild boar is good, the pretzel is good...I have had a ton of things there and they have all been good. AND JUST GOOD. Don't go there expecting to have your socks totally knocked off--it will not happen. And if you are acting like it just did your giving into the hype that is L&E.
