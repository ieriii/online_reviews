Since I mentioned Rick Bayless in my earlier review, it is only fitting to write my experience at Frontera Grill. I visited the restaurant about a few months ago. The place was extremely busy on weekend, and the walk-in wait time was well over an hour. Love the Ceviche Trio. It was a nice and refreshing start before the main entree. The fish special was fresh and cooked perfectly. The flavor was sublet and well balanced. Unfortunately, I was too full from the snacks next door at XOCO. I can't wait to come back for more. Too bad I didn't get to meet the Top Chef Master.
