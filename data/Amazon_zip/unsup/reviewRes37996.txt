Hands down best mussels and frites in Chicago. I can't comment on any other food here because I love their mussels and frites so much that I can't bring myself to order anything else. If I were to go for breakfast, I would still have to order the mussels and frites. And beer. The beer list can't be beat. The ambiance is also fantastic - very cozy. Definitely one of my favorite places.
