FRESH seafood!!!!! The fish dishes are amazing!! The name had deceived me for years and I always passed it up not wanting to wait for a table at a "diner" that appeared to specialize in cereal. I've peered through the window and seen the rows of cereal boxes on the wall and kept walking. Boy was I wrong! I hate to admit it but I sort of only tried this place because I saw it on the Food Network one night and realized that it was more of a seafood restaurant than a "diner". I had the sea bass and she had the scallops. Both were absolutely fantastic! I sort of want to try the breakfast now but I've seen crowds there in the AM. before and avoided it. I'm not a fan of long waits for breakfast, so we'll see. Oh and by the way, since Glen's was featured on the food network, you pretty much have to make reservations now if you want to get in for dinner. We showed up without them and they sat us at the bar but that was OK because the bartender was perfect and very helpful and knowledgeable about the menu. They make a mean bloody mary too! It's a little pricey but I'll be back to try the other fish dishes.
