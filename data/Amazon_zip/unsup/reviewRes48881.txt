I know it's not the greatest attitude to have, but I like to look for faults in establishments that have consistently rave reviews. That being said, I was blown away by the Publican. My girlfriends and I went for brunch and as usual, one of the girls was running late. Given how crowded the restaurant was, we were expecting a backlash from the staff, but the casual and friendly employees happily pointed us towards the bar tables and promised to seat us when she arrived. The decor of the restaurant is cozy and natural, reminiscent of an airy summer cabin. Most of the seating is communal, with several long tables wrapping through the restaurant. Smaller tables and booths are available, but the arrangement is done is such a way that the communal seating is surprisingly intimate. The brunch menu was mouth watering, as someone who grew up in Milwaukee with a grandmother who was an amazing German cook, any menu that places an emphasis on meat, beer and sauerkraut is on my good side. I must just say that I have never seen weisswurst on a menu outside of Germany and I was beyond ecstatic! The portions are hearty, the ingredients fresh and unique, and you will definitely leave feeling full but not in an uncomfortable way. I highly HIGHLY recommend the bloody mary with brunch, it was one of the freshest and well-seasoned bloodies I have ever had, which is saying a lot. All in all, I can't say enough how much I loved Publican and I cannot wait to go back. Despite the outrageous hype, the restaurant is surprisingly casual and unassuming. The staff and ambiance gives off the vibe of a local neighborhood bar, where everyone gives you a smile and makes you feel at home.
