This was my first meal in Chicago. My friends and I were STARVED after our 4 hour flight, so it probably wouldn't have been hard to satisfy our hunger...but sadly, we were not impressed. We ordered a medium Supreme deep dish pizza and the total came out to be about $26. For the price, the pizza did not meet my expectations. Firstly, it was Friday evening so the place was PACKED. luckily, we knew of this and had ordered take out. However, the girl that helped me at the take out counter was NOT friendly at all. no hint of a smile, and when I asked for plates and utensils, did not seem pleased at my request. The pizza itself was not impressive. the crust at the bottom was a little soggy. I didnt taste much sauce. I mostly tasted was the chewiness of the cheese. There was supposed to be sausage, but only little bits of it could be tasted. (my friend kept asking "wait..wheres the sausage?!") The crust at the side was crispier than the soggy bottom, so that was good, but my second piece, I didnt end up eating it, so maybe it wasnt very delish. :P if my friends were going to chicago for vacay and asked me for my opinion, i wouldnt suggest this place. i would say: LOU MALNATI'S FTW!!!
