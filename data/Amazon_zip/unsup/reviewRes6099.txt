Went here for lunch today with the wife. Here's what we had: * (chicken) Pate Vasi; way good, ate more than I should have * pork belly; I should come here for lunch @ least once a week * farro salad; wife's pick, not bad goat cheese really kicked it up * Uvo in Raviolo; egg/spinach in big ravioli, busting that yolk, mmm Comparing it to other similar joints in town, we'd stil rank Girl & the Goat 1st, but this may beat out Purple Pig. Wife commented on how PP seemed saltier and pricier. It's a tie for me based on location (since they're cross-town)
