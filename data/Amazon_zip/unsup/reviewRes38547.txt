Besides the 45 minute wait, Giordano was a pretty awesome Chicago pizza experience. Piping hot deep crust with fresh veggies, sausage, and tons of gooey mozzarella. Crust is crisp on the outside and warm and soft inside. It was so good I actually ate half of an XL which has to be at least 5000 calories. I then inevitably passed out on the subway to Wrigley, succumbing to the food coma.
