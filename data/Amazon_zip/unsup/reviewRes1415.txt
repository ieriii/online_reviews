Heaven on earth. I've made hour-and-a-half long commutes to wait in line for twenty minutes and it's so incredibly worth it. I'm always a fan of owner-diner interaction, and Doug stands front and center, taking orders and mixing it up with the guests. Over the years, I've managed to introduce Hot Doug's to dozens of my friends, and I've never had a single complaint. Great sausages, great decor, and a consistently updated website with their amazing specials. Oh, and the best testament to the place: I bought a T-shirt.
