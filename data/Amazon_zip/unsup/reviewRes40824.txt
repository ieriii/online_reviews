I've been avoiding this review for a long time to give Tank a fair shot. I've been here about 3-4 times in the last few years. This place is way overrated. I hate to rag on my people but probably the worse Vietnamese food I've had in a long time. Spring Rolls were soggy, flavorless. A train wreck. The Banh Xeo was too thin. My gf's Pho was watered down and tasted like they used instant Pho powder if there is such a thing. I ordered the porkchop with egg cake. The only good thing I can say is they got their broken rice down. The porkchop was skinny and dry. I get why people go here. Step inside on any given night you, don't see many Asians in here eating. Shouldn't that be a tell tale sign? I suppose if you've never had Vietnamese food before and this is the first place you went it would probably blow your mind, I get that. I suppose if you don't hang out in Uptown on a regular basis and you're scared to walk east of the Argyle redline, I get that. I suppose since it's on broadway, well lit, big open windows gives it a more welcoming vibe, I get that. But for god sake, step outside your comfort zone for once! This place is like the Joy-Yees of Argyle if you know what I mean. Perhaps worse cause I love the drinks at Joy-Yees...
