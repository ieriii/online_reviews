Fantastic restaurant right on Michigan Ave across from Millennium Park. Our service was impeccable and the eclectic menu items add to the feel. From the House Poutine and Escargot Soup to the Roast Saddle of Elk and Tuna all items were prepared and presented very well. We ordered family style and split the entree's. Dress ranged from T-Shirts and Ball Caps (out of place) to well dressed diners. With a Bar/Party room downstairs it is a great place to stop after a day in the Park or before a Concert at Grant Park. Highly Recommended.
