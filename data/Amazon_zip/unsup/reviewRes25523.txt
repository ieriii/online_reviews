This spot in the heart of Greek Town is a little gem. Their service is awesome and their food is good. One of my favorites is their lemon cream of chicken with rice. I come here especially for this soup. There's something about it and the taste is just perfect. They also have a bakery of some Greet sweets, and they do an amazing job with presentation and taste. It's also not that pricey, so you can surely have a good meal at a decent price.
