Came here with a large group unannounced one evening - needless to say we had to wait a while to get seated given the busyness on a Tuesday. Had a great time here - the ambiance had a great feel to it and is definitely somewhere to come just hang out and socialize. In terms of food and drink, the cocktails are fantastic and the food was really good too. I had their Whiskey Sours all night, and what really caught me was the use of egg white in the drink. Even after about a month since being there, I can still taste the sweet flavour of the drink when I think about it. Highly recommended for an intimate occasion - along with Curio, the lounge downstairs that is for the most part unadvertised.
