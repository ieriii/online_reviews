Great Friday night at the Gage!! I had been here before for lunch and for drinks but it had been quite a while. A girlfriend and I planned to meet for drinks and ended up staying for over two hours and having a really good meal. It was really crowded when we got there sans reservation hoping to snag a spot in the bar. I was immediately worried that we'd have to wonder for a new drink destination. After about 10 minutes hovering around the bar area, a server approached us and offered to bring us drinks. She also said that she had reserved us a table where she had just dropped a check. As if we weren't already impressed, she gave us periodic updates as the people paid and were getting ready to leave. We settled into our much sought after table and spent the next 30-45 min just catching up. Our server was so patient with us. We didn't feel rushed to make decisions but our glasses were never empty. We ordered some light bites: chickpea fritters, rabbit salad with arugula and curried lobster with quinoa. Everything was great, especially the lobster. For dessert, we shared a heavenly chocolate pudding/mousse with caramel and cinnamon ice cream. Total bill with two glasses of pinot noir and two beers: $98. Not bad.
