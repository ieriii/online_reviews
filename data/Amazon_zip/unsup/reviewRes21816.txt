It's a classic. I bring out of town friends and relatives here just because it is a drive-in, and a fun, retro one at that....And they still have the best chocolate malt I've ever had, even if it is kinda pricey. Go there at least once. That said, you can get better fries and dogs for cheaper at at least 2 other places, though they aren't drive-ins with huge winking wieners on top either.
