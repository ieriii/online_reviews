Maybe I should go back for dinner before I give a rating and review but their brunch was good. If you like crawfish and or gay waiters, this is the place for you. First off, you get a side of Beignets for free. I had some sort of weird biscuits and gravy but it was brown gravy and red sausage. Not exactly what I was expecting and I was a little disappointed when I saw it but it ended up being really good. I kept seeing other plates of food which looked delicious but I have no idea what they were. Will need to go back for the baby back ribs and then give a full review. The bottom line is that it's a really nice place and it isn't very crowded so it's worth trying and will probably be better than M Henry but without the wait. UPDATE: Fried Chicken night is on Tuesdays. I wouldn't recommend missing that.
