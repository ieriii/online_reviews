Located in Chicago's Greektown, Meli Cafe & Juice Bar is a, well, cafe and juice bar. This is going to be another one of those reviews where I don't remember what any of the things that were ordered are, and will most likely call something different than what it actually is. I want to state up front that we were actually here as sort of a warm-up for our stomachs because we had reservations for Next: El Bulli later that night (full review coming!). Because of the nature of our meal, we probably didn't get a representative experience of what this place is about. We basically showed up, took like three bites of whatever we ordered, and then ran off into the wind.
