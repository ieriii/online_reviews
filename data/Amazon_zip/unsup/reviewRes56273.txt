Had Simply It delivery for the first time and was very impressed. Their food was packaged very well to prevent spillage, the portions were huge, and we got a complimentary fruit assortment that we weren't expecting including two apples, oranges, and grapes. Fisherman's Pho Soup is very reasonable for the price and delicious! I can't wait to dine here again.
