Whenever the husband and I get a deep fried chicken crave, we pick up the phone and call Crisp. Our usual includes: half of the Plain Jane (which is similar to plain fried chicken), half of the Seoul Sassy (has a kick!), and a Seoul Steak Bowl (which is white rice with bulgogi placed on top). The Steak Bowl comes with this delicious sauce that's tangy, a little sweet, not really sure what it is, but it is GOOD. I'm guessing hot chili pepper sauce with something else with it. We eat our Plain Janes using this sauce. Overall, this place it awesome!!
