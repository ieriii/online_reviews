This place was great. They are pushing the boundaries of food and doing an excellent job. The overall energy of the place was nice - however, the atmosphere itself left something to be desired. The staff was friendly and interactive and I know the experience is supposed to be all about the food, but it wouldn't hurt to clean up the place just a little. As for the food, each dish was unique and exciting - and mostly delicious. It's hard not to compare Schwa to Alinea because of technique, presentation, buzz and general ideas... and it is right up there with the best. The overall experience, while factoring in the actual space and price of the larger course, I am giving it 4 stars. If it were based solely on food, I would give it a 5... but the atmosphere is a big part of your experience, and when talking price points of over $100 per person, price is a significant factor as well. Definitely go to this place!
