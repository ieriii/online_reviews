I would give Wilde 4 stars for the ambiance and the food, but I am a bit bothered by an experience I had there.  I have been going to Wilde since it opened, sometimes once a week. I live in the neighborhood and it is an easy place to pop into. A female, older waitress (name not given) served my group of 6 people whom had never been there. We ate, had some drinks and then left paying with both cash and credit. I used my card to pay the remainding balance and left some tip on the card. I left another $50.00 in cash at the table. This was a 35% tip she received.  Upon leaving with my guests, the waitress came out of the facility and told me that I did not tip her enough. I was overwhelmed with this! Who comes out and does that. I remembered that the cash was placed in an odd spot at the table and she probably did not see it. I walked back in and showed her the $50.00 and then told her that I thought she was completely out of line asking a patron for more tip.  Bottom line.....we don't have to leave you any tip if we do not want to. The fact that I left you a 35% tip and you came out in front of my guests was crazy. I have taken business clients to Wilde and would have been mortified if she would have pulled this with them.  I am officially an ex-wilde patron simply because of this. I have read a lot about the staff there and I hope management/owners are looking at these.
