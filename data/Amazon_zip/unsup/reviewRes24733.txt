Met a friend from out of town, and decided to go ahead and order the non-luxury tasting menu. It was very good, everything had great flavor, although portion size was borderline small.  Thing is, it's tapas. And for $135 pp with a couple of drinks and dessert not included in the tasting menu, it was a laughably steep price. This did include tax and tip. Not running back, except maybe for brunch, which I understand is far more reasonable.
