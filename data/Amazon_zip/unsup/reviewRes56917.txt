Pizza was really good...BUT I had my wallet pickpocketed out of my handbag here on Saturday night along with a handful of other people. Apparently the same happened last weekend too. Its being targeted by thieves as its popular and so busy.PLEASE be careful with your belongings. My pizza ended up costing me over $4000. Seriously!
