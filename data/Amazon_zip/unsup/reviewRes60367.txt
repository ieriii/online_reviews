I had a recent 18 hour quick in quick out visit to Chicago. Upon arriving at 8pm I had plans to order in from Gino's East. However, everyone from the airport, cab ride, and hotel front desk all insisted I try Giordano's instead. As I am from NY... I find I am rather picky about the pizza I eat and rather snobby about it as well. My plan in ordering this pizza, as I must admit, was to say for once and for all that Chicago Deep Dish had nothing on NY, brick oven, thin crust. Well, my plan was ruined. The pizza was great. Now I am not going to compare and apple to an orange and say that which is better... NY or Chicago because the truth is they are completely different. But... this pizza did not disappoint. I ordered the deep dish cheese with mushrooms. The sauce was amazing. You could really taste the different ingredients that went into it and the boldness of the tomatoes was very evident. I hate watered down bland sauces and this was anything but that. The cheese, despite being delivered, was still nice and hot and melted. The crust, while not having that slightly fire roasted taste I so love, had a good quality of it's own. It was crunchy and flaky and had good flavor. Overall, I was very happy with this pizza.. and if I ever return to Chicago... I would definitely order from them again.
