The lobby is absolutely gorgeous and the remodeled rooms are decorated nicely but... rooms are also teeny-tiny and kinda oddly laid out (we had two front doors on a really small room - I can't imagine it used to be 2 micro rooms but maybe so?). What really ruined it for me was the paper thin walls, or maybe the other guests were just REALLY loud the weekend we stayed there? I could barely sleep thanks to all of the noise from other rooms, the hall, oh and the el rumbling below our window.
