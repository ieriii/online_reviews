This is my place of choice for oysters on the half shell and a bit of old school Chicago. I always sit in the bar side and belly up to the bar. The servers are on point and will be at your beckon call.  You can half your oysters, chowder and guys with pinkie rings dining on the same thing as you are. Interesting as they were eating them on crackers??? Is that a real way to eat a raw oyster? Seemed so funny to me. But they must have been regulars as all the servers knew them and they kept the oysters a-flowing.  I also ordered like a rookie as almost every guy after me ordered the gumbo. It must rock here. I just had the boring new england chowder....they must have been laughing at me.
