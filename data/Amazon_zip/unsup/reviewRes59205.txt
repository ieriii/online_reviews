This place is awesome! I would suggest getting the Peking Duck meal that comes with soup or noodles. I got the soup with also fried rice which they make out of the duck. They also bring these breads that are half folded to where you can insert your duck meat with a little vegetables and sauce to dip in. I only been here once but I would go again when in this area. This was suggested to me by my friends friend who lives in the area and boy was he right. The best Peking Duck and the fried skin was so tasty! A must have for anyone who likes duck.
