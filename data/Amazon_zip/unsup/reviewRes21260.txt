This is a great place to go with a big group of friends on Thursday nights for half-priced margaritas. The food is pretty good. There guacamole is fantastic. The ceviche is delicious. And the shrimp tacos are decent. I don't know if I'd try to go here for a low key dinner, though. It gets pretty noisy, since the place is small and full of people. The servers are a little on the pushy side. I found the trick is to not make eye contact and they'll leave you alone.
