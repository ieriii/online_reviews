2 girls in from out of town, both wine and cheese lovers. It's 9pm when we decide to hit up Bin 36. We were the only table of people when we sat down and our waiter was very nice and never made us feel rushed or anything. The wine flights were perfect and the cheese assortment is beyond more than enough. I could have been there for hours eating myself into a cheese coma. My only complaint would be that they don't always leave you details on the cheese or foods you order. Being someone who forgets things easily, and while drinking, it would have been handy to remember the cheeses we tried and what exactly was in those 3 different grilled cheese sandwiches.
