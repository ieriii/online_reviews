I finally made it to Hot Doug's this past Saturday. We got there around 11 am and there was already a line down the side of the building and it took about an hour and a half to get to the front counter. You should definitely come with friends and expect to kill some time.  We had about ten dogs between us and some duck fat fries as well as the cheese fries.  I thought I'd love the Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage. The first bite was marvelous in it creamy buttery goodness but after a few bites, it was a bit too rich. I think it's perfect for a bite or two but I couldn't eat a whole one by myself.  I thought their simple hot dogs with all the fixings were pretty good as well. With all the rich toppings that are on the special dogs, it's nice sometimes to just have a plain grilled hot dog.  The surprising favorites for me were the antelope and alligator hot dogs. They were both pretty spicy but the sauces and cheese tempered the heat. The flavor combos were great in both dogs.  As for the fries, I was expecting them to be hot and crisp, but our fries were a bit mushy and cold. A bit of a disappointment. You get a huge basket though for only $3 so the value is great. I was expecting to the blown away but they were alright. You can't really taste the difference until you have a basket of plain fries to compare them to. Only then will you be able to appreciate them.
