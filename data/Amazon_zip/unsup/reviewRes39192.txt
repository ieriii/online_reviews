Yummy yummy! This place is awesome! If I lived in the area I would probably be here about every day. It looks rundown, but the food makes up for it. When you order something to grill they give you soup and rice, along with 20-something sides, consisting of veggies, tofu, dried fishes, and some things I didn't recognize but ate anyway. Some of the sides are 'gross', and some you might love - it really depends on your personal taste. The meat is flavorful and delicious, and for an average appetite, you definitely get enough to fill you up. And the rice... oh it is amazing. Hot, sticky, perfect-texture rice. I could live on that stuff. I will say that if you're a germophobe this place, and in general most Korean BBQ places, are not for you. I used about half a bottle of hand sanitizer because every time I used the tongs I got meat juice on my hands. I find that pretty disgusting, but I was willing to put it up with it for the deliciousness. I'd also like to warn about their water (or was it tea?)... I'm pretty sure it was mop water. I looked at it, thought it looked disgusting, took a sip anyway, and almost vomited. There is seriously no other explanation than the faucet was broken so they dipped our cups into a bucket of dirty mop water in the back room. Or maybe they didn't like the looks of us and wanted to drive us away... either way next time I go I'll be sure to smuggle in a bottle of my own water.
