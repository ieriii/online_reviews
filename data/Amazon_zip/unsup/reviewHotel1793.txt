Hotel Allegro is beautiful. I don't really have anything bad to say about the place. We had our wedding there in August and it was more than we could ask for. The staff there was super helpful, so kind and really went out of their way. KT, the wedding coordinator, made the process so stress free. She was there for every step and had all the answers. We had an amazing wedding. The ballroom is gorgeous, as is the rest of the hotel. It was definitely the perfect place for us.
