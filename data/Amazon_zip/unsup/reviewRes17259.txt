I think this place is one of Kleinman's best yet. We went there last week (not hard to get a reservation at all a few days in advance). Everything was wonderful. Great latin food, perfect service. What more can you ask for? From the appetizers to desert, the flavors were perfection. oh, yeah... yummy cocktails and they have that too.. the mojitos rocked. Thought the scene was fresh and the style was fun.
