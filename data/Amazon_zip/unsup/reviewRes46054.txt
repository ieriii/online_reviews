Grand Lux Cafe is basically a fancy Cheesecake Factory in the heart of the Mag Mile.  It is a huge restaurant that gets pretty crazy busy on the weekends.  I enjoyed the decor and overall atmosphere. Our service was a bit slow at times, but very friendly and informative. As for the food.... First off, the fresh sourdough and wheat bread was delicious.  Then we shared the Buffalo Chicken Rolls which were outstanding!  For my entree, I tried the Indochine Chicken and Shrimp. I was certainly not impressed with this dish. While it looked good, I found the dish to be quite bland and the shrimp were a bit rubbery.  I did have the opportunity to try my wife dish: the Shaking Beef and Caramel Chicken Combination.  It was delicious.  Overall, I did enjoy my night, but I left wishing I had ordered something else.
