Not sure what the hype is all about (ambiance and because its BYOB)? Ambiance was great, service was bad and food was 'ok'. My friend and I tried this place for the first time last night (8/29) and sat outside (in the front area).  We waited a long time to be acknowledge by the server once sat down. He commented he saw our wine and would bring glasses, it then took about 15 minutes, he came back around and I asked for the glasses, then he brought them. Ugh. We then order some bread to have before dinner and had to stop him to ask if we could have it before our meal because it was taking a long time. He then went and got it. Once we ordered, the food was pretty prompt and looked appealing. I had the pulled/braised beef dish (Roja) it was 'OK', I expected it to be more flavorful and a little more tender. It wasn't bad, just not impressive. At the end, we had flan, which was ok (would not order it again). The server came after we ate the flan (and plate removed) & laid down utensils and said dessert would be coming. We were like, "we already ate it". lol Really? We just wanted the check!! I would give this one more try, hopes of better server....do a sandwhich or something a little less than $15.95 (in case it wasn't worth it).
