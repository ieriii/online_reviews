Great Beer and awesome New Haven style thin pizza. We had one plain and one red (and ordered white-but did not try)... both outstanding. Next time I will carry out the Sunday special of a pie and a growler for $25. The staff was great too! Goes without saying good people watching in this neighborhood too.
