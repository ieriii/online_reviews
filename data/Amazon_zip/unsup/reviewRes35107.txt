This is my favorite sushi place! The seating area is small, but the delicious food makes up for it any day! Everything from the miso soup, to the edamame, as well as sushi is exactly to my liking. The happy-hour offer on Sunday and Monday, as well as the BYOB option, makes this place ideal for frequent visits on on a budget.
