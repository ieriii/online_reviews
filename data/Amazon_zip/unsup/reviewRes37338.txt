(See pics) I really love this place, lots and lots of great Belgian beer and very decent food!!! The line is ridiculous in the evening but you can grab some fantastic beer while waiting for the tables. I always sit at the back or outside when the weather is warm, both are much more quiet and less bar scene like. The Kwak beer is one that I found to be really cute as it ooks like a scientific experiment or half of an hourglass tube! Me like.
