I'm not a big fan of Chicago style deep dish, but I do like Pequod's. I think it might have to do with them never cleaning the grease and gunk out of their deep dish pans which makes the crust extra greasy and crisp. Also, big fan of the burnt cheese. The only problem is is that I always have horrible indigestion after going here. I would never eat pizza here and then go out drinking for the night without a 2 hour pit stop at home.
