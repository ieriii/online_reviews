I don't think you can really go wrong with Wildfire. Its great food, great environment, and great service. I come here once every few months and they never disappoint. The last time I was here, we were celebrating a friends birthday. The food came out quick and everyone enjoyed their food. I think my favorites here would have to be the horseradish baked clams, their famous crusted filet medallions, their halibut, barbecue and rib combo, and last but certainly not least, their key lime pies. Those things are to die for. no, honestly, TO DIE FOR. I've been here a couple of times just to pick up a pie to go. Their salads are pretty good too. I love the Wildfire Cobb salad, not healthy but definitely satisfying. Also, their mashed potatoes are extremely tasty. I'm surprised that they're pretty packed 7 days a week so reservations are probably the smart way to go. We''ve been pretty lucky with parking whenever we come here so definitely drive around the block so you can save the money for a key lime pie to go!
