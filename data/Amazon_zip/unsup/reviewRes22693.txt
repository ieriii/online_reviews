My first real foray into Greektown, I figured I should start with the place that everyones been to. I have to say I really enjoyed the decor here, some would call it tacky but I would say it was kitchy. It looked like a faux street scene in what I would imagine is supposed to be Greece. The menu had pretty much anything I could imagine you would want at a Greek restaurant. I never tried mousaka and heard about it alot, so I gave it a shot. It was pretty good though it didn't warrent me ordering it again. The fried zucchini on the other hand was the best I've ever had. The leg of lamb was very good and I was thrilled I could couple it with the mousaka. I wasn't a big fan of the saganaki but it was ok , the spinich pie was good but typical.
