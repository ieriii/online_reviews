I've been here a couple of times now and always with a good size group of friends or family. It is a good place to get together, chat and discuss the different meats we get to sample. The decor is nice and the ceilings are tall. The waiters wear costumes but they are in no way ridiculous. You have a lot of choices (meats and the food bar) and will most likely overeat so this is definitely a place that you can't visit too often. Fried bananas and the little puffy bread are awesome. It has been a great experience everytime I've been.
