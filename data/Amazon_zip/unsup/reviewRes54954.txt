Just because your restaurant is in Logan Square, does not make you good. Example: Longman & Eagle - showed up at 7pm Monday, restaurant half full. Service was unexpectedly confused and slow...Kitchen was really slow (people at tables who came in long after us, got their food first). If you want real good Gastropub fare, I suggest Publican. Because Longman & Eagle straight up failed!
