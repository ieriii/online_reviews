I think everyone knows by now the rep Hot Doug's has for being so damn good. Its high quality, easily approachable food. Its the ultimate hot dog stand for foodies. It's to be expected that the food here will be great, the lines will be long (BECAUSE the food is great), and Doug's humbleness and extremely good customer service will just add to the high points. Everyone already knows all this, though. What I REALLY enjoy about this place is the variety of menu options. They have all the regulars, but they also have some really creative options like bacon and cheese elk sausage, corned beef sausage, foie gras and duck sausage with foie gras mousse and black truffle, and get this - rattlesnake sausage with blueberry creme fraiche (just a weekly special they had when I went there last). The prices are great, too! Cash only though, come prepared. *update: recently had the ribeye sausage with chimichurri sauce. freakin good, people.
