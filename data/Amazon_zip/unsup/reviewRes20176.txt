There are good sides and bad sides to Mexican. Not the people, cuz I don't even know them that besides the fact that a lot of resto and fast food was patterned after their culinary culture, but I mean the food itself. Chicken tinga torta is good, I still don't get and maybe will never get used to having avocado in anything else besides ice cream or a milkshake. Sorry, that's how I grew up, but I dislike having avocados in burritos or burgers for that matter. I like the churros. The carnitas caldos was also very good. There's so much else that I have to try before raising it up a notch for the rating. Otherwise, its a good place to chow down.
