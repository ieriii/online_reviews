Great 'special' date location! Mood lighting, Spanish guitar music, and great wine ... The works!!! We ordered prince gejas combo. This meal includes a salad, cheese fondue with breads, meat (scallops, chicken, lobster, shrimp, steak), veggies, and chocolate fondue. The staff was extremely attentive, great food, and we received $50 off with a current running groupon. If you've never been to the restaurant, grab the groupon and go get your fondue on. The meal was very special indeed.
