Came here for my post Chicago Marathon dinner since Kumas was out of the way and my cousin said the burgers at Lockdown were comparable, it was closer to her place, and way less crowded. Apparently they have more burger options too. I got the Lockdown Warden and it was delicious - greasy, rich and juicy - every ingredient is pretty much what I would want in a burger (bacon, garlic, cheddar, truffle oil, fried leeks and onions). I had leftovers, and they tasted great the next day for breakfast too. I don't really get the decor (prison theme meets club (which almost makes it look like a goth night club) meets sports bar?), and the music was so loud we opted to sit outside in the cold (which wasn't so bad mid October), but the food was delicious, and I'd def come back here again when I'm in town.
