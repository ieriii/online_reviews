Oh gosh, I don't know how it slipped my mind to review this place! Their falafel is easily my favorite food in the whole city. It has spoiled me for other falafel, which I don't even bother with anymore. The secret is the delicious jerusalem salad (basically mild cucumber salad), that they put in with the falafel. It adds cool crunchiness that makes that whole thing unbelievably good. Add a little spice and damn! nothing better. I've had other things too. All are amazing, especially the lentil soup. Yum yum, I've literally gone miles out of my way to stop by this place. So cheap and delicious!
