We were a party of six and everyone loved their seafood. The service was excellent, the prices were reasonable, but the decor was a little dated. We found that not only were the traditional seafood dishes available, but there were some original ways to prepare the dishes that made the menu selection interesting. I would definitely recommend this to anyone wanting a great seafood experience.
