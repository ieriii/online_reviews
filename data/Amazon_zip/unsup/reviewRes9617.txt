Awesome place, but a little pricey for me! It's a $60 prix fixe, but adding wine and tax and tip really jumps the bill up fast. Small tiny restaurant - and when I went there was some construction going on right there so it took me a few seconds to find the entryway. I had: 1) The Egg dish with a little bit of Pork Belly. YUMMM! Definitely would always get this - it was freaking awesome. -Intermezzo of Hibiscus Ice - not really my thing, but it was OK. 2) The Short Rib - also yum! Tender and not dry. -GRILLED CHEESE - I TOTALLY WANT SOME MORE! 3) The Beet dessert - also good! Off of my friends dishes, I sampled the other desserts too. The Corn one is fantastically interesting - but boy do you really need to like corn to like this dish! But it was really good - I just had to keep eating more! And the Lemon dessert was also sooo good - and it comes in a cute little glass jar...just looks fun.  We unfortunately couldn't meet Dale but we were able to meet Sara - she is as cute as a button and very sweet and personable.  Hmmm...so I would totally go again but it's a little pricey for me personally so I'm not sure I will be there quite so often. But definitely worth trying!
