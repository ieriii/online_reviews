I love this place. we come here a lot. The beer list is amazing and changed frequently. I have never had bad food or service in this place. The burgers are amazing. Just amazing. The fries are delightful and I love the flavor variety. Old bay and truffle are my favorites. OMG I'm hungry just thinking about it. Go there. You won't regret it.
