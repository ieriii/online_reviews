IMHO, I give this place 3 stars. But my 1 yr old son loves this place. He really ate up the chips and guacamole, the rice and beans a.k.a. singing food, my hubby tells him, and the barbacoa, while he was shaking his half-chinese booty to the mexican dance mix coming from the jukebox. Note to self, dine out with son at places with jukebox.
