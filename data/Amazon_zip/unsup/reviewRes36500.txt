Wonderful! Been here 3 times since New Year's Day. If you and your friends are spread out all over the city, Meli is in a great central location. For being in a busy neighborhood we always seem to find parking (on Jackson across from the Staples). The service is very attentive, the music is fun, the decor is very clean and bright and the food is delicious! The french toast is consistently good. The hot chocolate is divine! The omelettes have interesting combinations and the price is reasonable. Downside: This place is popular so be prepared to wait. Come before 10am or after 11am. Go to Meli! You will enjoy it.
