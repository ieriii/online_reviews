Dark as hell, I mean black, not nary a window. can't even see the menu which is in some Neo sushi language (inside out, hot cold etc.) and there is no damn sushi bar! Who is making my maki? Listen, go here if your having an affair with a stripper and you wanna make out in a dark corner while enjoying an overpriced Neo roll!
