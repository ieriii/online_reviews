I have been here once and I can't wait to go back. The food was excellent had great originality. The best part of the meal came last. The chorro with hot chocolate. This combination was one of the best deserts I have ever had. In my opinion, the hot chocolate is a must try. I don't care if your belly is about to burst, you must try the hot chocolate! This place was very busy when I went and you could wait in line for a while. It also isn't best suited to handle a lot of sit down eaters.
