We went to 90 Miles to celebrate a friend's promotion with a group of 7. I got there too early and was led to the cutest little outdoor "lounge" to listen to live music and wait for my friends. Everyone was so friendly, the place was busy (but not jammed) and the environment was so cozy and fun. I even got one of the four parking spots up front! Buck, our waiter, was perfectly attentive, opening bottles (BYOB!) and offering drink options--mojito mix for our rum and fruit and ice for our sangria. He handled our group with ease, offering suggestions of how much to order and answering questions about the menu. Buck was rad. I'm not that familiar with Cuban food, but being a fan of pork, garlic, and fried things, I was impressed! Not sure how it measured up against other Cuban food, but I loved it--especially the Puerco Rostizato, Camarones al Ajillo and Media Noche sandwich. I would order all again in a heartbeat. We finished Key Lime Pie and Pastelito--the latter is apparently flown in from Miami. Again, I don't have a frame of reference for Cuban food, but I loved it all...most importantly my Cuban friend was so happy to have some of her favorite foods. Sad I waited so long to try this place!
