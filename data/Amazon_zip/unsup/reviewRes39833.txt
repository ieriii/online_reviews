Now this place was fun. A party of 16 and I went there after a fellow student of my martial arts dojo earned his blackbelt. We were promptly seated. After a few min of deliberation we ordered. The waitress was borderline rude and unaccomadating. But seeing as she most likely serves tables of jackasses Im sure her night was long. Still, she should have seen we were all nice people. our sides came and Everything I had was well prepared and yummy. I love kimchi and theirs was spectacular. When our meat came it was well cut and the octopus was very spicy which was a treat for me. try the chicken as well. Very moist. We finished off with ginsing wine and sake. We had so much food and I still wanted more. I look forward to stopping here again seeing as it was an unexpected treat.
