Awesome pressed Cuban sandwiches at this artsy urban cafe. Looks like a hole in the wall but walk in and the back room is spacious, warm and welcoming with plenty of Cuban art. Came for lunch in a group of 4 and had the fish which was perfectly fried and topped with onion, tomato and romaine and pressed on white bread to a crusty and crunchy yumminess. Fried plantain chips accompanied. Also had the maduros/fried plantains which were a bit oily but fresh. Will have to come back next time for the acclaimed bistec sandwich, pastelitos pastries, and cafe con leche or to try their dinner menu. Yum!
