Love the beer, especially Top Heavy and Dark and Curvy. While the pizza is one of the best in town, I do agree with some of the other reviews that the cheese is used too sparingly. I tried to get extra cheese as one of my toppings twice, but it barely tasted or looked any different. I will try to order extra extra cheese next time! :) Other than that, the place is cozy and I enjoy spending my Friday afternoons there.
