It is so sad to see that so many patrons are thrilled about FREE valet. Service and food completely escaped their highlighted afternoon and or evening. Poor greeting,lack of attentive needs of guests, and all around blatant "you are so lucky to be here", seem to be the goal of GREEK ISLANDS RESTAURANT. Let us stick you in a corner with TASSAS (if the spelling is correct) while he will blatantly ignore you and not pay attention to the fact that you ordered the catch of the day which by the way you recommended and was awful. I believe the term may be expired fish. It would have been nice to tell you that in person although you never came back to the very poor table you gave us in the very cramped corner we asked not to be in.  When we had to leave our very lucky location table and try and find you after 25 minutes of being ignored, no one cared even then.  Oh yeah, there is always the FREE valet parking. By the way, it was an extremely nice afternoon prior to this with my mom at Steppenwolf Theatre. We truly relish these mother and daughter days together. As an add on, we did pay $20 for the expired fish of the day". ... No one cared...period. The one star only exists because I could not post this otherwise. NO Stars here.
