love this place! one of my favorite places to eat and i'ev only been there once..so i think that actually means something. amaazing atmosphere and their lychee drinks are deliciously sweet yet light. the menu is very extensive although i don't see that much french flair except maybe for a boullaibaise. mostly a vietnamese restaurant but a good one at that
