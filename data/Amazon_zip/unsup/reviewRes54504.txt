Yummmmmm....I got the meat loaf and it was everything that I would've hoped it to be. At first I was a little hesitant because seitan meat loaf doesn't sound very appetizing, but it was great. It has lentil and what appeared to be carrots ground into it. SO good. I've also had the avocado tostados and they were also to die for. They have so many options both vegetarian and vegan, everything that a long time vegetarian has been missing.
