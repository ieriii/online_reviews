Indie Cafe is one of my favorit neighborhood restaurants. Only a few doors down from where I live, it offers great tasting Thai and Sushi cuisine. I have turned on so many of my friends to this place and they have become repeat customers themselves. The lunch menu is a steal but portions are the right size so you don't leave hungry. In the evening it usually its quite buys. The bigger seating space is a bit more comfortable then the smaller space by the entrance. It is BYOB. Try it. You'll love it! Enjoy!
