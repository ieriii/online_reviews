I stayed here because this was the hotel the coordinators of the conference I was going to chose for us. The conference happened at Roosevelt U. just a few blocks away. They will be getting an angry letter from me. I wish I could give this place half a star. And that's only because it was in a good spot close to the train (we could hear it from our room) and walking distance to some cool stuff. It's right next to the lake and there's a 24 hour BR across the street which is nice since the hotel has no vending machines with food in them. Reasons why I suggest never staying at this hotel: - Our room was TINY...I think it was meant to be for a queen/king but they shoved two full sized beds in it - There was a 1.5 inch margin between the floor and the bottom of our door...wtf? - The elevators hardly worked and we got to ride the "fun" manual elevator whenever the employees got around to it - Nothing was as clean as it should have been - No one knew anything...we were quoted one price and charged another...we had to negotiate for a compromise All around a bad experience!
