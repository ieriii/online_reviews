I love this place! I've been going here for years both dining in and on the occasion even ordering delivery from India House. Every single experience with India House has been extremely positive, and I would recommend this place to everyone. As a note this is an extremely great place to go on a romantic date since the ambiance is very special. What can I recommend for food? The naan and tomato dipping sauce they have is unbelievably good. All around the naan here is fantastic. I love the tomato soup (I forgot what it's called but it's very good and spicy). Lassi Mango is ridiculously good, but they also have a very good bar! Gulab Jamen is fantastic. Try this place out! India House rocks.
