Listen--I'm not going to bother writing a lengthy review for Grand Lux. In case you haven't eaten here before, you just can't go wrong with a restaurant that is HUGE, right off Michigan Ave, can seat your party of 6 or more and then some, has a menu the size of a phone book, and delivers consistently (90%) good food and service. So what if it's touristy, just ignore them. If you're going out with a group of people who all like different things, they will all find something on this menu. And maybe your indecisive self might find something too.
