Ok, does it deserve 5 stars based on the food? Probably not, it is a little overpriced for a dog and fries. If it was just another "dog joint" I would probably only give it three stars for serving an overpriced dog. I give it those two extra stars for the 1950's style drive-inn and the accompanying atmosphere.
