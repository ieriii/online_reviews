Ok it was like a month ago when I came here so this review is a little late. Came here on double date night to enjoy some burgers, beer and conversation. The boyfriend and I enjoyed the food and the beer (I may have a new favorite! Fireston Walker Union Jack) we ordered the Imperial, could have used more cheese, and the hangover, he loved it. Under pressure i didnt get flavored fries, biggest mistake of my life! I did get to tast the truffle and firecracker fries though, so I felt a little better. My friend however didn't love her food, Big Texan. Her and her boyfriend both agreed it lacked flavor and could have used bolder taste. The service was pretty good and our wait for the table wasn't too shabby. This place was crowded so be prepared to wait and enjoy a drink at the bar while you do.
