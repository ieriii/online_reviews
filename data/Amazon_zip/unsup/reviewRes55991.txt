I really like the gage. The service is always very good and the food is good value for the quality of the food that you receive. I have tried their fish and chips which I think are the best in Chicago and my friend had a 3 sausage platter.The one lost star is for the really cold place that we sat in. We sat near the entrance in the elevated area and everytime a person entered or exited the gage a really cold blast of air would keep our table cold for another 5 minutes afterwards. I should have asked to move but didn't want to be difficult.
