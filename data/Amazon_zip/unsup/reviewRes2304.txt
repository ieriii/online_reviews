I LOVE HOT DOUGS. I don't ever mind waiting, either. Totally worth it. The only thing that sucks about waiting is hearing all the newbs in the line talk about Hot Dougs just because they saw it on 'No Reservations'. Anyway, all the hot dogs are ill, and the duck fat fries are worth 5 stars alone. I love the kooky hot dog decor and everyone that works there is really nice.  The ONLY thing that bums me out about Hot Dougs is when I go there on a random day when they are supposed to be open and its CLOSED. TOTAL BUMMER, DOUG.
