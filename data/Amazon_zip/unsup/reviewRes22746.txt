Everything was great here... except for my food, I'm sad to say. I picked this restaurant because of its stellar Yelp reviews before an event at UIC. Free valet parking was sweet, and from the beginning of our experience to the end, we were treated like family by every staff member. Our waiter in particular was an absolute sweetheart while taking care of our table. He was knowledgeable about everything on the huge menu, offered recommendations, and flirted a little with my table of ladies :) My glass of Greek white wine was delicious, and so was the saganaki, but my main course of lamb, artichoke, and potato was way oversalted and drowning in a thick cream sauce. The way it was described on the menu, I thought it was going to be a much lighter sauce. The lamb was a bit overcooked, and the artichokes were flavorless. My dining companions were happy with their meals of meatballs and moussaka, though. I worked at a Mediterranean restaurant for three years, so I tend to compare all places to the awesome food they have there. Our food came to the table extremely fast, so I'm sure they don't cook everything to order. The ambiance is very lively and bright, and everyone seemed to enjoy being there. I don't want to deter anyone from coming here, but next time I'll just stick with my old restaurant.
