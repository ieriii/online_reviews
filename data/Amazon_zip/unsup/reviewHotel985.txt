I didn't seek out the Amalfi. This hotel is in same building as our Chicago office and, as such, we have a corporate rate. So, it was convenience more than anything else. However, this is a very nice hotel at an affordable rate in a good neighborhood close to a lot of things. Good combination. The rooms are comfortable and of decent size. Aside from the requisite TV, in-room entertainment includes several CD collections (mostly Jazz...fine by me!), books and a DVD player (DVDs available at reception.) The bathrooms are large and offer good quality Aveda soaps and hair products.  Lots of free amenities. In the mornings, there is a breakfast buffet set up on the credenza of each floor's elevator location. Coffee, pastries, fruit, juice and the like are set up here from (I believe) 6:30-10. During the week, from 5-7, there is a happy hour featuring antipasti selections and drinks, including the Amalfitini. Wireless internet is also available. Unfortunately, there isn't any free water (in-room Voss water is available for $5 and $7), but that is a very minor thing compared to all the other complimentary amenities. There's also a workout room and business center, but I have used neither. Parking is also pretty pricey, but I've never had to deal with that. Oh, almost forgot, they drop off chocolate truffles as part of the turndown service. During my last visit in February 2009, I saw that the lobby had been completely remodeled. Apparently, by now, so have the rooms. Hope to head out their soon so I can check them out.
