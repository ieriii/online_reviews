As many others have mentioned the wait staff/ hostess are not always kind. I ordered take out and when I opened the box literally two minutes after getting it, I was shocked. It looked like someone had taken the box and shaken it for 2 mins. Then despite the look I had really high hopes for the food but then it tasted meh! Which was really sad. The only positive I would have for this place was that my very small overprice salad tasted not too bad but dressing was a bit oily.
