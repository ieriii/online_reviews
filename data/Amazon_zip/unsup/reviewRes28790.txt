I got the Farfalle el Pollo and I love this place :) Close enough and walkable for an Italian fix. And I have to add that service was excellent. Very attentive, friendly and great recommendations. In fact, I'm compelled to try the lasagna when I come back because I was hearing so many raves the night I came in.
