Sappori is my boyfriend and mine's favorite spot in the city. We are here all the time, usually later in the evening, and regardless if it's a Tuesday or a busy Friday night, the service is always accomodating and pleasurable. The bread is exactly what you want at an Italian place: warm, crusty on the outside and nice and chewy on the inside.The menu is always changing, from the wine to the specials. Whereas my boyfriend can't get over the Spaghetti or seafood ravioli, which are staples, I always tend to order the rotating dishes and always enjoy them.And to back up the other reviews, the tiramisu here is the best I've ever had, and perfect for two people to share :)
