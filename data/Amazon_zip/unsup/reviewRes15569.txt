I grew up ordering their thin crust pizzas and while I admit it was very tasty, it was also really greasy and quite honestly I can only handle it on occassion now. However, if you've got a tough stomach, I say go for it as it tastes great. Oddly, over the years I've only eaten at the location maybe 7 or 8 times. I recall the service being fine, and seeing some occassional odd loungey entertainers (not sure if they still do that) but I remember overall the experience was enjoyable.
