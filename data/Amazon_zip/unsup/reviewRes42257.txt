Listen, I know everyone loves this place. I feel ok about it.  In order to see the menu, you have to more or less walk up to the counter. But when you walk up to the counter, the cashier gets all antsy like there is a pizza-pocalypse and you are going to ruin everything if you don't order now. This happens if there's no line behind you too.  So, despite the lack of people at the weird time we went, the pizza was going to take 40 minutes. Which is fine. I want you to take your time making me some kick-butt deep dish pizza. But when we each got a slice to hold us over before the pizza came? Not that impressive. I couldn't get the hype. And if your pizza's good, shouldn't it be good even if it wasn't cooked right that second?
