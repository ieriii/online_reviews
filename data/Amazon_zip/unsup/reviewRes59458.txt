first time having the Chicago style pizza...what was i waiting for??there was a bit of a wait to get it, expected that...but it went fast...atmosphere was cool, watching the guys spinning the dough...prices were very reasonable...appetizer plate was very good, the pizza was so filling we couldn't finish it...our family of 4 are pretty good eaters and it was more than enough, and exactly half the price of our meal the day before at the Cheesecake Factory
