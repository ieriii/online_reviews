My friend and I came here on a Friday morning and it was packed! Hello don't you people have to work?? (If you are wondering why we weren't at work, it is because we were on our way to PUERTO RICO for the weekend, yeah!) Anyway, this was my very first time dining at Meli's. I know, I am shocked as well. The portions are gigantic and the food is lovely. The eggs are wonderfully fluffy, but a little too buttery/creamy for my tastes. I got the veggie omelette, it was so gigantic I could only eat half of it. We shared a half-order of the french toast as well. Next time I'm going for the challah. I'm pretty sure this is one of those places where I'd enjoy eating anything I ordered here. Did I mention that the portions are gigantic??
