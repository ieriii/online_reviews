Forget the negative reviews-this place IS a classic. Listen, it's a hot dog joint-ok? It's small with limited seating but plenty of places to pull your car in and they bring the food to you like an old fashioned drive-in. Arguably the best hot dog in Chicago (although I like Portillo's too). It's nostalgic and kitschy and everytime I pass by there is always someone there. There's a reason it's been around so long-try it if you like hot dogs (burgers are Ok, pineapple shakes are awesome). oh, and it is a little pricey, but worth it all things considered.
