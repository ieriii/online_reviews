Arrived at Hot Dougs on a Saturday morning at 10am. The place opens at 10:30 and there was already a line being formed. My girlfriend gives me a look, you know that look, the "we're seriously going to wait 45 minutes for a hot dog?" look. The line was about 2 hours long by the time Hot Dougs opened at 10:30. We were a little bit behind where the red bricks started and it took us about 45 minutes to get to the counter. 15 minutes into the wait, rain. Fuck. My girlfriend gives me that other look, you know, the "this better be the best meal you'll ever have in your life or I'm going to remind you about this for the rest of our relationship until it eventually breaks us a part 2 months later" look. We finally got into the restaurant, right before it started heavily pouring. One thing that really surprised me, there were dudes still waiting outside. There was still a long line. People must really like these hot dogs. And it was very fortunately for my relationship that these hot dogs were the best damn dogs I've ever eaten. Foie Gras dog - The heaviest, tastiest thing I don't think I can ever eat again for the sake of my health. Shitake dog - My favorite. FOrgot what exactly was in there, but it was a damn good dog. The duck fat fries are also a must have. Just a different taste to it. Delicious. I definitely recommend showing up way early, because I don't think I would have had the same great experience if I had to wait 2+ hours for this. Then again, I don't think I would enjoy anything except for splash mountain at disneyland if it was a 2+ hour wait.
