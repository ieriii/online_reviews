I am not sure that most of you are reviewing the right place. This restaurant sucks. The service is horrible both eating in or for delivery. They act like they are doing you a favor and believe me they aren't. The one good thing they have going is the falafel but other then that forget about it. They usually are out of some thing their rice sucks their lamb shawerma is dry and their lentil soup is so so. I have been to other middle eastern spots and Im sorry this place is near or at the bottom.
