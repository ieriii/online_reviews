I recently stayed here for just one night, but I gotta say that Hilton Garden Inn's always impress me. It might be because some people have a notion that the Garden Inn line of Hilton is their inferior brand. I've stayed at several and they are actually better than some of the standard Hiltons. I think it might be because most of them are newer properties. And yes, I am giving them 5 stars. I know, I know! It's not a luxury hotel like the Ritz or Four Season, but for a nice, newer hotel in the area that caters more towards a business crowd, it is one of the best I've been to. The lobby was really nice and modern and they are attached to Weber Grill restaurant that offers room service. The check in was quick and the woman was super friendly and helpful. The room was great. It was a corner room on a higher floor with nice city views to both directions. The room was clean, had nice linens and decor, and also features a mini-refrigerator, microwave, and coffee maker. I love having those conveniences in a hotel room. The bathroom amenities were Neutrogena. Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel. You are just blocks to Michigan Avenue in the heart of the River North neighborhood. You are also just blocks to the Loop just across the river. Oh, and all that for just $145 a night. Great price for the area and the quality. I would definitely stay there again.
