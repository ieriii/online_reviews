Came here for the all you can eat hot pot. Definitely a pretty good deal. Coming here you definitely need to speak some Chinese or they're essentially not going to listen to you. When my friend and I were ordering we starting rattling off things that we wanted, but the waiter ignored us and started to walk away. Friend: Can we have the beef and... Waiter starts to walk away. Kent: Hey wait we want to order... Waiter: I will bring out popular thing. Kent: Ugh... Friend: Oh that should be fine. Kent: But he's gonna bring stuff that we're not gonna like or eat... Okay whatever. Out comes huge platter of fish, fish balls, beef balls, watercrest, tofu, random seafood stuff and noodles. Friend: Where's the beef and meat? Kent: See told you so. (gotta love those told you so moments) I was a fan of the fish. The beef itself that did eventually get ordered was 95% fat... The broth used for the hot pot was delicious. I would give this place 5 stars for hot pot but minus one for the lack of service until I busted out my broken mandarin.
