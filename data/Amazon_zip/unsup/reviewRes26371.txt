I hardly get out of Lincoln Park but I do go here for lunch often. Some folks love the look of the room. I wonder why they have curtains on the big windows looking out to the park. On Michigan Ave there's seating - but bus fumes are not my idea of an entree. I'm a lunch fiend and get the same thing. Chef's 2 meat misto (3 if you go for dinner) and the serrano and fig salad with blue cheese. Wow! Two glasses of Cava, the Prosecco of Spain. The place has a frequent dining card and you can quickly rack up credits to pay the bill. Chef also does group tours of the GreenCityMarket on certain days and then cooks what was bought for the group afterward. There is a nifty downstairs bar with sofa seats and tables but not available for lunch.
