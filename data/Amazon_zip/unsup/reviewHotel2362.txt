For 280 a night Internet should come with the room, not separately. Also, a fridge didn't come standard although I was able to get one when I asked. Usually I would give props for a clean room, but the blood stained towels the first day kind of ruined that. The last straw for me was trying to change my checkout day. They wanted to charge me for a night even though the hotel is full capacity and they won't lose money from my not being here. They did come down by half, but I still feel ripped off.
