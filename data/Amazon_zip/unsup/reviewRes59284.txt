Indie Cafe Thai & Sushi-OMG, why didn't I try this before???They had a special the night I went-Tamarind Shrimp! The shrimp were HUGE and JUICY. (My mouth's watering as I think of it.) The Spider Maki was excellent! The sushi portions were HUGE and extremely fresh.It was a very busy night, but they seated my party of two fairly quickly.This place gets an A++ from me!
