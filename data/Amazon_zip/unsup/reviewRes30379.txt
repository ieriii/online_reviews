I agree, with Jonathan S. - this place is a 3.5 if it were in the west. It's good; it's just not *that* good compared to lots of places in California and Arizona and New Mexico. We thought things were oversalted consistently. Going at lunch seems to be the trick since you have to make reservations ages in advance for dinner. As my dining companion said, "I was less disappointed than I thought I'd be." Tamal was ok, but not life-changing; quesadillas capitalinas were not outstanding but the red salsa was great. The guacamole, which he's apparently known for, was good; the flautas were fine and the tacos al carbon were great. I'd eat here again, but I wouldn't reserve two months in advance to do so. One note - it's a very tightly packed seating arrangement, so if you are marginally claustrophobic, get seated outside where you will be treated to city traffic whizzing by. Seemed to be good for families as there were lots of kiddos in tow. The limeade was fantastic.
