Ok, nice hotel, but the brunches are a bit week. The pool is small and not good for laps. Room service is clean and fresh, but nothing special. The fresh fruit was beautiful and fresh. This is not so much a family hotel, but if you are going to Navy Pier it works well. Also, they have a movie theater a block away. This hotel could stand out if it wanted to, but unfortunately they have yet to walk the walk.
