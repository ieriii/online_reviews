It was pretty decent food with the quantity reflecting the same experience with the quantity, par. It had presented very standard fare with the orders with the initial soup though meager, was unique to this restaurant.  I didn't leave feeling that I was cheated out of money but didn't think it was very memorable. The tortillas were very warm when it got to my plate and the food was pretty tasty.  Though, in retrospect as I was leaving, I felt that I perhaps should've noticed the trends and saw it was on the way down. It was worth giving it a try, but will definitely not be returning.
