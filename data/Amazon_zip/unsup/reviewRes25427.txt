This was my first foray into fondue and I enjoyed it very much, as I really like the act of dipping. The place looked like a hobbit hole in Morocco (the highest of compliments) and the servers were as sweet as pie. The cheese was my favorite part of the evening, and eight sauces into which you may dip your meat and vegetables are nothing to sneeze at. I'll be honest, I was almost going to be a jerk and write "Two stars because the food was cooked poorly" because I thought that would be funny.
