"Where's my churro?!" as the party beside us ordered after and received before us. Are the words uttered by my friend's gf. Unexpected, Loud, and possessed by another soul. Bayless is actually a drug lord smuggling that Mexican cinnamon sugar crack across the border. One of my friends actually went back for those churros 6 times in one month. I tried to do an intervention, but I ended up stabbing him in the flank for not bringing me one. Anyway, tried the ahogado, milanesa, cochinita pibil, carnitas soup. All were great.
