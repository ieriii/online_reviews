We had an SUV that didn't fit in their garage, and there was absolutely no parking on the street, so we had to drive all the way down to the Jewel Osco supermarket and leave our car in their parking lot (though their signs threatened us not to; screw'em). Then they almost wouldn't take our reservation because we needed five minimum and two of us didn't show up, so we had to ask a random couple to sit with us. Also, it was so loud, we couldn't even hear each other talk. I felt like I was supposed to be drunk. All in all: Parking - Sucked Waiting - Sucked Service - Sucked Omelette - Delicious
