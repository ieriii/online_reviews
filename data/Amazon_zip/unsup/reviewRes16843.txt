Sorry this place is past its prime.  OK... the cool outside look, the upscale attempts, decore as it is was nice. People in flipflops, cut-off shorts and ratty t-shirts seemed a bit much. When we asked the doorman what the acceptable attire was, we were told anything is OK... literally inclusing skateboards. If you are looking for swanky, sophistication, or higher-end (past the price point), then avoid this place.  We gave it two tries and the second time was more of a let down than the first.
