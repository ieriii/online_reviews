NeVER opens on time, people do have to get to work so when you decide to open at 8:10 in the morning rather than 8:00 it is annoying, no i will not leave you a tip fo that girls....then on top of it you give attitude to ME? because your late. hmmm wish there wa someplace better thats just as close, but then im kinda sick of paying $11.00 fir friggen oatmeal, coffe and scone, yep 11 buckaroos(thats without tip mindyou) OK this place give the SNUBS, the people that work there are ectomorphs with an attitude, most have been working there for years and still havent got the fact that it feels GOOD to be happy. My girlfriend has gone there with her 11 year old daughter and the ugly short haired girl at the counter sniggers at them, she thinks theyre a couple, as in gay lesbian couple. this has happened more than once there with the same snot nosed punk. yall need to aspire to more living and get off those happiness killer drugs y'all doing cuz MILK AND HONEY SUUUUUCCCCKKKS please spend your money other places it will be better, i hope the owner reads these because you have to talk with your staff about late openings and crappy attitudes whats with you people anyway??? wicker park is not about high priced food/clothing/things sold by stuck-up- ectomorph Art students- snottynosed- punky -chuck taylor wearing-"geek-is-the-new-beautiful"-cant -get- a -better- job -so im -going -to -make- you -miserable -place get out of wicker park and go to new york then,,,,,oatmeal is good:)
