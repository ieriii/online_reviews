Well done! Sometimes I'm skeptically of this kind of joint - something about trying to hard - but the Gage delivers. I stopped in for dinner and drinks with my sweetie on a Friday night, and the whole evening was really swell. The Good -Service was quite nice. The hostess promptly reseated us after I requested a table closer to the front (back room was too cold and quiet, and we wanted a more lively atmosphere). Our server Augustus (sp?) was knowledgeable about the menu, attentive but not too pushy. -Large portions (always a pleasant surprise at a nicer place) -Great attention to detail... cauliflower soup was just right but the garnishes (green apple, celery, bacon, and blue cheese) really took it over the edge. The just OK -The butter (served with warm brown bread) was topped with kosher salt. which seemed really unnecessary. Just serve good bread and butter, no need to fuel hypertension. We were too full for dessert so I can't comment on the sweets, but I hear the donuts (not on the menu right now) are killer. I'll be back. = )
