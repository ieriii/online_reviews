TRU is TRUly a great experience. Although this place is a little hidden, we managed to find it. Once we stepped inside, we were greeted not only by the amazing staff, but also by a mesmerizing piece by Gerhard Richter, as an artist, I appreciate this already. Although we had to wait for our table to be prepared, we were told to wait in the front room with beautiful ambiance and not to mention their art collection that is comparable to high-end art museums (Yves Klein). The atmosphere inside the dining room is fantastic, and the food gets as good as it get. I very much favor the seared foie gras, cooked to perfection, and they wowed me with their fancy utensils and plating. It is so apparent they pay much attention to detail, I dined with two of my guy friends, and when they served apple beignet, my utensil was red, while the boys' were blue.  And the service, it's impeccable. I have so much love for this restaurant, and definitely has higher standards than usual one-star Michelins.
