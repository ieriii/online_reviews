Logan Square is not my usual stomping grounds and I am the farthest thing from a hipster, but OMG was it worth it. L&E is worth a miserable trip on the blue line any day. The ambiance is chill but classy, and while it exudes this "hipper than thou" mentality, it works perfectly (granted I was the only person in the room not wearing a plaid flannel button-up). Our server was also adorable, which is always a plus. The only aspect of the meal I wasn't crazy about was the appetizer - the buffalo frog legs. (definitely not my first choice but hey, I'll eat anything). I just was generally unimpressed. Buffalo always feels like a cop out anyhow. I had some fish entree, which i can't remember and it isn't on the menu anymore (sorry, not helpful) but it was amazing. I wasn't sure what to expect and it blew my mind. However, my friend struck the jackpot. The pork belly. drool.. If i were making a list of reasons to move to Logan Square, #1 would be this dish. no jokes. So, make the trip. Try it out. I can't imagine anyone being disappointed.
