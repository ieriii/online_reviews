Delicious. I am an unabashed carnivore, and I am willing to admit that I enjoyed The Chicago Diner's fare. I ordered the Philly "Steak" with vegan "cheeze" and a side of Mashed Potatoes and Gravy. It was extremely flavorful and didn't leave me with that bloated, I-need-to-take-a-nap feeling. The prices are very reasonable for the food quality and quantity. My meal was $8.50! If you're a vegan, vegetarian, or vegan-curious and you live in the Chicagoland area, you need to try this place. If you live around Lakeview, you should definitely stop by.
