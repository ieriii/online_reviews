Things you should know about Indie Cafe: #1- when they say something is hot, THEY REALLY MEAN IT!!! #2- They have AMAZING customer service!!!! Sunday evening I ordered the Panang Curry. I'm used to a sweet/peanuty curry that I get at other places, and was shocked when I got IC's version that basically burned my mouth off. *Disclaimer: I didn't read the menu very closely, so this was completely my fault, as they clearly state that the Panang is spicy. I was exhausted and VERY hungry, so I called them and asked if they could remake it. I felt terrible, so I walked over to pick it up and make a switch.  Not only did they try to call me to deliver it (it was originally a carry-out order), but the manager was so incredibly nice in talking to me about what my issues were AND they included a little cucumber salad.  Even though this was my mistake, they really went above and beyond in making sure I was taken care of. I will probably not order the Panang there again, but I will definitely go over for other Thai dishes :)
