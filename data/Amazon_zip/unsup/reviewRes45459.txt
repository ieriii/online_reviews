This place is a welcome addition to the neighborhood. From a casual date night starter to the perfect hangover hotspot. The atmosphere of the resturant is pretty busy but not in a way that makes you feel rushed or overcrowded. The inside decor is pretty dark and I love the long bar. Great place to grab a drink with a friendly bartender while you are waiting on your table. The outside patio is also a big bonus. They accept my pup and the service is just as attentive. As for the drinks... they have a great draft selection and the Bloody Mary was delicious and the perfect hangover cure after a loong night of tequila shots.  Now the food...The bugers are huge and I love the irish choices of toppings from the bacon to the cheese.  The egg sandwhich was nothing inventive but was made perfectly with a great combo of eggs, cheese, onions and bread (my new hangover cure). And the cheese/artichoke dip appetizer was great. Overall, definitely a great irish pub type restaurant that I will be frequenting more often!
