Came here yearning for a primo place in Chicago for encased meats/sausages. I was not disappointed. Though the waiting 45 minutes in the freezing cold was a test of my limits, it was definitely worth the wait. Had the bacon and cheddar elk sausage with Guinness mustard and smoked gouda, the Elvis, and of course the duck fat fries. The sausages were the most unique and best tasting I've ever had. So much flavor in every bite. I tried a bit of the duck fat fries which were great as well but the portion was so huge I had to take them to-go. Hot Doug's is a definite must for me when I come back to Chicago. I'm hooked!
