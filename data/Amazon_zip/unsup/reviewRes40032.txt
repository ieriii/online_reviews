I love this place for Korean BBQ. I've always come here with a Korean who ordered everything for us which I think really helps. The staff doesn't seem to speak English too well. Whatever they marinate their beef with I wish I could buy it in a store it makes it taste so freaking good. All the little side dishes they serve with the beef are excellent as well. I highly recommend coming here really hungry because there is so much great food to consume!
