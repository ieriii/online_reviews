I was in Chicago on business and one of my Clients had brought me to the GLC. the first impression i got when i walked is was wow the decor is very nice and very detailed. As i sat there and looked around the room i said to myself, this looks awfully familiar. Then i said out loud This place looks like the cheesecake factory. After everyone concured we found out the the CCF in fact does own it. Well let me tell you the food was way beyond the CCF it was fabulous. Service was also great. The deserts are very large and very enjoyable. Cant wait to go back
