The server, Diacos tried to steal my money!!! If you have the misfortune of having him for a server beware. I gave him the bill with twenty dollars in it and my card, he added the twenty dollars to the total and had the audacity to take the twenty dollar bill as an extra tip!!! All of this while not making eye contact or apologizing after this fiasco. The food is four stars. However, the service was appallingly horrifying which ruins the overall experience.
