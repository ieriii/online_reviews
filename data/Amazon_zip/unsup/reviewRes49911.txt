Wings are HUGE and delicious. The burgers used to be great, but I think the kitchen has been slipping a bit. Last two trips here my burger was ordered medium rare, and it has come out well done. Whoever was on the grill 2-5 months ago.....BRING HIM BACK. He knows how to grill. In addition, my pretzel bun wasn't toasted.
