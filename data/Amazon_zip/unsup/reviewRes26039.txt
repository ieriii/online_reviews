A cheese/meat/chocolate orgy in your mouth. Hurray for Groupon! I can finally somewhat afford this place. Yes, you will pay a lot of money to cook food yourself. Is it worth it? Yes. Start off with a pot of bubbling hot cheese. Dip your bread, grapes (yes grapes) and apples into the glorious cheese, and find that the best thing you may ever taste in your life is a cheese covered grape. Next move onto a boiling pot of oil to cook your meat and veggies. You have a nice selection here. You can stick with premium cuts of beef or chicken, or you can go with the good stuff: jumbo scallops and lobster tails. The veggies include all your favorites: broccoli, onion, mushrooms, peppers, and potatoes. This will also include a ginormous array of dipping sauces. Just when you think will explode from too much yum yum fun time....they bring out a large pot of melty chocolate...light it on fire and give you marsh mellows to cook in the fire...when you come to your senses and try to figure out what just happened, you will realize that you have just devoured a pot of chocolate and several marsh mellows, strawberries, and cherries...mmmmm Then the bill will come...I suggest you make a mad dash and don't bother getting your car from the valet....just run Forrest run! This is a perfect spot for you to impress your newly acquired girly friend to show her how much money you can spend on her. Also, it is very romantic with the guitar player and the lighting. If you are not trying to impress anybody, and want to experience the best of this place without paying a fortune, the following is up to you: Sit at the bar and order a wide selection of great wines. Take in the atmosphere and snack on the crocks of free cheese and crackers. I am a cheese and crackers guy...these rock! If you want to sit down at a table, I suggest you get yourself a nice glass of vino, and go with the cheese fondue only. This will give you some nice snacks to sample, and will not break your budget. Happy dipping!
