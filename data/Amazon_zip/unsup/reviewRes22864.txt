The portions here are pretty good. Nice spice to it. Prices aren't that expensive, especially when you think about the size of the dish. My main issue is how much oil is in the dishes O_O It looked like they just threw a bottle of oil in the pot and threw the spiciest shit they can find with it. Don't get me wrong, that oily stuff was tasty but I definitely had a stomach ache that night well into the next day. So if you don't mind feeling a some pain after your delicious greasy meal then I suggest this place. hahaha. Wow, this review sounds so bad even though it isn't my intention. Oh well.
