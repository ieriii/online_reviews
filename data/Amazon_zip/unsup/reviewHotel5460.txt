I was in Chicago in September with my mother for a mother/daughter Oprah weekend. Once I was 'Oprahed' out, which didn't take long I had the chance to enjoy this quiet and contemporary hotel. I don't know if we obtained a killer deal but the rooms were not all that expensive, the bathroom was huge with a gigantic tub and a separate shower, I love a separate shower. I believe this hotel used to be the La Meridian, but I could be wrong.  The rooms were large and the beds were comfortable, the sheets were a little scratchy I don't know if I have become spoiled but I was expecting nicer bedding. The staff was wonderful and very friendly. The hotel is located off of Rush Street in the Gold Coast area, which I have heard awful things about. It really wasn't that bad, I was there during the week so the weekends may be different. The shopping in the area is very high end along with most of the restaurants in the general vicinity. All in all I enjoyed my stay at the Davenport even with my crazy Oprah loving mother and her friends, I would stay here again.
