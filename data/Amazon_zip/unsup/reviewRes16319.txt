Picture it....Sicily 1935....I was dating a spanish artist who would someday be famous.....oh the food, the songs, the wine....I will never forget those times with Pablo.....but I digress, fast foward to Chicago, I stop in to Calo's afer arriving in the city not a week before.....to the sounds of a great band singing "Sweet Home Chicago".....and then the food came. Ahh, almost like being back in Sicily........
