Meh. I went here last night, and though I'm glad I've experienced it and can say I went here, I most likely won't return. The drink selection is fantastic, yes, and our waiter was really nice and helpful. But the food itself is just OK. I know some people are gaga for this shit, but to me it was just overpriced and pretentious. It seemed like a lot of the people eating there were rich people, eating there on a Saturday night because it was the "thing to do." But anyway, onto the food. We started with the bone marrow and the frogs legs. It's pretty cool that I can say I've eaten marrow, but really it was nothing special. All I could taste was the red onion jam, there was barely any marrow, and the toast was a little burnt. And why are we eating marrow anyway? Just for the sake of being different? Meh. The frogs legs were cooked in buffalo sauce, and really just tasted like chicken wings. I was hoping for more. For the entrees we ordered the pork belly and the pork shank. The pork belly was amazing and delicious, but the pork shank, described by our waitress as falling off the bone, was anything but falling off the bone. It was somewhat dry and very hard to cut off the bone, even with a seraded knife, and it had no flavor. The best part about it was the grits, collards, and chanterelles that it sat on top of! That's what I get I suppose, for ordering one of the less expensive entrees on the menu. Lame. Also, when we walked in the place was FILLED with smoke, like you could see it billowing everywhere. While it smelled great, I felt that was pretty inappropriate to have the dining room filling with smoke... it was kind of disgusting... they need to invest in some better ventilation. All in all, I would go here just to try it, but it's definitely not the kind of restaurant I'd keep coming back to. If you like to eat crazy shit and pay a lot for it, just for the sake of eating crazy shit and paying a lot for it, then you will probably love this restaurant.
