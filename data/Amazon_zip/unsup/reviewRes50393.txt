Fifty/50 has great food! I have eaten there multiple times and tried everything from their cheeseburgers and waffel fries to their wings and nacho appetizer. Everything is always good. They also have an insanely delecious Mac and cheese, my boyfriend likes to add bacon to it. It's not really our scene on the weekend nights, but great for eating and watching sporting events. Last night I watched the Bears game upstairs and they had $15 buckets, which was great for us. Definitely recommend this place for upscale bar food.
