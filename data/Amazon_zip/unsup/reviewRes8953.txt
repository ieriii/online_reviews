The food - hands down awesome and I don't like Italian food normally. But - I want to write about the service. My 3 year old peed on their floor because she was so entranced with their pizza and forgot to tell me to take her to the bathroom. It was horrifying and the staff at the restaurant was amazing! They cleaned it up (we tipped big - don't worry) and didn't make us feel terrible or humiliate my newly potty trained daughter. They deserve 100 stars but there was not an option.....It's likely we'll not go back until time has passed they don't recognize us......haha!
