When showing visitors the city, I generally take them to two types of places: places with general touristy interest and places beloved by locals. Green Mill, a rarity, fits in both categories. It has the history of Al Capone and Chicago's golden age of jazz. the lush, subtle decor echoes history without hitting you over the head with manufactured artifacts. It also has value, convenience and damn good music. Beer and wine are cheap. The cover charge is almost always low, and if you arrive early, good seats are easy to get. Green Mill is just steps from the Red Line el, so transportation's a cinch. Green Mill is romantic in its snug, dark, (dare I say) sexy atmosphere, and live jazz is a beautiful thing. Every person I've seen play the stage has been talented, eccentric and genuine. The acoustics are outstanding. The sound man is a gem, and the jukebox plays old records that have stood the test of time. I can't wait to go back.
