Really nicely executed pub concept... food is solid and the bar's focus on fine bourbons, whiskeys and bourbon/whiskey cocktails really tickles my inner Kentucky redneck. We arrived just in time for their switchover to the fall menu. Scallops were perfectly cooked, but the real star of that dish was the Oxtail braise -- tender but still wonderfully ropey in texture, superb beef flavor. Pork cheek was also very nice -- heirloom pigs and dates make for swell BFF's and, in my opinion, far too few places offer cooked endives which I definitely prefer over raw. The mains that we ordered were pretty standard... burger was solid, meat was quality enough to order rare, and while the brioche roll took the burger to another level of richness, the beef-fat fries really took it over the edge of reason. The boar sloppy joe was a bit too high-brow for our tastes... some comfort foods, especially those that evoke a strong sense of childhood lunchroom nostalgia, just don't end up in a better place when elevated. The place is very cozy, the kind of place most people could see themselves spending hours in. Staff is remarkably well-versed and professional, and the menu isn't super-affordable, but there are definitely some solid value items in there. Drinks are made with care and come stiff. Definitely a place worth returning to -- maybe often.
