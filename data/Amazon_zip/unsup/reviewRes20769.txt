I'm not sure this restaurant should live up to its hype. It was $11.50 for a "caldo" of carnitas. So I was excited, but then it came out and had about five piece of carnitas in it (very little for that price) and the broth was incredibly salty, to the point of making me wince when I ate it. The ordering system is awkward too... you pay at the time of ordering and give them your tip then?? I felt pressured to leave a tip before knowing how the food was (and it turned out to be worth less than the price on the menu). Blah.
