Big disappointment relative to the reviews here and word of mouth I've heard. When this place opened a few years ago, some of my trusted friends told me it wasn't worth my time, so I stayed away. Recently I heard better things and saw the 4-stars here. I was looking to try someplace new in Uptown and tried Tank. Both my friend and I were very disappointed in the food and the service. Food was bland and the contents of the pho and the noodle bowls were boiled to a soggy, flavor-deprived rubber. The service was mediocre, not super slow but not friendly either. We will not be back. Sad!
