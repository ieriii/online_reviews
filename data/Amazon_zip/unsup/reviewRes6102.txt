I have but one requirement of any steakhouse, and that is to simply cook my steak as I've asked. My request is unwavering and really easy: medium-rare. It should be red and warm in the center, throughout the piece of meat. I can cook my steak this way without fail. Actually, Outback can cook my steak like this without fail, and a handful of other steakhouses I've been to can do this without fail. Wildfire did not do this. I went to dinner at Wildfire a few weeks ago and ordered the filet with mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes were tasty, if a little room-temp and slightly pasty. It's okay, I actually kind of like the spackle thing, it helps me sop up juice on my plate. The piece of filet that was served to me was downright burned on the outside. It was, at best, medium for a few slices directly at the center of the piece of meat. Everything else needed red wine and mashed potatoes to swallow down. I would have mentioned something to our waiter, but he only swung by a moment after the food was delivered and then once again much later to ask if we would like dessert. Other things: - a friend of mine was without silverware and we had to flag down a busser to get a fork off the dessert tray - we were sat directly outside the kitchen area and by the dessert tray, so every few minutes I had to duck when the tray was lifted mere inches from my head - it was kinda loud in there, but I liked the atmosphere overall - the manager came over to say hello when he'd learned our party hadn't been to Wildfire before - the wine list was extensive and affordable, for the most part - the key lime pie was exceptionally good So overall, I'd say, eh. I would go back again if invited, but the impression left was just sorta ok. Didn't knock my socks off, but it seems like a reasonably good restaurant.
