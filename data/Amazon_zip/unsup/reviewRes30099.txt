My wife and I came to brunch at Frontera Grill the day after Thanksigiving. We arrived at 10:30am to find a line at the door. Limited reservations mean that most seating is first-come, first served. We were promptly seated upon arriving and the fun began. Service was great throughout with prompt check-ins, water glass refills, thorough explanations of items and specials, and overall good attentiveness. Now, let's get onto the food. The fresh-squeezed OJ and spiced coffee (with brown sugar) was a great way to start the day. We then tried the appeitizer sampler platter which included the cheese quesadilla, chicken taquitos, ceviche, and jicama salad. Everything on the platter was wonderful down to the gaucamole. The quesadillas were not your norm, with wonderful corn shells turned over great cheese. Taquitos were great and the ceviche was prefectly marinated marlin on small corn chips. A great start. For entrees, the hot corn cakes with agave syrup were terrific and the sapitos offered three little cakes,each topped with different things. One offered great scrambled eggs, one was chorizo, and one was grilled chicken with tomatillo sauce. The only downfall to one was that the tomatillo sauce was ice cold when drizzled over the chicken which cooled things down a bit. Overall wonderful food. The mezcal margarita was great and the service through the mexican hot chocolate at the end was wonderful. Highly recommend Frontera for bruch for something a bit off of the beaten path!
