Mmmmmmm... so good! Everything was wonderful! We showed up a bit early and were sent, by the hostess, next door for a free glass of champagne! What an awesome start! When everyone arrived, we were seated at a table toward the back wall. It's a small room, so there's really only one setting for a large party. The menu is a 3 course prix fixe for $60. There were 8 of us, so we pretty much tried everything on the menu and I didn't hear any complaints. Here's what I had: Started with the foie gras, which was very rich and smooth. Next was the hibiscus sorbet palate cleanser--light and cool; not too sweet. Then I had the short ribs; these were my favorite, but I am a short ribs fan. Next was a cheese plate, which was a really nice surprise, so I'm not going to say exactly what it was. But, there's a small slice of apple; beware if you are allergic (I am). For my dessert, I had the beet. Hmm... interesting. Chocolate ganache and pistachio ice cream were awesome. The beet texture was great too, but my friends' lemon jar looked a bit more fun and refreshing. The waitstaff was very pleasant and made sure to clear our plates as soon as everyone was finished. We even got to meet Dale! It's definitely pricey, but the quality is worth it. We bought discounted giftcards in advance, which amounted to about $20 less per person. But, I would go for a special occasion even if I had to pay full price.
