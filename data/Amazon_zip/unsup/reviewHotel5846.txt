So Surprising when we arrived, The staff was great, the rooms cleaned spotless every day and it seems that they gave you everything you would need during your visit. A real breakfast was included every morning, waffles, biscuits and gravy, eggs, cereal, fresh fruit, coffee and danish. The rooms have a fridge, microwave and a mini sink, The bathrooms are great. I was just more than impressed with my stay. The beds are a little on the firm side for me and it is my opinion and my skins opinion that they use a bit too much bleach on the linens. (Sensitive) Perfect location if you want to be in Chicago.
