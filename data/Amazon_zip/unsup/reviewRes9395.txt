I went to Sprout for brunch today and was not very impressed. When we arrived and walked through the front door the first things that struck me were that the air in restaurant was heavily perfumed and that they were playing M83 pretty loud. Now, I like M83 but I'm not a huge fan of it at brunch and not at sound levels which make it hard to maintain a conversation. Looking at the menu, I immediately got excited about the "Steak and Eggs". The menu described it being accompanied by: "Crab, Fingerling, Sunny Side Egg, Thai Basil, Sambal". "I like all of those things," thought my groggy brain, "Sold!". Now I suppose I could have asked how the dish was prepared but when it arrived it was not at all what I expected. There was a deep fried corn-battered piece of skirt steak on a mound of creamy fingerling potato salad, crowned with a poached egg and garnished with pickled cucumber and radish slices and cilantro. After cutting through the thick layer of corn meal breading to get my first bite of skirt steak I noticed that it looked like the meat was seared on the grill before being batter dipped and fried. The steak was well done and took some chewing to get it down. There were a few flakes of chili and black sesame seeds in the relish which might have been intended to be sambal sauce but there was so little of it that it wasn't discernibly spicy. Also, the Thai Basil advertised on the menu was no where to be seen. My dining partner had the Braised Short Rib Eggs Benedict and it was a much better dish than what I received. The beef was tender and flavorful and the hollandaise was high quality. While there may be other dishes on the menu that might have left a better impression on me, I don't believe the food at Sprout was at a level which justifies the price. I am looking forward to exploring other brunch options in Lincoln Park but I don't think I will be back to Sprout.
