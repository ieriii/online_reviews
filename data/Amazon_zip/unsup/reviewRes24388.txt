Whether this place is good or not is debatable.... I liked the concept of the fondue and thought the food was very good, however there is an interesting smell to the place and the food is fairly overpriced. The service was FANTASTIC! Our waitress was very nice and understanding and the busy boys never left our drinks empty. I LOVED the chocolate fondue at the end that gets lit on fire so you can roast your marshmallows. Unfortunately I was so stuffed I couldn't eat nearly as much as I wanted. I would definitely try this place again, but only after I save some money to buy dinner!
