Excellent Thai food here. Authentic food but made a bit sweeter for the western customers. Pad Thai is good, but tends to be wet. I prefer more dry, which requires longer cooking time to evaporate the excess moisture in the noodles. Minced pork with basil - they make very good and authentic here. A favorite Gang Keo Wan - great dish, tasty and authentic. one of my favorites. Masamun, panang, etc. - pretty good dishes, but sweeter and less authentic. Fried banana - this desert dish is great. Portions are a bit small. Portionwise, pricing it a bit more expensive than your average Thai restaurant. For consistent quality, nice clean ambiance and great service. I am rating this restaurant a 4.
