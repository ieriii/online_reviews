Quoted 1.5 hour wait turned into 2 hours until we were sat.... and another 45 minutes until eating. So, initially entering the restaurant at 7:30pm on a Saturday (table for 2) equated to eating dinner closer to 11pm. Awesome. Aside from the long wait, the service was terrible. Host with an attitude, not given utensils or napkins (half way through our appetizer I got sick of wiping my hands on the tablecloth and got up to get my own). Food was fine, nothing special, especially for the prices! $22 for box pasta with meatballs?!?! Fortunately the wine we brought was excellent - but of course had to wait too long for the waiter to open it. Won't return.
