This was probably my favorite brunch place so far in Chicago. The menu is a little overwhelming because there are so many options. It was hard to pick just one thing. I had some sort of crepe, and the portion was HUGE! Especially for how cheap it was. My server was Evelyn, she was amazing. I will be back for sure!
