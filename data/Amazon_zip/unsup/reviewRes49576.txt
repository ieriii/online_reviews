Wow, those were some incredible Mojitos. I will update my review in copious detail when the hangover dissipates. Live music... go on Thursday. I'm thinking some of the negative reviews are because the yelpster went on a Friday or a Saturday (busiest nights at any restaurant) with preposterously high expectations. Go on a weeknight- it'll be a favor for you, your date, the musicians, the server, the cooks all thank you for the gracious consideration with utter attention to detail. I mean really, on a quiet night have you ever encountered a burned entree? Thought not. Yum. The service was sublime, the Entraa (Highly recommended by the hostess, server, chef...) Steak was transcendant, I kept stealing the avacado from my date's vegetarian plate and he in turn tried to swipe steak from mine. Ahem. Notice I say "tried" because 1. I didn't leave much 2. I hope his hand doesn't hurt too badly where the fork got him. I think it says something when a man is willing to be stabbed repeatedly with a fork in a vain attempt to obtain a scrap of buttery, juicy, succulent, perfectly medium rare meat from a girl who's cute but not too willing to share the yumminess. We enjoyed the Mojitos- lots of crushed mint, lime and sugar. I can't imagine what something so scrumptious wouldn't go with. Though I was told the Mango Mojitos were the most delicious- I couldn't say, they were all out (they use fresh Mango, not the artificial stuff from a bottle or a powder packet). Next time, and there will be a next time... if PETA doesn't go after me for corrupting another vegetarian then stabbing him with a fork. (I paid for dinner. Does that make up for for my bad behavior?)
