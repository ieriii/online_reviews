We straight pigged out! So we ordered bruschetta, the beef "northsider" sandwich (lunch combo), and two mini deep dish pizza's (pepperoni & a pepperoni w/ sausage & spinach). After that meal I didn't want to see pizza again for the rest of the trip but now that we're back home in the bay... damn, I want one again! If you're coming for lunch be sure to check out the lunch special menu since it includes several of the regular menu items at discounted price. Also don't be in a rush since they make a lot of their dishes 'to order" so preparation will take some time. And lastly, enjoy the experience w/ a beer! My suggestion is a local beer like a Goose Island (Hoppers Ale!).
