I really like the vibe of Gilt Bar. We called to try to make a reservation on a Saturday night for four but was told there wouldn't be one until about 9 or 10 so could try to grab a spot in the bar area. My friends and I rolled in about 6:30ish and were seated in the middle of the restaurant which had a large wooden table and two couches - all for us. The darkness of Gilt Bar gives a mysterious yet inviting feeling that you just want to sit back and hang for a while. Drinks were good and the food was yummy. We ordered family style and the plates that stuck out were the bone marrow and the mushroom pasta and if I were to pick one of the two the bone marrow was terrific and a must. Waitress was attentive and nice. I would go back in a heart beat.
