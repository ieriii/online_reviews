Went here with my mom on a Thursday night and loved everything! I was early to dinner so I enjoyed the opportunity of people watching while I waited. There seemed to be a large party as the hostess kept directing people "left at the exit sign and up the stairs" everyone else was 28-40 somethings with the occasional sugar daddy and blonde accessory. Once seated the waiter was very attentive and patient as my mother played 20 questions over the menu. We ended up ordering:-Oxtail pot stickers- delicious and savory but not over sized-Loompya- mini egg rolls and bib lettuce with yummy creative sauces- much better than I expected and a very large portion (I'd say around 10 rolls)Specialty sushi rolls-Crunch Pig, Hidden Lobster- so flavorful and interesting. My favorite out of the the two we got-Firecracker- HOTHOTHOT- Waiter said it was hot but my mom and i thought we could handle the heat. Jalapenos and tempura shrimp? I cant exactly remember.Over all, for a non Sushi fanatic, I really enjoyed every part of the meal. I would definitely go again and recommend to everyone!
