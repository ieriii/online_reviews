The dinner portion of Probably The Most Fun Night I have had in Chicago. Our waiter, Mario, was a storyteller. The multi course Italian meal, starting with a loaf of bread and complimentary pizza bread, was delicious. The cocktails my lady friends enjoyed- yes, I dined with two lady friends, were praised. They had manhattans and negronis, for the record, the bar knows how to make a balanced cocktail. For entrees I had the spinach ravioli with cream and gorgonzola sauce- vegetarian and super rich. My girlfriend had the steak and her friend got stuffed veal. The place was pretty full on the late side of Wednesday evening. For dessert we got the baked Alaska for two. Mario told us about baked Alaskas past. The maitre D lit the meringue on fire.
