When I go to a restaurant the first thing I check out is the atmosphere. I like small intimate places. Crisp is small and with its picnic style community tables you can't get any more intimate than this, plus you will be elbow to elbow with people cause this place is packed always. Second thing I notice is the wait time. When I go out to eat I am usually beyond starving when I get there. At Crisp I am maybe waiting 10 minutes before the food arrives...thats whats up. Third thing I check out and maybe the most important thing is the food. There are no words in the English language to describe the perfectly cook food I have eaten time and time again at Crisp. The people are friendly and nice (don't let the hipster vibe intimidate you) the food is impeccable and you'll never have to wait that long to be fed. If you don't know now you know!
