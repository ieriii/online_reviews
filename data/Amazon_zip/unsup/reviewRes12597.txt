Meat, meat, meat! Whenever I think of texas de brazil I think of the first time I came here with a couple brothers from my fraternity. I was blown out of my mind and had some mad munchies going on. I devoured meat nonstop for a good 1.5 hours. Whatever the waiters were bringing around, I was having. It was my first time at a Brazilian steakhouse so I did not really know how everything worked. Everything tasted good to me and I couldn't stop stuffing my face. When it was all said and done though, I felt like I was going to die. My friends kept eating and I couldn't understand how. I couldn't even drink water I was so full. I have been back there multiple times since then and sober and it's hit the spot every time. If you like meat, come here.
