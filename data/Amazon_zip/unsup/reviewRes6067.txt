Our reservation was at 7pm and when we got there, we still had to wait about 15 minutes to get seated. Granted it was a Saturday night but the main dining room was really, really loud. I could barley hear the server. It was also very warm in the booth where we sat. Our server was around and then would disappear. It seems like the bus boys and kitchen runners do more work than the servers but our water was always filled and plates were cleaned off the table quickly. The food was delicious, as always. I had the Alaskan Cod special and my husband had the Tuna Steak. Both were perfectly cooked. Our dinner-mates also loved their food. We split a chopped salad, which was refreshing and light. My husband got the soup of the day - clam chowder and although it tasted good, it was really thin and lukewarm. I love thick, chunky soups so it was a little disappointing. Atmosphere and Service = 2 stars Food = 4 stars
