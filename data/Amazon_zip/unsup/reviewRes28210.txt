Have been here many times but last two or three times have been very disappointing. I hear the best thing to get is the tacos. The fajitas de res were not fajitas but only strips of beef from a roast with way too many vegetables. However the refried beans with sprinkles of Mexican cheese and serving of guacamole was good. Before that, I had the huachenango al mojo de ajo and that was not a good experience either. The fish was extremely dry. Considering both of these dishes cost more than $15 each, I'd say it's about $10 per plate too expensive.
