My host described this as "arguably the best Italian food in Chicago.". We got the price fixe menu. The short of it: It wasn't, it was mediocre at best. It wasn't bad, mind you. It was just wasn't that great, and if you do "conventional" Italian you've got tons of competition. You can tell a lot about Italian restaurants from the quality of the bread and the quality of the olive oil and canned tomatoes. None of these was above average so all the food tasted blah. If it were cheaper it would be okay but they charge a lot for medium food. I see they have variations of this restaurant all over Chicago. Did it used to be better?
