One thing I love about Bon soiree is their unpretentious dining room, a bit blah, but still unpretentious. I do not believe in a dining that's over done or over shadows the food. Your dining room should set expectations of what the food would be like, and the food at Bonsoire does exactly that as well. It is unpretentious, but also quite blah. I felt like for what we were paying we could have had something better at other restaurants of better caliber. But with all that being said, I love what this place is doing and I think the exec. Chef is definitely on his way up because he seems to have the right idea, he just needs to go boldly into expressing them. The service was great, and the outdoor Patio was also quite nice.
