"Can you brush some olive oil all over my meatballs" Such a statement can only mean two things....you're either soliciting a hooker from uptown or you're ordering a pretty damn good pizza at piece...both are quite tempting, but I would rather do the latter. Its pretty awkward to say that the best pizza (so far) that I've had in Chicago is a thin crust pizza, but dammit, the crust, the toppings, the sauce, not to mention the beers...are pretty damn tasty bro The spot:  Its in Wicker Park, kinda like san francisco maybe a little LA, but definitely a plethora of eclectic folks roaming around blended in with a few sports fans...all in all a good mix of people. Its a big space, but this places can get crowded hella quick. The food:  I got the italian sausage and banana peppers in my pizza (get your head out the gutter)...and i also tried meatballs with basil, which is my favorite combo. The crust is very thin but a tad fluffy in the middle. Not too much cheese on top, but the red sauce is what makes it hella good. I think they just put the right amount of garlic, tomatoes, and oregano in there to make it pretty flavorful.  Haven't tried the white or the plain versions yet, but definitely on my next visit. The Beer: The beers are pretty good. Very unique, though being a beer aficianado, there's better stuff out there....not to say Piece's beer isn't great. My two favorites are the Golden Arm and the Worryin Ale. Both aren't too hoppy and are smooth, not too much carbonation. Next time I wanna try the Fornicator...thats right its called the Fornicator =p. yay yay Overall i would give this place 4.5 to 5 stars. Cmon its good beer and on top of that even better pizza Piece Pizza....me so hungry, me love you long time ^_~
