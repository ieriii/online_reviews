This has always been my favorite restaurant in Greek Town. The environment is perfect with a Greek village theme, the accents and even a steep GREEK HILL which tables climb their way up. My favorite table is at the top, except taking a bathroom break can be a hassle, yet a good way to work off their delicious burning Saganaki cheese. I love their weekly specials and their pastichio and mousaka "lasagna" and the lemony Lake Superior White Fish. If you're less experimental, the 1/2 broiled chicken is very moist. All their dishes come with great carb sides of rice and potatoes! If you have a big Greek family, as in the movie My Big, Fat, Greek Wedding (ah what a great flick!), then do the family style dinners for a good deal. A few downfalls would be: -The wait that often may require you to wait a half an hour or more. -Stern/serious (not necessarily rude) waiters is not uncommon, perhaps it's cultural. -Recently, I guess they were shut down for a few days due to health inspection findings. Hmmm now it's still busy as heck so something changed. This won't lose me as a customer! As with all the Greek restaurants, free valet parking is a plus (well it's not truly free since you have to tip).
