If you don't give 5 stars, you're crazy.I used to live in the Andersonville neighborhood, and Calo is by far the place I miss the most. The service is friendly; take-out and eat-in are both pure pleasure. The pizza bread is so warm and tasty, and the pastas are always yummy. But the gem of this joint is the minestone. I have never craved soup like I do now, and nothing satisfies that like Calo! The wine list is great with a nice price range presented. One more amazing thing about this place is its hours. After Christmas shopping all day downtown, getting caught in a snowstorm, and fighting for a cab for 45 minutes, it was a delight to find out Calo was open late. And serving soup.
