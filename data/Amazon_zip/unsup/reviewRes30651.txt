I've been to this place twice now. Both times was an overall great experience.  The service is impeccable. The staff is very friendly/helpful. Really makes for an overall pleasant experience. I've had both the lobster cocktail and the sauteed sea scallops as appetizers. Cold lobster in general freaks me out (my boss ordered it,) but it was still delicious. This place popped my scallops cherry and basically left me speechless. I am in love! I don't know if it was the AMAZING sauce they were in, but holy cow- so effing good. I ordered my steak medium-rare both times, and they were cooked to perfection.  As far as sides, I have had the garlic mashed potatoes, the twice baked potato, creamed corn, and roasted brussel sprouts. I can say one thing about all of the sides- I've had better. That is why I took off one star.The side orders are bigger portions, so it's good to order one or two and share. As far as dessert- the pecan pie with their homemade whipped cream is TO-DIE-FOR! So save room for dessert. They aren't stingy on their drinks like most places. The Strawberry Fields cocktail is very, very good. Another reason for the 4 star rating- the very, very dark atmosphere in the bar area. The upstairs has is right with the lighting, but the bar area makes you think you are at the movie theater or something. Waaaaay to dark. Overall, this place is a great place to wine and dine every once in a while. Be prepared to put a hole in your wallet. I still prefer Tavern for the whole package.
