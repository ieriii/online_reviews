I was excited to visit Big Jones as I had heard great things about the place. Upon arrival, I was impressed by the aesthetic and atmosphere. We were immediately seated at a table by the kitchen. Not a great a table as the staff seems to congregate by the kitchens' window. The lighting is horrible. We had a spotlight glaring down at our table. It was quite distracting. Our waiter was less then friendly but not rude. My friend inquired about the vegetarian selection and to his dismay, the waiter explained he was vegan and never tried anything on the menu. My suggestion to the waiter is to just fake it and make a suggestion based on advice from the kitchen and previous guest. My friend ended up eating a dinner salad as his entre. We were kind of surprised by the poor selection of vegetarian items on the menu, after all it is Andersonville. My shrimp burger was ok, not memorable. The owner was eager to hear about our experience. Hopefully, he will continue to seek out comments and concerns, as the restaurant needs some fine tuning.Big Jones, you get two stars. One star for the atmosphere of the dinning room, despite our spotlight. A second star because you're new and have the potential to turn things around. Good Luck!
