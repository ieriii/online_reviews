We were told there was an hour and thirty minute wait (7:30 on a Friday night), so we went to the bar for a margarita. To our surprise, thirty minutes later we had a table for two in the dining room. We got the appetizer sampler, which was a great way to explore a few of their tasty starter options at once. They said it had a 'little' guacamole but it had a pretty decent sized glob which made me happy (it was delicious).  I had a michelada and my wife had a champagne margarita, both were delicious but not the type of drinks you could sip on all night. We both got tacos, fish and pork, per the waiter's recommendations and they were outstanding. My only compliant was that the little bean sides that came with the tacos weren't that impressive - I expected something more unique or exciting. Overall, this is a must go place and you're going to be satisfied when you leave. For the price ($120 total for app, 2 mains, 4 drinks) its a steal and a great experience.
