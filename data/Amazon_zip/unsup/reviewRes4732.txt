Bruce Buffer: Ladies and Gentleman, we aaarrrrree live in Chicago. This is the Main event for UFC XXIV$*&? This is the moment you have been waiting for. It's TIME! Standing in this corner, at 5 foot 1, weighing 350 pounds, with 1004 yelp reviews, top chef masters appearance, and James Beard nomination.... AKA Notorious P.I.G. The Purple Piiiigg! Standing in this corner, at 5 foot 2, weight 180 pounds combined, with 1028 yelp reviews, winner of Top Chef... Giiiirrrrl and the Goat! Announcer: This is going to be close match up. Girl and Goat being a fan favorite with 4.5 stars on yelp. She has lots of charisma. And for some reason, Chicagoans love goats. FIrst with Billy Goat and now Girl and Goat. Purple Pig, the under-pig of the night, being more of the veteran in this circuit, you just have to wonder about stamina. Both have very similar fighting styles. However Purple pig has some weight on the goat, and will try to pin the goat down into submission. The Goat has to keep moving, avoid being grappled at the legs, and dish out some headbutts and jabs. Fast Forward... And we have a winner. Purple Pig puts a death grip around the Goat's belly until the Goat cannot breathe. He squeezes to the point of incontinence.
