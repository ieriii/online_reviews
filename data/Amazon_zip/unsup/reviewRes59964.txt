This place is amazing! Great service and an excellent dining experience. I discovered Las Tablas through a groupon that a friend shared with me. We went on a week night and were seated immediately. The staff was incredibly friendly and very helpful at making suggestions and explaining the menu. We both had the Combinaciones with their Entrana skirt steak and grilled shrimp. It was delicious! The steak was cooked perfectly and the sauces were very flavorful. I also had a Refajo which was a new and tasty experience for me. I can't wait to bring my husband here. He will love it!
