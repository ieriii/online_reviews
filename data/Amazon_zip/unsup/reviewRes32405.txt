So I know it's like the vegan mecca. I've been here a lot and I always love the food. The service is usually ok, but last time I went my server was a joke and I brought my newly vegan friend with. I was thinking he was going to be impressed but the service was so pathetic it took away from the whole experience. Now he thinks Chicago Diner sucks. Oh well, it was just one bad experience for 10 good ones. I love everything I've ever had here, but the ruben stands out and the desserts are all good. Moderate prices. It's small, you might have to wait for a table on a busy weekend, but just do it, its good.
