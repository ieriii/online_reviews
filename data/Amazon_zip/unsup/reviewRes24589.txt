Well, I can't say a whole lot about this place. I'll try... It's dark, smells like grease (which you'll smell of once you leave), expensive, okay service and it's - fondue. Fondue. Like the stuff that was a all the rage in the 70's. You dip your apples, veggies, bread and meat in their sweet*ish* fondue cheese sauce. You can also cook your own meat (selection of poultry, red meat and seafood) in a vat of hot oil that is put onto your table. Then there's the chocolate fondue for dessert. Eh. I'd prefer a hamburger.
