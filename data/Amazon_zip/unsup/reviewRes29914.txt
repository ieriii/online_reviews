Loved it! In Chicago for work, when dinner plans cancelled. Went alone to Frontera Grill and waiting about 30 minutes for a seat at the bar. While waiting I met two others who were alone and waiting for a seat, we ate together and shared some apps. Food was delicious. Loved the ceviche trio and the mole sauce was excellent. Had a cucumber mojito, which was completely refreshing on a hot summer day and also had his signature beer. Also fantastic. Worth the wait. I am actually going back tonight.
