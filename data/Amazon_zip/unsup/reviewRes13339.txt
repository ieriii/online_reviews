folks, let me offer a tip. DON'T go to revolution brewing co. on a saturday night. you will hunger, you will thirst, you will WAIT and WAIT and WAIT in hopes of getting a table.  you will show up, be quoted a TWO HOUR WAIT, be drawn in with the enticement of bacon popcorn and awesome food, and go across the street to cole's to drink cheap beers and wait it out. and because you will wait for TWO HOURS EXACTLY, you will drink a lot of cheap beers at cole's and be voraciously hungry once you get to rev brew co. when you are finally seated, it will be 10 PM yet the restaurant will still be packed. you will have a difficult time ordering since there are so many great options to choose from -- but you'll order more beer and appetizers and THE MUSSELS. get the mussels. steamed with beer and then wash it down with beer.  such a fantastic place for dinner. the only con is that the wait (and the subsequent 2 hour stint at cole's) doesn't always fit in my schedule for the evening.
