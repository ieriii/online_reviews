Wow, what a unique place! I had the Greek yogurt with honey and walnuts for a midnight snack with one of my girlfriends. She ordered the bread pudding, which was heaven on earth. Sure my Greek yogurt was probably something I could have made on my own at home, but the atmosphere at Artopolis is worth the trip. The selection of specialty desserts was awesome, but I try not to eat super sugary stuff. A sweets lover would be in heaven. I can't wait to bring my boy here and share some sweets! I will be back!!!
