Great place to eat when you want BBQ! I love the fact that they let you cook it in front of your table. I had a friend from out of town come visit who loves Korean BBQ and my sister come with (who is not a fan of Korean food.) but both enjoyed very much! There's a wide variety of side dishes that come with your BBQ . Not to mention, we had some sake! One of my acceptable late night food joints!
