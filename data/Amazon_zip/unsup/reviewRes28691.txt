Everything was pretty decent. The drinks were mixed perfectly, the ingredients were top notch and cooked to perfection and arrived quickly, the service was attentive. But few dishes were outstanding (we took a tapas approach instead of ordering entrees). Many dishes that featured meat suffered from a lack of balance - they needed more grains or vegetables to really make the dish enjoyable and complete. I love meat, but I got tired of eating it here. A handful of dishes came out mostly lukewarm, like they'd been prepared earlier and waited. The food prices weren't outrageous, but drinks were (probably on par with other nice bars downtown, though), but they were fairly expensive. We were hardly surprised by the wait - we arrived at about 4:40 (the restaurant opens at 5 most days) and were seated around 6:15 (and that's with a little bump up the list for being on our honeymoon). When we left, newcomers were being told three hours. As I said, absolutely nothing was bad, but nothing was excellent, and the food was by no means worth the very long wait, the incredibly crowded restaurant, and the higher prices. I'm not sure how the restaurant could better deal with many of these issues, given how outrageously popular it is, but I'll do my part to help out by not returning.
