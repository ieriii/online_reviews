I went here last night with some friends who I haven't seen in awhile. We started off with some guac and some ropa vieja-but they brought us the large guac and I don't remember specifying which we wanted. Anyway, only a minor annoyance. The appetizers came right away, before our drinks even, which usually annoys me, but my friends didn't seem to mind because they were starving. Then we ordered and I had the churrasco, and everyone else ordered something different so it was cool to see a lot of the menu items displayed that night. I thought the service was good, but the food comes out WAY too fast here. I do not like when you are spending a lot of money on food, to feel rushed. I know we were a litlte late for our reservation but the place was NOT that busy. Regardless, the food was good, and I will most likely return to try some of the other menu items. Drinks are also very good here-I had some margaritas and a glass of Malbec. Overall a pleasant evening, I just wish the food didn't come out so fast. Sometimes you want to really savor your experience when dining out.
