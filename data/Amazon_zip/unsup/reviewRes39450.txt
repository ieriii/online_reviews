Wow, I was quite amazed by this place, and have continued to be on all of my subsequent trips back to this fine establishment. I had heard about the GQ "top new restaurants" accolade. What I wasn't prepared for was how casually the bartender dropped the knowledge on me that this place also was awarded a Michelin star. And wow did it earn that star. I have been for dinner and also for brunch now on several occasions. The house potatoes that accompany a number of the brunch dishes have to be the best I have ever had, anywhere--I'm talking scavenging the plate looking for the last tiny bits good. The crab benedict is amazing, the burger is unreal, and of course the pretty extensive beer menu doesn't hurt either. To summarize, amazing food served in a delightful and unassuming environment. Next time I'm trying the chicken & waffles..
