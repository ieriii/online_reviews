PORK & BEER. That's what this place is about. Sitting inside reminds me of sitting in a pig-themed, modern German beer hall. One large wrap around bench and some side booths.  They have tons of different, fine beers to choose from and pork cooked all ways. If you don't like pork or pig fat then go somewhere else. Make sure to bring some aspirin and your doctor friends 'cus you're gonna have a heart attack. Oink!
