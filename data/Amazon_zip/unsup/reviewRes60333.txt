My boyfriend and I stumbled upon this sushi restaurant when we were looking for a good BYOB place in my new neighborhood. This is by far the BEST sushi I have ever had! The Sashimi is so fresh that it melts in your mouth. The prices are a little higher than other local sushi bars, but they are still reasonable and it is worth every penny!The staff is very attentive and friendly. The atmosphere is great...the music is VERY loud, but surprisingly, it works. The music helps drown out those sitting next to you, providing a surprisingly intimate dining experience.
