Doug is such a nice guy! My fiance and I arrived at the Hot Doug's counter fishing out smashed dollar bills from our pockets to see if we had enough to buy two of the speciality dogs. It was the "Doug" himself at the counter who told us it would be no problem if we didn't have quite enough. I didn't really think he was serious and proceeded to count out the money. It turned out that we did have enough for the dogs. He then asked us if we wanted fries or drinks and of course we said "no and no"--since we didn't have the money (either with us or in our bank accounts). Doug then asks us if we would have wanted fries if we had had enough money. We mechanically (and enthusiastically) said yes. At this point, I actually started counting out the remaining two dollars and change to see if we had might just have enough for some fries. I didn't have to. God...I mean, Doug, immediately says that we will be getting fries with our food and then tells us to help ourselves to drinks...for free! He does this without a moment's hesitation! Wha'??? I mean, WHO THE HECK does that these days? WHO!?!?!???? I was really touched at what an amazingly nice guy he was and how disinterestedly generous he was. Judging from the amount of people in there he could probably afford it. But still, it is almost unheard of for people to be that generous these days. Needless to say Hot Doug's is a wonderful place, with great people, very cool atmosphere, and obviously the hot dogs are dee-licious. Thank you Doug for being so nice to us. And by the way, although you didn't know this, it was my fianc's birthday that day...so double thanks! These two broke kids LOVE YOU! b+c
