Edit #2: They canceled our redo dinner 2 hours before. We did not reschedule.----------------------------------------------------------Edit #1: The restaurant staff did call me the next week to apologize for our experience. They offered to have us back to the restaurant to try again...which I thought was was very nice. Will update review after the second experience._________________________________________________________We went to schwa last night and had *hands down* the worst dining experience we have ever had in Chicago. I can overlook the fact that they cancelled our Thursday reservation 2 hours before dinner. At least they rescheduled us for the next day...annoying, but tolerable.The restaurant has a reputation for a laid back, laisseze faire attitude when it comes to service. Wonderful. However, last night, Carlson and his servers were not just obviously high and intoxicated. They were past the point of functioning. The chef alternated between making out with multiple women in the kitchen and sleeping on the prep table. His helpers were in no better shape. We went 2 hours without wine or water. They skipped a course - the main meat course - then denied they skipped it. Multiple patrons walked into the kitchen trying to obtain service and drinks. Overall, we were there 5 1/2 hours and left hungry and sober. They even had the absolute gall to charge us full price for a dinner experience that was beyond painful. We should have left without paying the check. I hope they use the money towards a stay in rehab...The best part of the evening? Carlson and one of his minions getting in a fist fight in the kitchen. Why? Because diners dared to complain about dinner. I think it is time for schwa to close its doors again.
