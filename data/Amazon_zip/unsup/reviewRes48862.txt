if i were to review the beer list & food only it would shoot past 5 stars & linger on a solid 10. however the place is confused. it's trying really hard to be casual -- so hard it's frighteningly uptight. came in on a friday w/o making reservations (our mistake). we drank, snacked, waited & waited. sat down at 10 to 10 already a little full from the assorted beer & snacks. ordered a variety of things any way. was it worth it? absolutely.
