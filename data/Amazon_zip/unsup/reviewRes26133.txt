This place is goodness in my mouth. Its byob with no corking fee...yes please! The dumplings were amazing, as well as the mahi! The staff was attentive and didn't care that we were there for 3 hours (we finally felt bad when they started putting the chairs up). The food is presented amazingly and is uniquely tasty. I will definitely be returning to this little piece of heaven.
