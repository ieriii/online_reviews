I may just be a silly Southern boy, but I still can't stop thinking about the mango shakes they serve here. And the hot perfect green salsa they serve from a ketchup bottle. Enormous sandwiches dripping with avocados and other Guatemalan goodies. Plantains. And all the cool Wicker Park folk that eat there, hipster musicians and such (maybe too turn of the century knowledge?)... Just a great place for lunch or dinner or for sitting outside after another Cubs day game victory!
