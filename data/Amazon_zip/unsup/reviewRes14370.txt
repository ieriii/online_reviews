A mix of high and low notes. Went to Revolution for the first time on a Wednesday evening as a party of 3. Promptly seated and greeted. Our server, Jessica, was wonderful and our water glasses never made it below half-full. An awesome space, mega clean bathrooms, and great music. We all ordered a local brew on tap. All were delicious and at the right price. The low notes started to hit once the food arrived. My partner and I ordered the tempeh reuben and it was a major fail. The tempeh was seasoned in some sort of chili spice rub, thickly cut, and stacked too high. I was hoping for a thinner cut and a sweeter spiced flavor. The sauerkraut was heated and not grilled. It would have been nice with grilled onion in the mix as well. The cheese, bread, and sauce were just fine. I have had many a vegan reuben and this was by far my least favorite. Perhaps a few tips can be taken from the Chicago Diner reuben masterminds.  Our friend ordered the Italian Seitan pizza and seemed to like it just fine. No major raves though. The true stars were our french fries and mashed potatoes---and that is somewhat sad to have to say.  Overall, a good experience and a menu worth a little more exploring. I want to love Revolution and have heard nothing but great things about it, so I will 100% be back to give it another chance.
