This is my go-to place for Vietnamese food. It is amazing the amount of food they give you for the price & BYOB is plus. The most precious family runs this place, who are always thankful and gracious when we come in. I love all the fresh ingredients & that they give you a plate of fresh fruit at the end of each meal. I tend to go to this place a lot and my order is always evolving, but if you've never had the beef Pho, you will not be disappointed.
