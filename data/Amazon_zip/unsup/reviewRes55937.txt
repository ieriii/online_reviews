Disgusting. I am confused at all the positive reviews. First, when my friends, family, and I walked in, the restaurant had this strange aroma of old cheese and funeral home. Second, the bread, the bread at an ITALIAN restaurant, tasted like the strange scent we smelled as we walked in the door. I took one bite and stopped...I don't think I've ever done that in my life with Italian bread. So that was just a sign of things to come...here's what happened next.Over the strange background music that sounded like a haunted house, I decided to split with a friend the chicken vesuvio and risotto with porcini mushrooms. Chicken was dry, two of the three potatoes I ate were alright (not saying much because everything tasted bad), the risotto tasted strange and strangely seasoned. A friend had the chicken Parmesan and she said not so good. My brother had gnocchi, which I tried and had so much cheese on it, I only tasted cheese and not the pasta. My cousin had polenta, which she said was decent, but she said the minestrone soup she ordered may have been the worst she's ever had. Another friend has the sun-dried tomato raviolis with mascarpone cheese, how could they mess up a plate with mascarpone that usually saves dish...I know, use reconstituted sun-dried tomatoes that hadn't quite been reconstituted so they were dry and hard to chew and swallow. I cannot believe that we paid for the disgusting items placed in front of us, never again. Definitely not Italian run. Save your nose and stomach and don't go.
