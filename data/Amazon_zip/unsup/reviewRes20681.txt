My friend recommended this place for late night drinks, since she lives down the street. The place was bustling with the corporate folk and tourists. It was pretty spacious on a Monday night. We grabbed a bar table towards the back and hung around for a while. I tried a ginger cocktail (too weak) and a seasonal beer on top. I didn't try any food but this place seemed pretty standard with good service.
