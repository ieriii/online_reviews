I love it when places have a hamburger with a fried egg on it. Those foods comprise about 20% of what I eat, ever, but are nevertheless an uncommon pairing. Sausage and hamburger? Yes. Bacon and hamburger? Frequently. Bacon and eggs? Of course. Yet, never hamburger and egg. Nice, airy space, frequent top-offs of hot coffee, and attractive dishes sailing around everywhere. Large bathrooms. I get the sense this place gets pretty packed, but it was pretty sedate at 7:20 am. Would definitely go back.
