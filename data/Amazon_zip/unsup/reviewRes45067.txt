Only recently have I pulled my mouth away from plates of pasta to pay attention to the meat and fish entrees-- and thus I wish I were a professional eater. Instead I leave Anteprima now looking like a disheveled Oscar Meyer wiener, due to massive wine and food consumption. Several things to know when going as a novice: -Quartinos of wine are priced proportionately the same as bottles, so you do not save money by not ordering full bottles. -A wiser or more frugal person than I would thus drink only what they need (i.e. less than a bottle). I use this reality to do large scale comparative wine tasting-- Primitivo vs. Nero D'Avola! Yay! -Get the sampler appetizer of starters from above. It is always refreshing and delicious. -Other than the rubbery bucatini, all of the house made pastas are EXCELLENT. My husband and I went to Rome in August during the national holiday, ate pasta, came back and went to Anteprima-- and found its strozzapretti amatriciana better than (off-season) Rome. -The tuna is MIND-BLOWINGLY GOOD. -End with the laurel liqueur. Wow.
