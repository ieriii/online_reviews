I haven't been here in a while, but I still consider it one of my top three choices in the chicagoland for hot dogs. Everything from the service, presentation, and taste are all done to perfection. I love the decor of the place, the drive in atmosphere, as well as the famous dancing hot dogs on the roof. Every time I come here I always get the whoopski dog. This thing will never get old in my book and will forever rock my world. i love hot dogs.
