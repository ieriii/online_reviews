We went for a relatively early dinner on a weekend evening. When we arrived the place was not very crowded, but, by the time we left the tables had been filled. The first floor consists of a dining room and a dark bar area with a relatively long bar (a number of folks were sitting at the bar and eating) and several tables for drinks and food. We were seated promptly after we arrived (we had reservations) in the upstairs dining area (aka Siberia), which seemed quieter than the downstairs dining area. The tables were set far enough apart that we were not forced to be unwilling participants in other tables' conversation and the noise level was such that we did not have to shout across the table to carry on our own conversation. Service was efficient and professional. Bread was brought and finished items cleared unobtrusively. We paced ourselves during the meal and started with oysters and a shrimp cocktail. The shrimp cocktail was very good (but the shrimp were not as large as the ones we've had at EJs or Prime One Twelve).  The steak was very good and the sides, especially the lobster mashed potatoes and brussels sprouts (sauteed with pancetta), are highly recommended. The butter cake dessert was exceptional. The wine list was, as one might expect, red heavy (we had a California Cabernet Sauvignon).
