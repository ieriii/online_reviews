Longest wait for food ever. 20 minutes to heat up an already made empanada? The kitchen definitely needs some restructuring, as the two female cooks who handle the 4 hot items on the breakfast menu cannot handle reheating empanadas and bread pudding and constructing sandwiches. I've worked in restaurants, I know that it can be hectic, but this is completely ridiculous. The bad service is overshadowing the experience of the food. I can't even imagine what it would be like to wait for lunch, and I probably will never go for lunch because of my negative experiences with breakfast. It's disappointing to say the least. I'm sure a lot of people were excited for this place to open; exactly what Chicago needs right now, but the service will definitely keep me from coming back. The only employee that I've had a positive experience with is the cute pregnant girl at the register, she is a doll.
