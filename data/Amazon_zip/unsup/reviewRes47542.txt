The service? 5 stars. Ambiance? 5 stars. Food? 2 stars. It seems that maybe we picked a bad night or something based on the rest of the reviews here.The items on the harvest table all were pretty bland and tasteless I felt. My GF and I tried to pick a variety of items from the table and neither one of us wanted to go back for a 2nd helping on anything we tried. In fact, we didn't finish our plates for any item we grabbed. The meats were fine. Nothing spectacular by any means and when the bill is north of $200 with a bottle of wine, I hope to be wowed just a bit more. As other people have stated, the service is phenomenal. The decor is really great. The amount of positive food reviews on here might convince me to give this place another try, but I'm definitely hesitant.
