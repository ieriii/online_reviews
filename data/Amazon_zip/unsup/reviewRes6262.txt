There are not enough amazing things that I could say about this restaurant. I went there with 3 girlfriends for my birthday dinner last night and had one of the best dining experiences I have ever had. Not only was the staff SUPER friendly and helpful (helping 4 girls decide what to eat is a feat in itself) but they treated us like we were one of the family! The chef was fantastic, and came to talk to our table multiple times. I felt as if it was an endless supply of the best Italian food I have ever had. We ordered a dish from every part of the menu, and couldn't stop eating the food. I swear, food coma even today. I loved every minute of our experience at DaVanti. I would HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend this restaurant to both a group of people looking to share some delicious Italian food or even a couple looking for an intimate, cosy date spot. I am so happy I celebrated my birthday there. Recommendations: Vasi: Ricotta + honey comb Boards: Focaccia di Recco Antipasti: grilled asparagus+ black pepper+,ascarpong+ pickled rhubarb Truffle egg toast+fontina+asparagus- OMG if you love truffles like I do, this is something you want every day of your life Insalata: roasted corn+ walnuts+ aged goat cheese+arugula+wild mushrooms Paste: Uovo in Raviolo 'San Domenico'- (we had 2 and they were UNREAL) Raccheri con Saldiccia e Pomodori al forno (giant rigatoni with sausage- heaven) Pizze: Pizza con Prosciutto e Rulola- Prosciutto pizza- to die for We also had the most delicious deserts in the world. The pumpkin gelatto was unreal. Also, the chocolate mousse and vasi with gelatto were to die for. I can't pick a favorite because they were all so good. We ordered was too much food, but we ate it all. All in all- I am going to be making MANY more trips to little Italy and tell everyone I know about this place. SO GOOD
