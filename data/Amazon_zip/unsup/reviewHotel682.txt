Stayed here for a convention and I walked away very impressed and pleased! The staff is very friendly and professional. The rooms are spacious with comfy beds. My room had two doubles with each bed decorated by five soft pillows each. Tenth floor has an indoor pool, gym room, guest laundry (1$ for each load. Front desk has free detergent and laundry sheets), & microwave. The restaurant, Le Viand, even offers Turducken as a special every once in a while! The hotel is centrally located and just a few blocks from Hancock Tower, Navy Pier, and lots of great food shrines!
