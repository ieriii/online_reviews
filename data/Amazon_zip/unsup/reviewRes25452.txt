I am a big fan of this place. I have been going to Artopolis for over 10 years and can't say enough about the atmosphere. I can come here in sweats to grab breakfast or I can come in a black suit and feel comfortable either way. They have really great egg lemon soup, different pitas filled with different things and a good selection of lunch/dinner items. I prefer the potato salad over the pasta salad as a side. Great dessert selection that is very good but a little pricey. All in all a nice casual cafe where you are bound to be satisfied!
