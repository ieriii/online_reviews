Came here on a Sunday morning, at about 8:30am. We saw my sister begin the Hot Chocolate race, and then while she was running her behind off in that race, my parents, brother-in-law and niece and nephew went to have a hearty breakfast. Works for me. We got in and got a table in about 5 minutes. The place was PACKED. Families, 20- somethings, seniors, young moms, couples, college kids with their parents, every type of person was there. Even a few who were dining along. There was a great kids menu with really AWESOME, what- kids'- dreams- are- made- of selections such as Oreo Pancakes, caramel french toast, etc. DO NOT bring a child here is you want them to have oatmeal with fresh fruit, because they will get an eyeful of what other people are eating and have a meltdown. The breakfast menu is huge, and playful, and lots of options, and servings are large and very filling. Keep in mind that because the crowds here are so large, your waitress/ server is probably not bubbly and sweetsy- they're just trying to get everyone served, and the orders accurate. They're just fairly no-nonsense here. Once we were seated, it looked like the line went from 5 minute wait to 50 minute wait. The line went out the door and around the corner. If you find yourself along South Michigan Ave. in the morning- stop in here. It's a "wow" breakfast!
