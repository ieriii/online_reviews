There's always a line around the block for good reason! I've been to this place many times as it's only a block away from where I live and I think that this is the only way I would be able to go. The line for brunch on most days is at least an hour long and their waiting area (even though it was expanded a few months back) can never accommodate all the people waiting, which is definitely a testament to the greatness of the food here. Since I live a block away, I usually go over and put my name in the go home and get ready or run errands and then return in about 35-45 minutes. Many people are patient enough to stay and wait but I admittedly have a problem and this is what works for me. On to the food... The food here is always great. I mean ALWAYS! I usually opt for the fruit as my side of choice as is always comes in the form of large slices of fresh fruit. I've had the eggs Benedict, pancakes, French toast, crepes, and corn beef hash and I definitely give 5 stars to all of that. My boyfriend opts for the hardier omelets and skillet choices that I enjoy taking one indulgent bite of with great delight. This place is a true gem in the oasis that is the South Loop. I've been eagerly waiting for years for this neighborhood to develop more of a feeling of a warmer community and its places like this, The Bongo Room, Opera, O'Malley's, and a few other places that are giving this neighborhood hope. The one star was knocked off for 2 reasons, one being the wait (mentioned earlier) and the other is the fact that brunch cocktails are not served. I think its BYOB but I just feel weird bringing vodka to a brunch location at noon. Brown paper bags should never see daylight in my opinion.
