It's nice that they have a tight parking lot. The restaurant is set-up, so that you can only eat at the counter seating. Although, the day that we stopped in it was nice enough to eat outside where it wouldn't have been a hassle. I couldn't decide on what to order. . . all the sandwiches have a slight variation from the next. I decided on getting the bistec sandwich. It tasted interesting with the potato shoestrings in there. I thought my sandwich was lacking in flavor. It needed more kick or something. I also ordered the goat cheese empanada, which was too much cheesiness for me. Normally, I love anything with goat cheese in it! Now, I know to stick to the meat-centered empandas. Even though, I was disappointed in my meal. . . I am always willing to give a restaurant a second chance.
