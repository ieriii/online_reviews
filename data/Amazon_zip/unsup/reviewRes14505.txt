I have only been here on Tuesdays for the king crab leg all-you-can-eat. Every thing looks so good on the menu, and I always mean to order from the menu...next time....but every time it is "next time" I end up doing the all-you-can-eat. That said, it is amazing. Sweet, succulent king crab legs always piping hot. Mmmmm. I always make sure to take my seafood loving friends here.
