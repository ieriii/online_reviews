Stumbled on Nana's on the search for a change of pace for lunch and have become a regular. Outstanding food and one of the nicer organic restaurants in Chicago. The coffee bar has a fairly nice selection and I love the fresh squeezed juice --as did my one year old daughter. The staff is friendly and the food has a consistently high quality. The nanadict is great, try it!
