My friends took me out for arepas in Caracas few years back. My arepa was stuffed with a different sort of cheese and topped with butter. I know there are 100s of ways to making arepas, but I didn't particularly enjoy Las Tablas' version which had the arepas covered in cheese and criollo sauce.  I had the churrasco and I have to say the steak was juicy and had some marinade locked in the seared sides. There was a good amount of gristle and fat, but I guess I can't complain too much for steak under $20. However, when I do go to a South American steak house, I am all about the Chimichurri! The chimichurri didn't taste fresh that day and tasted like just chopped green onions in oil. I was hoping for more of a bite with the parsley and garlic. One thing that I did really like was the pork belly in the bandeja paisa.  I thought the bathroom was interesting. I saw the men/women sign on the door, so I was thinking it was gonna be a small single stall. I had a minor panic attack because the door opened up to a long flight of steep stairs. At the bottom of the stairs was a nice waiting area for a separate men's and women's room.   Overall, I thought the place was okay for the price. I was a bit let down by the chimichurri and arepa.  I'm gonna try a few more places for comparison before I come back here.
