So I am not quite sure when this place opened or how long it has been opened but if it has been open a really long time then I need to kick myself for not finding it earlier. The sandwiches here are fantastic as are the fries and the service. A complete A+. I had the Cubano sandwich which had meats and cheese. The sandwich comes with some crunchy fried plantains. The fries were hot and crispy and had a nice taste to them. The service here is outstanding. We got here right before noon and the place was starting to pick up. One of the guys behind the counter was making coffee and handing out samples. He was really pushing the Cuban coffee. Starbucks and my coworkers should be happy this place isn't close enough for my morning brew cause it is tasty and I would be wired all day. A great addition to the neighborhood. It is a small place with some stools and a window counter to eat. They are now accepting credit cards and beware...they get busy but it is really worth it.
