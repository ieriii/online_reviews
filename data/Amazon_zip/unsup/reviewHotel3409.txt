First, the good news---the Allerton is clean and it's in a good location. Here's the rest of it. The poor service started with the bellman bringing the bags up--which took about 45 min plus a phone call. They had no idea where the bags were, someone would be "right up" etc. We eventually got the bags, went to dinner, came back and hit the sack. It felt like there was something in the bed---like sand or something sharper. Weird. The next day we came back at 4pm, and housekeeping still hadn't shown up. I called downstairs and they told me "they have until 6pm." Needed towels. "They are on their way" No towels ever came. I grabbed some off the cart in the hall. Came back from dinner around 9, called for towels again, stopped by the lobby, asked for towels, and left my business card with night clerk and asked for the manager to call me the next day. No one ever called. Eventually--after a about 30 min, some towels came. The second night I inspected the bed a little more closely. The mattress covers are made out of some sort of woven plastic, and a handful of the fibers stick through the sheet---they are so sharp they stick right through the sheet. The effect is like sleeping on a tack. Other issues---tiny/slow elevators. No coffee maker in the room, so all the guests are going to the lobby in the AM for coffee, then waiting in lines to get back on elevators. Bartender surly; couldn't take cash. "No change." Way, way overpriced for the level of service and comfort.
