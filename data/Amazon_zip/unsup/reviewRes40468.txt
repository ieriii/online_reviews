We did make reservations for this place as a result of my friend's birthday dinner choice. We hung out at the bar as the place was pretty packed and waited a few minutes for our table to be ready. The place has a trendy but yet relaxed feel to it. I alway think trendy and pretentious, but this quite a surprising combination. I tried the gin and ginger beer drink, and it was very strong. If you like the mixed whiskey this is the spot for you. The bartender seemed like a real chemist mixing the drinks with such precision. We started out with the pork belly and bone marrow appetizer. We also split the sliced steak dish and the softshell crab dish. The food here is creatively made, and delicious. I have to say though, that the portions seem small to me. I felt like I should have been more full for the amount of food that was paid for. The service was great from the hostess, to the server, and the waiters bringing out our food.
