WHERE is the ZERO star! probably worst experience ever!  first of all, what is the point of having a reservation when you still had to WAIT for almost ONE HOUR? we made reservation at 8:15pm and when i book it they still had 7pm, 715, 730, 745, 8pm, 815, 830, 845,, 9pm and so on available! so you can tell they were not busy...maybe? (i book it on the same day)  so we got there at 7:55pm and told the hostess we are all here. she told us we had to wait for a couple more minutes as they have to clean up a couple tables. waited until around 815, asked the hostess again, she claims they are running behind and have to wait 10 or 15mins longer. i told her we were told 20mins ago you guys were cleaning up table (a phone ring and she picked up the phone w/o answering our concern, i can honestly say she was ignoring us!). we walked away...around 8:40pm, we finally realize perhaps, we aint getting no table so we asked one of the hostess again to see if table are ready...she said they are cleaning tables and next one is ours. finally we got there at 755 but seated at 845pm! i cant say the hostess was rude but obviously NOT professional! she acts as she do NOT care anything, do not care how we feel, didnt say she is sorry or anything when we waited like 50mins for a reservation! i realize sometime busy restaurant may get 10 or 15mins behind but 50mins?? really??? and the hostess as if it was our fault? food was good but service by the hostess or how we were treated was a zero star! extremely POOR customer services and experience...left me wishing i had gone on a different restaurant!
