Great view of Michigan Ave! The menu is so varied, everyone in your party will find something they will like. The prices are not too bad when you take into account the location and the ambiance. It is a chain restaurant, so if your a snob I guess you can knock that. But, they are always busy and that says a lot. The portions are HUGE, so take a doggie bag or bring a hungry friend (or husband with a big pie-hole!) to share!
