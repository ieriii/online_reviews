I wanted to try the avena shake, which I've heard raves about. I loved it. Sweet and cold and refreshing. I enjoyed it and so did the hubs. But he soon got sick of it. As he kept drinking it he thought it got too "fragrant". Too much cinnamon. I thought it tasted like horchata. We ordered dinner to go. I ordered the pepito sandwich. A ribeye sandwich with cheese, beans, grilled onions and avocado (extra). It was very good. He bread was chewy. They steak was tender. The hubs ordered the casado with rib eye. It was a stew like dish with carmelized onions. It was very tender. Served over rice with an over easy egg. Ahhhh. That's the way to my husband's heart. Especially with a take out order to have an egg that had its yolk still runny was a winner. You had him at hello. He broke it over his rice and it complemented his rich casado well. The cabbage slaw was nice and refreshing I break up all the richness. The Lizano sauce is their green spicy salsa verde. Nice and cool and a bite of spiciness. Delicious with the sandwich. I'd go back and try some other costa rican dishes. And other combinations of shakes they have. My only criticism? Cash only. Come on. Are you paying your staff under the table?
