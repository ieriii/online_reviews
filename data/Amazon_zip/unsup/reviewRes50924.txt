My experience at Big Jones was an excellent one. It may have been the "southern coastal" claim (I tend to not like southern cooking, sorry)that made it seem SO awesome when I actually really liked it. We had the prix fixe of $25/person. We started with some cornbread that was hot from the oven with some melty butter.... then we had squash in a sauce that was to die for. It was almost ranch flavored but so much bolder. After that was a salad with plums and a plum dressing. I couldn't believe how good that was. So fresh! For the entree we had the Carolina wreck fish which the waitress said was bass. It was SO fantastic and meaty. It was almost like a steak. There were fingerling potatoes cooked perfectly... I ate everything on my plate. For dessert boyfriend had the Mississippi Mud Pie and I had the bread pudding. He actually said, "This may be the best dessert I've ever had." Wow! That's a compliment from him. My bread pudding was also ridiculously good. I ate until I couldn't stuff any more in my mouth :) It was awesome and all for $62 including our two specialty drinks. (I had the True North Cherry Coke - coke, cherry vodka and brandy cherries. And he had the Charlston Mule - ginger beer, vodka, and lime juice. They were both fabulous too.)
