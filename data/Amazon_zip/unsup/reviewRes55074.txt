Our waitress was very friendly and did a great job at telling us about the various specials and at recommending items on the menu.Food delicious (but not cheap by any means, especially if you get drinks), great service, and very nice atmosphere (great place for a nice romantic date!). The portions are on the smaller side, which I suppose is often the case at a restaurant of this standing. 4-1/2 stars.
