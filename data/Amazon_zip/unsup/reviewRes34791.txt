Big fan of the falafels and the zattar fattia. Sultan's Market has a large outdoor seating area, with nice planters and a view of the historic queen anne houses in the neighborhood. The inside has an abundance of seating, since the recent expansion. Oh yeah, then there is also the price, which makes Sultan's Market an incredible value. If you haven't been here before do the following: "Falafel, spicy, with tomato and onion. For here."
