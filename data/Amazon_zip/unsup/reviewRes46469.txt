What shall I say? I went to Indie cos' of the great reviews on Yelp...but like the French say "Comci-comca" and the Singaporeans say "so-so only lah". It was erm...OK. I was famished after a 3 hour session in the gym and was ready to gobble. We ordered the Yakisoba, unagi (eel-my fave!) sushi, hamachi (yellowtail) sushi and the spider maki. It was bad at all but it definitely WASN'T mindblowingly fantastic and definitely NOT 5 stars. (The fish wasn't as fresh as I expected) Let's just say the presentation was better than the actual taste.
