Let me begin by saying that I haven't felt the need to "yelp" about anything since I noticed how much restaurant management is crippled by arbitrary reviews written from extreme view points that I, for one, don't like being associated. With that being said, Ruth's Chris killed it Sunday night. I highly recommend the dark leather booths facing the TV in the bar. After our server explained the intricate steak process we ordered drinks, then wine, knowing this evening just turned eventful. Mannn... once the food began, it was the attentive eye of the server that kept the experience just that. From the onion rings to the KC Strip to bread pudding, complete with a visit from the exec chef to check on us and sing the praises of his genius broiler chef. So awesome. ...not like my opinion matters, though. ;)
