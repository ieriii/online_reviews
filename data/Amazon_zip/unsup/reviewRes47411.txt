I was torn about giving a stellar review. I mean, word is already out but Lockdown still feels like neighborhood secret. I don't want this place overrun with "tourist". I've been to Lockdown a few times and they just continue to kill it. Yeah you'll wait for a table on Tuesday nights (Half price burger night) but it's worth the wait. The prices are fair at full price, paying half I feel like I'm robbing the joint. I'm not blowing smoke when I say this is THE new burger spot. Kuma's? ok. Epic Burger? HA!! DMK? Surely you jest! Lockdown is what those guys should shoot for. Well done you!
