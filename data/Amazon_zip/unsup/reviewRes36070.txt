One of the very best meals I've had in Chicago, after living here 10 years. We had the egg rolls--generally I don't like them, but husband and kids do--and they were really good. Nice crispy skin, and tasty filing. The won ton soup was divine, and the pork shrimp dumplings also had great seasoning with fresh mushrooms. For the main dish, I had fish over rice. A white fish cooked perfectly, it had a delicious scallion-ginger gravy. I can't wait to go back here!
