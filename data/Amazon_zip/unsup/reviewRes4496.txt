Not too crowded on the weekdays. It's a great little place to catch some jazz and drink a tall beer. The people are friendly and you'll have good conversations; however, the bartender and doorman will probably shush you a few times. Apparently the emphasis is on the music and not on the bar. You get used to it, but it's a bit strange.
