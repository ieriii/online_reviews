Mercat was delicious. Everything we had on the tasting menu was sooo good. After sitting down trying to decide to order a la carte or the tasting menu, we went with the tasting b/c we couldnt decide. we made a great decision and I would recommend to anyone!! The service was very good as well; the server knew his food and wine which was helpful in us deciding which wine to choose. I thought it was a bit pricey, but worth it! Definitely a special occasion place, I would go again!
