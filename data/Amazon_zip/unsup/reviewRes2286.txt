a prerequisite to eating at hot doug's is a medical exam from a professional doctor stating that your heart can withstand their delicious sausages.  i was finally able to eat at hot doug's in the summer when he returned to work after his fall. before then, i would drive by hoping that the restaurant was opened like a stalker. i had to have his sausage! i've heard great things and i wasn't disappointed. and coincidently, i went on a friday and tried their delectable fries fried in duck fat. did i say fried? delicious!
