I had some friends in town visiting during Cubs Convention weekend and took them there. Again, the food was amazing. I had the pulled chicken. It was unbelievably moist and tasty. The chips and pickles delicious as always. I tried the fries for the first time. They were good, but wish they would come up with something more unique. I had the Pimm's, which was a perfect drink for one of the few bitter cold days we had this year. My friends both agreed that it was the best barbeque that they have ever had. Between the three of us we have lived in about 15 different states around the country and had many different styles.
