Absolutely fantastic. People that didn't like this place need to take in to account a few things: the price, the location, the service, they fact that it is environmentally friendly. I rate each of those five stars. You get a wonderful location for cheap. Boom. Bargain. Then you arrive there to nothing but great service. The poorer reviews of this place actually annoyed me. Those people must just be habitual complainers. My girlfriend and I wanted tickets to Blue Man Group. We asked the front desk for tickets a few hours before the show and we get PERFECT seats dead center near the front of the stage. The next night, we were thinking early dinner before we caught a show. We wanted to go somewhere romantic, they recommend the Signature Room (great call). With nearly no notice they got us reservations. This place allowed my girlfriend and I to have an amazing vacation. We will stay there next time we go to Chicago, and the next time and so on...
