Yummm, I love me some Big Jones! This place has become a regular weekend brunch spot for me and my boyfriend. As I've never had dinner there, I can only comment on their fantastic brunch menu. The meal always starts off right with a plate of complimentary warm beignets covered in powered sugar. For my meal I usually can't resist the crab cake salad. Resting a top of pile of nicely dressed mixed greens and delicious pickled vegetable relish, the crab cakes are meaty and flavorful only made better by the creamy sauce accompanying them. My boyfriend has tried the catfish omelet, corn cakes, and eggs new orleans, all of which were wonderfully executed. Due to my affinity for the crab cakes I've yet to try the whole wheat banana almond pancakes, or s'mores french toast, but am guessing they both lie in my brunch future. Big Jones also offers a wide variety of sweet teas, classic cocktails, as well as many New Orleans favorites. Last weekend we were lucky enough to meet one of the owners, Mark, who was charming. He even made a point of saying goodbye to us as we left. If you want some real comfort food with a lot of class try Big Jones.
