Aggghh! I was going to write a good review for this place. The service was okay, the price was decent, and food I thought was pretty tasty. So, overall an initially good experience. Then me and another girl in our party brought home what was left and.... THERE WAS A HAIR IN MY LEFTOVERS! EWWWWWWWWWWWW I'm so lucky I saw it when I scooped the food into a dish to reheat it! SO grossed out, never going back.
