Happened upon this place randomly, and it was good. Nice place, ambiance is clean and Southern without being overbearing. As that, the chairs are kind of uncomfortable, being faux wrought iron. Besides that, the food was very good. The corn muffins with honey butter were brought out hot and were delicious! I might go back just to have some of those and soup. Appetizers of crab cake and celery root soup were very tasty, though the celery soup was one-dimensional. Entrees of catfish and pork chop were good was well, catfish was more tasty and tender, but baked pean puree on the chop plate was interesting. For drinks they had a nice tea selection and nicely presented, while I had the 'homemade' ginger beer, which was very tasty and refreshing. Service was very nice and friendly from the lady server, if not a little overbearing, but that may have been b/c of the lack of other customers at the time. Price was good as well, given the quality of the food and nice atmosphere. Recommended!
