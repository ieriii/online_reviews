Delicious dill rice! Simply heavenly. Rice is rarely a highlight of a meal, but here it really is something special. The kebabs are also incredibly tender and delicious. I have also tried a super delicious saucy dish that had raisins in it; it was the perfect balance of sweet and savory. This has become the first place I want to visit for good middle eastern food. After experiencing such awesome food here, I happened to be checking out their website which heavily promotes their catering service. I had a light bulb moment that this would be the perfect cuisine for my wedding! My husband-to-be is part middle eastern and seriously, who doesn't like kebabs? I phoned and spoke to a man who seemed friendly but all over the place. He couldn't answer any of my questions clearly, kept interrupting our conversation to answer other phones ringing in their establishment, and just generally seemed disorganized. He promised to email me a quote but I never heard from him. I can forgive someone being super busy and forget to follow up so I decided to call again. This time, I got a woman on the phone who treated me like I was burdening her with my questions. She also told me "We can't give you a quote, we don't know what the price of beef will be then." She then handed me off to the same guy I talked to before who sounded as easily distracted as before. Again, he promised to follow up with me and it has been two weeks with no response. Even though I never received a final quote from them, I have decided to go with someone else because the two phone calls I had with them did not leave me with a positive impression. I understand that many restaurants do not have the ability to provide catering for a large events. However, I expected a more helpful and organized response since they are clearly promoting their large-scale off-premise catering on their website.
