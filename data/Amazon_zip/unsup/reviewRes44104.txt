We went here last minute for my boyfriend's birthday (another steakhouse gave us an hour wait despite our reservation). Kinzie saved an almost ruined evening! Our server was fantastic, the restaurant was quiet, and the atmosphere was cosy. Our food came out quickly and we both loved our steaks and sides. Not a thing to complain about and we'll definitely go back for other special evenings.
