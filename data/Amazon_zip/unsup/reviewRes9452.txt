The romantic ambiance resembles that of French colonial Vietnam in the movie The Lover. I've dined both downstairs and upstairs, but I prefer eating downstairs as there is more room between tables.  The food is more Vietnamese than French, but I won't complain! This place hits 5 stars on the following appetizers: banh cuon, bahn uot, and tom cuon ram. The entrees are not as great as the appetizers (3.5 stars): ca chien saigon, ga nuong xa, vit quay, and sup do bien. I think the best entree to stick to is chicken (ga nuong xa). Desserts have hit high marks at this place, so save room.
