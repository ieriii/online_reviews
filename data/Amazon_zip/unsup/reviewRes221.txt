I really can't top Monica T.'s review on the food, so I'm going to review their valet. I drove my car up to the valet area in front of Alinea. (The only way you'll know you're at Alinea is when you see the valet sign. ) Initially I think they thought I was lost, because they didn't come up to valet my fancy Ford Focus rental car. I had to wave at them and they came over. So I got out and watched them drive the car away. So while I was waiting outside for Monica T., Jun H. and their friend, the valet was nice enough to point out that they found a street parking spot for my car, so they wouldn't charge me for valet service. My jaw almost dropped to the floor. "Really?!?!" I asked as he handed me back the car keys. "That was awfully nice of you!" And then I tried to give him a tip, and he refused politely. Never before had I experienced someone being so kind to find me a parking spot and refuse a tip! Perhaps it's the astounding attention to service at Alinea or Midwestern kindess, but I would love it if more people were like Alinea's valet staff. :)
