We saw him , you can't imagine my excitement after waiting 8 months to go here. BUT, it is not worth visiting again. The menu sounds delicious but the execution was mediocre. Skirt steak tasted sour (was that intentional/marinated ?)- crab cake non existent. The pairing of the fingerling potatoes was good with the vegetables. The french toast and crepes were laughable. The bacon infused vodka with ginger beer was too strong as a drink (should be a shot) and my horchata/coffee/vodka/banana drink tasted like watered down coffee with vodka. The only thing that was executed well were the pommes frites with wasabi tobiko (EXCELLENT). Oh and it took 5 minutes to get coffee after I sent my drink back & my server never refilled my coffee. All in all, I wish I would've saved my 80 bucks.To top my experience, I left this review on their facebook page. Not only was it deleted- but no one responded to it (management). Sprout really needs to take a look at their business practices, how to run a hospitable restaurant and train their staff on giving good service. I'm beyond frustrated with my experience there. Just because three people come in under the age of 26 doesn't mean we don't know how to spot good service or deserve it. We were asked repeatedly in a condescending tone about what questions we had. We didn't because we are knowledgeable when it comes to high end food service. I'm a server and know when to cut someone a break because they are in the weeds or get frustrated because they are hanging out at the bar chatting with other employees. (dare I mention it was the latter). There was never an apology for not refilling my coffee or even a question as to why my drink was sent back. Perhaps when my boyfriend didn't touch his drink you could inquire as to if he liked it. Obviously, NO! Learn to read your guests. This isn't IHOP, but I felt as if our server thought that is where we went to brunch.
