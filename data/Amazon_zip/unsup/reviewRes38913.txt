Incredible experience. SERVICE: The staff was extremely friendly - which helped our 45 minute wait. While we waited, we got recommendations from the bartenders on which drinks to get. I ended up with some sort of rye whiskey and ginger beer drink - which was incredible. Note - This place is SOLD on the $3 whiskey shot special ALONE. (with something like 30+ whiskeys available) FOOD: As if I wasn't impressed by the amazing drinks and shot special, the food was fabulous. We started with an artisanal cheese selection with three types of cheeses and a fruit marinade and buffalo sweetbreads. They were both amazing - but the buffalo sweetbreads dish was to die for. And I'm not even really sure what it is... I know it's something sketchy. For our entrees, we shared the roasted marrow bones, (my favorite meal of all - which is disgusting and awesome) and the maine scallops dish. The scallops was okay - the MUST HAVE here is the bone marrow. DRINKS: Besides whiskey, we also both had glasses of Shiraz and another white wine. I know what you're thinking... yes, I was buzzed and no, this wouldn't have affected my 5-star score! ATMOSPHERE: We sat outside as it was too crowded inside - so I didn't get to experience much besides sitting at the bar for 5 minutes. But it was a beautiful night and comfortable seating outside. OVERALL: I'd go back in a heartbeat.
