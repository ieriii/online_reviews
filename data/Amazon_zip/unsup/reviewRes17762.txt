I've been here a few times now and have been very happy with the place each time. The dining area is huge but divided in a way that makes it feel intimate no matter where you are sitting. It's lush interior adds to the experience and keeps the noise level down. The staff is friendly and I never felt rushed. I've sampled a few things from the menu now and everything I had was outstanding. If you're a novice when it comes to Indian cuisine, you may have to depend on the waiter to guide you through their encyclopedic menu. Or, go with a good friend that knows the ropes.
