We went here after a very cold trip to the Christkindlmart downtown.  You walk in, and you're immediately approached by a server who tells you the drill: You of course start by waiting in line at the register to order. Once you're 5-10 minutes away from placing your order and a seat is available, you'll be given a number. After you place your order, just get your drink and slide down to your table. Servers come around with your food in ~5-10 minutes. Is this called a "limited service restaurant"? Not really sure. Great food though. We tried the bacalao torta (don't be turned away by salt cod; awesome), Wood-Roasted Chicken Pazole soup (spicy), and the Duck Torta. Just as you'd expect from a Bayless place: very good.  Word to the wise: don't get a soup and a sandwich. Both are pretty big. We didn't end up having room for a churro and hot chocolate, which I regret now. We're going to go back some night just for those two things.
