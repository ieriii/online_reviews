Delicious food for vegetarians and meat eaters alike! I've been to the Chicago Diner quite a few times over the last few years. There's such a great variety of tasty, satisfying food, even friends skeptical of meatless fare have left full and happy! The trend in most of the new restaurants I've been to lately has been lots of meat- wild boar sloppy joes, sweetbreads, homemade charcuterie, you get the idea- I'm so glad Chicago Diner is still around (and busier than ever!) for dependable food and excellent service!
