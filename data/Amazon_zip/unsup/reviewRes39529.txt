45 minute wait, but who cares... it's Sunday Brunch... have a drink at the bar and chill the f#*k out... seated promptly... atmosphere was a little dark, but the Sun shown through... perfect... friendly, informed service... smart, rustic food for "foodies"... extensive, well-thought out beverage program... an excellent experience...
