Loved it! Can't wait to go back! The crepes were delicious - I had the Crepe Icosium and my date had the Crepe Marrakech. He's not a fan of goat cheese, olives, onions, or bell peppers and they were happy to substitute on any of the items or they had the option of building your own crepe, as an FYI for other picky eaters! I added merguez sausage to mine and highly recommend it - there's a slight kick to the sausage so it will perk up almost any dish. Each crepe is quite a bit of food but does not leave you overfilled if you finish it all! I also think they are worth the $7-10 per crepe because of the variety of fresh ingredients in each crepe (a lot of ingredients go into each one). BYOB and lack of a corkage fee also lead to a lower check at the end of the night than going out to a similar restaurant.  (2 dinner crepes, one with meat, plus one dessert crepes = $35 with tax)
