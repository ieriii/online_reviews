I had ordered pick up from here, and couldn't believe my ears - the hostess said it would be ready in 5 minutes! That's the fastest anyone has said my food would be ready. I got there in 5 minutes, and it was ready! I noticed that there were quite a number of people at the restaurant for a weekday - which to me is a sign of a good restaurant. I can't imagine the craziness that would be there over the weekend. I got the combination plate which is why I thought would be more complex to make and package in 5 minutes. It was very good, and it tasted so homemade. It was a lot of food, but I wolfed it down like I was a starved maniac. Usually for a meal that much I would have leftovers for the next day, so I was a little disappointed about that. I could see myself coming back with a group of friends.
