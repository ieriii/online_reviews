Yolk is a great brunch spot. Their menu has quite the selection and the portions are big enough that I am sure everyone will be satisfied by the end of your meal. I got the pecan chicken salad. It was just what I was looking for. My friend got one of the skillets. It looked awesome, and it came with a side of pancakes. The only downfall is they don't take reservations and the wait can get kind of long. But be patient, it is worth the wait! I will be back to check out some of the breakfast items, everything looked so delicious!
