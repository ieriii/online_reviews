Irazu's is not effing around when it comes to delicious Costa Rican cuisine! I was highly impressed with everything I've ever ordered. The empanada's, the guac, and the horchata were all muy delicioso!Every time, I go I stop at Red+White Wine store (right across the street)and pick up a bottle of Spanish red to enjoy with my meal. It's BYOB and the perfect place to sit out on the patio and enjoy a wonderful, affordable, filling meal. My only complaint is that it's small and it's cash only, so don't forget to stop at the ATM beforehand. You will not won't be disappointed.
