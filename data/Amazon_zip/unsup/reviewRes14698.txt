Welcome to the neighborhood, Revolution. We're on board. Great food, fantastic beer selection and a friendly, attentive staff all in an amazing location with some great architectural details and only 2 TVs in the whole place. Thanks for not turning into a mindless, douchey sports bar. I really can't get enough of this place and will be back to refill my giant mug of beer as often as I can.
