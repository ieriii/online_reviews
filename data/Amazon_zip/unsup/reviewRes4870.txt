I really wish San Francisco had a place like this. Wine and Pigs! What a great combo! You can't really go wrong with the food here. That's what our waiter said. Actually that's what my friends have told me. So I went with the following... 1. Fried Pig's ear with crispy kale, pickled cherry peppers & fried egg. I adored the pig bowl! How to eat this? You mix everything together and enjoy with a glass of wine. 2. Asparagus and Hazelnuts with Arugula and treviso salad. Delicious. The hazelnuts give a good crunch to the salad. Very refreshing on a warm day. 3. Jamon Serrano with oyster mushrooms and Fried Duck Egg over a grilled bread. Just like an open face sandwich. Love this dish. 4. Milk Braised pork shoulder with mash potatoes. This was my favorite dish! Pork was tender and tasty. All the dishes are considered small plates and meant to be shared. Of course having a few glasses of wine to compliment the dishes is a must. They have an extensive wine list. They have pigs. What more can you ask for. I highly recommend this place!
