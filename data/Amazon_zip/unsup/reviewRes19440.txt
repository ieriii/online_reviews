Went to Xoco opening day and was not disappointed. The line was only about 5ish minutes to order at about 5:50 PM. I was expecting the line to be around 1 hour and that I would probably wait until another time to try out the food. The menu is pretty large and there are small dessert items and drinks everywhere you look too. I ordered a "Aztec" hot chocolate, a glass of 2007 Topolovino Syrah, a Churro, and a Choriqueo Torta. The Aztec was very good with a hint of spice, very different than the hot chocolate I am accustomed to. The wine was good but overpriced at $12 a glass. The Churro was light and sugary. It wasn't a heavy, oily, gross filling mess that many of the ballpark / amusement park churros are. By far the best Churro I have had but it doesn't seem like there's much competition in the Churro arena. The Choriqueso Torta is a homemade chorizo sausage, roasted poblano, artisan jack cheese, tomatillo salsa. The torta come out of the oven about 15 minutes after I ordered. The torta was very flavorful and spicy. I normally do not like onions and poblanos on my sandwich but these were very flavorful but not overpowering. The chorizo was spicy and oozing a bit of yummy pork juices. I can't wait to get back there and try some of the other tortas and desserts. I will skip the wine next time and stick to other beverages. It was also fun to see Rick Bayless in the kitchen making delicious foods.
