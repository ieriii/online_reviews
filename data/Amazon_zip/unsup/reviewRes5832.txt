How are you still so incredibly good? I enjoyed my graduation dinner here on Thursday night and I loved every bit of it! This was a great spot to bring my parents to and we were lucky enough to get the best table in the house (my opinion - back corner by the wine racks) by arriving at 6:15pm.  Highlights: Pizza D.O.C. - The sauce is the shit.  Cheese flight - props to the waiter for surprising us with a mix of three cheeses Squash salad - I heart you too Spaghetti - You make it hard to put my fork down I have yet to make it to dessert.  Davanti Enoteca - You are dangerously delicious.
