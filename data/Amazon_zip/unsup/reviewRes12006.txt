This is one of the best places I've been to for brunch - for the chocolate tower french toast alone! But I've also had a couple of other things - one being the veggie croissant sandwich (which was ok) and the other being the black bean and sweet potato burrito (which I liked). But I really liked how you can order just one piece of french toast/pancake instead of the entire thing - I can't handle all of that sweetness! Also, the service is ridiculous (in a good way). It seems like they're right on top of your table, cleaning things up and giving you refills. The first time I went, it was a crappy rainy day around 10:00 and we only had to wait about 15 minutes for a table. The last time I went, it was the first really nice weekend day of the season, around 1:00, and we had to wait about an hour and a half. So I would recommend getting there early. Although, if it's nice outside, you can always check out the many surrounding stores if you have to wait.
