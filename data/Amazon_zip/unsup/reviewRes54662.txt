I have to say that this is was the best and freshest fish I have had in a very long time. A friend and I had gone there on Tuesday March 17th it was busy for a weeknight,so right there I knew it was going to be good. The waitress was great she made suggestions which is great. She was also on top of filling our glass with wine. I had yellow tail tuna that was amazing. I will be going back there sooner then later.
