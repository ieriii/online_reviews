This place is cute! I am a brunch connoseiur so that's a lot coming from me. I live in the Wicker Park area yet never went here before, and decided to one hungover morning on Milwaukee. The service was good and the eggs were cooked perfectly....the atmosphere was different, cute also. We went on a Tuesday which made it a very spacious, intimate little experience. Oreo pancakes looked good but I didn't try them.
