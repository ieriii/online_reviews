Food was not good at all. Crust soggy and had the flavor of cardboard. Bartender was inattentive...the bar wasn't busy at all...then he just left and there was no one tending the bar. Very bizarre. The host said there were no tables available...come on, there were tables and it was later in the evening.  No lines.  I think it was because my date was BLACK....if you're AFRICAN AMERICAN, they won't seat you. We had to seat ourselves...the waiter was okay, though. THIS IS A RACIST ESTABLISHMENT. Take your business elsewhere.
