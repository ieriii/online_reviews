What a warm & friendly eatery! The food was fantastic. I had the russian rueben sandwich...delicious & plentiful, especially with that HUGE potato pancake. My wife had their spicy fish stew called Ciopolla?...damn tasty also on a rainy & clammy day like today. Many, many more trips planned in the future. It actually may be added to my default list. I deleted one star for the hokey cereal display. Sorry, but it kinda ruined the nice vibe I had of the overall space. So much so that I switched my seat!
