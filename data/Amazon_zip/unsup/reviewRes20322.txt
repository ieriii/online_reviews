Loved it! The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because the chips and guac were a little too salty and they almost blew my taste buds out before I got my entree. The entree was heavenly. My husband got a pork dish that was excellent as well! This is not the place for you if you are a large group wanting a table together, it seems like they have a few tables for 4, but mostly it's great for 2 people or if you are by yourself. Once more, food was terrific! Next time I have to get myself some hot chocolate.
