UMMMMMM YEAAAAAAAAAAAAA this is the best joint on earth! Hot Doug's is worth living for.They have every kind of hot dog, including game and snake!!!!!! In addition to his online menu, he has a daily special menu. His Chicago dog is better than any stand in town! I was in Chicago and insisted after wahtching this place on the food channel that I go! I have never been this blown away by food in my life. I dragged my wife and sister in law here. We ordered $75 worth of dogs and we each had to taste them all! Doug is a true genious. My hat goes off to this man. I tell all of my friends that visit Chicago that this place is a MUST! If there is a line, don't trip. It is worth it!!!!! Enjoy.
