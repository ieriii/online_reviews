Last time we visited Chicago we put this on our to-do list, as vegans it probably the most recognizable vegan establishment in Chicago and always pops up in conversation in top vegan establishments in the US. I have only been here the one time and the food and service was great. I had the Philly Cheeze Steak and it was well done. The place is small but cozy and everyone was friendly. The day we were there it was a late fall, cold rainy Chicago day and the place was kind of empty so service was fine. We also hoofed it from the L so we didn't have to worry about parking(I thought only people in sprawling Phoenix complained about parking?). Even if you don't love the food this is a Vegan landmark. I would definitely be a regular if I lived in Chicago.
