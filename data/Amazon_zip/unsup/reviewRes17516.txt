Not thinking I did not make a reservation on a sat night BIG mistake! They told us it may be a hour wait. We decided to wait and have a drink at he bar. It was very busy but we got seats at the bar and our bartender Marissa was so nice and let us know we can eat at the bar so we did. It was fun watching her pump out these beautiful drinks shes quick and her drinks are soooooo good, I may have had too many!!!! She suggested the cheveche sum other items and it was amazing! I had a awesome time at Carnivale. Awesome drinks foods amazing and the bartender was great. Ask for Marissa her drinks are divine. we will b back soon!!!
