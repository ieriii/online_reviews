I really wanted to like this place based on what I've read, but it just didn't live up to the hype. The food was decent, the service horrendous. If you are looking for a better option, Ukrainian Village is full of them. I personally would settle for a small Lou Malnati's deep dish over this place any day, however, as I've stated in some of my other reviews, I really do recommend Picante, Smoke Daddy or even Janiks over on Damen/Division.  There's also a nice couple of Italian restaurants in the area as well. Overall, this place is worth checking out as we may have just gone on a bad day and ordered the wrong thing, but we just waited so long that if I had a choice between picking up a burrito and eating right away while watching football or sitting down and waiting for an hour and having to raise our voices over the ruckus from the kitchen, just to be heard, I would take the burrito.
