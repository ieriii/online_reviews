Sabatino's is an old standby for sure. If you would like to dine on the weekends, it is probably best to call for a reservation. The atmosphere is kitschy but called-for, and the drinks and wine are reasonable while you wait for your table. The food is delicious and consistent, but I haven't been back since I moved from Jefferson Park to Noble Square, which means I don't truly CRAVE their food. My most common orders have been shrimp scampi and Papardelle con funghi di bosco. If you order an entree you get a TON of food, so appetizers aren't truly necessary. It would be a fun place for a rehearsal dinner or holiday party.
