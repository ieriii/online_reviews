Much like many of the restaurants on Division street, the sidewalk in front allows for ample seating during the warm summer months. I have been to Milk and Honey on a few occasions for brunch. After a long night of drinking, their food was a balancing and delicious follow-up in the late morning hours. I usually order their orange brioche french toast. The toasted almonds are a great addition to my favorite breakfast food.  I like the counter service idea. Instead of doing the dance with a waiter, you can get your order in and find seating. Some may not like this idea and if you don't, you may want to avoid M&H. However, for those of us that want to slink in during our 11am hangover haze, its ideal.
