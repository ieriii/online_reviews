Garcia's is awesome. The delicious and cheapness of a dive restaurant but without the dive. We ordered a margarita pitcher last time and probably will every time from now on. Everyone gets a full glass, plus the 8 glasses worth in the pitcher. With such a generous pitcher, we doubted the strength of the drinks but they did not disappoint. If anything, they started out strong and kept getting better towards the bottom of the pitcher. You can all but guarantee a good time here and they conveniently are open plenty late.
