Made what I believe is our third trip to Lao Sze Chuan last weekend, and again, I was quite pleased. Prior to heading up to Chicago for the weekend, I phoned 24 hours in advance to order the Peking duck (this is a requirement). After seeing these ducks hanging in the window throughout Chinatown during our last visit, I felt the need to partake. It always reminded me of Atari's "Adventure" game where the dragons(ducks) were killed by the arrow and their neck were broken and they just hung there lifeless. Sadly, the ducks are not brought out in this fashion as I had hoped, instead they are sliced up into little bite-sized squares. This actually was fairly upsetting as I really wanted to stand up and yell out "One land, one sword, one king!" and then slice his head off and chuck it across the room. The waiter actually prepares the duck for you by placing some sauce into a tortilla-typed shell and then adding the duck, green onions and then folding it over to eat like a burrito. Although it wasn't presented in the manner that I had expected, the taste was exquisite. The wife and I finished off the meal which is perfect for two people and at about 28 dollars, it wasn't too expensive. Not something that we'll order every time we head to Chicago, but since it was my wife's birthday, I splurged.
