WELL....I am not gonna say one place is better then the other....we all know "the other place"....but it left a bitter taste in my mouth that after sitting there for hours and having had enjoyed the best burger and appetizers. the bar tender that came on shift....well proceeded to ask me if i was drinking both of my drinks(both glasses wer full btw).....and her attitude well lets just say CUNTY! me and my friends moved to a table just so we wouldnt have to deal with such bartender...aside from that brunette bartender...which did not approach us! oh well....will i go back HELL YES! this place is aweosme! food hella good service was awesome aside from her CUNTYNESS i had an awesome time! food graet.....cruelty to animals is the way to go!! and they have desert...the other place...not so much!!
