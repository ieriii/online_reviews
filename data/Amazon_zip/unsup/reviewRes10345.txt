Great food. I had the black pasta with tons of fish and it was fantastic. I was stuffed after 1/2 the plate but I couldn't stop eating nor did I want to throw away such fantastic food. Our server was friendly and had Italian accents which made it all the more fun.  I went there with a group of girlfriends and I will definitely go back. It was raining so we couldn't enjoy the deck. Hopefully next time!
