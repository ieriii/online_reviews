Really cool place. Usually have live jazz.  Is like stepping back in time to the 1940's. They have a long bar and live music stage, a vintage juke box, and two old ancient greek-styled statues near the stage. Bartenders wear bow ties. Really cool place. I would highly recommend for a date or a night away from the norm.
