Very good, cheap mexican food.....HUGE burritos! The veggie is the best. Service is generally very poor....they don't ever check back and see if you need anything else. They take the order and bring the check....so if you know that going in you will be fine. But it is always open late (1-2 a.m.) and always consistently good. Great homemade salsa (ask for the green...you don't get it unless you ask...amazing) Give it a shot if you want low key mexican. You will not be disappointed.
