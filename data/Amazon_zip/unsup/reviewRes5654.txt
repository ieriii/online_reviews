Beautiful sunny afternoon outside at a large, friendly, family table enjoying a glass of Sicilian white wine recommend by a knowledgeable waiter. Small plates were well prepared, different and filled my pallet with new flavors. Try the almonds, beets and even the roasted marrow.  Great vibes, friendly, making you feel like you are in a European bistro. An enjoyable afternoon or evening. Would go back. Very much fun, even more so on a warm sunny day.
