Ok so I'm not gonna say anything new that hasn't been said: the drinks are unique and tasty, the "sustenance" is good (duck confit sammies!), and the atmosphere is great. But someone please tell me why there are only 3 vodka drinks on the menu? I really don't care for any other liquor so I am very limited on my choices here. I want to know where this martini list is that Obama L. is referring to? Maybe I missed something? 4 stars if they had more vodka drinks. 5 if there wasn't an hour wait at only 7:30 on a Friday.
