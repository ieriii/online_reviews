I was lucky enough to celebrate my birthday here. My boyfriend took me and a few friends for a little surprise birthday dinner. I loved the environment... totally upscale and trendy but not overwhelming. (I wasn't dressed very nice but didn't feel out of place at all.) It is tapas, but fancier than most, and tastier than most. We ordered about 2-3 tapas a person and we were so full by the end of the night. I can't even remember everything we ordered but some of my favorites were the beef shortrib flatbread and the shortribs and diver scallops. The bruscetta-type opener they brought out was really tasty, too. Overall, the dishes were very unique, tasty and nicely presented. We also had the pear sangria which was delicious! I would definitely recommend Mercat for a special night out. It is pricier than the typical tapas place but well worth it for the quality of food!
