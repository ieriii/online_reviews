Lovely downtown restaurant with a huge menu! We asked our helpful waiter with tips, and ordered onion bhaji - ok, really fried tawa paneer - OMG good, never thought sauteed cheese could be so good! tasted like mozzarella cheese. samosas - ok, too much potatoes chashew nut/almonds rolls - SOOO good! all tikki chat - ok chicken pakora - REALLY good mango lassi - GOOD In hind sight, we realized that most items are fried and probably bad for you. However, I actually enjoyed ordering something new & unknown, and some of them were actually good.
