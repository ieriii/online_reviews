Lucky I did not know how to put 0 starts ....I am french, I know what fondue is.... and It's nowhere near this awfull, smelly, creamy, orange mixture, in which you get to dip the stupidest ingredients such as soft bread or grape !I was ashamed I went with friends to whom we had to explain that this is really not what it should be. When we cooked it at home for them, it was like a revelation, I doubt they'll be back there anytime.And that's only talking about the food...What about the terrible smell ? As soon as you are back home you need to get rid of every piece of clothes you had been wearing and run in the shower wash your hair .. maybe that's what makes it a famous date place ...I could keep writting, but I guess you get the point: DON'T GO ... ever !
