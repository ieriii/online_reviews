Beer. So much beer. Tasty beer you want to hang out with for a long time. Tried my first Satan Red, and Orval Trappist Ale...and finished it off with a Duvel. Oh, wait, there was food in there some place. I had the duck reuben, which was dy-no-mite. The marble rye was nearly blackened, but not too much, so it came out crispy with a cranberry cream cheese (?) spread and a light sauerkraut. I'm adding this to "play in the kitchen" menu at home - great sammich. The atmosphere when we came in (9ish on a Saturday) was great. Crowded but not suffocating. A piece of advice, though: Put your name in for a table and then make a beeline upstairs. A lot more space to enjoy a beer while you wait. There tends to be a logjam at the front door as people park themselves by the front bar. Be prepared - its pricy here. Cash is also your friend in the upstairs bar (no CC up there), so get ready to make it rain.
