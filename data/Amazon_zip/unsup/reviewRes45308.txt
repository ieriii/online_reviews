I went to Wilde today on a whim with friends for brunch. It was a little more upscale than I was expecting, especially since this was a roll out of bed and head to brunch type of day, however, once I went inside, I didn't even think about that again. The staff was friendly and the atmosphere was very cozy. I think we all had a great experience. My friends arrived before we did and were seated. When we got there, they were able to promptly move them/us to a larger table. Our server was great, very friendly; the bus boys were friendly too and very on top of the tables needs.  All of our food and drinks were delicious. I enjoyed my food, but two of my counterparts stated theirs wasn't all that great. However, we all agreed that the drinks were a hit. The whole menu looked great and I would definitely go back to try the other items.
