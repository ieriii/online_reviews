I decided I wanted to get all of my friends together for a birthday celebration at Revolution, so we all came on a Saturday for the tour and lunch. The tour is free and informative and only about 30 minutes. You even get a sample at the end! For brunch, we were seated upstairs immediately after. My friend and I started with the polenta fries, which were served with a homemade giardinera. The fries were solid, but I really loved the giardinera, For my entree I ordered the red flannel hash. The was not much corned beef on my dish, but I loved the baked eggs, sweet potatoes and beets that Revolution incorporates into the hash. I must say that the star of my meal was the homemade biscuit as it was flaky and buttery. I also had a chance to sample the pork belly sandwich which was delicious as well. The fries are addictive-my boyfriend said I ate half his order! We ended up spending the majority of the day drinking here-I cannot wait to come back again!
