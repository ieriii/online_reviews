I never actually got to go because they cancelled the party we were supposed to have.We were going to go to the Holi [Hindu Festival of Colors] party because the state shut it down. If Illinois is shutting down the hotel, I can only pressume it's living up to the not-so-great reputation is already has. I just can't believe they waited until only hours before the event was supposed to start to notify everyone that it was cancelled.
