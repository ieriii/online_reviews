Sometimes after a long day of work when it's 100 degrees out, getting in the car and heading uptown for dinner is WAY better than cooking in your un-air conditioned kitchen. And when the destination is Sun Wah, the night is pretty perfect.  We walked in to the large dining room to find it about 1/3 full. We were seated promptly and given hot tea, which is always great. I love when you don't have to ask! We only needed a couple of minutes to peruse the menus, because even though they're huge (yes, there are TWO), we knew what we wanted. Unable to decide between pork and duck, we got bbq pork with rice and a small order of roasted duck. Also some fried rice, because my bf is obsessed with fried rice. It was nothing to write home about. Get noodles instead, I think. Anyway, our other two orders were SPOT ON. I could have eaten the pork and nothing else, surprising since pork is a new addition to my life. The duck was juicy with perfect skin, though I was a little turned off by how they just chopped it up with the bones. It was kinda hard to eat (but worth it!) Anyway, everything everyone says good about sun wah is true. Now I want to go back for my birthday and get the duck that they carve at your table. mmmmm. duck.
