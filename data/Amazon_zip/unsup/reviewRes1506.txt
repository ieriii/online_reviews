I really, really, really miss this place, especially now that I live in a city almost completely devoid of a decent dog. I used to live not 5 minutes away from here and I really took it for granted - not just for the classic Chicago dog or firedog, but also for the more exotic menu items. Last one I got was some sort of venison sausage dressed with blue cheese - I forget exactly, but point being it was delicious. And those duck fat fries are a thing to dream of. Doug's the man. He'll recognize the regulars but is super friendly to everyone. Lines can get long, but it's really a minor issue that I never complained about. Now that I'm 2,000 miles away I find myself visiting the website frequently just to read the specials.
