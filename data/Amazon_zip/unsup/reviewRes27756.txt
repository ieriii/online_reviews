My wife took me here for my birthday. I've been wanting to check out Graham Elliot ever since I saw him on the first season of Top Chef Masters. The decor is very nice. It's a larger space than I expected, the tables are evenly spaced and the colors are neutral but interesting. I really liked that the menu's are located on LP covers (even if mine was Barry Manilow). I had the North Bridge Fizz for a cocktail and it was very good, but my wife's Anise in Wonderland was phenomenal. We each started with the froie grois lollipops which I thought was very cool whereas my wife wasn't a fan. I then had the twinkie ceasar salad and my wife had the pea soup with the mint marshmallow. Both of these were huge hits for us. I then had the pork tenderloin for my entree which was good but not amazing. I can't recall what my wife's fish dish was but it tasted very good. We then each ordered a dessert. All I can recall about mine was that it had a cardamum ice cream that was divine. My wife's had a cream cheese ice cream which was too powerful and muted the flavors of the other items on the dish. You're probably wondering based on that review why only three stars. Well, my wife hit it on the head when she said "I was able to eat my own starter, entree, and dessert...and that NEVER happens." The size of the plates are small, and we both agreed this is a great thing. I hate leaving a restaurant feeling like my stomach is about to explode, but I also think the cost should be comparable. There are plenty of places I've eaten in the city that offer comparable portions (or even larger) for a better price. Graham Elliot is a very cool dude (he even stopped by my table to shake my hand!) so it's nothing against him. It's just going to be difficult for me to revisit knowing the cost and portion ratio.
