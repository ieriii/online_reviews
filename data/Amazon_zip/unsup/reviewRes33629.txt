I'm only giving it two Stars because the server made a great wine recommendation from the Valpolicella region of Italy. We went at 10:30 on New Years Eve not expecting much since we would be the last seating. To start we ordered Mussels and a Zucchini Saffron risotto. The Mussels we're the freshest and the red sauce they were in wasn't even worth dipping bread in for the extra sauce (usually my favorite part of mussel dishes) and the Risotto bland. We did share a Caprese Salad which was decent considering the season, It's actually had a decent profile but could have used some olive oil. For Dinner I had the Portabella/Scallop entree. The scallops that happened to land on my plate look much smaller than what I had scene go by before... I wonder if that had something to do with us being there at the end of the night and that's all they had. Anyways the Scallops were over cooked and the general dish was boring with no thought. My friend had the grouper that was drench in an over powering tarragon butter. My girlfriend's pasta was amazingly flavorless -- some mushroom pasta debacle. Dessert where decent, we had the Tiramisu and their special of the night. Both which were polished off. I'm not sure though were it was because they were that good or just in comparison they rocked and we were hungry from not eating our other food..... OK I admit I ate all of mine but no one else did. I'm just a hungry guy and those scallops were tiny ;). I've got no desire to ever go back, there are way too many other restaurants in this city with this style, price range and much better food. Buyer beware I believed the hype and was extremely disappointed.
