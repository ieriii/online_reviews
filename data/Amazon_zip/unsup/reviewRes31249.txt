I'd been wanting to go to Chicago Diner for quite some time, but I don't often find myself up that way. Husband and I stopped in for lunch and it was Ohhhh-kay. Though, I have to be honest, the Reuben was a bit too much like a Reuben for my veg. taste buds and the idea of it leaves me a bit nauseous now. But for a meat eater it'd be a great sandwich when you find yourself dragged here, I suppose. The roasted veggie sandwich was fine. Nothing over the top extraordinary. Though, at their prices, you do kind of expect extraordinary. The side of potatoes were burnt and lukewarm. We tried the dumplings, they were okay. The skin was strangely thick and rubbery. I wanted to fall in love with this place. I wanted to have to find more reasons to head up this way. But sadly, Chicago Diner didn't win this Vegan over... I'll give it another try if I find myself up that way, but I won't make a special trip for it.
