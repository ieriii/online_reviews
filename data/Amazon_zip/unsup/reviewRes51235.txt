Walked in with two friends for a Sunday brunch. I ordered a wishbone omelette, one friend got biscuits & gravy, and the other got french toast. In spite of my omelette being slightly over-cooked it was still awesome. I had a biscuit on the side which was great. I tasted the biscuits and gravy that my friend ordered and I was kind of jealous. I didn't taste any of the french toast but judging by my friends empty plate it couldn't have been horrible.. Try their Irish Mud (coffee whiskey drink)..Yum. Service was super friendly, but she didn't really check on us.. not that that would have changed anything because we were pretty content with what was in front of us and didn't need her to bring anything else. As far as prices go, slightly more expensive than your run-of-the-mill breakfast place, but worth it when you're looking for more than a couple eggs and some toast.
