The setup: From Chicago but needed a hotel for some home improvements.  Pros: (1) Excellent customer service at the desk.  (2) Free upgrade to a bigger room with a better view; (3) Room was updated and very modern. (4) Mostly clean (but see important exception). Cons: (1) Wine stains on our sheets (ICK - and deducting points); (2) mediocre water pressure; (3) split opinion as to the bed being comfortable; (4) Long waits for the elevators; (5) Hotel lobby packed with a kid's convention; (6) $15/day for internet Overall: Overrated.
