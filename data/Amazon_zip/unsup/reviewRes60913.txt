I came here one friday night, and was a bit disappointed. The server, Aaron, or Eric i believe his name was, was great! Super knowledgeable. I did however come into contact with one woman who worked inn the retail area who had the nastiest attitude. She was sloppily dressed, her hair looked all matted and greasy, just all around non professional looking. She was rude as all get out, as if she did not enjoy her job. I asked her for some wine suggestions, and before I could even get out what i wanted to pair it with, she cut me off & basically TOLD me what i was looking for rather than asking me what i was looking for. As a younger lady rang us out, I asked for a cup of they're coffee with a shot of Almond to-go,which i have gotten before, with no problems. I then overhear the shorter, rude woman, speaking to a young man about how it wasn't Starbucks, and she didn't know what i expected. When I asked to speak to the manager, to explain how rude she had been, i was informed that this poor excuse of a human being, was in fact the manager for the evening. I just walked out. It was just all around a bad experience. Poor Management, I am honestly surprised this place hasn't gone out of business yet, with this un-fit manager running the show.
