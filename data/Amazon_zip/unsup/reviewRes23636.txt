I just thoroughly enjoyed my Grilled Steak from Irazu. I work in the area and usually get my food delivered from them (we've been ordering from them about twice per month for the past year). I've yet to experience a mix-up with my orders. Their sandwiches are awesome and SUPER affordable. Actually, the entire menu is affordable. Being from Central America myself, I can't say that the food is as good as Abuelita's. But it's pretty darn good. 5 stars for you, Irazu... Keep up the great work!!!!
