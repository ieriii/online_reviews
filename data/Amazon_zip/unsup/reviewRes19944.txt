I had been reading the reviews for this place for over a year and disappointed I did not go here sooner. Went there for lunch on the rainy Saturday of the air show. Wow! The food was unbelievable! Pork belly sandwich was probably the best sandwich I've ever had. You have to try it! Also, you must try the Gage N-17 Fondue. Can't wait to go back.
