I had the most hipster sunday. I rode my bike to the new Wes Anderson movie and ate at a vegetarian restaurant after. Interior is nice, we wanted to sit outside, so we were led through the kitchen (weird) to the back covered seating area. Very nice. I got - Vegan Cookie Dough Milkshake - This was really good and made with soy. Award winning rueben - Give you the option of dairy or non dairy cheese, which is nice. I liked this one. I think the rueben at Native Foods cafe slightly edges this one out, but I have to get another and reverify. Gluten free cupcakes - They have them here! Yes! Oh, what a great city for hipsters.
