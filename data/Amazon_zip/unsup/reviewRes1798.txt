The GOOD: The food is amazingly good. Each polish has a combo that makes my taste buds yearn for more. To quote Ken Griffey Jr. from the softball episode in "The Simpsons," "Wow. It's like there's a party in my mouth, and everyone's invited." Each dog is an experience everyone has to try for themselves. I usually go there with 4-5 friends and we just go split them in half and share. I really can't explain how delicious the sausages are. Just try it and you will be hooked. The BAD: The seating. It's such a small place, but decorated in a playful, unique way with walls covered in hot dogs and hot dog memorabilia. Some people know the drill by eating at a good pace and leaving. Some of the people, however, love to just make a day out of sitting at their table. It's straight up terrible how some people can be so inconsiderate of the people waiting in line. Some people have been outside for like 45min to 1 hour+! The duck fat fries are average. A lot of people rave about them, but I like my fries to be thicker but that's just me. It does give a slightly sweeter taste that can appeal to some people, but I'm not really into that either. The UGLY: The wait! The wait can be seriously long and ugly. The last visit we had there gave my friends and I an hour wait. It was during the winter, but the day wasn't too bad for everyone except for my brother's friend (he came with just a long sleeve T-shirt and sweatpants over basketball shorts. He ended up using his pants to cover his arms because the windchill was making him pretty cold up top. Another ugly thing is the prices. $7.50-$9.50 for a hot dog? Good Lord that's alotta money. Costco has some of the same mixtures in like 12-15 packs for $14. I actually wanted to make this a 3 star place but the hot dogs were just too good. Well the dogs are great but the only real problems are seating, the wait, and prices. If your willing to go through those obstacles then you have an awesome hot dog in your future.
