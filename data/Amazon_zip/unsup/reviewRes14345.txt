Last Saturday, a group of ten of us came here. We waited about an hour (they don't take reservations), but gorged ourselves with the bacon fat popcorn and an assortment of beers and cider comfortably in a large waiting room area with ample seating. When it finally came time to sit down, I was almost too full from all of the beer tasting and popcorn to eat too much. One of their specials was a fresh-made giant pretzel with a cheesy ale dipping sauce (not exactly sure of the correct name). My friend and I split it, shared some with the table, and everyone agreed that the dipping sauce made it special. For dinner, I had the farm burger and fries, but ate too much earlier to be able to finish either of them, although I would order any of these meal items again. Our server was attentive and kept our drinks refilled so we were never in want of more water (which annoys me when I'm thirsty and have nothing to drink!) or beer. Overall, I would come here again since it's very casual and you can come as you are, but it's a hike for me and I usually don't like to wait so long for a table.
