I grew up eating fresh sashimi so i am very picky about eating sushi. But this place was great. I was not expected.. Price was good and not over priced as I see often at other sushi place.. I was super hungry so i felt like they served a little bit slow comparing to the amount of sushi chef were there.. but i guess that was just me. BYOB style is also cool.
