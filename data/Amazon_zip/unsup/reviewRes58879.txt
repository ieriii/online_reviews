Superb (first time) dining experience from start to finish. The fact that service and attention was beyond the doting stage only served to make the diffficult menu choices that much more satisfying. Not for the diner who tends to consume similar food groups at every evening meal (I never thought I would enjoy watermelon as part of an entree), but for the rest of us, superior.
