Great place. The entrance was underwhelming, but upstairs is breathtaking huge hall, beautifully designed. The menu is very well thought through, all items on the plate really compliment each other. Almond gazpacho is incredible, as well as pork belly, pulpo con patatas, and olive oil cake with wild blueberries. The wine is really overpriced, although the selection is decent. I would bring my own the next time.
