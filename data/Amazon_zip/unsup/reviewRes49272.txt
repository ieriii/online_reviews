I REALLY wanted to love this place because it was so darn cute and their cupcake flavors were so awesome, but they were really dry. I'll go back there because it's close to my house and we spend a lot of time in that area, but I just wish that they were moister. I went specifically for the cupcakes (it's what I do) but I think I'll order a tart next time because they looked so awesome. The staff was really helpful and the presentation was incredible, but for the best cupcakes in the city, that award still belongs to Sweet Mandy B's.
