Hey. Let us be fair. The food is actually good. It IS actually authentic. I have been there countless times and heard native Italian after native Italian say that it's perfect, and then order an espresso, pronouncing it just a little bit cooler than everyone else. So everyone who visited Italy for four seconds and act like they know the score are absurd, because real Italians don't waver. But it is over priced. The boss occasionally yells at his staff in front of us, which is inappropriate, especially since they seem pretty competent. Not to mention we were asked to leave once because he needed room for more customers after we'd been there for only an hour. I'm also a bit annoyed by how some people get stuff for free and others don't. The whole situation seems rather random. But the food is good. I would say I've tasted nearly everything on the menu. Creepy, I suppose, to say out loud. But I do like the food. Just not a huge fan of the management, but some people seem to like him.
