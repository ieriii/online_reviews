Love this brunch spot. I was very surprised to see that it had lower ratings than other nearby places. Great coffee, great pancakes, great sandwiches. I really enjoyed the huevos rancheros when I had it. Actually, I have yet to be disappointed by anything that I have ordered here. And to top it off, the service is friendly and helpful, and the atmosphere is very cozy. The only complaint I can make is that there is often a long(ish) queue at the weekend -- in my eyes a good sign, but potentially annoying when you are starving for your first bite of food for the day.
