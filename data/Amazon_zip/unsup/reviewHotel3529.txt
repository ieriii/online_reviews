After reading the other glowing reviews, I think I might be at a different hotel. This place has pretentious written all over it. It aspires, and yet, it fails. I've yet to see a "large" or "spacious room." I was in a Comfort Suites near O'Hare yesterday, and today, the room I'm in at the Avenue (which costs much more) is smaller than most hotel rooms I stay at in 4-to-5-star hotels. My room overlooks the roof of another building. My flat panel TV gets 16 channels, most of which are local/network. Valet parking is either $45 or $49, more than the cost of renting the car for the day. I couldn't get an answer because there was utter chaos at check in. No organization at all. My room wasn't ready when it was supposed to be. I had to wait 45 (!) minutes for a room to become available, so I just surfed the Internet on my laptop while I waited. Did I get anything in compensation? Nope. Even more confusing? My reservation calls this place the Crowne Plaza. Everything else calls it the "Avenue." The sign outside says both. Which is it? Not impressed -- and I'm even a Priority Club member. P.S. The "zebra chairs" are just a cotton print. You could make one with fabric from Wal-Mart.
