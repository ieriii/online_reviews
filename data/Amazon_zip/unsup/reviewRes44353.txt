I came in here after getting my physical done. I came to celebrate because my doctor told me that I am in perfectly healthy shape: perfect blood sugar, perfect blood pressure, and get this: perfect BMI. So I gallantly entered Alliance and asked the barista to make me something with a lot of whipping cream. He looked at me puzzled for a second, but I reassured him: I was serious. He made me a mocha with LOTS of chocolate and LOTS of whipping cream (as requested). As he gave it to me, he said, "This might be the most unhealthy beverage I've ever made." I thanked him for taking such accurate directions. For kicks, I also got a lemon poppy seed muffin. And walked into their lounge. There, I started formulating this review. The music perfectly complimented what everyone was doing. Whether it was reading articles for class (me), working on laptops, or quietly gossiping (two hot girls), the music was neither snooze-worthy nor too distracting. The coffee was brilliant. Strong, but didn't give mama the jitters. Comfortable seating, not cozy enough to make me nod off, but definitely better than other chairs you can find at various coffee shops around the city. It was just perfect. I got so much done. In a pleasant environment. Nice work, Alliance. I'll be back.
