SIMPLY AMAZING! thats all i could say. Everyone is so friendly there, i walked in to some celia cruz music along with some old salsa. every single waiter/waitress welcomed me and my girlfriend with a nice warm smile and a hello. the appetizers, entrees, and deserts are amazing with minimum wait. very reasonable priced as well. i cant wait for the summer to go back and enjoy the fresh air while having some cuban.
