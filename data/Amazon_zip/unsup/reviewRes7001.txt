This is a mini review for those with a point of reference: The food is 80% as good as Smoque (basically the same standard BBQ menu with same sides which is not a bad thing) BUT the ambiance, dessert and drink menu makes it a cooler place to dine out. The have a nice selection of bourbon and whiskey with a pretty extensive wine list (mostly California). The desserts are pretty inventive and a nice touch (bacon and oatmeal cookies, rhubarb pie with ice cream). This place is a great way to marry a fun time out with BBQ.
