Awesome burgers! Top of the line beef and cooked perfectly. Fries are way overdone, though, in my opinion. When I want a good burger, I come here. Frenchie on an English muffin. You won't be sorry. Also, they're not playing around with those garlic fries - they're like biting into a clove itself! That's a good thing.
