4 words. Over Priced Hot Dogs. Not all that. Always busy. Only thing that saves them from getting 1 solitary star is the krinkle cut fries are redeeming. They are nothing special, mind you but a quality that makes for a better meal experience. If you are a tourist please don't come here. There is so much better. I know Superdawgs has a lot of fans but I am in the minority on this one. Right up the street there used to be a place called Happy Hound, which would service you like a champ minus all the hoopla over nothing at Superdawgs. If I were to guess it is just because of the location and over hyping everyone seems to give it.
