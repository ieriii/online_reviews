foodwise, this is my favorite brunch spot in chicago. they have some amazing choices such as the yankee scrambled eggs and the breakfast burritos. plus i'd highly recommed the cheese grits. the downside: this place can be unbearably packed during the weekend and as often as i go i've found that there is no rhyme or reason to how busy this place can get. sometimes i've lucked out and have been seated right away and other times i've left because i couldn't handle the wait. the service varies as well. certain times have been horrible and other times it's been fine. in my opinion the pros outweigh the cons here.
