I was really excited to eat here this past Saturday night. My good friend is a teacher at Lasalle 2 Elementary school just down Division so we strolled down there later in the evening. At some point during the day my friend was given a coupon from Fifty50 saying "We support our Teachers!" and it said come in for 40% off your entire bill. There was no fine print, no explanations as to what the specifics were. So we showed up ready to enjoy. Looking over the menu, I was shocked by all the accolades this place had gotten and was ready to try some of the food. When we presented the coupon however, the waitress said it only applied to the person with the coupon, even though everyone at the table was a teacher, but didn't have their CPS id's. This wasn't printed on the coupon and we were thoroughly bummed. The wait staff was rude and indignant about us hoping for the deal, so we eventually just got up and left. We really didn't have a problem spending the money, but the way it was handled was awful and made us feel like beggers for even asking. We ended up walking next door to "Small Bar" and had a great time. I can't speak for the food, but the service staff was poor. Don't go here.
