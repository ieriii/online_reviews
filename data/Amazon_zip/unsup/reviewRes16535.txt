overrated, overrated. Fun place, I admit. Great atmosphere, good drinks, and a fun time. The food, however is low quality, overindulgent and just plain lame. If the quality of the food isn't good, the restaurant is just not worth it for me. Their meat is of poor quality, there is nothing great about the flavors in their dishes, and the dishes are mediocre at best.  I think it's easy to get crazy about this place b/c they fancy themselves to be some great restaurant and put up a good show, but both times I have been there, I felt like I saw straight through their facade to the poor quality food they serve.  Pass!
