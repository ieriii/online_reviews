Our group of 6 decided on Sapori Trattoria for our monthly "turtles" get together. I'm always down for Italian so I was pleased and was looking forward to trying a place I had never before patronized. The service was extremely accommodating. They even put us in our own little intimate room in the back. Sometimes restaurants can get very loud, making it difficult to converse, but the noise level at Sapori was totally acceptable. It's not often that we all get together, so it's important that we can all hear what the other is saying. The food was great. I thought it was a little on the pricey side (most of their dishes are over $20), but they did have a nice variety. There were a few things I was deciding between. The pumpkin ravioli and lobster ravioli sounded phenomenal, but I was really in the mood for the gnocchi. It came with a pesto sauce, and it was quite good. I wished the pesto sauce would have been a bit creamier, but other than that, I was happy with my choice. They also give a nice portion, so while you are paying at least $20, that will be enough for dinner and lunch the next day. They had a fabulous wine list, bread straight out of the oven, and a number of tantalizing desserts. We ordered the panacotta, which was my favorite dessert, as well as the tiramisu, also good, and the bread pudding, which I did not try. The only thing I wasn't crazy about was my caesar salad. It just wasn't exciting. The dressing was just OK and the lettuce did not look fresh. Boo. Other than that, this was a fabulous pick. I would not hesitate to come back, and this place is excellent for groups.
