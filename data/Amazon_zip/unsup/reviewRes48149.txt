Oh man, I've been so busy recently I can't believe I never got around to write the review for Publican. This little gem of a restaurant in the West loop embodies fresh ingredients and creative ways of preparing them. Came here for Sunday brunch and the four of us were seated inside one of the pig pens, I have to say that was one of the more amusing things in a good way that happened to me that day, surely made me enjoy my meal more. On subsequent visits we sat on the patio and on a nice summer day that's the best place to be IMO. Service- casual and efficient. Food 1) Publican bacon- the server recommended it the first time I came here and I've gotten it every time I've been back and it has never disappointed me. 2) Soft-shelled crab sandwich- was amazing! 3).... actually I will just skip the rest as the menu is ever changing and quoting a friend when asked what's good at Publican, his reply was "EVERYTHING" and indeed everything I've tried here has been good to amazing so get out here and try their Sunday brunch, you won't be disappointed.
