Sultan's Market is my go to spot for falafel. It is consistently delicious and cheap. The rice and lentils dish is sooo good and the spinach pie is pretty tasty too. My only criticism is that the falafel in the sandwiches is not hot, which would be preferable and I feel it wasn't always the case that they were cold. Also, the woman (owner?) at the cash register should probably not be on the phone all the time when ringing people up. It seems sort of rude and might turn some people off, but whatever, I still love Sultan's.
