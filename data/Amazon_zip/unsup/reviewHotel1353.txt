This is a nice old hotel right off Michigan Ave and very close to the lake. I booked my stay here while a 20% off special was running, it came to about $150/night for the middle of the week. While that is a good rate I believe for a hotel in the area, what you realize when you get there is that a lot of the incidental, parking etc. are pretty outrageous. Valet parking was $55/night. I needed a roll on bed added to my room, in most hotels I've stayed in this has been for free but they charged $20/night for this too. In many ways this hotel is the bastard cousin of the Drake, right across the street. Don't expect it to be quite as glamorous or classy, but ofcourse you get what you pay for. Also the location is smack in the middle of the "Vi-tri" (Viagra triangle) in Chicago. Basically a lot of old dudes hanging out at the steakhouses and bars in the area. If you're not an old dude you'll want to get out of the area pronto! In summary, good hotel, great location, friendly staff, just don't come here expecting it to be the Drake!
