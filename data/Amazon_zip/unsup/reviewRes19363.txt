I've been here a few times and for me, this place is just okay. The rolls are good, but nothing outstanding. They've got a good selection, but nothing I haven't seen before. The prices are about average for sushi so its not a bad deal. And the BYOB is nice and saves money. (Though they do have some sort of specific policy about how much you can bring. Not a bad idea on their part really, but they were oddly insistent about it on the phone and didn't seem to enforce it all once we got there.) All the times I've gone the service has been extremely slow. Maybe it was just at really busy times and sushi isn't exactly fast food, but it seemed unusually slow. The staff is nice enough, but again nothing special. It can also be quite loud in there when its busy, which is understandable but annoying when you're trying to having a nice romantic evening or a conversation with friends. Overall it's nothing to complain about but nothing worth going out of your way for. I'd go if I were in the neighborhood but there are far better sushi spots in the city.
