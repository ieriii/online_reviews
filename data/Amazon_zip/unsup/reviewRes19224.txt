Crab cakes and football, that is what Maryland does. We'll we're not in Maryland, so burgers and beer. That's what Bad Apple does.  The food menu at Bad Apple is relatively limited. That is probably all for the better because the beer list is LONG. There are far too few restaurants here in Chicago where the beer list is many times longer than the food menu. Bad Apple is one of these few, exemplary venues.  Some appetizers and sandwiches comprise about half of the menu, and burgers define the other half. For anyone who is looking for a beer to wash down their succulent burger and fries, well you've got a veritable novel of beer to peruse. It's not as though Bad Apple offers every variety of Bud and Coors and Miller, and used those to create their tome of beery goodness. The good folks at Bad Apple seemed to have scoured this fair country and the better part of the world to find great beers that won't sully their good food.
