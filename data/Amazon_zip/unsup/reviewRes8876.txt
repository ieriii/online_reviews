there's something about this place that feels like you are somewhere else. the staff is really wonderful and the pizza is pretty good - mind you, if you're looking for deep dish or a smothering of sauce and toppings...this place isn't for you. the crust is really good and the amount of fixings are apropos. the antipasto plate is alright....but, the white pizza with rapini w/sausage on it was really phenomenal! i love how they give you a pizza cutter so you can make your slice as big or little as you want. i'm definitely going to make my way back :) thanks spacca napoli!
