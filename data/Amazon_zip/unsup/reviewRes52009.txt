Gino's East was my 2nd Chicago-style pizza experience (the first was Giordano's). I split a small pepperoni with a friend. The crust was good, the sauce was good, but the cheese? Lacking that special melty-gooey cheese quality that I love on a pizza. You know, that cheese that connects your slice to the rest of the pie by a series of melty, cheesy strings, even when you stretch it about 3 feet from the pie. Yeah, that didn't happen, and I was a bit disappointed. So...not awful, but not my favorite.
