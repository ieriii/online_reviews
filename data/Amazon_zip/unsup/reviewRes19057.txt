We went here on a whim and oh man am I disapointed! I was hoping that I would get something to rave about, but other then the Shiner Boch being 3.75 I got nothing. The service was sup par because she really didn't talk to us much or sell the burgers! I wasn't really impressed with the burger combos so I went with the veggie burger called strange famous. It was a hommade veggie burger with goat cheese, grilled onions, and some other topping I can't remember. Erin had the frenchie and it was very rich! Spinach, Brie, and truffle on a juicy piece of meat. We both got the fries w curry, but it is a spice and not the curry sauce for .75 more a piece. The ketchup tasted homemade or something but it was watered down tomato paste. The prices are very reasonable but i don't think I will come back!
