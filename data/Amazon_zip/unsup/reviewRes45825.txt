After reading the reviews, I was looking forward to a nice dinner with my husband and 3 of our friends. I ended up having an ok dinner, but I will probably not return. Our service was terrible- I had to flag down the waitress 3 times throughout our time there to refill drinks. She never stopped by to see if we needed anything or wanted another drink (most of our party had ordered mixed drinks - at $11 each and absolutely not worth the money). It took her 45 minutes to take our dinner order - and I had to flag her down for that too. The other reviews had said that this was similar to a more upscale Cheesecake Factory. I disagree. Overall, the food was just ok. I had a burger- it was a regular burger. My husband had the BBQ salmon. The salmon was undercooked, and it came with mashed potatoes that had been tubed/piped onto the sides of the salmon and it looked like mashed potato cake frosting. The other 3 in our party ordered various sandwiches, all of which looked like regular deli sandwiches. Nothing special. The saving grace of the night was our deserts. I spilt the pineapple upside down cake with my husband, and it was one of the best pineapple upside down cakes I've ever had. Our friends had the carrot cake and cheesecake, and they said those were great also. There were a few pros for the place, which, aside from the desserts, is why I gave 2 stars instead of 1. We went on a Monday at 6pm and didn't have to wait for a table- impressive, considering its location on the Mag Mile. The atmosphere was nice, comfortable and casual, which is always a bonus. And their food prices for entrees were standard for the area. But overall, this was a less than average dinner experience for me. I'd rather wait the 45 minutes for a table at the Cheesecake Factory and receive good food and service than wait 45 minutes to get a refill on ice water at the Grand Lux.
