Quite honestly... I'd love to give this place 5 stars, but I was REALLY disappointed with their entrees... Chicken - dry, Salmon - bland... no flavor whatsoever... However, the appetizers are fabulous!!! If you decide to go there for dinner, instead of the main dish, get a few appetizers, your taste buds will appreciate the many flavors. Oh, and don't forget about the mojitos!!! Try the raspberry one, you will not be disappointed!!! The flavor is phenomenal! For desert, I would go with the cheesecake! Yummy!
