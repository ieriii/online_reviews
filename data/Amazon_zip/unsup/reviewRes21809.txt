Went here for breakfast. Chorizo egg torta at $7.50 is a bit pricey. But it is a huge portion, easily shared by two. And full of flavor. Churros are a must order. As an expert of the churros on the 7 train platform at Grand Central Station in NYC, Bayless makes hands down the best churros. Along with the beignets at Cafe du Monde in New Orleans, most addicting food ever. Had the almond milk hot chocolate. Thick and you really get the real taste of chocolate.
