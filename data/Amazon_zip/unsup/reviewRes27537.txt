Mexican We had chicken tacos and the enchiladas suiza. When I hesitated in choosing the meat for my enchiladas, he said "Try one of each," so I did. The food came out about 5 minutes later - fast. big plates, swimming in food, I couldn't believe it. The steak and ground beef enchiladas were very good, the salsa verde was fantastic. I did not get to the chicken enchilada as I was pathetically stuffed at this point. Also on the plate were very good rice and beans, guacamole, tomato, and lettuce - nice extras. The tacos had a lot of meat. It actually looked like they used all white meat chicken. They were very good, moist and yummy. Lime, lettuce, tomato, radish also served on the side.
