Best sweet potato fries in the city. End of discussion. Crispy, which if you've had many sweet potato fries you know is a miracle. Crispy on the outside, creamy on the inside, and served with what they call a goat cheese fondue, which is really just a bowl of fatty goodness. Oh, they serve other food too. Last time I was there I had a turkey sandwich, which sound dull until you've had their turkey sandwich, which is a slap in the face to turkey sandwiches everywhere. The turkey is from Gunthorp Farms, which I didn't even know raised turkeys, but they do, and they're just as good as their pigs. Uncommon Ground is all about the local and organic, which is nice, but really it just tastes good, which is what I'm looking for. Also, they don't get all earthy-crunchy in your face, which is a relief. That said, here is the weirdest thing about UG. Their outdoor seating ... is in the parking lot. Seriously. Right next to the entrance. Sandwiched between Devon and people driving in and out of the lot. Yes, it's fenced in, but not such a lovely place for a meal.
