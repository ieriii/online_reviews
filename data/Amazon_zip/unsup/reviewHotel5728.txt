For a business trip, I found the Crowne Plaza to be beyond adequate. The rooms are decorated in a clean, modern manner. It's within walking distance of some great restaurants (Meli, Greek Islands, the Paramount Room, etc.). The staff was very friendly and helpful. The wireless Internet and workout facilities are free. And, the restaurant/bar in the lobby is pretty darn good.  There is also a Dominick's grocery store, Walgreen's and Starbucks within 100 yards of the hotel's front door.
