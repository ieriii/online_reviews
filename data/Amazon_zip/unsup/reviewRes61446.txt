I came here with a few people for dinner. I was impressed with how classy&fancy it looks. BUT it's not Asian fusion so if you want pretty little expensive Asian food, please go somewhere else! We ordered 2 pounds of crawfish, fried chicken in fish sauce, scallops in bacon, pan fried noodle with seafood, and shrimp fried rice. The crawfish was so tasty and flavorful but it was pricey for the amount of crawfish they gave us. Oh well.. The fried chicken is the best chicken I've ever tasted! My taste buds were just dancing. The sauce that was flavoring the chicken was the best part. In addition, they put cucumbers around it to balance out the saltiness. ;) Scallops in bacon wasn't all that, could survive without it. Kind of pricey, the quantity was good, but the quality wasn't. The shrimp fried rice was sort of dry and the shrimp was a bit hard. It was weird, I'll try something else next time. The pan fried noodle (hu tieu xao do bien) was good. I only ate the pan fried noodle, no seafood, so I can't say much.. But I'd DEFINITELY come back. :) Plus plus! The bathroom is spectacular, out of this world!
