My parents were in from out of town this past weekend and I took them to Wildfire Sunday evening. I've always been a big fan of the place but hadn't been there in some time. It was just as good as I remember it being. Incredible bread (the onion bread, not the one with the fruit in it -- not such a fan of the fruit bread). Big portions, and a helpful waitstaff. If I could afford it, I would eat here all the time.
