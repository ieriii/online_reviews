Everyone who lives, visits, or stops through Chicago always wants to try this place because of all the hype. So after living in Chicago for quite awhile my boyfriend and I, along with another couple, finally decided to head over on a Thursday night. We were all extremely underwhelmed and disappointed. The food was mediocre at best, the portions are laughable, and the service was not up to par for a meal that cost the amount of money we spent. The salsa is a joke. I thought we would be given enough for the entire table or atleast enough for one person. The salsa was served in two small plates and the serving size was about a tablespoon of each salsa. It was ridiculous. Not to mention they gave us barely any chips. I guess you don't need that many when the salsa portion is barely a spoonful. I ordered fish in Yucatecan Escabeche. It was tasteless and unseasoned. I also ordered the Traditional black beans. They tasted like they came straight out of a can and/ or sat under a heat lamp for way too long. At the beginning of our meal our waiter was noticeably getting mad because we were not ready to order after he had come by twice. We were just talking and catching up we didn't realize as soon as we sat down we were going to be rushed through our meal. It was really rude. He also was not happy when we did not decide to get dessert. It was a little inappropriate. Everyone else was just as disappointed as I was. We were just expecting more from such a well-known and raved-about restaurant from a celebrity chef. There are a lot of drink choices. I had the rhubarb margarita and was not that impress but everyone else was really happy with their drinks. I can now say I went but unfortunately I will not be returning. Big waste of money.
