Slight brusque doorman only adds to the charm, that's how good this place is. I've never seen jazz this fantastic - not for this bargainous an entry charge anyhow ($12). The atmosphere is great, as everyone is there to enjoy the music. The sevice is swift and the drinks aren't too expensive - we enjoyed a decent bottle of cabernet for in the region of $20. It's not somewhere to spend every Friday - conversation is obviously tricky - but for any visitor to Chicago I'd say it was a must. Head there early - after about half 8, the tables are full and it's standing room only.
