We decided to try out Carnivale for a friend's 21st birthday on a Friday night. Wow, it was busy! Even though we had made reservations, it took nearly an hour to seat the whole party (granted, our party for 40 plus people! so I don't blame the restaraunt for being completely overwhelmed!). But while we waited, a DJ spun some great latin music, so we were able to dance the wait time away (and worked up a big appetite in the process)! Loved: - rasberry mojitos - guacamole - ceviche anything! I would definitely come back here for appretizers and drinks!
