So, the over all experience here was good except for ONE glaring point. Hotels should do a couple of things right. 1. Have clean linens and bedding and 2. have room service that is on time. That said the Hyatt had a nice gym and pool. Decent equipment. It was conveniently located close the convention center that we were working at. On our last day we called the night before for room service so that we would be sure to be able to eat before working since we had an early call time. Well they called 15 mins after the time they were suppose to deliver our breakfast telling us it would be another 15-20 mins and if that would be OK. WE SO ANNOYED BECUASE NOW HAD NO TIME TO EAT AND FIND ANOTHER OPTION. They had all night to figure out their scheduling to be sure to have our breakfast served on time.  Sorry Hyatt this was totally unacceptable and worse you left us high an dry with out having breakfast and going straight to work where eating lunch is not option due to how busy the day is. Hopefully next time you get it right and in the event of screwing it up you offer something in return for your mistake.
