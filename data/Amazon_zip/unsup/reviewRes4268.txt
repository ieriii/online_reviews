A hearty no, thumbs down, no thank you to this place. We brought my husband's dad and step-mom here for drinks around 10pm on Friday night. Everyone reccomends it, the reviews are great, it is supposedly a Chicago institution.....and we were not impressed. Actually, we were impressed. We were impressed that a place that is supposed to be so great could suck so bad. Between the $50 is cost us just to get in the door, the abyssmal beer selection, the rude staff (we were yelled at twice for being "in the way" when all we did was sit in barstools that were already there) the constant shushing, and the crappy jazz (and dad loves jazz), this place is just a mess. They say everyone should come here once. Well we came, we hated it, and we won't be back.
