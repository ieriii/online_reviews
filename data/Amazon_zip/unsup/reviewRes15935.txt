For the cocktail connoisseur, the Violet Hour is a must-visit. You may or may not appreciate the decor, and who could appreciate the "give us your cell number, we MAY call you back" waiting list, but the drinks are some of the best I've ever had. To give you an idea of the sort of cocktail we're talking about, take the delicious Chi-Town Flip: Buffalo Trace Bourbon, Dow's Tawny Port, Whole Egg, and Fee's Old Fashioned Bitters shaken to milkshake consistency and served in a highball glass. If that sounds too rich, there's the classic, reliable Corpse Reviver #2: Bombay Dry Gin, Lillet, Curacao, and Absente. Finally, there's my favorite, the Autumn Sazerac: Old Overholt Rye Whiskey, Berentzen Apflekorn, Herbsainte, and Peychaud's Bitters. If those drinks don't excite you, you still might appreciate the dark, candlelit, windowless Speakeasy atmosphere, with custom-made, high-back booths. The man standing outside the boarded up storefront, sporting a suit, sunglasses, clipboard, and Secret Service-style earpiece, taking phone numbers for the waiting list, may enhance your feeling of exclusivity. These things were fun for me the first time, but I can imagine them getting tiresome, especially if it's common not to be called back and having to check back later. Still, I think the drinks demand a little patience and a willingness to play along, at least until you've tried most of them.
