Best deep dish in Chicago as far as I'm concerned. Can say that I haven't had any thin crust pizza better than Pequod's as well. Great place to eat, too - staff is very friendly and service is great. Have been there many times and always a great experience. Delivery is excellent as well. Can't miss with this place!
