Went to Davanti again on Saturday (been here numerous times) and had another plesant experience. Arrived around 9pm and only waited about 10 minutes for a seat on the rooftop patio, which was really nice.  They don't take reservations, which is frustrating and the wait is typically MUCH longer. I've waited up to 2.5 hours on the weekend. :( Maybe going later (around 9 helped). I have to admit, I once again ordered the burger, which I normally do and really enjoyed it.  For the app, the marscapone/polenta with the braised pork was awesome. The corn bruschette was ok, wouldn't get it again. The service was as expected, but not outstanding. Def. recommend trying this place!
