I don't know, I guess our stay here was fine. Nothing exciting, the room was decent, and the bathroom was pretty nice. The check in process was smooth, but we were unable to use the in-room checkout for some reason. If you like them on FB they have been running promotions for 24 hours of free internet with the secret password, which is good since they charge something like $14 a day. We ate breakfast downstairs one morning, it wasn't great. We ordered off of the menu instead of getting the buffet, I wish we had skipped it all together. There is a Corner Bakery a block or so away, it was better and cheaper for sure. The location was pretty much perfect- close to shopping and dining.
