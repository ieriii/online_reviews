Oh Doug.....we share your passion for encased meats.....how you perfected the art of three star dining and fast and friendly service that starts from you. You read the reviews....so there's nothing I can say that really equals what the yelpers have been saying...so I'll just give you some quick pointers: CASH ONLY Weird hours(they're not open for dinner....open at 1030am...closed at 4pm monday thru saturday) check the website (http://hotdougs.com) for what's on their special menu....and what holidays they will be closed on....Doug loves taking extended vacations so check the website often....and before you plan on making a trip to there... First time there? NP....make sure you let Doug know(he is always on the cash register taking your orders) it's your first time there so he can happily guide you through what you want to order.....he is extremely patient and friendly...so don't be worried if it's your first time... My recommendations if you're there the first time....get the FOIS GRAS dog....imo their best product other than their fresh cut fries deep fried in DUCK FAT! DUCK FAT fries are only available on fridays and saturdays....and they are worth the $3.50....you will get a large amount.... Lastly...have fun and enjoy Doug's vision and passion for his little encased meat emporium and sausage superstore!
