First off, the space is really nice. Low amber warm lighting, with a really rad central modern chandelier. Seating is pretty cool too, non traditional with some couches and benches but also the standard tables and booths. Food was massively yummers. So were the Moscow Mules! Oprah luvs em too. Food takeaways were the duck and pork liver moose with stone ground mustard and cornichones. Totally GOOD! Even the toasted bread was good on its own. Gnocchi was really more potatoey in flavor than I am used to, but I liked it! Buttery goodness going on in that situation. And the kicker was the braised beef. Cant really ever go wrong with something like that, but this was extra special. Tasted like they used some five spice, or anise something. Kicked it up a few notches. There was NONE left. Carrot cake was good too, but the icing was a little bit too sugary....needs to be lighter, more whipped up. Overall, I really really enjoyed my meal here. Cant wait to return.
