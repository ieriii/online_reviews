Went to Superdawg on my recent trip to Chicago -- LOVE THIS PLACE -- it's consistently good and the service is excellent, love the drive-in set up. Really surprised by some of the reviews I've read here!! I've been going to this place for years and now that I no longer live in Chicago I make a point of visiting every time I'm in town. I had the hamburger this time and it was excellent but I love their dogs, too! Also, LOVE the fries. Overall, one of my favorite places!Note: They only take cash but there is an ATM there.
