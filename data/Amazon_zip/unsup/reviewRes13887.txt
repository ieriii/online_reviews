I've gotten take-out several times from the place, since my business / work is pretty close to this place. I love the Lechon and Tostones sandwich here.  It's probably one of the best pork sandwiches I've had in Chicago.  Moist, juicy and well seasoned pulled-pork. Fantastic! What I like the most is the overall experience, decor and energy of this restaurant. Every time I walk into this place, it feels like I've been transported to a small cafe in Miami or the Florida Keys.  The only other restaurant is Chicago where I felt like I was somewhere else besides being in Chicago was at Birchwood Kitchen, which left me feeling like I was walking into an upscale cafe situated in downtown Portland or Boulder. This place is a great combination of ethnic food, decor, music and variety and other intangibles which makes this place one of my favorites in the city.
