i live 3 blocks from longman and im kicking my own ass for waiting so long to try it! me and my girl friend went to eat brunch on monday and it was AMAZING. we shared the french toast and the chicken and waffle. Both were to die for. From what i hear the weekends are a bit of a shit show to get a table, but if you come in on a weekday you can get a seat right away. Our waitress was very nice and the food lived up to its standard. I even let a perfect stranger try some of my french toast! his eyes lit up when it hit our table and i couldn't resist to share. we will def be back for more!
