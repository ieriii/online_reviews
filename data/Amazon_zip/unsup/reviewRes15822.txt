So I came to this restaurant with a crappy can and got valley parking. SURPRISING $5. That's cheap. Dress casual and sexy. I see many girls dressing up like going to a club. It's a good place to take a date to. It's very pricey and the food was good. Great beautiful set-up and the service is good. Just saying, I would rather spend the money at Fogo de Chao or Texas de Brazil.
