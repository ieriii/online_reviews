Amazing food... I mean, really good... the fish is crazy good. I've been coming to this place since it opened. The Gonzo bloody mary is redonculous. That said, I think the service has SH$T the bed... ever since Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives, I feel like they've lost their neighborhood appeal and would rather be down in the gold coast. I know Glenn and many of the old timers don't feel this way but as some of the new blood comes in, they clearly don't have a connection to what Glenn was/is all about
