My dining experience in Chicago finished off with a deep dish pizza dinner and I was not disappointed at all with choosing Pequod's to end it all. It was packed because of the Pats vs. Tebow game, but luckily we had a reservation and were seated upstairs. We had the corner booth to watch the game so I could not have been happier with our seating.  The pizza took a long time to come out, but they warn you of that when you walk in. They make each pizza to order, which to me is a great thing. In the end, there is lot worse things that you can do then to talk to company for 30 minutes while you salivate at the thought of some cheesy, doughy, saucy concoction cooking in the oven waiting your disposal. To be 100% honest, I still prefer NYC pizza, but Chicago pizza was delicious and filling. 2 pies were more than enough for 5 of us (3 guys, 2 girls) and they were both extremely delicious.  Side note: The next morning I went skeet shooting (that's right bitches, I am a skeet shooter too) with a Chicago native and he was very pleased at my choice of Pequod's for the deep dish pizza, so clearly it's a favorite amongst locals as well.
