The boyfriend and I stopped in here the other night before seeing a film. We saw a few cops eating in the place and figured, hey, if there's cops eating there, it's probably not awful. It wasn't awful. The service was spot-on- our waitress was very attentive, refilled my drink often, and asked how things were. The ambiance was all right- a sort of dive-y, bring your kids kind of place. There were flat screens tuned to the Sox game. The small salad I had was fresh and good, but the (thin crust) pizza wasn't my favorite. The pineapple on the pizza was in full rings- which made it difficult to eat given the fact that the pizza is cut into the little squares. The toppings and cheese slid off the pizza, leaving you with either a mouthful of cheese and toppings or a mouthful of bread. There wasn't much flavor to the pizza, and I wasn't a fan of the braided crust- it just seemed overly dry, flavorless, and burned. Generally, I love the crusts on pizza, but this one- not so much. The boyfriend seemed to like it, but I wouldn't order it again. Overall our experience was good- but the waitress really earned the three stars, because without the friendly service I'd have given this place the minimum one star. Also, it seemed a bit pricey for what it was- a medium pizza with two toppings, a small salad, a soda, and two (not fancy) beers cost $40 with a tip.
