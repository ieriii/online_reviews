We used Sutton Place hotel for our wedding reception venue and it worked out really well. Anna, the event coordinator, was fabulous. Working with her was like having a wedding planner. Can't say enough positive things about her, but having people like Anna to work with in the stress of wedding planning is a lifesaver! I could never thank her enough. The venue itself was great, too. The location is unbeatable, and the discounted room block rates were affordable for our guests. When the dance floor was down and the room was set up, it really looked less "hotel-like" and more unique. Plus, Sutton Place uses Flour, Cake, and Pastry for the wedding cake and those ladies do some fabulous work. Overall, it was a great place to book our event and I'm glad we chose it.
