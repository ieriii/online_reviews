I love this place.  Having visited other Brazillian Steakhouses before, I like that they added a cut (or two) more meats, as well as made their salad bar double the size.  Awesome wine/drink selection. The waiting staff are super attentive and are all over once you go green. After several visits, I try every time to eat my weight in filet mignons and garlic picanha.  I will never turn down an invitation to eat here. Don't mess with Texas.
