We were able to bring our own bottle of champagne and make mimosas. We mixed it with the strawberry orange juice; it was delicious! I ordered the cinnamon roll french toast and it was unbelievable! The french toast came with frosting that you were able to spread over each piece. I cannot wait to go back there again!
