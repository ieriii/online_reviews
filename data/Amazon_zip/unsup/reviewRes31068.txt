How can I give a place that has beer battered trumpet mushrooms and cheese curds on the menu less than 5 stars? The answer: I CAN'T. Oh man, Goose Island 312 Fritto Misto? You are a good appetizer, my friend. Those fried mushrooms, cheese, onions and squash with a spicy aioli for dipping? Good heavens! I'll break my diet for that. And you know what? I DID. The squash and broccoli soup topped with bacon and cheddar? Deeeelish. By the time my entree came around (the chicken sandwich with avocado, onions, greens, tomato and aioli) I was stuffed. But still I could not quit. Ate up half my sandwich and half the oh-so-amazing crispy house potatoes serving before I had to stop out of pain. The service was great. I went to dinner with a friend I hadn't seen in a bit so we were a couple of chatty Cathys that took a really long time to actually look at the menu and decide what to order but our waitress was friendly and patient. The space was bright and clean and I love an open kitchen. The smells wafting out of there always make me so happy. The iced tea was awesome. Brewed perfectly and not bitter. Not to mention the waitress was so on top of refills that I was never without my caffeine. Big bonus as far as I'm concerned. In the end we were both far too full to try the desserts which made me sad because the pumpkin cheesecake sounded to die for. Hohum guess I'll just have to go back for more! I took the rest of my chicken sandwich home and ate it for dinner the next night and it held up remarkably well. The chicken was still moist and flavorful and the veggies were still fresh. Excellent. My only complaint is that they didn't pack up the rest of my potatoes in my carry out carton. I'll be sure to ask next time.
