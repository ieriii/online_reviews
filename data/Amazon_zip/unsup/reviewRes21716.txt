Ok, the food is really good and the service is unique (you get to eat in your car, it reminds me of having a meal while in flight) but it now reminds me of great times with my wife and kids when they were much younger. We like to park the car pointing toward the green bushes and it's really relaxing. Without anything else to look at, you focus on your great food and conversation. I like the burger, cheeseburger, fish sandwich, onion rings, etc. The place, food, experience are linked to some great summer time, cherished memories. Thank you Superdawg!
