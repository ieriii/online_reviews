Not Marriott quality. Poor management, poor customer service, no follow through on customer service. Specifically: -internet sucks -manager doesn't follow through on action items -management makes no effort to compensate clientele for inconveniences -management makes no effort to address discrepancies in bills until I pointed it out right at check-out Soooooo, if you're thinking of typical Marriott quality, don't think of this place.
