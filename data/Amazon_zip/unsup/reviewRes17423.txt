I went for dinner and I had the "Arrachera". The steak was perfect and my raspberry mojito was delicious. We did have to wait a little for 14-20 minutes but it wasn't too bad since we didn't have reservations. I love the interior design, its bright and I loved the crowd, young and old people. I also went on a Sunday night when they did a wine flight thing and it was great! We ordered the guac and chips and you must have this when you go to Carnivale!
