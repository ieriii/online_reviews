Brunch: the Publican does it perfectly. My girlfriend and I had a really hard time choosing just one entree each, so we made up for that by ordering two sides. I food-gasmed over everything - the finger-licking spicy pork rinds, the flaky waffle with blueberry preserves and honey butter, the melt-in-your-mouth, thick-as-all-get-out maple syrup-cured bacon. My lady's egg custard - which came with some kind of smoked fish that I can't remember the name of - practically brought me to my knees. Finish that off with a perfectly-crafted mimosa and there are only four words I can think to say: "See you next Sunday."
