My new favorite place to eat in ALL of CHICAGO! I took my entire family here for my 30th birthday celebration. They do in fact take reservations and we sat at a terrific long table with bench seating and thrones at the end. My whole family thoroughly enjoyed the experience. It was such a festive atmosphere. A. The BEST Mojitos in town-- I didn't even LIKE mojitos before having theirs...and try? Boy did I! I had a regular, a pineapple, and a mango. All delicious. B. Their food was TERRIFIC-- spicy chicken and beef that tasted like it has been marinated since I was born. And the vegetarian platters (both of them) were INCREDIBLE. The two veg-heads in my family were very VERY pleased. It almost makes me look forward to the next milestone birthday....almost.
