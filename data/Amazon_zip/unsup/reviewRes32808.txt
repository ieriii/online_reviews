simply the best vegetarian i've ever had. tried the wings for an appetizer and they were AMAZING. kind of fun for someone who's never had the real thing. and just for authenticity sake, even my non-veg boyfriend was hooked on them. i had the radical reuben for dinner and it was perfect. absolutely delicious. lived up to and surpassed all the hype. i can taste it right now. if only i wasn't all the way in ny, i'd be there every other day! my non-veg bf had the meatball sub and he thought it was excellent. service was extremely friendly and knowledgable. hope to go back again soon!
