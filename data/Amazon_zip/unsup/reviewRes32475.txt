If you are a vegan living on the North side-this is heaven. Anywhere can serve up a salad with tofu and boast vegan options for their menu. Chicago Diner takes it to the extreme serving up REAL food. The sort of place you can take your meat eaters and they won't care/know the difference. The imitation meats are not really my thing, but if you are teetering on the edge and craving something that tastes like the real deal, let this be your guilty pleasure.
