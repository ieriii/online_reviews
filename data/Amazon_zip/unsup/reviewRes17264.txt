I read the other reviews, but after going there I am not convinced that this is the right place for me. Reasons: a) Overpriced low quality drinks - the bar is really not worth going to b) The "dressy" and "classy" clientele surely was somewhere else, instead the suburbians were out in force. Atmosphere is more like a Burger King at 11pm c) The maitre d' is as unfriendly as they come, the wait staff overworked d) The decor looks colourful, but a little tired - kind of dining in a big food hall e) Food is better elsewhere for better prices Really not worth it.
