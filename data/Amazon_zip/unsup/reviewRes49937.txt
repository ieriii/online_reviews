Definitely an exciting place to bring a large group of friends. Arrive early in the evening because this place gets packed and the wait can be excruciatingly long. The Columbian food here is pretty authentic, with each entree you get a nicely seasoned steak or seafood (shrimp or baby octopus) along with some exotic sides such as yuca or plantains. Excellent BYOB.
