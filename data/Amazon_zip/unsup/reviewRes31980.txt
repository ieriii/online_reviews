I am a huge fan of Ethiopian food and have my favorite spot but thanks to Groupon I thought I would try this spot out. While the service was a bit leisurely (which I didn't mind since I was on a date and enjoying the company) the food was excellent!  the trio of samosas was wonderful...I liked all three, flavorful, flaky and tasty. We got the meat veggie combo which was wonderful...great choices of all my usual dishes...I particiuarly enjoyed the zilil tibs and the lentils. and the injera was good as well Their honey wine was the best I have had...not too sweet with an awesome kick. Even enjoyed the mango ice cream for dessert! Plan to go back and place this one in my usual rotation of Ethiopian restaurants
