Listen, if you are a man or a meat eater this is the place for you. There is so much meat running around that you get full by just seeing the waiters walking by with meat. It's not a romantic first date restaurant. I think it's $50 a person if you eat or not. Of course you want to try every piece of meat coming your way, but you are looking around to see what's coming next that you don't get a chance to enjoy the food. It's certainly a conversation starter.
