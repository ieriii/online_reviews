Came here because I felt obliged to do something touristy in Chicago and because eating deep-dish pizza in Chicago has been one of my life goals. Seriously. I kind of wish i'd gotten a chance to check out Lou Malnatti's or Pequod's for comparison, but I was satisfied by Giordano's. Not wowed, but satisfied. We ordered a small pizza, which came in six slices. Saw other tables order mediums or large only for two people as well, but we could barely finish our pizza. No, we didn't finish our pizza. It was sooo filling. We had two slices each, stuffed with sausage, pepperoni, and mushrooms. I loved that the sausages were in thick, large chunks. But at the end, suffered such a food coma that I felt ill. The crust was quite thick and very crispy. Liked it, though I do think it contributed heavily to my food coma feeling. 3.5 stars.
