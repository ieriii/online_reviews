By far the best, most authentic chicago hot dog experience in the city of chicago. i love knowing that everytime i bring friends to dougs - i see the man himself - doug taking our order. you MUST go on Friday for duck fat french fry day! the line looks long, but moves fast. if you can get there before 11...you won't have a wait.
