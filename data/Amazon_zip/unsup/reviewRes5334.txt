You had me at roasted bone marrow. Where others are afraid, my taste buds boldly tread ahead. Pork galore...stuffed, fried olives, pork shoulder braised and presented with a toasted bread that got me eating carbs again with gusto. Small plates that are served with duck eggs, truffle oil, goat cheese and other savory delights. Yes, the wait is long, the eating communal and the noise level high but your mouth will thank you.
