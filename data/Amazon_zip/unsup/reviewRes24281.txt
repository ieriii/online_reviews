i have been to irazu twice. once this summer when there was a party atmosphere on the patio. the dj made my whole table want to dance! and a second time about a month ago when the patio was hopping, but the music was MIA. and i must admit, i missed it! it really helped set the scene and made you feel like you were on an island somewhere (mmmm costa rica?) instead of a stretch of milwaukee avenue. the food is plentiful and fabulous. each time i have set out with the goal of saving enough room for an oatmeal shake. and each time i have failed failed failed!!! bountiful portions and every bite gets more and more delicious so how can i stop?? :) get thee to irazu, tout de suite!!
