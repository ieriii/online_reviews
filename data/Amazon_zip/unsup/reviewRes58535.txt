The staff and food were amazing. I added a note on my reservation and they were very accommodating. The waiter was great and the buss boys were at times too aggressive on cleaning the table. That is better then the bus boys not showing up at all I guess. The place was buzzing all night the atmosphere was great. Overall a great experience but the only thing that I could say negatively is that I should of gave the Valet guy my ticket to get my car when I ordered desert, what's the deal long wait for the car........either way it was a amazing night. ************** THE SEA BASS A MUST HAVE ************************
