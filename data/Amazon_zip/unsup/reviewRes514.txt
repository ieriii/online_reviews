My husband and I ate here the other night, and we were not disappointed. What a great experience! It definitely lived up to the hype. The service was warm, friendly and very welcoming. The food was fun, complex and delicious. The sommelier was knowledgeable and easy to talk to (unlike some snooty sommelier's I've encountered at other restaurants). Capping off a great evening was Chef Achatz himself creating his work of art dessert on our table-top. Was I starstruck? Absolutely. Will I be coming back sometime soon? You bet!
