So on a bakery tour in the city with my company's executive chef and we stumbling into this place as our last stop. Is it possible for me to wish a store was my boyfriend? Yes it is! I walked in and thought "I could have fun at this place" Sadly that day we were bakery/bread focused. And even more sadly, the bakery was sort of disappointing. Chocolate angel food muffin: Texture has a wow-factor that entices but the flavor was so wearing. Good at first but soon becomes overpowering. Morning Bun: Another great texture! Like a wonderful brioche slathered with a delicious caramel sauce. My only complaint with the Morning Bun is that the sauce really sticks to your teeth. It seems like a cavity waiting to happen. Cheese Brioche Tart: HOLY FREAKING FANTASTICNESS!! I would take an hour train to the city to eat this for my daily breakfast if I could. It was the flavor of cheese-y heaven in a light, buttery tart crust that screamed "Bury your face in me and never love another!" So the rest of the store was so much fun to just look at. This is the place I could walk into and walk out broke. If I ever have the occasion to throw a wonderful dinner party, this place would be the place to find all my gourmet needs. I can't wait to get back and spend an hour just looking around.
