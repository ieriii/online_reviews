The first time I ate Pequod's was when we had staff meeting at a clinic I used to work at. At first, I was wondering what the char was on the crust (I'm not questioning why, but what is it?). My boss said it was cheese, and that made it even better. Their pizza was very unique, thin crust attributes (accidental caramel crust, loaded looking) with the appeal of a stuffed pie (the more to love deal). It was good, good enough to realize that I sometimes forget that it was a deep dish. However, to me, the only thing that really got me interested in their pizza was the crust. The cheese peeled/fell off often, that forced me to reset most of the pizza back on the crust. And because of caramelizing, the crust was very soggy underneath. Either way, interesting concept, tasty, but hard to overlook the flaws when you actually eat it.
