Wow, what a difference a few years makes. This pizza, frankly, stinks. If there was cheese on this pizza, I couldn't find it. Here's the ratio: 96% bread, 3% sauce, and 1% toppings. Excluding cheese. Just...wow. So not good. I like the caramelized crust. I'll give Pequod's that crust, but nothing else. I just can't get behind a deep dish pizza that has no cheese on it. (And I hasten to add that we ordered a straight-up cheese pizza, and one that was half cheese, half mushroom. More like half mushroom, half nothing but sauce.) People love this stuff, and I mean....why? Maybe they don't like cheese anymore.
