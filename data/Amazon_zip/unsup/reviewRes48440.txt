Publican = F'ing delicious. Menu at Publican = Diverse, lots of meat options, lots of beer. Enough options that even my super picky vegetarian mother was happy, weird right. Service at Publican = Friendly, helpful, great beer pairing reccos. The Design at Publican = I love everything down to the pink gingham checked shirts of female food runners and the wedgewood china. The Chairs at Publican = Ungodly painful. Like some sort of medieval torture device. The ladder back chair has been around a long time, why did you have to make one so painful?
