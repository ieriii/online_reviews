This place is great. It is perhaps the most authentic korean restaurant I have ever been to in the states. I swear its exactly like a regular galbi (bbq pork) spot in Seoul, only the price tags show dollars instead of won. I guess the service can be uneven, but the food is great and the prices are about right. They are open really late as well so you can go get a bunch of galbi and whittle the time away drinking soju and hot sake. This is a good family spot, a good drinking spot, and a good date spot.
