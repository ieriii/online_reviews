My husband read about this place so took me there as a surprise. I hadn't read any reviews and didn't know what I was getting into but was thrilled. We had a 90 minute dinner that seemed so quick and relaxing. I can't wait to go back to this fabulous restaurant. They didn't take reservations but when we arrived just after 6pm on a Tuesday, the restaurant was only half full (and 30 minutes later--it was more than full). I was not pleased at all when we were sat at a high top right next to the kitchen. Turns out at Davanti, this is THE BEST seat in the house. We were able to see all of the different plates and figure out what we wanted to eat based on watching it being prepped or served. Lucky us! We ordered some wine and then started ordering a few plates at a time. The entire order consisted of: toasted hearts of palm; crispy pork belly with peach mostarda; roasted cherry tomato, burrata cheese & basil oil; giant rigatoni, sausage, oven roasted tomato & parmigiano; and pizza with italian mild sausage, broccoli rabe, garlic & chili oil, fresh mozzarella, tomato. Everything was SO GOOD! And there was no problem (and no fuss!) to have the pasta with sausage on the side and pizza with sausage on one side. So different from any restaurant we visited in Italy. My husband didn't like the pork belly but was glad he tried it. Our waitress felt so bad that she took the charge for the pork belly off of our receipt. Little touches like this go a long way.
