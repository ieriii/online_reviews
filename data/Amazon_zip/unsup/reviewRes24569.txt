Tried the chicken and rice (avgolemono) soup to go for my first visit to Artopolis today. I was pleased with the portion size for the price - it was probably about 16 oz of soup, with a generous amount of actual chicken and rice, and a few small slices of delicious bread (I think it was mild sourdough) and two little butter packets - all for $4.37 after tax! This just might be the most cost-efficient and taste-efficient way to eat a full lunch in this neighborhood (maybe tied with Primo's $8 baked mostaccioli, which usually takes me two days to eat...). Overall very pleased. I was served quickly and they seemed like nice people.
