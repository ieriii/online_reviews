Despite the amazing variety of tasty servings, we were disappointed by the poor time management of the chef. We waited 20 minutes for our coffee and desert and finally just left without them at midnight. At most restaurants, this would not be worth mentioning, but at Alinea one expects perfection especially with the $650 price tag for two. It was late and we had traveled that morning so the delay really impacted our enjoyment of the evening. It was such a shame that we walked out of this amazing restaurant a little miffed. But when you charge that much for a meal, expectations are high. My recommendation is that Alinea is missable.
