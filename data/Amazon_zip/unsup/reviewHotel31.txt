I agree that this place is pretty small, but in the city it's hard to find a place this cheap that isn't. The value is huge with this place. It's in a great place, standard high-er end rooms, and above all pretty quiet. We stayed Halloween weekend and had no issues with hearing people in the hallway/people hearing us. The crowd seemed to be mixed, some young some older so I was little worried about noise level, but nothing happened (which is more than I can say for some of my other hotel visits). I mostly interacted with the night guy. He was great. Really knew a lot about the hotel/area and he was very friendly- even went out of his way to find me a lighter :) The biggest downside was really just that they never asked if we needed more than one key, so at a few points in time I got locked out of the room and had to call someone to let me back in... but that was pretty minor :) Can't wait to stay again!
