I tried this place out with some girlfriends for drinks and appetizers before we went out dancing on a weekend night. I was not a fan of this place and I am a big fan of tapas. I have had better elsewhere at many other tapas restaurants in Chicago -at least 3 or 4 tapas restaurants come to mind right away. The place was very overpriced also. I would recommend going elsewhere for tapas and for drinks. The place even had a stuffy feel to me and was not laid back at all.
