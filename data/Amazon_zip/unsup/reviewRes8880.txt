It's a little place, and so completely unassuming, but man-o-man, the food is good! I think more people need to check it out. I would never have popped in had it not been for a friend moving into the neighborhood and raving and I'm so glad I stopped in! Persian food that is definitely worth the stop whether your due to be in the neighborhood or not. It's really a nice place to go with a group of people. The staff is friendly and the food is delicious!
