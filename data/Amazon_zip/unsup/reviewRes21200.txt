Superdawg in the evening after the sun has gone down to me is the best time to visit. With the neon lights and the car hops the whole 50's vibe is kinda cool.  I usually visit a few times during the summer months with my family to get that nostalgia kick, but if it was not for the atmosphere lets say a cold winter day I'm not that interested in going. The food is OK. The "dawgs" are larger than most and loaded with toppings the fries are a crinkle cut fry ((frozen?) and in my experience usually overcooked and very crispy. The Supercheesie burger is smaller than the bun that it comes on and is buried in condiments that overpower the actual burger.  The Blackkows and Supersundaes are good.  The menu is a little pricey and the food is OK but hanging out with the family on a warm summer nite 50's style is fun.
