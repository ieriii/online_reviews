Pretty good Italian - chicken liver starter was good if you like that sort of thing, jerusalem artichokes needed to be sliced a lot thinner, but the flavors were good. The pasta dish we ordered (with lamb sausage and chili) was great and we split the baby chicken - also good. The walnut tart was so-so but the bread pudding was delicious (could have used a touch more moisture). The dinner room is crowded with too many dining tables and it can get loud, but despite this, it's sorta cozy.
