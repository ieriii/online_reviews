I've been to almost every Ethiopian restaurant in town, and thus far, Demera is my favorite. I often order the vegetable messob, which provides a delightful opportunity to sample multiple dishes at once. The collard greens ("gomen") are wonderful, and the beets are better... but my favorite thing on the menu is the "ye-shimbra assa," which is a spectacularly delicious chickpea dough, cooked in berbere sauce. It's a taste sensation. Regarding service, the manager is a dead ringer for Stanley Tucci, and he's about as nice a guy as there could be. He has always worked hard to seat us, even when we are silly enough to arrive on a weekend without reservations.  Demera is perfect for a date, perfect for dinner with friends,and even perfect for a larger group. I highly recommend it.
