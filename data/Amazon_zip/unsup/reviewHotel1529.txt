Yeesh....did not have the best experience with this place.  We kept talking about all those things we needed to do before the wedding, and finding a nice hotel for the night of was one we kept forgetting about. A Groupon popped up a couple of months before for Hotel 71. Sounded nice enough for a fine downtown hotel price, so we bought it. The Groupon advised that we not call until the next day to book it. Fine. I called around 9:30. The woman who answered was very rude and already flustered sounding. So far we weren't off to a good start.  Then about a week later I have a charge on my credit card from Hotel 71 for $250! In a panic I call and find out the woman had booked my date incorrectly and we were charged the no show fee. With barely an apology it was refunded - which as everyone knows takes a few days to clear back onto your card. Lovely when you're paying vendors left and right for wedding stuff.  The week before I called to verify we actually still had a room and we did, so so far so good I suppose. Day of wedding we arrive exhausted around 10:45p. The front desk staff were super duper friendly and even went out of their way to go find a cork screw for us to open our bottle of wine the caterer had stashed away for us to take!  The room itself was eew. Leopard print chaise lounge you didn't want to touch. I didn't sleep a wink that night the bed was so uncomfortable - and considering how exhausted from the whole week of events leading up to the wedding, this was BAD. I ended up watching the sun come up through the windows of the buildings across the river. It was bad.  Again though, the staff was super sweet and friendly when we left! The one redeeming quality about this place were the kind ones working - except for the icky woman on the phone. For our out of town guests that come in through the year I won't recommend this place, unless they can sleep like a rock on anything and don't mind paying a pretty penny for it!
