Wilde is a perfect place to go hang out with your girlfriends, the ambiance is great. The decor is impressed. But when come to the food, i wasn't sure how should i feel about this place. i ordered Ceasar Salad and Fish&Chips, salas was bland and boring, same as fish&chip, i can have it somewhere else with more taste on it. I was a bit disappointed that they don't have Fried Calamari on the menu. Drinks were ok, i love the idea of having special drinks menu every night. The service was quick and good. Will be back and try something else on the menu.
