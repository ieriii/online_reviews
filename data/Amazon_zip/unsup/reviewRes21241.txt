For the (indisputably, in my opinion) affordable prices, XOCO is as good as it gets! I saw it featured on the Food Network back in January and knew I just had to try it when I was in Chicago for a dental convention in February. I was a little worried it wouldn't/couldn't live up to the high expectations that had built up in my hungry brain and tummy, but all my worrying was in vain. My expectations were met and exceeded and satiated and oh I dream of eating more... From the signature Ahogada sandwich with its divine combination of crisped artisan bread, succulent pork, and spicy arbol chile sauce broth to soften the bread, to the guilty pleasure cinnamon-and-sugar-smothered churros dipped in Mexican vanilla soft serve, I would literally fly to Chicago for the sole purpose of eating at XOCO.... Kidding... Kind of.
