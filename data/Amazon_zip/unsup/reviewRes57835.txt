Great restaurant! I had dinner there the other night and WOW what a terriffic meal. The only thing better than the meal was the service... When you go there ask for Omar, he's one of the owners. Get him to turn you on to some of his private stash of juice. No kidding, if you're lucky enough to get some, it's a treat!Either way, this is a reat place for breakfast, lunch or dinner (business, casual or intimate). Enjoy.
