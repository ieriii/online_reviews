Thanks to my lovely wife who recommended this place as an after-work meeting place. I had the lasagna cara mio and it was delicious. Creamy tomato sauce with tons of tasty meat. Highly recommended. It was also huge like everything I saw coming out of the kitchen. I really enjoyed this dish. My wife had the baked gnocchi in a tomato sauce. It was also quite good and large portioned. We also had the chocolate souffle which was ok. It's a little pricier than some places. About $20 per pasta entree, but I was all good. There are a lot of pluses to this place, it's by the train stop, it's byob, and the food is really good. We'll come back for sure.
