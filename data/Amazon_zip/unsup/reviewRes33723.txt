I would give Yolk 2.5 stars if I could because I think it's between okay and "meh." I eat here because it's close and convenient, but for the price and mediocrity of some of its dishes, I'd rather go to Bongo Room. I've been here half a dozen times, and the size and layout of the room makes it really noisy. The food isn't anything spectacular, and the several times I've had the steak omelet, the texture and consistency have always been a bit watery. It makes it a little gross when you eat down to the bottom of the plate and the egg, mushroom, onion, and tomato juices are a watery mix. It makes the presentation kind of gross. The steak also tends to be overcooked.  Overall, its just a hipper, yuppier-looking IHOP.
