My boyfriend and I went to lunch here today, to take a break from eating at our regular pizzeria, Lou Malnati's on Wells St, and afterwards, we decided to never take a break from going to Lou's again! The service at this Giordano's was lousy, our waiter was not friendly at all, and he hardly paid attention to us. My boyfriend practically had to wave his arms in the air at the waiter to get another bottle of beer! We got seated at 11:10am, and didn't leave until a little after 1:00pm. We waited nearly 40 minutes for a SMALL STUFFED SAUSAGE AND PEPPERONI PIZZA. Seriously, people?? WTF?! This place is so overrated and undeserving of its praise for having good "Chicago stuffed pizza". Tourists don't realize they are wasting their time waiting in line to eat at this place. A total disappointment. Shape up, Giordano's! You gotta represent Chicago properly!
