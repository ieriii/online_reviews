I give this 4 stars for what it is: a cheap, delicious location for one of the best foods on the planet, pho. Eaten here a million times, but rarely in the restaurant itself. The place gets packed and can be annoying to wait. The solution? Take out, of course. No matter how packed it is it takes 10 minutes tops. On one occasion, I saw a line from across the street then called from outside for pick up. Smugly nudged my way past the waiting patrons about 5 minutes later and was on my way. Bypassing a waiting crowd is a very rewarding experience, and goes double or triple for the winter.
