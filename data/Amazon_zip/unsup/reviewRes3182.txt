Crisp offers a very interesting blend of the american love for fried food and the balance rice and vegetables in their specialty bowls. I myself, am a self-proclaimed chicken wing expert, and really all that means is I like hot wings to a fault and would likely eat them far beyond me feeling full. I grew up on Buffalo Joe's in Evanston and became fascinated at an early age with jalapenos as well as waffle fries and chili with my wings. Crisp offers a much different take on your traditional chicken. These wings are full size, standard culinary chicken wings, breaded and fried. The Korean BBQ sauce with sesame is my favorite, but they have many options. While I may have been looking for something different when I first heard Korean chicken wings, I was satisfied with what Crisp served.
