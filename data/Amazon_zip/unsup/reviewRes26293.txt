Yep, this isn't gonna happen very often: 5 star review. I really do love this restaurant. The food is delicious, fresh, flavorful. AND it's priced HONESTLY. How many restaurants can say that? Almost none.  We recently tried the Tuesday/Wednesday dine-in (apparently available for take-out/delivery Tues-Sun) special ($12.50 for each person), and let me tell you, the food was great! It's a pretty good deal, and you get a nice variety of food. The lunch specials are fantastic, and of course, the regular menu, with its wide variety, is excellent as well. The owner, Tuan Nguyen, really knows how to run a restaurant. He works incredibly hard, and he is always, always there whenever I go, cleaning the tables, serving food, making food, thanking customers, everything. He and most of his employees are so nice, always smiling, very cheery. They are eager to make the customer happy and do a find job of it. He treats his customers so well, which keeps me coming back again and again (in addition to the food of course). I really wish other restaurants would take their cue from Mr. Nguyen and SImply It.  Go here and support this fine establishment especially during this dang recession. You won't regret it!
