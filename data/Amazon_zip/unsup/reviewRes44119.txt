There were 11 of us to share a box of some 25 macarons. In other words, each person is rightfully allowed to have 2.27 macarons. That does not sound like an easy number to work with. Therefore, the best approach is to ally with a partner in crime and divide each of our four macarons into halves. We tried vanilla bean, passion fruit, lemon poppy seed, and raspberry. Halleluiah! I think I just stepped into Mr. Willy Wonka's chocolate factory.....except there are aisles and towers of macarons instead. Each bite sent me frolicking around the room! Each piece of macaron had a smooth crust. The flavors were ever-bursting as I bit through the crust and reached its moist filling. It wasn't overly buttery and the fruit flavors were very vibrant. I can actually snack on it for hours had I let my addiction overcome me. The downside is the macarons were a bit soft. It was a hot day because we left it in a warm environment for too long.
