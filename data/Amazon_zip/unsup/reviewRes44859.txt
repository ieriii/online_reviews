OK. We just got back to NY from Chicago last night and I just reviewed Glenn's Diner and Yolk (both very good) and I had to put my 2 cents in about this place too. I saw Giordano's on TV and I have to say that THE PIZZA SUCKS here. Even if I didn't think that NY pizza rules, the crust here was just awful and the tomato sauce tastes like the crap you get if you are dumb enough to order Italian food at a diner. We went to Lou Malnati's a few days earlier and that was pretty good (for deep dish pizza, that is) as were the other dishes we saw people eating there. Other people near us at Giordano's ordered other dishes and they looked just awful too (a plate of fried, really greasy looking appetizers, calamari that looked tough and hard). I mentioned to my husband that I hoped that their pizza was better than what we saw at the other tables. As far as the pizza, I don't think I ever tasted a more disgusting tomato sauce in a restaurant. What are they thinking?? And this is an Italian restaurant? I think a jar of Ragu (which I would NEVER serve) is even better. There is a ton of cheese (which I have no problem with), the sausage was just fair and the crust had no taste at all. It was quite disappointing and I have no idea at all how so many people actually eat there. It was a total waste! If you want deep dish pizza in Chicago, go to Lou Malnati's instead!  The crust is tasty, the ingredients are better quality and the tomato sauce is good.
