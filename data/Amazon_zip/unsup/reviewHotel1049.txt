Was looking for a cheap place to stay near the Allstate Arena, total was around $50 for a night for a King bed room. I've stayed in a lot of hotels for around the same price, but this one really reflects the cheap price. Here's why: -Hallways and common areas are really in need of maintenance and basic care -Mold on the ceiling above the shower -Shower fluctuated between cold and scalding and the water pressure was pathetic -Mattress was extremely uncomfortable and had a distinct dent in the middle that we both rolled into over the night. -Breakfast was described as coffee and donuts, the coffee was terrible and the donuts were actually a platter of ho-ho's. -One of our lamps in the room didn't even work, room also needed more lights. -Wi-fi was available, but only in the lobby.
