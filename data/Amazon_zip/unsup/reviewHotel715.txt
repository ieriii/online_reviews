I had a pleasant, albeit short stay at this Westin. Keeping up with trend of what appears to be a huge amount of hotels that sink money in the lobby but not the rooms, this Westin falls in line. The lobby is nice - strangely rectangular - but in good condition. The room was fine - in need of a facelift I think. My in-room wifi did not work at all. The heavenly bed is reason enough to stay at a Westin. The staff was very friendly here. For business purposes, I think the Westin Chicago River North is a more convenient location. This Westin was in a great area though - near beautiful shops and restaurants - perfect for tourists.
