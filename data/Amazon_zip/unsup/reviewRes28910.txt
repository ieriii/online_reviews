Quick dinner and needed some simple take out. My brother suggested this place and figured the food would be as great of quality as the sister location on State street. Ordered the Musaman curry, as I had craving for something creamy, homey but with some kick to it. And boy did it have some kick to it, as it was a lot spicier than I anticipated! Not too hot, but if you don't have a tolerance for heat, you won't enjoy this meal. So just as a warning..... Wash it all down with some Thai iced coffee, which they put it in a 16 ounce to-go container. It was pretty tasty, and was fairly cheap. It gives Starbucks a run for their money at $2 apiece! My only feat is that they charge you $1 for a take out rice. Now, I'm not cheap, but I am Asian...hello. I EAT RICE! I've never heard of a charge for rice for an entre that requires rice to be eaten with it. Boo for that. One star deducted
