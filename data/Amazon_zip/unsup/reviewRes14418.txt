So, I hate to give one of favorite places 2 stars but here it goes. I'll preface this with the 2 stars are Sunday Brunch only and hopefully not indicative of what's happening at dinner time. We went for brunch this morning, my wife ordered the Smoked Trout Hash, the first challenge started when ordering, - BK, "I'll try the hash", Waiter - "How do you want your eggs?" BK- "Fried Medium", Waiter, "they only come fried hard or soft"... She opted fried soft, came fried hard, oh well, minor challenge. The rest of the dish missed the mark on almost every level, the potatoes were under cooked, the trout wasn't de-boned, flavor was off. When the waiter came back he saw the dish was pretty much untouched, he did ask if there was a problem with it, we listed the misses, (gentlemen at the next table chimed in with the same points), the waiter listened, nodded, said oh well....  The bill showed it still on, no jee sorry how about something, just kind of felt like the polish is off the apple. I hope that dinner doesn't follow suit.
