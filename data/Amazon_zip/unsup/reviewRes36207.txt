I walked by here a couple times not realizing how nice it was inside, on a recent vacation in the Edgewater neighborhood. On my last day, my host suggested it as a place for lunch and I was glad he did. I won't say its the best I've ever had - but it was tasty sushi with a beautiful presentation. I splurged on a couple fancier rolls, and one rainbow roll - and that was actually the best of all that I tried. I liked the decor and would return if I am ever in the area again.
