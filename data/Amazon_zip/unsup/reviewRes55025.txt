I had been to Longman & Eagle twice prior to my latest visit. The first time I had the Wild Boar Sloppy Joe which was good, not great. I was impressed with the thinking outside the box, but the deep fride sage was a little over powering for me. The second time was just for drinks. While I have not been impressed with their cocktails, I almost had a heart attack when I saw the whiskey list. This past time I went, I was set on one dish until I asked a question to our knowledgeable waiter. I decided on the Venison leg with spaetzle and piggy sprouts. What are piggy sprouts? Brussle sprouts cooked in bacon fat. This was easily one of the top 5 meals I've ever had. It was amazing! I'll be back many times, but I'll stick to drinking my whiskey on the rocks.
