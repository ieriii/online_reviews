San Soo tasted a lot better in my memory than it did today. I appreciated the charcoal grill and the number & variety of side dishes, but the meat was lacking. The cha dol baek ee was cut more on the thick side and was not chewable. I thought i was the only one having a tough time until my friends started to comment on the meat's toughness too. I was confused why the rib eye cut came out partially frozen but the manager came out to explain that they marinate it then freeze it to preserve the marinade? It was a strange explanation, but it tasted good. Not worth the $19.95 for it though. The thing that saved it was the spicy marinated pork. My lasting impression would be the epic failure of the cha dol baek ee. BTW when did they start featuring sushi on their menu? Sansoogapsan, we had a good run, but it's time to end our relationship.
