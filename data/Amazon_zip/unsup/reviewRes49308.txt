I may need to come here on a night other than Monday. The place is huge but no crowd and I like a place with energy. Again it was Monday night so maybe i cant talk. Friend was in town and could only meet at 7pm. Granted the cheese bar is a really cool idea. I could talk about cheese all day, esp with a cheese expert. The cheese plate was of good portion for 3 people, I hate when you get the plates that are so small in servings you barely get any cheese. For dinner I had the seared ahi. It was pretty good, but by the time I got my dinner I was quite tipsy and more concentrated on drinking more wine. Go with the flights they are great, then you can choose which one of the wines you liked best and get a glass, or 3 like I did.
