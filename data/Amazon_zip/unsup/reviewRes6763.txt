Kicking myself for not having come here sooner! This review is for the bar. I can't wait to go back to have a full meal!! We popped in after Eduardo's because its so close and I've heard that Q makes some awesome bourbon drinks.  At first we were disappointed. It appeared that they weren't so much about the bourbon drinks because the cocktail list is small and only has a few featuring the mash. But we tried a few of them and they were awesome. The julep is like a sno cone! Then they brought over a big bowl of house made chips and pickles. The drinks tasted even better! Both chips and pickles were really good.  So we decided to check out the dessert menu. I had to go with the chocolate mouse pie with the pretzel crust. Yum!!!! The perfect balance of sweet and salty. It just coulda used a smidge more of that house made caramel. The place is perfect! Not snotty but slightly sophisticated.  I can't wait to explore more of their menu.
