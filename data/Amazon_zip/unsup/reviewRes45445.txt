A renovated hardward store grows up.....into an Irish poet-themed pub! I live in the area and have been here countless times. The sandwiches and entrees are all good, as well as the brunch. My favorite thing off the dinner menu is the macaroni and cheese. It comes in this big crock and is all crusty on top. Pretty standard breakfast food, of special interest is the fruit cup. It's all fresh cut and has a nice assortment of bananas, berries, and pineapple. My only beef is that it's a tad overpriced and occationally the place gets loud. A special shoutout for the delicious Thanksgiving meal I had the pleasure of eating last month. Carrot soup, a mixed salad, turkey and dressing, rolls, and pie. Mmm. Thanks for a delicious holiday meal for those of us slackers that didn't cook at home. Overall: 3 stars +1 for Thanksgiving
