This place is super crowded during the dinner crowd, you actually end up sitting next to people you dont even know... The food is almost like tapas style... we ordered a bunch of things on the menu, shaved brussel sprouts, pig ears, milk braised pork shoulder, bone marrow and razor clams. The brussel sprouts were okay, they were a bit over powered by the cheese they used. The pig ears were nice and crispy with the kale was delicious! The bone marrow was pure gluttony, but also yummy. The razor clams were my first time so I dont really know what to expect but they were simple and clean tasting. The item that takes the cake at this restaurant has to be the milk braised pork shoulder! Wow this dish was AMAZING! I would just got back and order the pork shoulder alone!
