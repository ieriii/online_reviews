Man, this place is excellent. I love jazz (in almost all its forms) and have been to a bazillion jazz clubs -The Green Mill and Tonic in NY (so sad it closed!) are my jazz club benchmarks. I bring all my out of town guests here (and then to the New Apartment if they are game). Go here. You will love it. Allison A is absolutely right though- don't walk home alone from the G.M.-bad news!
