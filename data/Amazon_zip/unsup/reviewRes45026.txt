Summary: If you like great Italian food and don't mind being ignored by the waiter or waiting 40-50 minutes for your food, then this place is for you. Will I return? Only if they offer take-out. The first thing I want to comment on is, if this waiter had actually tried to sell me something, I would've bought it. I wanted to throw my money at this place if someone would have made the effort. I would have bought 1-2 more drinks and an extra side if someone was there to take my order. Aesthetics: The place looked fine and the seats weren't too close to each other. Staff: Whoever was at the door to greet us was nice. The waiter looked like he didn't have a thought in is head, well, that is until a couple (that had a similar skin tone as the waiter) sat next to us. He couldn't stop talking to them for some reason. The other waiters seemed similar. I didn't see much interaction between staff and customers. I don't get it either. It's not like there were too many tables to deal with! It's just a shoebox, people. Get it together! Talking to customers is easy! Price: For the money, the food is well worth it. Food: OMG the food! It was great. I wished I got another ravioli or two on my plate, but I had enough appetizers to hold me over. That's the other thing. Get appetizers. You may spend so much time waiting that you will need something to hold you over (their bread was good, too). If it weren't for the bad service I would have had an over-all great experience.
