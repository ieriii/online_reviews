THE best!! A must hit when in Chicago! Rick Bayless is a genius! He's often there working hard in the kitchen and walking the floor. It is near impossible to get a reservation form 6 weeks out, however, you can show up and wait in line on Fridays (maybe other nights as well, you may have to check that one...) for when they open the doors at 5p. Well worth the wait in line! Now, all you have to do is figure out what incredible item to devour, but i bet you order more than one thing!
