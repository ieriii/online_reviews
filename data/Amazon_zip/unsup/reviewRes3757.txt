Believe the hype, these wings are the real deal. If the wings from Great Seas had a baby with the wings from Dong-Ah then you would get the Seoul Sassy. Hints of sweetness work in harmony with your standard Asian aromatics such as soy, garlic, and ginger, plus there's a nice unexpected touch of herbiness, too (I'm guessing Oregano?). I'm not quite sure how they do it, but the exterior of the wings more than live up to the "crisp" moniker, yet they still maintain a moist and tender interior. Don't get thrown off by the quantities either, one wing here is a complete wing (both the drummette and flapper). And these bad boys are huge. HUGE. They either come from a crazy ginormous chicken or a small turkey. An order of five was just about right for my appetite. If you do opt for a side of fries, they're the shoe string variety and very crisp. They might act like more of a filler, but they're not a bad break from all that Seoul Sassy goodness.  I've yet to try anything else on the menu, but 5 stars on the wings is well deserved.
