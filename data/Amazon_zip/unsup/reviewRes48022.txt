Two friends were visiting from Doha, Qatar, and wanted to get their share of some pork. Not being able to enjoy pork in an Islamic country like Qatar, I agreed to take them to Publican, although my pescatarian palate was not going to allow me to indulge. They had the flight of hams: a Tennessee ham, a Virginia ham, and a ham representing another state that escapes me. The Tennessee ham, they said, was salty but good. The Virginia ham was the first that induces a smile on their faces. The third ham apparently reminded them of some ham they'd had in Spain, for they spoke of how it melted on their tongues. Needless to say, they were quite happy. For their main entre, they ordered a whole chicken. Not being a rabid pescatarian, I sampled a piece and was quite satisfied. The chicken had been rubbed or marinaded in oregano. You'd think that oregano was only for spaghetti sauce. Apparently not as far as Publican goes. Succulent, juicy, tender: three words that came to mind while tasting the chicken. I had a grilled Atlantic char that reminded me of salmon. Cooked thoroughly without me having to request it to be cooked so, I was incredibly happy with my order. Served with radishes and sea salt the way they're served in France, I was even more pleased. The grilled asparagus that I had in addition made the trip to Publican all the more grand. If pork is your thing, I recommend Publican highly. Not being big on meat, I cannot say that I will return on my own accord. However, for friends like the ones who were visiting from Qatar, I will make some adjustments.
