I haven't a clue what other Yelpers are seeing in Sun Wah BBQ? I agree that their duck is delicious but their service is absolutely horrid! Our waiter looked like the guy from the Hangover and I had to wave him over for everything! I know that Chinese Restaurants are not known for the amazing service but this was even worse than the status quo. I know because I have worked in numerous Chinese restaurants and have eaten in a lot of different establishments. I might come back for takeout duck but don't think I could sit through another meal of this poor of service again.
