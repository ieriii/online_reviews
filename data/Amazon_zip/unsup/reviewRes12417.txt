Used to live right around the corner from this lovely spot. The food, atmosphere and service are all impressive. I love the chili butter with the bread and could just have that when I go. Like many have said, the pork chops are INCREDIBLE and giant. The drinks were pretty good, and they had freshly made mojitos which was very nice. My only complaint is that they don't take reservations for parties smaller than 6, so we had to wait a long time in the cramped bar area each time. The food is worth the wait, though. I haven't made the trip back up since we moved farther South, but now I just might!
