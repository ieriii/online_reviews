I had heard about this place from a friend, and I believe I also saw this on Chicago's Best on WGN9, which is kind of a throw-away show in a way, but I enjoy listening and reading about fun things local. We dined on the patio area, which was pretty spacious, but it doesn't overlook anything amazing on that strip of Milwaukee. Curiously, some of the meat is cooked right out there on the patio, and there is a real wood-burning grill there. There's a mural outside that makes the "90 Miles" name make more sense, if you don't know what it's in reference to already. Walking back to the car, I noticed what looks to be kind of a cool lounge/covered patio in the back, which I would be interested to check out. We ordered the goat cheese empanada, sandwiches (1 de ropa vieja and 1 cubano) and 1 licuado (fruit shake). I can't say I was thrilled with the ropa vieja sandwich, but everything else was quite good. Perhaps it was my mistake for ordering the ropa vieja on the whole wheat roll (which I'm told is in the same form-factor as their regular white bread), but ropa vieja usually explodes with concentrated slow-cooked flavor, and I wasn't getting enough flavor to really stand up to the bread. I tasted the cubano, and it was superior. Service was good -- they made the licuado with splenda instead of sugar (a habit I picked up in Brazil), at my request. The waiter was friendly and explained to us why they have these water-filled plastic bags hanging from the doorway that separates the kitchen and dining area from the patio... they looked almost like a bag you take a goldfish home from the pet store, but apparently they deter the flies from flying inside.
