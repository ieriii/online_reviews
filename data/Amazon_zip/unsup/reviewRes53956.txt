I'm a Puerto Rican from New York. Born in Puerto Rico. Aside from Puerto Rican food which is similar, I've had good and bad Cuban food and I most say that 90 Miles Cuban Cafe has some of the best Cuban food I've ever had. I had a Cuban sandwich with fried Yuca. My girlfriend also had the Cuban with tostones. I don't add many bookmarks but this one is a must for future visits to Chicago!!! If your expecting a full blown restaurant with a waiter/waitress this isn't it. But if your are looking for outstanding Cuban food and can get over what you may normally expect, then this is it! Unlike other reviews, my service was good. As I sat outside and enjoyed the weather and my food, the locals were non-stop stopping for carry out. A clear indication on how good the food is. The other important fact to point out is that if your a person that normally seasons food with just salt and pepper, your taste buds may not know how to act when you taste well seasoned Cuban food. So if your taste buds don't agree, it's not the food. So don't be fast to blame the food and accept that maybe you just haven't had authentic Cuban food!!! One more thing, don't judge this neighborhood treasure by the size of the building. Great things come in small packages!!!!
