I must be the only person in the world who has never been to the Meli Cafe. It's like I had a sign on my back. And I don't profess to know chapter and verse about what happens when you get there. But .... once I was there I got that cozy comfy feeling when you know you are going to get some awesome food. From all the hype Meli gets, this particular branch was smaller than expected and awfully busy. But that didn't stop our restaurant hosts from doing their all. Three of us settled in for a catch up brunch (make that feast) and had a marvelous time. Even on a good day I take my time deciding on what to order. I have never seen a menu the size of Cleveland before. I know my friends wished it were shorter, but there was never a doubt about our orders. Looking around, I was tempted to say, "I'll have what she's having" but instead I went with the apple cinnamon crepes. Granny Smith never had it so good. Across the table though, and it's a good thing too, honey french toast with warm custard and, you guessed it, honey was beckoning. And to round out the threesome, a great looking panini with avocado and sun dried tomatoes and baby reds on the side. The bread smelled fabulous. No gripe about the coffee either, and that is something I expect, no, I need to be fresh and great. And it was. Maybe it was the first timers experience that shot me to the moon. Maybe it's because they seemed to show a lot of respect to their diners and to the food they serve. Maybe it was finally being able to say, "yeah, I've been there". And maybe its a super simple fact that it's just plain what Meli is.
