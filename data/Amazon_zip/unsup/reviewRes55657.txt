First time - amazing selection. I had the pretzel encrusted walleye while my friend had the potato pancake whitefish. Both were wonderful. The table next to us had the Char - looked great - think I will try that next time. Server was friendly and helpful. They recommended the brownie pie with banana foster for desert which came with ice cream. Delicious!
