What Alliance lacks in food and rink, it makes up for in atmosphere. The best coffee shop to work or study at in the area, easily. I live near Alliance and head there regularly to do all of the usual coffee shop things. The staff is always attentive, friendly and professional and the coffee is consistently good.  There's better coffee out there, but I haven't had a bad cup at Alliance. I wouldn't recommend any of the espresso drinks, though. The americanos are good, but any of the milk espresso drinks can be passed on. Maybe I haven't found the right treat yet, but most of the cookies and pastries I've tried as Alliance have been underwhelming. You're paying for presentation. The real draw to Alliance Bakery is their lounge next door. It's usually fairly full, but you can almost always find a table for yourself. Being separate from the kitchen noise of the bakery helps to keep the lounge nice and quiet, and aside from the occasional conversation the clientele tends to preserve that quiet. It's perfect for working and studying. There isn't a better coffee shop in the area if you are looking to hang out for a while. THE END.
