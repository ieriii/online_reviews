If you are a tourist and you are going to the Art Institute or going to check out The Bean, come here for drinks/snacks/lunch. Forget about Park Grill. Its a hearty menu of risottos, burgers, chops and other upscale bar fare, but it is in such a great environment of a restaurant that is like you are in a vintage building circa Chicago 40 years ago. I also believe owned by two brothers that also have a big presence even just being there for a business lunch. Love that. Its like a neighborhood feel, but you're still in the Loop. Choices nearby are spotty since anything nearby is such a chain establishment or stuck in a hotel lobby. A great wine list too.
