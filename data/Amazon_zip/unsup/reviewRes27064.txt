The atmosphere is fun. The food is mostly delicious. The drinks were yummy. The prices were reasonable for the quality of food. If you sit in the bar, you can eat off either the Frontera Grill menu or the Topolabampo menu which is great since you have to get reservations WEEKS in advance to get a weekend dinner table at Topolabampo. We ended up only ordering off Frontera Grill's menu. Most of the dishes we tried were very tasty with good blend of flavors and all were perfectly executed. A couple of dishes were just good and not fantastic (thus the loss of a star). Overall, I definitely recommend it.
