I felt like a superstar getting in this place! Especially when my group looked like a bunch of slums and smelled like Pizza. P.S (Piece Pizza Rocks!)  Anyways, so we heard about this joint from my old roomie and he referred to it as an old school speakeasy. Which essentially means - No signs outside. Seriously, all you see is a door with a light and a huge bouncer in front. So not knowing what to expect we get in and grabbed a booth, realizing that the show is really the mixologists (aka fancy bartenders) is where it's at we move to bar. So it goes something like this: Mixologist : What do you like? Me: Alcohol!!!! Mixologist: I have the perfect drink for you. (Does his thing for 10 mins, putting in a bunch of bitters, sweets, liq, and a huge sphere of ice. Now try this. Me: Sip... * then i hear like the music when the heavens part and my taste buds explode. I love scotch.. and he made me the best wiskey sour i've ever tasted in my LIFE! Mixologist: He then explains the entire story of the scotch and what goes in it. P.S. Don't try the egg drink.. its not that good.
