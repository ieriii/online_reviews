Well worth the wait for a reservation...and officially, my new favorite place to eat in this city. The food is phenomenal...the chefs are simply brilliant. We loved every single dish of our 9-course tasting; sending the plates back (almost) licked clean. The chefs are the waiters...and the service is spot-on...our water glasses were always full, as were our wine glasses. It is a restaurant you could only find in a city and prob only in NYC or somewhere Europe. It is truly a hidden gem in that when you pull up to the front door, it couldn't be more uninviting. You walk into a tiny dining room and the front door is literally steps from the tiny open-air kitchen. This was my first visit, so I was slightly concerned, but having read all the fab reviews from those who braved before me, my anxiety was more of excitement than hesitation. And, with the first course...an amuse...they had me...anxiously waiting for the next...and the next.  I was blown away...it's just that fantastic. It's BYOB, so bring plenty of wine. I did not plan accordingly and quickly realized that one bottle for 2 people was not going to make it thru 9 courses...but, the table next to us was more than happy to share theirs. We were the 8:30pm seating and after a while (time flew, so not sure exact time), they cranked the music...so, if rocking out while dining on haute cuisine offends you, eat earlier. I loved it...and you will, too, if you love food, uber-cool cooks and funky places.
