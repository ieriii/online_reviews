Fit for frat boys, not grandma: The Violet Hour has lost control and quality. The "rules" posted at the door say no baseball caps and to not bring anyone you wouldn't bring home to your grandmother, but these were written for a different bar ('You! hypocrite lecteur!'). Their website says that the space was "designed to create places of intimacy conducive to the art of conversation." But now it's barely possible to think, much less converse. Lincoln Park wants its playlists back! Someone tossed out the Ella, Louis and Johnny Cash albums! The 10 varieties of Pisco are souring from the music selection! What is going on here?! Last week, my group encountered sloppily-dressed patrons, terrible music and -- worst of all -- a host who requested a bribe to get us in faster and a waitress who was not interested in helping us enjoy our cocktails or evening. This was once my favorite bar in Chicago, but it's barely recognizable. No longer a refuge from the tacky and obnoxious, The Violet Hour now defines it. It is becoming T.S. Eliot's Wasteland: "At the violet hour, the evening hour that [NO LONGER] strives..." Still deserving of 2 stars because our drinks held up to expectations. But hopefully the bartenders will leave and start their own place. Until then, we'll always have The Aviary. Let's hope that The Publican isn't next. "Burning burning burning burning  O Lord Thou pluckest me out  O Lord Thou pluckest"
