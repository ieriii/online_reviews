My bf took me here for my birthday and the food and service were amazing. I will say that I was pretty buzzed from the wine (which, the waiter was cool enough to recommend after I told him what I like) but overall my experience was great. Only draw back is that it is very crowded and a little loud but that can be expected when the food is this good - everyone will show up eventually
