Mehhh.....maybe I'm just not a fondue person? Sure, it was romantic, but I feel as though the main course lacked flavor and the dipping sauces were mediocre at best. Especially for the dinner being $60 a person, which didn't include our drinks, I thought it was rather expensive and the portions were small for the prices. Your clothes do smell like grease and when your meats slide off and splash into your oil, consider your favorite, fancy shirt stained. The only thing I really enjoyed was the chocolate fondue with strawberries and marshmallows, but that's about it...Sorry Geja's...
