So I have eaten at wishbone a number of times. Memorable only because of the people I went with. Okay that's not fair. Some of my friends insist we go here when they come into town so we do. Southern eggs benedict = amazing. So good with gravy instead of hollandaise sauce (i love hollandaise) and a biscuit instead of english muffin, ham instead of bacon. Don't get me wrong I love a traditional eggs benedict but man this one is good too. Any omlette is a good choice (I always stick with my favorite - egg whites, scallions, mushrooms, tomatoes, spinach, cream cheese yess) The decor is pretty sweet. The back room is amazing, you can stare at it while you wait for your food. I've been seated in the back a few times and there's a pretty big bar back there too. Add a star. Now I'm up to 4 stars. I usually get a Mimosa ($5 kind of pricey?) but it's always refreshing. I haven't tried the lunch menu yet but some friends have and it always looks pretty good. The red eggs are good also. Seating is fast as is service. If you are in the neighborhood stop on by.
