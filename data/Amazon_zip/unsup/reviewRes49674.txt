yuck. i had been here before and it was good. last night, not so much. the restaurant was not crowded and the service was not good. we waited about 10 minutes after being seated for menus. Then we ordered a salad, 40 minutes later our salad came. the breadsticks were stale. my steak which they never asked me how i wanted it cooked came out bloody medium rare. i sent it back and when it came back it was completely overcooked. i was to say the least unimpressed. also, it really bothers me when restaurants do not give free soda refills.... i will NOT be back. however, i do love Bin cafe in bucktown....hopefully that will not take a turn for the worse like it's big brother Bin 36.
