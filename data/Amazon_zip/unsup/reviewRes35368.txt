I feel kind of out of place here, I know there are a lot of 5 stars... but... man, we had the rudest server. Our order was pretty simple (one duck, some vegetables, and some shrimp), but at least 3 parties came and ate before we got our food. The guy pushed our table over and was nasty grumpy when he slammed plates down. Then, when we paid, he stood and counted the money in front of us. Spent probably 20 minutes trying to figure out how we pissed him off so much -- we still gave 20%, hoping to make his life a little better. Besides, our duck wasn't crispy, the shrimp was old, and the broccoli kind of stale. This place is a legit institution. I get it. It has merits, but it's not always perfect.
