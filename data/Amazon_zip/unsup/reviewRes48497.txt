The brunch is out of this world. I can't see why people wait for an hour for the Bongo Room breakfast when you can walk into the Publican and get a brunch that is 10 times better without the wait or the D-baggery. Great bloody mary's that come with a sidecar of your choice of 4-5 beers (this is a beer joint, so natty ice isn't an option). Good coffee with constant refills. Best of all the menu is organized and priced, so you can try a bunch of different things. We shared the waffle with rhubarb and maple butter. It was crunchy and extraordinarily light. Then I had the Publican Bacon which are very thick rashers braised in maple syrup and the "ramped" hash browns, which are as you'd expect hash browns made with ramps. Both were spectacular. I hope that the Publican brunch works. Their dinner is very good and, to me, their brunch is even better.
