This place is great for those who like it hot. I'd say about a good 1/2 of their menu is devoted to spicy dishes ranging from a bit of zing to "I can't feel my tongue" levels of heat. Typical of most places in Chinatown, the food is very reasonably priced. The service is better than quite a few of their competition. If you're feeling extra hungry, you might want to go for their all you can eat hot pot special. They have one of the better Ma Pao Tofu dishes around. Great place to coat your stomach with chili oil.
