BYOB and good, honest mexican food. And CHEAP! who could not like this place? I think our whole bill (enchiladas platter, and a combination of tacos, enchiladas, tortas and taquitos) for about $11. Parking is plentiful and the staff was really friendly. There were tons of families there and also fun groups of friends. Loved it!
