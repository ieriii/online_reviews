One of the nicest Brazilian steakhouses! The harvest table (salad buffet) is excellent. The meat buffet is great too. Prices are comparable to Brazilian steakhouses in any major city. I like the space, architecture, ambiance, and the decor of the restaurant - very contemporary, free flowing, warm, and chic. The crowd is diverse and attracts everyone from 20somethings to 40somethings. Their rooftop patio is very fun in great weather! I highly recommend the watermelon mint martini!
