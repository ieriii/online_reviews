I should preface this rating and review with the fact that I am lowering it a star because the beer is simply "okay." I was here for lunch February 13, 2010. The taps from other breweries were very good, but the beer made on premises was average. It wasn't bad, it simply did not "wow" me. With the above in mind I think the quality of the food is very high. The bacon fat popcorn is a tasty novelty. I'm glad I've had it, but don't imagine I would get it a second time. My table ordered across the board--a couple of salads, a burger and some beef stew. Everyone was pleased and my salad was outstanding. The food is the real star at Revolution. The build out and overall design of the bar is extraordinary. I love the use of barrel staves on the walls. I hope the berwers will continue to hone their craft so that one day the beer is as good as the food.
