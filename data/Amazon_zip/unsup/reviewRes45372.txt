Stopped in to Wilde Bar on a recent trip down to Lakeview. They are currently trying to open a location in Andersonville called Lady Gregory so we wanted to see what they were all about. This place is much larger than I expected and was fairly empty at 4:30 on a Sunday; I assume because it was 60 degrees outside and everyone wanted to take advantage of the warm weather. We were seated right away but there seemed to be some confusion as to who would be serving us. While the tables around us were being handled, the servers just seemed to by pass us. After that confusion was managed the rest of our meal went very well. I had the wedge salad and my partner had the meatloaf. The wedge was very good and they do not skimp on the bacon or the blue cheese. My partner said the meatloaf was good. All in all we were satisfied with our meal and I am sure if we were closer we would eat there more often.
