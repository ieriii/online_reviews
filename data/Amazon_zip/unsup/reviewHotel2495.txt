This hotel is gorgeous on the inside. I actually have not stayed here but I went to a wedding and it was beautiful. The ballroom was a very pretty room and didn't need much decorating as well as the reception area outside the ballroom where drinks were served. They have a winding stairway that is very old fashioned and elegant and the staff couldn't have been nicer! I recommend this hotel to out of town guests all the time!
