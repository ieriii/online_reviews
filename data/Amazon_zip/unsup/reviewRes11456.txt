Usually, when I really want to see a movie and I wait too long to see it, I end up being disappointed. This is similar to what happened with Piece. I had been so excited to go there, mostly because places with their own breweries are generally cool. But also, I love pizza, like most humans. We gave it a try around 8pm on a Thursday night, which was a terrible idea since it was packed beyond belief.  The good: The beer was pretty good. I forgot the name of what I had - something about curves - and it was a darker beer but not too bitter or heavy.  The bad: the noise and customers. Close your eyes and picture a trendy, young popular place and you get Piece. For some people these are good things - and that's great for them - but for me, I prefer a quieter, more laid back kind of atmosphere with less pretentiousness hanging out. It was just a little much. The neutral: the pizza. Although intrigued by toppings such as clams and mashed potatoes, the banana pepper pizza we ordered was far from extraordinary. The crust was extremely dry and bland, and since crust is my favorite part, I was understandably disappointed. I must point out that most people wrote the pizza to be great in their reviews, so I guess there is a taste for this kind of slice, but being the pizza snob that I am, I was not at all impressed. all in all, i wouldn't go out of my way, and probably won't be heading back to Piece anytime soon.
