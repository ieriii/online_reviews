this place is SICK. whoever designed this place put a lot of effort into it and it shows. you could say that this place is gay since it's so nice, but i don't think you can have a gay hotel (maybe you can, but it's not like every room only has king beds in them) we got a great room on the corner of the building with an amazing view of the river and downtown chicago. the location is great, the rooms are big and very well done up. for a place this nice it's not too pricey, and you can walk to House of Blues to hear great music. i think the only place with more class is the W, and that is always $300+, so if you want a great place to stay in chicago, try the 71.
