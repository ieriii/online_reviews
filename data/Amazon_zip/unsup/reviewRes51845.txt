When you ask someone who lives in Chicago about deep dish pizza this is the place they always mention. It is hyped up a bit too much, but it is tasty and not too badly priced. I mean a 30 dollar pizza is sort of bad, but since 3 people can eat one, I guess not too bad. I wish I had brought a white marker to write on the walls, as apparently, that is something that people do here. Get the Meaty Legend. It is a meat-pocalyse of tasty.
