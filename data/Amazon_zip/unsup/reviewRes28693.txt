While the Morton Grove location has more character (more mom and pop feel), the pizza is still the same. Great place and good atmosphere. (they renovated a few years ago so it is now filled with plasma tvs). The pizza is excellent. We always get the deep dish sausage, green pepper, and onion and are never disappointed. Make sure you try the crust. It may look burnt, but it is really just carmelized cheese. It is in a good location so you could catch a movie at Webster just before or after since the theatre is right across the street. I highly recommend!
