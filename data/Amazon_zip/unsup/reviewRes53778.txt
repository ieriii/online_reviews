This place would get a 5 if it wasnt so crowded and their beer selection was a little bigger. But aside from that this place is great. Very good music, sunday night poetry is always fun and the place has a great aged feel to it. TIp: they allow you to bring food in or order in. So get there early, have a few drinks and order dinner in. Unfortuantly thats one of the only ways to get a good seat at this popular joint =/
