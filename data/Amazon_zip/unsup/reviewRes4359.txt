What a gem of a bar! My boyfriend and I stopped in after a show at The Aragon Ballroom, and were charmed instnatly by the cozy, dim-lit atmosphere and fantastic service. The $4 cover was totally worth it--we saw a fantastic set of a Hammond B3 organ and guitar duo. They take the music seriously here (no talking during set!), which I appreciated. The bartender was awesome, buying us a couple rounds and entertaining us with his anti-Twins rant (he's a White Sox fan). I will definitely visit this spot again when I'm in Chicago!
