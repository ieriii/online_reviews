We decided to check out the new brewery in town last Friday night, fully expecting a great experience and a long wait. We were surprised to find out there was no wait, and we were completely blown away by the food. First we got a sampler of all six beers on tap, of which we really enjoyed four. The pale ale is actually one of the best I've had. For an appetizer, we tried the Bacon Fat Popcorn, which we LOVED. I read some other reviews saying that is was plain and didn't have enough bacon, but I couldn't disagree more. There was so much bacon and parmesan, and the popcorn itself was seasoned very well. Onto our meals...I ordered the fish, which was battered with one of Revolution's own brews, and it was DELICIOUS. The fries had to be handmade because they were so fresh tasting. My husband ordered a burger, which he also enjoyed. This restaurant is definitely worth checking out. We really enjoyed it!
