Probably the best BYOB sushi place I've been to in Chicago.  Definitely do not miss the jalapeno miso soup - comes in a coffee mug-like bowl that you sip out of - DELICIOUS.  All the rolls we had were awesome. For sushi this good, I'll pay a bit more than usual. Love that they take reservations now, too!
