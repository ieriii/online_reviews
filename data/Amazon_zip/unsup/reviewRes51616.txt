The food is usually good at Garcia's but I wish I could say the same for the help. I do understand that the wait staff is busy with a full house, you might have to wait a little longer than usual. Well it seems that every time I'm there, the waitresses are so slow and the food can take more than 30 minutes to be served when the restaurant is not that crowded. Like I said, if they're packed, it's totally understandable. What I don't understand is why does it take 30 plus minutes to get 3 tacos and a coke? As I said earlier, the food is on the money but the wait staff is nothing to be desired.  There's a lot of taco joints in the city and maybe it's time I visit some different ones.
