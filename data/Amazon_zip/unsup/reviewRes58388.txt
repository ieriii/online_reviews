We went for our 28th anniversary and was hoping for a special afternoon. We drove 2.5 hours and planned to walk the Magnificent Mile prior to lunch. The salad bar was amazing and was very fresh. The meat was delicious and was endless. I have never seen service like this. They never let your table leave their attention. Then when she brought us desert our plates were hand written around them Happy Anniversary! with strawberry topping. I found that was very sweet of them and shows they are focused on detail. I would not be able to give any higher recommendation for this restaurant. They are truly one of a kind.
