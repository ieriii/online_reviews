...it was a dark and stormy night. this is not actually relevant to this review, but it was relevant to me as i rode through rush hour from the far south side on my motorcycle and i was like a popsicle when i got to the restaurant. also i just wanted to start a review like that one day (and now i have). anyway. i was invited out to this place not having any expectations other than i knew it was for pizza. the inside is bright and cheerful. we ordered a daily special which was mussels in a tomato white wine sauce and also a white pizza with arugula and prosciutto.  both were excellent. the sauce the mussels were in was so good (tomato puree, white wine, garlic, basil) that we ended up asking for extra bread and even dipping the pizza in it. the pizza i enjoyed, but it was kind of a medium crust that i expected to have a crispier bottom crust. quite tasty, though. my dessert was also great...a delicate eggless custard with a pear/vinegar compote. the service was good without being too attentive. the prices weren't outrageous for what you go. i wish every restaurant was BYOB (this isn't), but their prices for glasses of wine didn't seem to far out of line. overall, i had a pleasant experience here, and i will be back.
