Yum but soooo busy and no privacy. This place is the busiest restaurant in vietnam town... I can totally see why but they really need to get a bigger place or make the restaurant more space efficient. There were lines on each side of the restaurant and it was a bit hectic. 1 guy was taking names down of people waiting for tables. I noticed that people were seated wherever there was room and even seated with people they dont even know. My bf and I were little piggies and order spring rolls, fried rice and pho. The spring rolls were fresh and so were the veggies and meat in the pho. The food made up for the lack of service and personal space :)
