I LOVED this place! I was so excited about the Three Floyds paired menu that they had the night we went, but it sold out JUST before we sat down. That sucked, but I got over it because the meal we did have was awesome! Plus, we got to at least taste the beers that were to be paired with the food. Love 3 Floyds, they're so fun! We had (I'll try to remember it all): Pork Rillettes, Scallops, Foie, Sweetbreads, Shortrib, Venison and damn, I forget, but there was more. There were 4 of us and we loved EVERYTHING! In fact the only dish that was not perfect for me was the meatballs?  Also, one of the best Old Fashioneds I have had! The server was pretty on top of things, and answered questions knowledgeably.  I will be back for sure!!!
