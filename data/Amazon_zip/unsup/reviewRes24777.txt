This place is massive! They have something for everyone. Two thumbs up on the vegetarian friendly steez. The only subpar item I've had there is the guacamole. It could use a little more seasoning. All in all this place is completely worthy of the 4 stars up above. Definitely leave room for a shake when you go!
