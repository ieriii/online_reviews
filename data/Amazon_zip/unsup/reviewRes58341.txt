Wow, this place draws a LOT of people! Do not go there if you're looking for a quiet night out, it is not going to happen! But, DO go there if you want to have an exciting night out, with lots of people and good food! Amazing selection of beers (the one I ordered was not that good) but hey, there are so many selections for a reason! One for each taste! I just did not pick the right one! The waitress was a little weird, like she was under the influence or something, but considering the crown and demand, she might have only been under the influence of stress. So, great, food, great beer selection (next time I will stick to the brands I know) and great atmosphere. They lost a start for me because of the poor service and impossibility to have a conversation without yelling!
