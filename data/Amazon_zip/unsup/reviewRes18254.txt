Breakfast review.  Was staying in a hotel nearby and got there at 8:00 on a Saturday morning, just as they opened. Loved the churros, which were reasonably priced. Rip off that they charge extra for dipping sauce. The Mexican hot chocolate was good and thick. But who wants loud music at 8am? I don't. Between the music and the odd placement of the cash register right in front of the espresso machine, I had to shout at the poor cashier to place my order. Maybe they can't help all the hard surfaces, but it is certainly within their power to turn down the volume of the music.  Weird setup where the hostess tells you what number your table will be and then the cashier asks for your table number when you order. I had no idea I would need to remember the table number, so the cashier had to ask the hostess what it was.  A simple, "Tell the cashier you are at table 16" by the hostess would have been nice.
