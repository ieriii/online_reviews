I've now been to Xoco 3 times and have yet to come away with a bad meal. The chips and guac are just as solid as they are at Frontera, the churros are light, chewy and delicious, but the real star here as we all know is the Tortas. Of the 3 I've had (pepito, cuban, milanesa) I would have to say that the Pepito was the most enjoyable. The flavors were perfect, the meat was tender and juicy and the bread was sturdy enough to handle all of the juiciness that comes with the sandwich. This is a definite must do restaurant
