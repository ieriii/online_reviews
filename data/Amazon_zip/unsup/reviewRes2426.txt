Yummmmmm. Great hot dogs (but hate to use this term with such delicious sausages). I only wish I could have eaten more. Even with a 2.5 hr wait on a Saturday it was more than worth it which says a lot. Get ready to wait on any day, though since it is that good and that famous. Note, I had the duck fat fries which were only meh. Save the money and get another dog or the regular frites.
