although i have been a faithful follower of las tablas since it opened, my recent experience there left me wondering what are they thinking!!!!! the food was fair at most and the portions were literally half of what they use to be despite no reduction in price. a meal $38 for 2 left both persons hungry and in spite of our complaints, we were told this was purposeful. the waitress tried her best but no one else was available to even listen. SERVICE was terrible and the food was fair at most. POOR customer relations. will not return.
