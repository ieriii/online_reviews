So cold. So so cold. I thought the fact that it was 20 degrees out would make the line shorter, but we still stood there for 45 minutes in the cold cold air. I wondered what kind of encased meats would make people do such a thing, and so I ordered two sausages to find out. First was the classic duck confit pork sausage. It had peach aioli, morbier cheese and truffle oil, and I've never had any of those things before. I'm glad my first time was at Hot Doug's, because everything went together perfectly: the softness of the cheese complemented the snap of the sausage while the truffle oil and peach aioli added just the right amount of earthy sweetness. Probably the best sausage I've ever had. Next was a Chicago Style hot dog, to see how Hot Doug did it. It was presented beautifully, and the flavors were all classic. It felt like there was an extra dash of celery salt and a little something in the mustard or celery that added just a bit of tang to the whole thing. Overall a supremely good hot dog. I can die happy.
