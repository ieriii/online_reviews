I was pleasantly surprised by City Suites. It has an amazing location, right by lots of restaurants and bars. It took us 10 minutes to walk to Belmont Harbor! I was a little freaked out at first by the proximity to the Red Line station. You can hear the trains all day and night, but I got used to it pretty quickly. Inside the room, the bed linens and amenities were nice. It had a fancy tv and a very well stocked mini bar. They also have 24 hour coffee/tea in the lobby and a nice little continental breakfast. There was also no problem with an early check in as we arrived a lot earlier than anticipated. The staff were all very friendly and accommodating (nice to look at too)!!! The rooms are pretty small which is standard in big cities. We didn't have a lot of room for our luggage (I did overpack though). I would definitely recommend this place to a friend and will be staying here when I return to Chicago.
