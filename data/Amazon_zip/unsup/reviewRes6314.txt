I have a confession...I'm addicted to the chopped salad at wildfire. I've picked it up for dinner at least 5 times in the past week and I'm still not sick of it. If you do the same make sure you order the large and you'll have enough leftover for dinner the next day (yum). The chopped salad isn't the only thing that's good at Wildfire, but it's probably the most affordable.
