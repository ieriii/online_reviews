I took a friend of mine to the Violet Hour on my sister's recommendation, and I'm so glad we went! The Violet Hour serves fantastic drinks and great small plate food. The atmosphere is completely original yet completely welcoming. You need to take a friend, wear a snazzy outfit, and go enjoy The Violet Hour!
