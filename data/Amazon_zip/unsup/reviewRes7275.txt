To the Brian who lives south of Lincoln Square and sat next to me in the exit row on the flight to Chicago from Washington D.C. - thank you for recommending Q. Absolutely the finest BBQ ribs I have ever had. I'm 54 and I've had quite a few in my day. I even smoke them myself on my Weber grill then bake them slowly until they fall from the bone. Anyway, the flavor of Q's ribs was soooo fine that I didn't use any of their 3 sauces they put on the table...didn't even taste them. When ribs are this flavorful they don't even need sauce! We tried the "competition" ribs for $10 a rack more. They were better than the normal ribs, but not $10 worth. They are somewhat more moist and sweeter. The chef uses apple juice in basting them according to the waiter.  The bowl of bread 'n' butter pickles were really yummy as well as the home-made BBQ chips they put on the table from the start.  We had three sides: coleslaw, baked beans, and cornbread -- all excellent. I'm picky about coleslaw and it was super. The baked beans have a couple varieties of beans in them and are somewhat spicy hot...delicious. The cornbread was moist and had some whole kernel corn in it. The atmosphere was great! We sat in the room which had the large skylight. I highly recommend this place for the finest ribs ever! All three of us thought the ribs were the best we had ever had.
