Amazing specials, worth-the-wait traditional Chicago dogs, and foamy soap in the women's bathroom--what more could you want? How about the always friendly and gracious Doug to take your order? Each time I approach the counter, I feel as if I have been granted an audience with the Pope of Sausages himself (though Doug would never take himself so seriously, and he doesn't wear a ring to kiss :)  As another reviewer noted, many enter but few leave, yet there's always a seat when you need one. I won't hazard a guess why this is so, I'll just stick to my favorite Hot Doug's formula: arrive as close to opening time as possible (on a weekday) and wait a reasonable half hour or so until served. From arrival to sated in less than an hour.
