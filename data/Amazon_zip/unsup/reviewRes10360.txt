I originally had this place at 5 stars since the first time I went was on a weekday when it wasnt busy at all (go then if you dont want a horrible wait). I tried to go again on a friday night, and figured I would call ahead to get my name on the list. No they dont do that...so I made my long trek from the south loop to here and in that time the wait went from 35min to an hour and 45. Sorry but screw that. Now for my review when its not busy! This place really is sweet. They have very cool servers, kinda have a punk thing going on. The beer selection is pretty nice here too. Oh, and the pizza.... well its damn good!! I had a group of about seven so we got a few different types, cant remember exactly what but they were all fantastic.
