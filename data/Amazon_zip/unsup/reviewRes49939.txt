Fifty/50 had me at outdoor seating. Yeah, twas a gorgeous Summertime Chi evening and a couple friends and I were in the neighborhood. We heard about F/50s wings and just had to try em. No lie, we were walking along Division looking for F/50 and walked by an open sports bar. We all looked at each other and said "we gotta come back to this neighborhood for this spot." Lo and behold it was F/50. Pleasantly surprised, we walked in to greet the hosts and were seated in our preferred area: outdoors. It's a great spot to people watch, and boy did we watch some peoples. There are some interesting characters that go to F/50 and walk around the neighborhood. You got THOSE guys, scantily clad gals, hipsters on their sweet bikes, families walking their dog in the middle of the night. Everybody. If people watching is your thing, head out here. The wings are jumbo. Like forreal, jumbo. We ordered 16 regular wings [bone-in]; half teriyaki, half spicy garlic. The teriyaki is really sweet. The spicy garlic was surprisingly very spicy. I enjoy spicy, so this was a pleasant treat. But to my buddy who doesn't like hot foods, he was not happy. If it means anything to you, the regular wings and boneless wings are the same price. I'm interested in the other wings, so I'd consider heading back to the F/50. They've got big screens that face the street, so you can catch the game while dining outside. There are bathrooms on the main floor AND downstairs. Huge, given a busy night! Oh, if you're a hungry hungry hippo, they do have a food challenge. The fifty/$50 challenge. It sounds beastly [30 wings and like 10 sliders], and out of my league.
