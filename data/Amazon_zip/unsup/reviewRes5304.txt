I'll give this place a 5 star mainly cause the food experience they provide you with is unmatchable elsewhere. They have all the items on the menu that your normal restaurants do not have and they are all delicious as well. The seating is a bit too cozy but the wonderful food, wine and beer make up for it. The bone marrow and the pork shoulders are the MUST TRY items on the menu. I hope I get a chance to re-visit this place again.
