I'll admit it. I'm a southside kid, born and raised. Lucky for me, my father was a northsider. He was a lifeguard at Whelan pool and used to have Superdawgs as lunch, so we were introduced at an early age.  I remember many hour long drives to get the most mouth watering, tasty hot dog this city has to offer. The krinkle kut fries have spoiled me. Add an order of onion chips, which are crispy and sweet, and i'm one happy camper.  Alas, it's no longer an hours drive as i live in Los Angeles, but every time i go home, Superdawg is my 1st stop after touching down at ORD. They don't get any better than this dawg!!
