I LOVE NANA! I love that I can trust that the food is organic & as local as possible... and amaze-balls! (the BEST chicken sando I've ever had + that Po Boy from DDD rocks + the vegan lentil plate, the biscuits & duck fat gravy, those dang delicious grits... should I continue?) I love the staff... :) I love that all my friends and family that visit want to come to Nana & then they love it! I love that I have food allergies & can still eat here~ L.O.V.E.
