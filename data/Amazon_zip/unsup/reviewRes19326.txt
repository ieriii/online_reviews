Honestly? Overrated. Many many people RAVED about Coast so I'd been DYING to try it. Maybe it was a case of High Expectations Syndrome---you know when everyone and their grandmothers exclaim "OMGAH I found the BEST sushi place, you're just going to LOVE IT!!!!" Then you wait and wait and dream and dream about the lucky day you can pick that piece of heaven up. Time will stand still and it's just you and that maki in the room...you pick up your chopsticks, take a bite, and all of a sudden all seems right in the world. Well, like any normal person that is how I imagined it. And....was pretty underwhelmed. I had the Philly and the Una Q (unagi, cucumber, eel sauce). Both were just ok. I judge my sushi by freshness (of fish, rice, and veggies) and flavor of sauces. Everything was middle ground (nothing was spoiling by any means, but I've definitely had fresher ingredients). The eel sauce was also nothing standout. Somewhat bland and watered down. One huge pro was the AMBIANCE and DECOR. I absolutely LOVE the dark orange walls with cherry blossoms. =D The very dim lighting, candles, and fairly quiet noise level make it a perfect date spot. Very comfortable, classy booth seats as well. So all in all, GOLD STAR for ambiance and service (our waitress was very friendly and gave us several recommendations). Bronze star or 4th place for the sushi itself. I still prefer SEADOG or even Ukai over Coast. As a few stated, I wouldn't go out of my way to go here again. But for $7 for a roll (aside from signature maki which is about 2x as expensive) it IS a very reasonably priced sushi restaurant and worth going to if you're in the area and in the mood for a semi-classy night.
