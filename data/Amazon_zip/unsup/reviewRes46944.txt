I really enjoyed this restaurant. I have had several things off of their menu. Their omelet was a stand out delicious meal. They have great hot chocolate that they serve in a bowl.  I would have given them a perfect but on my most recent visit, I had to sit at a small table near the fire place. It seems as though they are trying to fit so many tables in there that it is impossible to feel comfortable.  Great food, but they need to improve the atmosphere.
