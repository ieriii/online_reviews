Nice byo.....agree with everything below it is a little salty (but I like that) and the pasta is really good but not the best by any stretch....huge portions and price may seem expensive to dumb asses but if you spend zero on drinks and get at least two full dinners out of the portion for 30 bucks a person.....then shut it up.....' I did like the service and I don't know why everyone thinks yelp is for kitchen nightmares and they are paying $150 per person for a meal....If you want that take your ass to alinea or trotters or something and then complain about the price.....tired of idiots
