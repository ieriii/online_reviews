I can't begin to describe how much I loved this place. For beer-geeks, you'll love the list. Personally, I loved the prices of their list, didn't find it offensive like some places that carry that many specialties. The show-stopper here are the burgers. While we started with fried cheese curds that I couldn't let go to waste, my "Elvis" burger with bacon, peanut butter and cheddar (added by me) was amazing. Service could have been a little better for a slow Saturday afternoon, but I truly could care less after I tasted their food. Definitely worth a trip to Lincoln Square!
