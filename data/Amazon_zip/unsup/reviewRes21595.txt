I was looking foward to my lunch here. I came at 3:30 and there was not a wait and the service was fine. The hot chocolate and churro were also pretty good. I got the Wood-Roasted Chicken Pozole Soup and Gunthrop Chicken sandwich. If the soup was $5 and not $12 I maybe would have cut it some slack, but it was just an oversalted chicken soup with cabbage and chili powder. I have also never had a bad chicken sandwich before the Gunthrop Chicken sandwich. Overall I was very disappointed with the food. Everyone around me was also complaining. $30 lunch, wouldn't care if it was good.
