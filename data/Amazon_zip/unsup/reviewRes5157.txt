The recent pervasiveness of the pig has had me giddy ever since restaurants like The Publican and Purple Pig have been on the scene. I'd like to consider myself swine chic and frequently drool over new and interesting pork-themed dishes. The Purple Pig is often packed, so expect a wait. You cannot be seated until your entire party is present and they do not take reservations.  Have a drink at the small bar and enjoy the lively atmosphere as you wait for your table or guests. You may be seated with "new to you" pork lovers, so be prepared to swap restaurant tips with those at your table. I hesitate to call them strangers, because these fellow pig enthusiasts are just friends you haven't met yet. I've dined here 3 times now and thanks to their tapa portions, I've shared about 70% of the menu with friends. This is comfort food at its best. Don't pass up the pork shoulder, pig's ear, pig's tail or fried manchengo cheese! And if you order the pig's tail, pair it with the burrata cheese. It was a delightful (and for me, an accidental) combination. You must try the fried deviled egg, if it is available. They serve the dish after 5:00pm, and often run out. I was finally able to try it on my 3rd visit, and it was well worth the wait! The wine list is extensive with a range in varietals, price points and portions. Feel free to snag half a bottle of wine if you're pacing yourself. I'm not a beer drinker, but I believe they have a nice selection of beers as well.  My only criticism of the restaurant is that they often run out of dishes, but I've never been disappointed in my alternate selections.  The Purple Pig offers a lively and friendly atmosphere. The price is very reasonable and the food & drinks are of excellent quality and satisfying portions.  As an example, our total for 5 dishes and a bottle of wine was $77.  Don't miss out on this instant Chicago staple!
