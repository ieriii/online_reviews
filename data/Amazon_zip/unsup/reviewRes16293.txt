wow! this is not the old neighborhood place we went for friday note pizza when my kids were growing up! I was shocked when I had occasion to go back after about 15 yrs. what a difference a few years makes! food was great italian but very pricey. the bar was a bit chaotic and kept having to flag the bartender to the table for more drink orders. we had a party of 10+ and were jammed in the last table by the kitchen. not good. not really kid friendly but since my kids are grown that's ok with me. don't really want to have a $50 dinner with a screaming kid at the next table. (the screaming kid was at our table, sorry other patrons) they did let us bring our own birthday cake. kept the bill down! would go back but not with a large group. I work with the handicapped and could not imagine taking a person in a wheelchair in this crowded place, no matter what they say about being :accessable"
