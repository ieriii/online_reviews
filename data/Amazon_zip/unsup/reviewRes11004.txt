Solid four stars for so far best thin crust and mixed green salad. Actually whenever there is an urgent need to satisfy my craving my mind cannot come up with other option than Piece. The place is a loud gathering of mainly 30 something or approaching 30's slew of professionals who swarm the hood. It's a sports bar slash catering place. Their pizza portions are gigantic, even the smal pizza looks like medium. I personally like their plain style although when you order it has least plain flavor. Good place for catching up with friends over beer and pizza. The liquor is ok, pretty good selection of beer.
