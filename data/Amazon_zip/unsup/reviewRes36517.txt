Yummy yummy yummy. I'm addicted to this place. Favs: Spring rolls (and the presentation - even with delivery - awesome!); Red curry (hot hot hot).  I usually do take out or delivery, which is a shame, as the atomsphere is cozy and lovely - even with their recent expansion.  Very good thai food and I really enjoy their maki.
