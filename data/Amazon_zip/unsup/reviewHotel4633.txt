Hotel Felix is just enough off of Michigan Ave. and the beaten path to lend itself to a quiet room at night, but certainly close enough to plenty of shopping and dining choices. Coffee makers and a mini bar are not in the room but no worries as coffee is provided in the lobby until 10am and a fantastic bar is open late. If the bar is closed, head over to Elate - the restaurant on the lobby level. The rooms are small but have plenty of storage space. In fact, my husband missed the fact that the bed had additional drawers until I pointed it out when I joined him in Chicago 2 days after his arrival. The bathroom is small too, much like that of a cruise ship, but outfitted with modern touches including a nice shower head and mod like sink. A large flat screen TV and desk round out the notable features. Hotel Felix has a card entry fitness center that consists of 2 ellipticals and perhaps 2-3 treadmills and some free weights. There is also a card entry business center with 3 computers and a printer for use anytime. The decor of the lobby is chic and the Hotel Felix prides itself on green initiatives.  If you are looking for a boutique hotel in a prime location, look no further.
