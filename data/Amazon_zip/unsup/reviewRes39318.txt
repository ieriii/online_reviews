I really, really wanted to hate this place. I hate the frontier vibe, I hate the whiskey bar, I hate the patrons cloaked in flannel and irony. I hate the trendiness of it, I hate the hard core crunchy hipster mecca that it is. Unfortunately, this place is awesome. The drinks were delicious. The bartender was pleasant and relaxed, even though it was packed. The host and server were on top of their game and very nice. The food was just amazing. I had this half chicken in a pot with broth and vegetables. It almost made me cry. It's was so juicy and flavorful. My dinner companion had a steak, and insisted it was one of the best he's had in Chicago. We tried the pigeon, and meh, it was OK, but everything else, everything was really, really great. Kudos to Longman & Eagle, they've officially won me over.
