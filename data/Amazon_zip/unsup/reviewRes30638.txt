We made reservation for 3 people on a Saturday night. The moment we entered we were greeted warmly by the receptionist and escorted to our table. Mary was our server and she went above & beyond from the start. Our experience with this restaurant was superb, food, service and atmosphere. We spent over $460 but felt it was worth it,
