I love the shared plates concept. Gives me an excuse to order lots of food. Like the salumi, prosciutto pizza, ricotta+honeycomb, raviolo, rigatoni, burger with bacon jam, pork belly, polenta+ragu....well, you get the picture. All delicious, by the way. I only wish the desserts were better. Maybe next time.
