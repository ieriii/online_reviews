Love led me to Grand Lux Cafe. For serious. Why else would a sane Chicago resident venture in at 8 pm on a saturday night - wait for it - the weekend before St. Pat's? A friend was celebrating his 40th, and for reasons unbeknownst to me, this is the spot he chose for dinner. When we arrived, the entire foyer was crammed with tourists, loud-talkers with shopping bags, and an unfathomable amount of non-Irish strutting out the greenery. In other words, we had arrived on the 4th level of hell - forgot to mention this didn't you Dante? After a relatively short wait due to extenuating cirumstances, we were told to go upstairs where we again waited for a short time before being seated. Please note, your wait will be longer - much longer. Sorry. Upon being seated, there appeared to be a controlled orderly chaos surrounding us. Expediters, waitresses, random important people wearing black, all buzzed around and somehow made it all work. Our server, Rachel, was delightful. She knew the menu, was able to make recommendations, and overall kept everything moving along perfectly. The food is basically the big brother to Cheesecake Factory, though to be honest, I prefer the latter. There are plenty of menu choices, and sure, most of it sounds good, but it seemed to be lacking something. I would be curious to try the brunch menu, but honestly, I can't imagine it being worth the trip. Overall, it's good for what it is, but nothing special.
