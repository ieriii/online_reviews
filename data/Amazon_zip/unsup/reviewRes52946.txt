Went here last week and was excited to have another nice place in the neighborhood to eat at. I went during the dinner rush, but didn't have to wait too long for my order. The atmosphere is nice and the patio on a hot day is the place to be. I ordered the snapper. It was pretty good, not the best i've ever had but i wasn't disappointed either. The service could have been a bit better. We asked for a side of rice and beans and had to remind our waiter after they didn't show up, but they are new so I'll wait until the next visit to make a final decision. Overall thoughts: Great place for a date Reasonable prices cool patio
