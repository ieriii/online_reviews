I came here for the first time for an early Friday night dinner with my fianc. We usually tend to keep our meals simple and especially don't like to feel weighed down after eating so we decided to split both a salad and a pasta dish. Wandering around Boystown trying to find a place to eat, most places pretty were empty. Except for Mia Francesca which was buzzing with activity. After being seated without having to wait, we found our server to be very prompt and attentive. We started with the Insalata alla Francesca. The salad was very simple-almost rustic-yet all the different parts put together formed a synergy which tasted excellent. Next we had the orecchiette. This was light pasta dish but very flavorful. The small cherry tomatoes had an excellent subtle spice to them and the pasta were cooked to a perfect al dente. We enjoyed the meal so much that despite not initially planning on ordering dessert we decided to stick around and try the tiramisu. It was definitely one of the best that I've had but my favorite part was the amazing chocolate sauce that was drizzled around it on the plate. We left the restaurant with a greater satisfaction than we had expected. Only two days later I found myself wanting to go back again!
