After reading reviews of this place in Yelp I was concerned... I can't stand loud places. At any rate, I stopped by a bit after lunch time and it was not bad at all. The place was full but you could talk to others without screaming which is a lot in comparison to most places in Chicago. Yolk could use some sound paneling but the food was great and service was perfect. I will definitely be back.
