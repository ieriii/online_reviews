I usually like to write detailed reviews in order to provide as much info as possible to other Yelpers in their various searches, but with 331 reviews for Sultan's Market already, I doubt there is much I can add, so I'll keep it brief: Delicious food, generous portions, quick service... and cheap prices. I highly encourage anyone to stop in here if you are in the area.
