We went for Peking Duck on Christmas. We pre-ordered the duck and the only additional thing we ordered were some stir fried vegetables. It was definitely enough for 3 people. What a treat! I had only had Peking Duck once before and had more memories of the production of preparing the duck and the presentation than the taste. This was wonderful. As other reviewers have stated, there are 3 parts to the meal--the little sandwiches you can make with the thinly sliced pieces of duck and duck skin, soup that they make from the bones, and fried rice from the rest of it. They provide these rolls (bao) to make sandwiches for the first entree. The duck on these rolls combines with a little bit of their sauce and pickle radish was wonderful. I could have skipped the soup. It didn't have much flavor. I am so glad they have a new location. I am a big barbecued pork and sesame chicken fan and used to get these items "to go" at the front of the store. Finally after several years of picking up food, I went in for a meal with family members and the grunginess of their old place destroyed the experience for me.  Call me a princess but...Any, the new place is big, clean, and modern. Our server was very nice and friendly and told us not to hesitate to ask questions about anything she was doing while she prepared the duck for us. I recommend everyone trying Peking duck at least once! I updated this review and went from 4 to 5 stars because I recently celebrated my birthday there and the people could not have been nicer. The Peking Duck was even better than it was on Christmas and we ordered some other dishes served family style which were recommended by the owner: (1) stir fried chive flowers (2) crispy shrimp with coconut and candied walnuts (3) stir fried beef with a medley of 4 kinds of mushrooms. These were all specials that were not on the menu so when you go there with a group, be sure to ask about them!
