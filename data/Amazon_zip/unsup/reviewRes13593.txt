we finally got to see what all the buzz was about on our most recent trip to chicago. unfortunately, it's impossible for us to get a small group together for lunches/dinners/drinks... so our wait was a long one, since they won't even put you on the list until your entire group is present, and one of our friends was an HOUR late. i'm not sure why so many restaurants are anti-reservation, but this one should maybe reconsider that stance since they've been open for a few years now and the place is still always packed. just a thought. i guess i was expecting the focus to be on the beers that they make, but it wasn't. the beer list was extensive, which i usually love, but i came to try THEIR beer. also, please update your beer list regularly. i don't want to see central waters bourbon barrel stout on there only to be told that you don't have it. that's just mean. when we were finally seated and ordered drinks, our server forgot a few of our drinks. they were insanely busy (as i assume they always are), so i guess i'll forgive him for that. most of us ordered workingman burgers (aged cheddar, beer onion and bacon) and agreed that they were just ok, nothing special. the people in our group that went the brunch route seemed to like their meals more. overall, i thought revolution was alright. if you're hungry, don't expect to be seated in a decent amount of time unless you have a group of four or less. maybe we'll come back and try something other than burgers next time.
