Be prepared to fork over the cash at this place. I recently saw this place on an episode of Check Please! and desperately wanted to try it out. Its a little tricky to actually find the restaurant once you're inside the Blackstone Hotel, but I eventually made my way. The drink list most def has a variety of unique mixed drinks. I started off with the Merengue which was sweet w/ a kick. Then later tried the seasonal sangria which included a kick of vodka.  My girls and I ordered several tapas dishes which we all shared. Be aware that these dishes are probably only met for sharing between 2 people. The portions are small and pricey. The tapas staple of bacon wrapped dates were flavorful and left me wanting more. Ironically, their spinach dish with pine nuts and apples was awesome. Who knew spinach could taste so good? My gal pals and I also tried the bacon flatbread, spicy potatoes, diver scallops, an amazing rice (almost like a risotto) w/ clams and a short-rib and scallop entree. All of the dishes were amazing and had a pretty presentation. Desserts were also very good. The chocolate croquettes and the butter cake are a MUST try! The croquettes come with a marshmallow fluff type sauce- need I say more?! All in all the food was good- small portions, and a little pricey, but a great ambiance. Glad I tried it.
