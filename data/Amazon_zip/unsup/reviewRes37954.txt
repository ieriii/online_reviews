Some visiting friends and I were going to a nearby comedy club and had time for some drinks before so we turned the corner and had to go to Hopleaf (since I'd heard great things). We weren't disappointed. Hopleaf consists of 3 areas - bar, restaurant, and patio - and all are inviting. The bar had a lot of people in it so we opted for the restaurant area which was equally as comfortable with plenty of room, vintage brick walls, and large open windows looking out to the large back patio area. They have a huge selection of beers (especially Belgian beers), which made it hard to choose, and we got a couple of tasty appetizers that seemed to disappear pretty quick. Next time I plan on trying the fries and mussels since I've heard those are both great there. All in all, great atmosphere, great brews, and great food.
