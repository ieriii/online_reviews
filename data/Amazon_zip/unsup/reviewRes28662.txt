The last time I was here was years ago!!! But I cant lie, I cant for real.....Ok I kid hehehehehe Yes I can! But in all reality I have been getting cravings to go back to this little pasta place and have some of their creamy pasta. Good stuff and its not expensive either...well it wasnt back then anyway. I will be back definitely! great location too right on the corner of Fullerton and Clark. Hipster infestation level: ZERO!!!!
