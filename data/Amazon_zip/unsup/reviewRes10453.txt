I didn't want to like this place. It looks like a sports bar and I don't like sports bars. However, they brew a plethora of beers here, and I must say, I was impressed with the selection. I was also impressed with the Golden Arm, which is a kolsch-style beer. I love Kolsch, too bad it's hard to find outside of Bavaria. It was late-afternoon, so I was still able to order a personal-size pizza (they serve them til 5 pm). They are plate-size and just enough if you are not too hungry. It was a little under-cooked, but still yummy, topped with fresh basil & tomatoes. I'm not too keen on the huge open atmosphere, as it isn't so cozy, but then again I am just here to get a quick bite to eat and a brew... Next time I'll probably go for there Sunday deal of a large pizza and a 64 oz. growler (jug) of one of their beers to go for only $25.
