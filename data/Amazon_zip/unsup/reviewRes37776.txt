The first of many Chicago favorites... Stopped into Hopleaf for a few beers and maybe an appetizer and was blown away by the unique selection of high octane brews. My personal favorite was the Black Chocolate Stout, but each beer I tried was unique and delicious in it's own way.  We ordered the house specialty Belgian style mussels and loved them as well. Look forward to going back for special events (Beer & Chocolate!) and a dinner every now and then. Seating was an issue, but eventually a spot opened up at the bar. Check your 'entitled' attitude at the door. A beer lovers must!
