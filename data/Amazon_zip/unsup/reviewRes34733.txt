Unique and tasty food at outrageously reasonable prices -- not much I can add to the hundreds of prior reviews. I'd like to rate it 4 stars; so why didn't I? Because they fail in one of my basic requirements of a restaurant: TAKE CREDIT CARDS. Listen up, Sultan's Market management: this is the fuggin' 21st Century. Fewer and fewer people carry cash these days, and there is less and less reason to. And no, it is NOT sufficient to point to an ATM in the corner that you make money on and would cost me $4 in service fees. I don't want to eat at your restaurant badly enough to waste four bucks before I ever even look at the menu. This place is right on my way home from work and has the potential to get lots of my business, which they will once they catch up with the times and start taking plastic, Until then, I will be a very infrequent customer at best.
