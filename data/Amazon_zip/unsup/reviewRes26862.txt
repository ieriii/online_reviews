Mexican is definitely among my favorites when it comes to choosing a cuisine. I was very excited when we got the chance to go to lunch at Frontera Grill. We had tried the little outpost inside the Macy's, so I knew what was coming my way and was ready to dive in. It has been quite a while since our visit, so I don't remember everything that we ordered. My cocktail was one of the fresh cocktails of the day. Yes, it was pricey, but it was worth every sip. We split the guacamole to start. I do keep a list (http://www.yelp.com/list) so ordering guacamole went without question. Looking at the pictures from our trip, it appears I ordered the el pastor. Neither my husband nor I were dissatisfied with our meals. The service wasn't super speedy, but the restaurant was quite busy when we were there so we weren't surprised. While the meal was among some of our pricier meals, it was expected, especially for the city.
