I think I had high expectations going in. We went for brunch on a Saturday. We were happy that they were able to take reservations, were willing to seat us earlier when our plans changed, and the waitress was incredibly nice to us. The food was so so. The portions were nice. The presentation was nice. My eggs Benedict were incredibly salty and the gumbo was okay. Our drinks were also okay. We were expecting to fall in love with the place, and instead we were left thinking we might want to travel to New Orleans to see what gumbo is really all about.
