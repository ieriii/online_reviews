I came here for the first time a few weeks ago with my boyfriend and a coworker. We were all pretty much blown away by the food. Knowing that they don't take reservations, we left work at 5 and arrived at the restaurant at 5:15. Even then it was packed, but we were able to get seated immediately. This is not a quiet restaurant and the tables are extremely close together, but if you can get past those negatives, the food is certainly worth it. Since the food is served tapas style, we ordered several small dishes for all of us to share: charred cauliflower, braised baby artichokes, a combination of cheeses, pork shoulder, turkey leg confit, scallops, and some kind of fish that is no longer on the menu. Everything was absolutely delicious with the exception of the scallops. Normally I love scallops, but these were skewered with whole lemon slices, which made the scallops themselves taste overwhelmingly like lemon. Personally, I'd rather taste the seafood. The pork shoulder was amazing and I don't even normally like pork. We skipped dessert since all the other food was pretty filling. One thing to note is that the dishes vary quite a bit in size (which our server warned us about). Some of them are like small appetizers, while others (such as the turkey leg) are the size of a whole meal. However, if you tell the server what you're thinking of ordering, they can advise you on whether it's too much food or not enough.
