This place is great. I guess that statement sums it up. Went here on a Sunday for a friend's party. We had a section reserved for about 20-25 people. Service was very good, we didn't need much from the wait staff but they were still attentive. Pizza was fabulous; they have several varieties to choose from: white pizza (olive oil base), traditional red pizza (tomato base), and they even have a cheeseless pizza. Excellent beer selection (try the dysfunctionale if you like dark beers). I don't know what the total tab was, but the pizzas range from around $13 to about $20, depending on the number of toppings. A medium would definitely be enough for 3 people, the large is very large. Beer was reasonable; the 22oz hefeweizen I was drinking was only $5.50.
