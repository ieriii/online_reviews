We started our annual trip to Chicago for the Restaurant show at our favorite breakfast spot, Yolk.  They simply never let us down. Huge portions, good service and very tasty. You can't miss with the Eggs Bene or the Zamboni crepes. This place is so good we go every single morning for breakfast and actually rented a condo right around the corner so we start out day right before the show every day. Just about as good as it gets.
