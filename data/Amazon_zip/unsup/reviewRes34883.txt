i've only had the falafel sandwich here, which i LOVE! the only thing i could ever hope for is if they could mix their spices in with the falfelly filling rather than scooping it on top. it makes for really spicy sometimes and not spicy at all other times. even so, sultan's has the best falafel sandwich ever!
