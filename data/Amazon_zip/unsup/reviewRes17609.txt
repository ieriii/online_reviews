I had a great experience for the one time I was there. We had a party of 12 people on a Friday night around 10 pm and the doorman initially told us it'd be at least an hour and got our phone number to call back. He called back only after 15 min and we were able to get a nice table to comfortably seat all of us. This place was quite unique in that they didn't let people stand on the inside. Everyone had to be sitting down. Drinks were well crafted and tasty. Our waitress was friendly and very knowledgeable on the drinks. I'd recommend this place. At least check it out for yourself.
