i only came here for drinks with some friends, but i liked it so much i'll go back and try the food. we sat on the rooftop, which is big and beautiful and comfortable. our server was efficient and friendly, the drinks were strong and tasty and our bbq potato chip appetizer was perfect. all that being said, the best part was when we were leaving. they have a complimentary shuttle that will take you wherever you want to go. ivan, our driver, was incredibly nice and told us to use his name at other bars to skip the line. very cool place. i'll definitely be back.
