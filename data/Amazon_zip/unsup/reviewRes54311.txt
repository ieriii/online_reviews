So I have only been here a couple times for lunch, and its my fave spot for Chicago pizza. The pan pizza with the caramelized crust was pretty damn good! Toppings were fresh, great selections of drinks, and good customer service! Also, Webster Theater is right there, so if I want some good pizza before a movie or even after, Pequod's is the place to go!!!
