I've been waiting for years to Frontera, finally my wife surprised me with a Saturday night reservation. 9pm reservation but we got to the bar around 8 and we were seated by 8:30. The atmosphere is loud and festive, small crowded area but well worth it. Started with ceviche and quacemole, both were excellent . For the entree I had wood grilled shrimp with an apricot mole that was unbelievable! I've eaten, literally, thousands of shrimp and this was by far the best shrimp dish I've ever had. The price wasn't bad either dinner for two with apps and drinks was around $100 with tip. I've easily spent that on average restaurants, so I thought this was pretty good for an award winning restaurant. As we were getting ready to leave I turned around and Rick Bayless and his wife were sitting behind us eating dinner, kinda cool!! Love the atmosphere, food and margaritas... We will definitely be returning.
