Meh, I think since the remodel the place is fairly characterless (suburban, even). It's hard to cope with all the space in this place now remembering how small-ish and uncavernous it was before. The food doesn't seem to be as good lately either. Not to say it's bad, because it's still good. The margaritas, however, are still as awesome as they ever were!
