Nothing to say but the best Steak in Chicago. By far the best steak "chain" ever. I have been to the one in Chicago, Las Vegas, and Orange County. i always find an excuse to take clients out to dinner and will forever have Mastro's as my go to if I am in a city that has one.  Always have the bone in ribeye. The chilled seafood app tower is a must. and frankly its a heart attack on a plate...but the butter cake is the final, exceptional cap that will send you into the best food coma of your life.  if youre on a diet... stay home.
