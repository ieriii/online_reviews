I've only had a chance to check out their rooftop lounge, but plan on trying the food here one day.  The rooftop is sleek and a very chill spot to have some drinks. They have a okay beer selection and also a nice selection of cocktails. If you like bloody mary's, they whip em up extra spicy and delicious. It sucks that the rooftop closes at midnight, but there's a bar downstairs to continue the drinking.
