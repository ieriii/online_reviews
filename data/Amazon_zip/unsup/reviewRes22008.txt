Final Update! Almost 4 months later I finally had the opportunity to order a new meal from Irazu. I was hopeful and optimistic and they really surpassed my expectations. Today's order was extremely well handled by Justin, on the phone. He was professional and very detail oriented. I cannot say enough good things about how AWESOME management (Henry,and Omar) were through this process. They were truly and genuinely willing to listen and to help. I call back this long after my original conversation and they still remember me. I gave them so much credit, just for that. Then for them to remain cordial and courteous throughout this process is something I value and appreciate. Now to the food. We tried a variety of items including the Taco Tico's, Casado with Tilapia, Pepito sandwich and Chifrijo. Every single thing was awesome. Even the tortilla chips that came with the Chifrijo were great. I am really happy that we had the chance to try their food again and definitely will go back in the future. The taco tico's were actually our favorite and now we can't get enough of the, Next time we need to order a couple extra for leftovers.  I now see that my original bad experience was truly just a bad day/moment and not indicative of the typical Irazu experience. I really have never experienced such great resolution to an issue before and I think the Irazu team should be commended. I now see why the reviews for this place are so good. It really is good stuff. Now I just need to get over to the restaurant to get a fresh shake, cause I still really do want to try one. Thanks Henry, Justin and Omar!!!
