the food here is ok, but nothing special. i have had way better Pho elsewhere. their Pho have too much MSG i can taste it in my throat.. eww! but they have good fresh smoothie and fresh sugar cane juice; therefore they get 2 stars. but not a fan of this place... "its over price for Vietnamese food.
