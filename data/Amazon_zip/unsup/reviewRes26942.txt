This place is the place to go for Chicago-style deep dish pizza. I have had plenty of Chicago deep dish and this is by far my favorite. The caramelized cheese crust creates flavor like I have never had. I would go just for that. I usually get a large pie with half pepperoni and half sausage. I like to have leftovers to eat later... The service is great. The bartender/manager knew my face after only 2 visits. Impressive. The atmosphere is laid back. It seems like your typical bar. It has plenty of TV's and plenty of booths. It can get crowded on weekends. The wait, though, is never too long. 15 is the longest I have ever waited.  Pequod's is the best. GO THERE NOW.
