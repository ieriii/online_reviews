On a Friday night, this nubile dark-wood sexpot of a Gastropub can still seat you with ease. The beer selection is prolific, with at least a baker's dozen of beers worth drinking on draft, and triple that of bottled brews waiting in the wings. Their "taster" beer flights gets you five 4oz glasses of either light or dark beers served on a paddle for $18 and is a great way to break into new beers. They also have meads, cocktails, wines and beer cocktails that defy expectation. The food menu was straight-forward about what was in everything, and allowed a person to imagine the flavors of each combination. This unambiguous approach to the food was so tantalizing it took us a good 15 minutes to decide what to commit to. Sandwiches that lure with siren-song ingredients, gourmet burgers with toppings that rival (and in my opinion outmatch) Kuma's, customizable flavor french fries and appetizers that should be illegal due to paralyzing tastiness. We spent a comfortable couple of hours here drinking and eating, and got out for under $50 total. We'll be back and be bringing friends.
