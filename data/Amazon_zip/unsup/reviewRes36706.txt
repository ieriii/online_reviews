Meli is a great place for breakfast. Be sure to go very hungry--the portions are huuuuge. Since we live close by, my husband and I go quite often. We like to go before the crowds start, meaning 9 AM or earlier on a Sunday. They always have a lot of interesting specials--the last time we were there, my husband had an antelope omelet. I'm more of a traditional person, so I tend to order off their regular menu. Even just the plain scrambled eggs, potatoes and toast are awesome. I love their homemade english muffins and the changing selection of jams. I also like the fresh-squeezed juice, though I wish it were cold instead of room temperature. Mmm...we might end up there tomorrow morning!
