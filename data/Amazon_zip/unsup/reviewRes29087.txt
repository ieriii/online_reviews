This is by far my favorite restaurant in Chicago. I eat here about once a week and have been going here for about 3 years now. It's slowly been getting more crowded, which means the word is spreading. The prices are ridiculously cheap and the food is always fresh and seasoned unbelievably well. I think if you were to stumble upon this place like I did, you'd find it to be a gem. But if you go based on hype, you probably won't dig it as much. It's pretty casual... the same servers work night after night and tend to leave you alone, which I like. The food comes out fast. The crab rangoon is amazing. I've never had a bad dish. BYOB is awesome. The only complaint I can possibly think of is that the spicy-level is ever-changing. Every time I order a dish with medium spicy goodness and it comes out either mild, hot or just right. It's never accurate. But the suspense of what it's going to be is a constant fun factor. I'd recommend: Gaeng Panang Gaeng Masaman Gaeng Daeng Peanut Sauce Lover Chicken Paid Thai Pad See Ewe Yum Neau Pad Preow Wan Rama Delight Crab Rangoon Egg Rolls Thai Iced Tea Hot Tea
