Ok. So. I have a story for you today. First, let me say how much I love Groupon. Seriously, it's like a magical little treat that drops into my inbox each morning. Anyway, that's how I ended up at India House. I bought the Groupon thinking I would use it for their lunch buffet since it's really close to my office. Well, I didn't get around to that, but one day I got out of work early and went running errands around town. By 5 PM I was FAMISHED. Shopping does that to a girl. So I thought, hey, Groupon= cheap meal, and we swung by India House. Now, this is not the kind of place where you get cheap, down n dirty Indian food. In true downtown style, it's a little pricey. But the food really was fantastic. The vibe was a little off to me though...like no one spoke a word to us really. But whatever, not a huge deal. So they were on track to have a great review from me...that is until I found a rubber band in my curry. I'm not generally one to make a fuss. It was just the kind of little rubber band that you find in kitchens, usually around bundles of veggies, so I just kind of pushed it off to the side of my plate (and totally still asked to have the leftovers boxed). Well, I guess the waiter noticed it on my plate and came to ask me if I had found it in the food. I said yes and he started apologizing profusely. They gave me back my Groupon and told me to use it another time because they were going to give me a 50% discount on the meal we just had. It was excellent customer service in response to something that would have sent a lot of patrons through the roof and I was really pleased to see that. It also made the meal really affordable and I did eventually use the Groupon on the lunch buffet. So, yeah. I like India House. I wouldn't stop anyone from trying it...I would just recommend the buffet as it's a better deal than their regular menu...if you're a big eater, that is. If you're more like me and are only going to eat one serving of food it's kind of expensive.
