I just called the Gage to inquire about bringing 20-25 people in for an after-dinner casual event and the guy that I spoke with, I think his name was Dave, was incredibly rude and was not interested in the least in helping me. I've been here for dinner, drinks and my company has held multiple private events in the past and I never expected to be treated so rudely. I will not be planning any events at the Gage in the future.Gage - big mistake, HUGE.
