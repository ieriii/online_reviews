Great bloody mary, but I prefer Feast's version because the celery stick is half the fun. I had the smoked duck egg benedict. I liked it, but there was nothing really special about it. I liked the hash browns though. I had a taste of my friend's caramelized apple and toasted walnut flapjacks with warm praline cream and toasted walnut pieces. Now, this is something to rave about. I'm not usually a big fan of anything resembling pancakes or waffles or French toast. I think they're all way too sweet. The flapjacks at the Bongo Room was delicious! It was light and fluffy just the way I like it, and you don't even need maple syrup to sweeten it up. It was just the right amount of sweetness. Next time I'm here, I'm coming for the flapjacks... and maybe with a celery stick in a ziplocked bag. ;)
