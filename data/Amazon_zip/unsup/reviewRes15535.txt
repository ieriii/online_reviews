So why review 59, do they need any more. Well, here it is anyway. When I lived in the area I ordered delivery from here for years always good, kept me dialing in weekly. This is the first time that I dined there. This is where I wish Yelp had a several star rating system. One Star- For when we arrived. No one at the podium, could have been seating someone? Well no, and it was before the rush. The bartender spotted us, I figured she would acknowledge us, well no. When I approached the bar, she walked in the other direction. She looked pretty cranky. The hostess at this point spotted us and we were seated. Three stars- Service, We did get water and menus right away, however there was a little confusion on who was waiting on us, shift change. No big deal, our server and the service was very good once things got going. Four Stars- Food. Very good, some of the best fettuccine alfredo, that I've had in a while, a good value too 12.95 with a choice of soup or salad. Four Stars- Atmosphere. Nice comfy decor, a good mix of tables and booths, not spaced tightly together. Beautiful hardware floors and an overall open airy feel. I'll be going back, and perhaps after that they'll get that fourth overall star. Because when you get down to it, it's all about the food.
