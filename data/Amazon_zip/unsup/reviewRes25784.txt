This place looks like a little love dungeon inside. A definite must for special occasions. I guess you don't really have to have a special occasion to go here, but if i adopted that strategy I would gain a couple of hundred pounds. Do come on a Monday night, half of on wine. I was impressed with the prices of their wines and the selection. Our server was helpful and attentive, although it felt like she was reading of a script. I enjoyed my connoisseur entree which consisted of steak, lobster, and shrimp. I love to cook my own steak because nobody can say anything about how raw I like it. I recommend wearing something nice but not to fancy, you're bound to get some cheese or oil on you at some point. Well, let me rephrase that, I'm bound to do that.
