Huge restaurant. Went in for an early dinner with some girlfriends to celebrate new jobs in the city. My one friend went with the $16 Salisbury Steak... amazing! Beautiful presentation and tasted wonderful. I had a burger, nothing too spectacular, just a typical $10 burger - guess I expected something a little better being at Grand Lux. My other friend got the $29 Filet Mignon and it was horrible. It came out thin and dry and was not cooked to order, very charcoaled with a boring presentation (a side of fried greasy onion rings... ew. - I would have preferred some tasty potatoes and grilled veggies if you ask me!) Figured it would be a lot better than the Salisbury. None of us are ones to complain about our orders but for what she paid she thought it was worth a try. Sure enough the manager came over, apologized and quickly took it off our bill. My friend would have been happy with a discount - but it was very nice of him to remove it completely. Had they not - they probably would have 4 unsatisfied customers leaving with a bad experience to share with others - but instead they had 4 decently happy customers leave to share the positive experience we had with the manager himself - and we'll have no problem coming back in the future (probably refrain from ordering the filet, but other than that at least we'll return!).
