Boom-baby! The legend is true, this is place to go if you want Chicago Deep Dish all others pale in comparison. They have a new Chicago Fire Pizza, it was amazing! Gets crowded and there is always a wait, but you know what Heinz ketchup says about that. Just trying to limit myself to 2x month at this place.
