For a good Chicago dog, Superdawg is the place. Loaded with the works, can't beat it. Of course parking is tight but that is to be a given with the location but its worth it. Minus one star due to the fries. What's up with that? Small and "brown", like they refried them. Anyway, go for the dawgs and ps, don't ask for mustard so warn the kids and outsiders =).
