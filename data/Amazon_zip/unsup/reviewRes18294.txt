I was here on Friday the 13th and the "bad" thing that happened was I ate too much! I decided to stop in here after being at Northwestern Hospital for 3 hours. The stroll here was nice, although going through the tourist zone had some challenges. When we arrived, there wasn't much of a line for seating, but they told us it would be about 20 minutes. What place doesn't say 20 minutes? We were handed menus and figured out our food while we waited. Everything was yummy! I had the woodland mushroom torta and hubby had the choriqueso torta. It was hot and fresh and brought to our spot. I also ordered some chocolate espresso for when I was finished dining and then had to go up to the counter to request it. That part I didn't like since by then there was a HUGE line and I had to do the "excuse me, excuse me" dance to get to the counter. It's noisy in here, so don't go if you plan to converse lots. Also the seating is a crap shoot, you might be at the counter, you might have some stranger next to you. Get over it and focus on the food. That's why you visited, isn't it?
