It's a sit-com truism: the good-light/bad-light woman, the cheerleader effect, beer googles, etc. In certain settings, everything looks awesome and you're having a fantastic time, unsure of what you did to deserve such amazing luck. But, in certain moments of clarity, you see the ugly truth: you're with a woofer and there's no way out. PS benefits from its patio. It's just...so... pretty. On a nice summer day (let's not kid ourselves and mention spring aka second winter), you'll want to spend all day outside, sunning yourself, drinking fizzy Italian sodas and loving life. In fact, I am pretty sure that you'll be so excited about the patio that you'll largely miss that your food isn't that good. I think there's a reason why so many of the reviews are so effusive in their praise when written in warmer months and so... meh in the colder ones. The common thread is the patio. So, the patio gets five stars! Experience it. Unfortunately, I can only muster up 3 for the food. I was bored by the insalata di pere and my griglia mista tasted like char. I was so uninspired by my food, that I couldn't be bothered to eat much of it and I left PS hungry. I know! One should never leave a restaurant hungry. What a sad waste of octopus, squid and shrimp. I kept wanting to be astounded by the blend of citrus and seafood but bite after bite, all I can sense was grill marks. It made me a little sad. What better way to spend a sunny day than on a patio, drinking drinks with bubbles and eating summery food like tomatoes, oranges and octopus. I should have been reminded of my misspent youth as a cabana boy on the Mediterranean. Instead, I was sunburned, hungry and my mouth was full of ash. It was like that pool party at Lindsay Lohan's house I told you about...
