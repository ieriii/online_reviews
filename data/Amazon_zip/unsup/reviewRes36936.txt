it was my first time eating at indie cafe last Thursday and i had a great time. i loved the decor of the restaurant, esp. the lamps. i didn't venture for any Thai food, except for crab Rangoon (my favorite appetizer to get), which was really really good esp. the filing. i like the fact that i can go out for sushi but also get crab Rangoon, so this rest works out really well for me....our service was good and the food was reasonable priced.... i love that it is BYOB, i can enjoy my Sapporo without being overcharged....overall i can't wait to come back.
