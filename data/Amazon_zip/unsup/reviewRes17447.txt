I have been to Carnivale on 2 different occasions for dinner. They had a long wait for a table in the dining room so we opted to eat in the bar area in front where they have a smaller seating section. Even though we were bummed that we couldn't get the full experience the food more than made up for it! The first time I went was with my bf and I ordered the filet mignon and he ordered a steak of some sort. The waiter accidently put the filet mignon in front of my bf and his steak in front of me and we didn't realize it until we had finished! He really liked my dish, which was suppose to be his so he was disappointed with the mistake but I wasn't!!! Either way.. great place. A must try!!
