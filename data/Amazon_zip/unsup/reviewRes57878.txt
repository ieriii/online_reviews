My girlfriend and I go here all the time. Its the best deal if you'd like to share a meal for one person (we can never finish them for two). Ethiopian Diamond can get pretty expensive (special occassion expensive) if you want to add on drinks and appetizers that's why we prefer Demera over Ethiopiam Diamond. The food at Demera isn't quite as good as Ethiopian Diamond because they're lamb and other meat dishes are hit or miss. If you like black injera you can order it ahead of time and they'll serve your meal with it. The honey wine is delicious and they make their own which they open on Fridays so get there before the weekend is over because they run out quickly. They do have bottled honey wine that should suffice if the run out of the home brew. One thing we've noticed is that the night time service has new management and they are pretty annoying. The head manager told us about how the old servers (off the boat Ethiopian servers) couldn't even open a bottle of wine. I thought that was pretty unprofessional to be gloating about how badly they needed new management especially when it has made the atmosphere seem so much less like authentic Ethiopian dining. Maybe I'm in the minority, but I think people would be much happier feeling like they were not in a steak house (where the new manager came from) and in a family owned Ethiopian Restaurant. Overall, the food hasn't changed since the new management and that's the biggest draw for me so I still give Demera 4 stars!
