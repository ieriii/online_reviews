Yeah! I had been dying to try this place and finally went there tonight for my birthday. The bartenders were amazing, I actually wished that we could have sat at the the bar just so I could watch them work. I love all the little touches and the wait for my drink was definitely worth it. I love a place where I can just look at the bartender and say "make me something with gin and her something with brandy. " I love that the hostess went out of her way to find us a booth because it was my birthday. I love that it was a smoke and cell-phone free bar. I will definitely be back!!!
