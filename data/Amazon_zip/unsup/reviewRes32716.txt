We have been coming to Demera since it opened a few years back and Demera has been on top of our list for favorite restaurants ever since. Not just topping the list of Ethiopian restaurants, but favorite of all kinds combined. I have never been disappointed as the Ethiopian food is always very flavorful and consistently the same every time we dine here, which is as often as 6 times in 7 days at one point. Demera is a must stop location for all people wanting to experience Ethiopian fare with tons of options for all food lovers from the vegan community to more carnivorous types, this is the place to go. You can even call ahead and be sure to get gluten free injera if you have a gluten sensitivity or just want to try something new. The restaurant itself has evolved and is currently experiencing a brand new look. The entire business from bathrooms to kitchen is being redone from an already very acceptable environment to an even more cozy and earthy vibe with open air indoor/outdoor window capabilities. A bar area also awaits those who arrive early and want to relax prior to having the best meal they can imagine. As for the staff, they are authentic and great! The owner and head chef is the most friendly lady I know and she always approaches us when she sees us at a table. All the servers as well as the front of the house manager have treated us extremely well. By now everybody knows who we are and they make it a point to fill our special requests if we have something special we desire. I could go on and on, but to learn more you should check it out yourself. Everything at Demera is very good and also very well kept. Check it out quick before I eat all the injera!!!
