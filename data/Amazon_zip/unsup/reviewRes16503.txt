Hands down, the BEST MOJITOS IN CHICAGO! Really. I get mojito almost everywhere it's offered. The ambiance is very festive but tasteful. It's definitely a great place for a good night out. If you order off the restaurant menu, they'll seat you in the larger room with high ceilings and amazing decor. The bar decor pales in comparison. Their ceviche is especially good. They have combo ceviche dishes so you can try them all! I wasn't a fan of their meat entrees but other people in our party loved them so tomato tomAto.
