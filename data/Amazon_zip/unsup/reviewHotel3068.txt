W Lakeshore is LOUD and OBNOXIOUS. It is NOT hip and cool, although it tries to be. Stay somewhere else, folks. Not worth it. Just back from weekend trip to Chicago - although decor was nice/modern, bad management decisions made for a negative overall experience - loud music blaring in lobby/elevators, parties going on every night in the lobby, room service wakes you up at 8am. Free Acura Experience is a joke - always constantly booked, never had the chance to try it. Hotel is perfect for 22 year old frat kids who want to get drunk, scream, run around all night picking up strippers. For everyone else, an awful experience is sure to be had here.
