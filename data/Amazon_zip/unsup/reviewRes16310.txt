Carnivale is solid. The mojitos are yummy...and strong. You wouldn't think so with the size of the glass. You know they crush the heck out of that mint and sugar to get that flavor in the drink. I get the ropa vieja and the chicken tortilla soup when I go here. Both of these dishes are amazing. Now, the ropa vieja is "I took a bite jumped out my chair, laid on the floor and starting convulsing" good. Don't go here and not get the ropa vieja. You will regret it. Originally, when we came here, I had the chicken, it was okay. I don't frequent this place too much because I don't eat pork, raw meat (steaks not well done) or shell fish, and that's their menu. But, that ropa vieja, hmph. I sure will go for just that...I sure will!
