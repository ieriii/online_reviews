Had one of the best meals I can remember in a long time last night at Nana. Our server, Aaron, was adorable, completely attentive and genuine. The chef grinned when I raved about how amazing our meal had been. We started with one of the sexiest vegetable plates I've ever seen. My dream dinner. Some raw (radishes, cauliflower, baby carrots), some cooked just so (ramps, fennel)....there were SO MANY vegetables I could have stopped there. Plus a fat gorgeous toasted bread, olives, a dollop of guac, and a heavenly cheesey dip (this was the fondue, after all).... Next my amigo enjoyed a gorgeous-looking soft shell crab, and I indulged in blue corn house 'quesadillas' with house made ricotta with huitacoche & wild mushroom which were more like some sort of masa variation. YUM!! I was already full, but I ate almost the whole dish....underneath was a bed of more delicious seasonal vegetables: fiddlehead ferns, favas, fennel... Did I mention we ordered the onion rings? Yep - we over indulged. Huge fat plate. It was a little much...but....delish, of course. I sent my espresso back after dinner (the machine hadn't been used all day), but the second our server pulled was con panna (whipped cream) and completely delicious. So was the sauce of the nightly dessert, which included some sort of berries infused with rosemary....there was more whipped cream & a fluffy textured baked thing. Dio mio. Honestly - I couldn't eat another morsel, although I could sip on my dinner date's rye, which was to die for. I am thinking of going back tonight.  x
