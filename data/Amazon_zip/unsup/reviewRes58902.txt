Loved the trendy Asian fusion vibe, felt like I was at the Tao resturaunt in Vegas! In the heart of River North close to a lot of other bars, so if you wanted to go somewhere after dinner! The place was lively, yet relaxed a great balance. Once complaint I do have is the service was not up to par. Our waiteress was extermely moody, so friendly at first, by the end of the our meal she looked flustered. Overall food and location are amazing.
