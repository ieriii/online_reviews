I wrote the review below a while ago, but alas, I decided to give Sultan's another try. I thought that perhaps it had improved. After all, it is a very popular establishment. HOWEVER, I was disappointed once again. The hummus was bland and the tabouli was so flavorless. I am Kyle C's gf (see below) and I, indeed, stole a lemon, but it was not enough.
