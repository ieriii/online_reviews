I am new to the neighborhood and was pointed by a coworker in the direction of a nearby breakfast spot on Taylor for Sunday Brunch. The place was small and absolutely packed so my girlfriend and I wandered up the street towards another breakfast restaurant when we passed Davanti. The doors and windows were open and music was playing. 10am on a Sunday for what I had heard was a relatively new Italian restaurant? We popped our heads in to check it out. For the next 3 hours we ate and drank our faces off. Soft scrambled eggs with fresh black pepper and pecorino. This breakfast calzone as big as my head. Some cheesy bread and egg dish in truffle oil. The bloody Marys were good. The mimosas were delicious. We came in with no expectations and left extremely full and very satisfied. I was pleasantly surprised. For an Italian restaurant boxed in between two well known breakfast spots, I was very impressed at how well they held their own. I have been back since and will go back in the future.
