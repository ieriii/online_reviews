Went last night and...okay, I didn't know that crepes were the *only* thing on the menu! I do like crepes, and I like vegetarian fare, but I also like options. A better variety of menu items would've bought this place at least an additional star from me. But anyway, my crepe (marrakech) was very good, and my partner's (adumi) was a little date-heavy, but also pretty good. And our server was lovely! So I guess I must recommend.
