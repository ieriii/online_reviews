Really enjoyed the dinner in this Italian Restaurant. Staff are really friendly and they try their best to serve you. Before I went, I made a reservation via Yelp but somehow, the restaurant didn't receive my reservation when we arrived on a busy Sat night. It's super crowded and people can't wait to get a table for those delicious looking cuisines. Staff knew our situation and promised me that they will still take care of my reservation and try to find a table asap. While be seated, we enjoyed the priceless appetizer-mussels. It is so FRESH! At that moment of tasting the freshness, I totally feel it's worthy to visit this restaurant and I can't waiting to have my entree. We order pasta, but I can't recall which one we ordered. Only memory it still remains in my mind is their pasta sauce; it is so special and you don't feel sick or increase the blood pressure after the meal. I bet the food quality is so far the best but this is a bit over my budget if I didn't use their coupons/ promotion.
