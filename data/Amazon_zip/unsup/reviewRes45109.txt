For me, the true measure of a great Italian restaurant is its ability to deliver on non-pasta dishes. It isn't an Atkins sourced aversion towards carbs, I just find that pasta gets in the way of meat and sauce flavors; aside from ravioli stuffed with meat in a meat sauce, I'm not interested. So, that's my bias. And Anteprima is more than ready for it, with entrees ranging from pork to steak to bison and beyond. Tonight I opted for the grilled octopus appetizer followed by the pork porterhouse special, grilled with peaches, faro, and smoked onion. The octopus was pleasantly chewy and flavorful, but the pork blew me away. It was a massive cut, cooked perfectly juicy, even at medium, the flavor enhanced by the juicy peaches and savory smoked onions, among the best I have ever tasted. The owner is attentive and ready to make recommendations on the wine list, and heartily recommended my choice, a valpolicella ripasso with some age and earthy tannins that smoothed out beautifully fifteen minutes after opening. He was correct, it evoked a baby amarone, and possessed a well balanced old world style that would complement any of the meat dishes on the menu. Finally, for dessert, the chocolate budino gives any French pot de creme, whether made at my place or elsewhere, a serious run for its money. The chocolate tart is a close second, and the coffee, Metropolitan's Red Line blend, is dark and heavy but extremely well balanced. The food is complemented by an Italian bistro decor and attentive but unhurried service. For high end casual Italian fare on the North side, Anteprima is worth a visit.
