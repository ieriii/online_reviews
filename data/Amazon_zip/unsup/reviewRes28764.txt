This place deserves a 5 rating as I love the za and have been several times. However, last Saturday night I took my parents and soon-to-be inlaws for a casual dinner. We had 8:30 reservations - didn't get seated till 9:15. The temperature was about 90 degrees - come on, get some AC - its July in Chicago. Pizza was great as usual but get the service and AC to match it.
