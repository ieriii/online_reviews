My company caters from this place often. I just had it again today so I had to tell about my fantastic lunch! Today I had the turkey, cranberry & brie sandwich on multi grain bread. OMG, this sandwich was delish! It kind of reminded me of Thanksgiving with the turkey and cranberries. The brie was nice and creamy, it was a nice alternative to fatty mayo. The sandwich also came with gourmet potato chips (very crunchy and good), an apple and a HUGE dark chocolate cookie! I will be nibbling off this cookie for a couple of days because it's huge and rich. I'm also way to full to continue eating. This is a great option for office catering. Waaaaaaaaaay better than the average Corner Bakery crap that we usually have. I heart you Fox & Obel :)
