I love this place but it's typically way to packed whenever I've tried to stop by. Sometimes it gets so bad, that it's 3 to 4 people thick by the bar. The one time that I was successful in staying there was when I went in the afternoon after it opened. There were several other nice regulars at the bar as well, already, and the place had a nice, friendly vibe. The beer selection is just awesome.
