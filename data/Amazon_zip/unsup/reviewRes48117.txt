Over 1K reviews for this place. Yelpers you never steer me wrong. Everything was awesome about this place: waitress, awesome. Food, amazing, seats even better and the bestest (We sat watching the kitchen in action and it was great. We loved it), the snoop dogg cd playing in the background. Every single thing we ordered, was awesome. Especially the Suckling Pig. wow. The pork rinds. amazing. The beer selection, stellar. What can I say I am smitten with you Publican. The saddest part, that I gotta get on a plane to come here.
