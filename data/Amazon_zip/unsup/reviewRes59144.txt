We have been going to Sushi X and carrying out since they opened! We love the double stack, yellow jacket, and white tiger. Their dumplings are very good and love the spicy sauce it comes with!! Stephen, one of the managers, is great and always very kind to us. If you haven't tried it yet you must and it's BYOB!!
