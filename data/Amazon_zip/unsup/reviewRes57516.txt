Like all the other reviewers say... the dim lighting, the close quarters make this a great place to take a date. If you've never been to a fondue place before, I'd say that you should take a date here to impress him/her. But seeing as I HAVE been to a fondue place before, Geja's was just A-OK. Service... impeccable (we always felt that we were being taken care of and didn't have to wave anyone down)Food.... so-so (and that's only because I am comparing it to La Fondue in Saratoga)Ambience... romantic
