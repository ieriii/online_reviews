Edit (05-10-07): Another of my bosses brought me here for staff appreciation week this year (I see a theme) and MAN! It was just as good as I remember. I gave it the 5th star back because our waiter this time around was excellent. Cazuela de pollo. Get it (if they have it by the time you check this joint out; I noticed that the milanesa de pollo is no longer on the menu, as it was replaced with pork milanesa). You will love it. So tender, so tasty, so filling! That's my story!! ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~ Some places aren't exactly dirt cheap, but when it's a good restaurant...it doesn't matter. This place has such great food. I was taken here by 2 of my bosses for Staff Appreciation Week and man...what a way to appreciate me! By feeding me great food! We had an appetizer platter that included quesadillas, tostadas, and taquitos. They serve those up with sour cream and guacamole, making them oh-so-good. As an entree, I had the milanesa de pollo (breaded chicken) and it was to die for. They put this avocado-tomatillo sauce on it that makes the chicken taste divine! The only reason it loses a star is b/c our waitress rarely came back to check on us. When she did, she was super nice, don't get me wrong. But we were in a rush to get back to work and it would have been nice to have gotten our food and check a bit quicker. The food is excellent, though, and definately worth checking out!
