I've been a here a few times to do the tasting and once during Restaurant Week and it has never disappointed. If you are here with a group I highly recommend the tasting. It's very affordable for a "tasting," everything is served family style and you get to try almost the entire menu. Some of my favs: Fried Peppers - Really unique, I've never had anything quite like it. Arroz de Casuela - A mix between Paella and Cioppino Gambas - perfectly cooked All the meats are cooked perfectly with amazing steaks. You won't go wrong Dessert - There's one with fresh marshmallows that's to die for! Fun for groups, great for entertaining!
