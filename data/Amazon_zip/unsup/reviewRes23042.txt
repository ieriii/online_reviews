best place to take the family and after a weekend of hard work, not interested in cooking, we start mulling over where in town we can get a good meal, good service, a few drinks and a certain level of quiet and comfort. Greek Islands seems to be the consistent winner. The menu is huge and I've always found something that fits my mood. The food is fresh and prepared nicely. The service is friendly and attentive. Good wine list, and the bar pours a good drink.
