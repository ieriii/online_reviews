The hype is totally real!! The food is awesome. Try everything and you will not leave disappointed. - Chips and guac : minimal ingredients in the guac, but super flavorful - Blue shrimp torta : Yum, spicy shrimp cooked to perfection with some chilli mayo and frisee - it was gooood!!! - vegetarian torta : earthy mushrooms, perfectly tangy - churro with choc shot: this was the star, it is like heaven in your mouth yum yum yum!! I could go back everyday to just eat the churros, they were soo good. Do not leave without tasting this.
