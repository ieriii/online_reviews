Went here for my friend's birthday =D The bar was a nice spot to wait for our table (they do not sit incomplete parties). I felt like drinking a dessert wine....not being a wine connoisseur, I asked the opinion of the bartender.... She brought me some deliciousness!!!! & So did the waiter!!!! My buddies ordered some appetizers.... The Chicken skewers (Yum!) I ordered the Steak Risotto- a little salty for my taste & the steak was a little dry.... My hot date ordered the prime rib (Yum!) & we shared all of our sides "Family Style" =D Asparagus & Broccoli w/ hollandaise was ON POINT!!!! The dessert was OMG =D The Double Candied Walnut Ice Cream & the Pistachio Semifreddo did more than enough to make me forget about my steak risotto. Yes Yes Y'all....
