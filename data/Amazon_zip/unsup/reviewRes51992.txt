Good service, good food, and good times. As for the food, I have absolutely no complaints. As a tourist, there's not much more I could ask for than some awesome buttery deep dish pizza, competent hot wings, and good local brew. I'm sure it's hackneyed to the locals, but to me it was a treat and a memorable stop on our whirlwind tour of the windy city. The only negative I have about this place was that it felt like I was eating at a downtown subway stop. There is graffiti everywhere. I get that it's their thing, but it was offputting to say the least.  I eventually got over myself and had a great experience.
