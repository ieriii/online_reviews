You've heard of it. You've read about it. Now go eat it! I won't bother trying to talk it up any more. It's worth the wait in line. The foie gras hot dog is pretty good and the duck fat fries are even better. They change the menu around, so recommendations are kind of hard, but you won't be disappointed. Don't forget, CASH ONLY!
