I like this place because it has a wide selection of vegetarian and vegan food. I can't say that it is awesome because the portions are not big enough for the price. I'm well aware that vegetarian food is more expensive. I'm spoiled because I come from a town that has a wide variety if vegetarian and vegan food and they don't get to charge as much because its not a niche market. I like my fair share of fake meat and I've never really had the real thing so I don't like when food "tastes vegetarian". My point is that I eat vegetarian food all the time, and It doesn't have to lack on flavor. Its nice to go somewhere where the whole menu it catered towards your diet, however I dont need to pay more for a salad because its at a vegan restaurant. And i dont understand why the fruit shakes taste "vegany". Its fruit, its naturally raw, vegan and healthy , you dont really need to mess with that. If I'm going to pay more for my vegetarian food, I want it to be better than what I make at home.
