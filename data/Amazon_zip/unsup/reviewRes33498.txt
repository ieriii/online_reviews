We were there last weekend for a Bachelorette Party and I must say, Mia Francesca was VERY accommodating. We had 25 people, so I can imagine it would be a bit stressful. Our waiter was nice enough to separate our checks into bills of 4 people, based on who we were sitting by. This made the stress at the end of the dinner (bill splitting) MUCH easier. The menu was preselected by the MOH but the dishes all came out hot and tasty. The only reason this place doesn't get 5 stars is because of the bathroom situation- it took about 10 minutes to get in because of the single stall bathroom! Would definitely recommend for a future large group! :)
