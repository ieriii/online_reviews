I'm a bit flummoxed by the rave reviews of Frontera. When I planned a trip to chicago, it was the first place I thought of eating and while I'm often skeptical of high-end Mexican, I assumed all of the hype had to be pretty well deserved. However, our meal was passably tasty and hardly revolutionary. We started with chips, guac, and salsa. The guac was delicious, though about as good as any place that makes decent guac. Chips were too thick and lacked salt. Next, we had the tamal de birria. The tamal was very moist and had a nice corn flavor; the goat was quite goat-y. Good, but an acquired taste, and more gamy than other goat dishes. Next up, the salmon tartar with a peanut/plantain chip sauce. This dish had a distinctly odd, bordering on unpleasant flavor. The peanut sauced masked the salmon taste and I couldn't find the texture of the plantain chips. We also ordered the sopes rancheros, with short ribs. Delicious though not transcendent. The sopes were well crisped and the short ribs full of flavor. Probably the best dish of the night. Finally, we ordered the maple pork tacos. I swore I was eating chicken! We even asked the waiter, who laughed and insisted we were eating pork. He also said that people ask him this all the time. I'd say if people think your pork is chicken, you have a problem! I like my pork to taste like pork, thank you. Also, no hint at all of maple flavor. Perhaps I'm being too harsh. All in all, the meal was reasonably good with a few great moments. But overall, given the prices, the wait time, and the incredible hype, I'd say it doesn't live up. Best thing I ate in Chicago all weekend? Carne asada tacos at La Pasadita near Wicker Park & Ukranian Village.
