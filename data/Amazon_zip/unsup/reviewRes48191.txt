I wanted to love this place, and maybe my expectations were just too high. But my dinner DEFINITELY didn't live up to the hype. Pros: Scallops Asparagus Chicken (but how can you really mess up roast chicken?) Chocolate cream pie with pretzel crust- AMAZING. Best part of the meal Aged ham platter- but we asked for more bread/butter and it was never brought out Cons: Broccoli- very weird tasting... served with bitter greens of some sort Soft-shelled crab Pork rinds Service was okay... loved the communal seating and the decor. Don't think I would recommend this place though. The only awesome part of the meal worth going back for was the dessert!
