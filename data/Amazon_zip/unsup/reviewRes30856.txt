Yummy, yummy, yummy but a bit pricey, pricey, pricey. We got the seitan buffalo "wings", which were delicious and a great treat since I miss buffalo wings oh-so-much. I got the quesadilla which was pretty damn good but there was no side or anything with it. :( The BF got a reuben which was also amazing and I've never been a fan of real reubens. Overall, amazing food but it's extremely crowded so we didn't really have much of a convo going and the wait sucked but I would go back for the food in a heartbeat.
