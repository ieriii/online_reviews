Love this place. Upscale pub grub, fancified! Highlights: slow cooked shrimp, curry fries, caramelized lobster, lamb loin w/ lamb belly confit. Nice selection of spirits - one of the best. Not too many places have Plymouth gin and Yamazaki whiskey. The 18 year old Yamazaki is really delicious. Service was great. About the only downside is the cost - pretty pricey!
