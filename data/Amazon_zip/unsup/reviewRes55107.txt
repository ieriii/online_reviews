Went there last night at 6 pm and we were seated right away, although they asked us to leave the table by 7:15 for an incoming reservation. That didn't bother me, though - I like it when restaurants are respectful of reservations. Food was great! We started with balsamic glazed garlic and ciabatta and it was DELICIOUS! We shared the raw beet salad - yummy! My husband had the pot roast and he really liked it. I had the egg sandwich - it was so heavy and rich that it got kinda goopy. The frites were nice, but would be better if they were a little thinner.I had the Pimm's Cup cocktail and it was awesome, while my husband got the $2 glass of PBR. We'll be back!
