I used to love this place, but my two most recent (and last) visits made me not like it anymore. we ordered the spicy pan fried pork (along with other dishes) and my boyfriend and i got sick of it. we are pretty sure it was that pork dish, because it tasted a little different than usual. definately not going back.
