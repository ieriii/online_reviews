The James Hotel is wonderful in every sense of the word. The staff are all amazingly friendly, helpful and generally really happy! The place is pet friendly and that is a huge plus. My girlfriend and i own a dog who goes a lot of places with us. The James is not just pet tolerant but they are happy tha tyou brought your four legged family members along (see the water and treats by the entrance!) the decor is modern but comfortable. the food is amazing. The location is unbeatable. you can get to the Loop, River north and every place you want to go quite easily. The prices were all good - i had expected a larger tab for a hotel in the heart of Chicago but was pleasantly surprised!
