Dear Sultans Market, Um, when did you start hiring stoners? I'm not expecting a genius level IQ behind the counter but it would be nice if you could hire someone who could remember what I said 5 seconds ago. And....your lamb shwarma tasted like and had the consistency of tire shrapnel. I bet your stoner employees left it cooking for too long while they were getting "baked" in the alley. Also, next time I'm in the mood for incredibly watery tasteless vegetable salad I'll remember to order your jerusalem salad. I used to love you and now I loathe you.
