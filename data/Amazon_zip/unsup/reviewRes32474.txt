I went to Sunda last weekend for a birthday party and my overall experience of the restaurant was forgettable. I will say that they did allow us to sit at our table even though we were still waiting for 4 people for our party of 10. we started with drinks which were a little priced, $10 for vodka/soda. Okay. We ordered food and between my husband and I, we split 4 items. (Edemame, Duck Bao Buns, Ultimate hand roll and the Buddha rice w/tuna) Other than the Buddha Rice, everything else was nothing special. Even the Buddha rice wasn't anything I'd go back for, it was just the best thing out of the stuff we had. Overall, for the price we paid, quality of food, serving sizes and service, I'd don't think I'd come back. I found myself wanting a burrito to satisfy my tummy after. The place is very nice and trendy, so maybe I'd come for a drink or two just to people watch. But for food, there are way better options in the neighborhood.
