The interior is gaudy as hell. Everything is bedazzled and/or gold. It has a Jewish grandma meets Elton John vibe going on that goes perfectly with the rhinestone studded fanny packs donned by the tourists who stop in. The menu has a lot of options but the food is pretty average. The portions are huge, the servers have always been nice and helpful and the prices are good considering one meal can feed a small family for the day. Meh.
