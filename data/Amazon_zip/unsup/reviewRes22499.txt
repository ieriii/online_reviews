This place has pretty solid reviews, which I think it deserves. It's a Chinatown establishment. I went for their hot pot; all-you-can-eat for 16 bucks, which I think is a really good deal if you're a fat-ass like me. They have two soups to choose from--MaLa (spicy) and the bland one. You can also get a soup base which is half MaLa, half bland. In that event, they give you a pot that is shaped like a yin-yang with an s-shaped metal divider separating the two soups. I dig kitsch. I've been there before for dishes, and the spicy boiled beef and dry fried chicken with chili are amazing! I think the true test for a Sichuan restaurant are the Dandan Noodles. For that, I give them a passing grade. Tsingtao Beers are 5 bucks; they have a bunch of Japanese beers like Sapporo that are only $4. Not sure why I remember that, but though I would throw that out. To add to the authenticity, there were shoe prints on the toilet seat where some Chinese guy squatted on the toilet seat, choosing not to sit. Just like a trip to China without 16 hours of rude flight attendants! The only bad part is that the service is horrendous. The waitress will not check up on you at all, so you literally need to flag her down for everything you need. It is pretty disappointing that a restaurant so famous in Chicago would not do a better job training their staff. I do think the waitresses are nice people and hard working. But it's the restaurant management that needs to be more organized.
