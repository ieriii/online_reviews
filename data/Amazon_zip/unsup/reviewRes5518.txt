This place is excellent. I love the atmosphere, the decor, the staff is incredibly friendly and knowledgeable and, of course, I LOVE the food. Everything I've ever had here has been amazing(and my friends and I really like this place, so we go very often) My favorite thing about the Purple Pig is that because of tapas style, I get to try things like pig tail and pig feet without having to spend a lot of money on it, in case I don't care for the taste. But however the chef cooks it, it tastes great. Favorite items are the beet and goat cheese salad, white bait, pig neck bone gravy, the house made greek sausage(the grapes are what make this dish scrumptious) and the shaved brussel sprout salad(which is seasonal) You can't go wrong with any dish you order, though. Everything is delicious!
