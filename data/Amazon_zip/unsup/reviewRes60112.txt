The food and the service here is great! I always get the large Tank special and my girlfriend usually gets the watercress soup. Both are seriously delicious. Yes, because the place is so good that there are times you will have to wait. Not to worry because if you don't mind sharing a table the turnaround is quick. Btw... stay away from the pig feet and pig blood soup. A lot of people like it but it just didn't do it for me.
