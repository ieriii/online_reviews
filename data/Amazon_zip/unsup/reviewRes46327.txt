I have been here a few times and I must say the service is ok....In many ways....But the food has just gone down hill but this last trip it was bad....I ate three bites of my food and I get two things what else can I say...It was strange the server said very little to me after he saw I did not eat.  I guess over time it is hard to stay good. Becasue my last meal there and at chessecake have not been good
