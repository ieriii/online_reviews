As a man in constant search of the IDEAL falafel sandwich, I have to say that Sultan's is good, but not great and certainly not as good as other places in the Chicago area. I've noticed, each ingredient in and of itself is nothing special, but as a complete sandwich it's pretty solid and very reasonably priced at $3.26. So, if you're on a budget, it's all that much more delicious. After years of eating here I've started going for the curry rice and lentil soup instead of the falafel sandwich. Both are equally inexpensive and delicious. In the past few years this place has clearly been unearthed by the masses as it is crowded almost every time I go in. However, the staff is rad, the food is pretty good and the prices are great.
