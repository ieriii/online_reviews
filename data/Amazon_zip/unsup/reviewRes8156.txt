I'd been dying to try this place for a while now and finally made it up there. Very close to the Montrose Brown line stop- it was not hard to get to at all. With two people, we only had to wait about 15 minutes at 8:00 pm on a Friday. Not bad. We ordered the prosciutto and arugula salad which was great...it could have used a little lemon juice as it only had a tiny drizzle of olive oil and most of the arugla was comletely undressed. But fresh and delicious so it was ok. We ordered 2 pizzas and left nothing on the plate- one with mushrooms and sausage- the italian sausage was so so good, and one margherita of course. We loved it...the bottom was paper thin, so thin it's pretty much impossible to eat without a fork and knife, but it didn't leave me feeling like I had a huge ball of dough in my stomach. Key here is super fresh ingredients, yum!
