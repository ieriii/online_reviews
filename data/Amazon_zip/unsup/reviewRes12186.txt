Divine, from start to finish. After a second meal here, I feel like I can truly give this place five stars. The service is fabulous, attentive, and considerate (and not pushy at all). Recommendations are forthcoming, refills are prompt...wonderful. Drinks are wonderful. Try the standard mojito (delightful), the mojito martini...all sorts of wine (the Cava is wonderful by the glass, as is the Malbec). It's all perfect for the Latin fare. And the food is heaven. Starting with soft chewy bread and the delicious butter...I don't even know what's in there, but I want to ask for more and more and shove my purse with it...I want to take it home and eat it all week. OK, I'd even want to have little Cafe 28 butter babies. Disgusting? Yes, but true. I'm not ashamed. Goat cheese dip? Yum. Ceviche? Try it. The Taste of Cuba is a fantastic appetizer with plantain chips, empanadas, and croquettas...get it. You won't be disappointed. I enjoyed the almond crusted tilapia...it was divine. I seriously almost licked my plate. Thought about it...decided against it...but still thought about it again. SO. GOOD. Very accessible...even moreso when the Irving Park brown line stop opens back up. Prices are reasonable. Great for a date, great for girls' dinner, great for family. I can't wait to come back!
