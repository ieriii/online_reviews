I've been here twice, my last visit was on Valentine's Day and it was exceptional! My hubby and I walked in with no reservation, and we were seated at the back bar next to the kitchen. At first we were like, "Did they really seat us by the kitchen, behind the desert bar?" But this turned out to be the very best seat in the house! It's very warm and cozy because you are right by the stoves/ovens. It's very close to the harvest table. The staff were really personable - we asked them questions, they answered and asked us what we especially liked to eat and so that it came around to us more often than the other choices. The drinks! Oh wow! The spice/fruit is marinated in the liquor which creates an infused blend of aromatherapy & flavor! My words can't describe how good they are. My favorite is the Cranberry Spiced Old Fashioned because it tastes like Christmas in a glass!  Oh, I forgot, the tuna is also very fresh and excellently prepared. They have great non-red meat options, and the cheeses are fantabulous.
