My new husband and I made the best decision EVER when we decided to take our immediate family to Mia's after our wedding ceremony. It definitely helped that it was the perfect weather day...we were able to sit on the back patio eat our appetizers and sip our wine in the sun before retreating into the precious little private coach house for the rest of our meal. I would suggest this to everyone!!! If you have a small party of 25 or less that you want to take out for an amazing family style dinner - this is the place to go. Guaranteed my family will be raving about this for years to come.  The coach house has a little bar in it also.  The staff was impeccable - They were at your service at every moment. The food is what really blew us all away though... each course that came out was seriously perfect... and because it's family style, you don't have to stuff yourself silly (well, you could).. but it's really nice to sample all the food, and then at the end you still have room for tirimisu (which is light and fluffy) I could go on and on....but you get the point. A+
