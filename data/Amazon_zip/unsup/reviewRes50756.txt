Chicago has a wide range of comfort/soul food joints, places from the divey to the sublime. Wishbone capitalizes on this in a variety of good dishes and sides. That said, its clear they have some issues with their success, namely in the execution at this particular location. While I think the West Loop location pretty much nails everything, I've always been disappointed by this Wishbone on Lincoln. The tastes aren't as bright, the grease seems heavier, and the presentation lacks any inspiration. Is it because of the huge dining room thats constantly full of young families? Or is it that West Loop diners have more aggressive restauranteurs vying for their dollars? Whatever it is, and as much as I dig Wishbone... this location only gets a pass from me. I really don't mind lots of kids in an establishment, but I do mind what that does to the kitchen staff. Go to any big restaurant in the 'burbs to see what I mean. Things just get blandified cuz the youngin's aren't ready for a full-flavored palette. OK this is just my theory, but name me one family-friendly restaurant you'd go just because the food is that great? I mean regarding taste, huge portions don't signifiy greatness. Anyway, Wishbone is a great Chicago establishment, and I wish them continued success... but when I need my fix I'll make sure to visit the West Loop location.
