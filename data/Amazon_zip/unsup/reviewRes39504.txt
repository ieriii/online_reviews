No frills, but the food is delicious and WORTH the wait, the smoke and the mediocre service. I should mention we had someone who could mostly speak the language and it was STILL mediocre service. Honestly we enjoyed the food so much and had so much fun we didn't even notice :) Now, I've been to one other BBQ place a few years ago, and this place was definitely better. The grill was larger and cleaner and the meats were higher quality. We had a noodle dish as well as 4 BBQ entrees to share amongst a table of 5 and it was a TON of food. Great value!  Parking is VERY limited, and if you go at a busy time you may be waiting an hour to get in. So just be warned.
