Loved everything about this place, right down to the plates that made me feel like I was in my grandmother's kitchen in the country. Clearly the designers have a good sense of humor to create booths that simulate being in a pig pen with large wooden doors that enclose around you. Loved the lighting and the clean simple designs in the place. I'll keep this short and sweet but if there's a "must try" list, obviously you gotta go for the pork belly.
