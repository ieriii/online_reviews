My friend and I went here on Saturday for brunch. We arrived at around 10:30 am and we were told there would be a 45 minute wait. Not too bad. We just went across the street to Pitaya, dropped some cash, came back, and our table was ready! The food: AWESOME. One of the best brunch places I've ever been to in Chicago, and I've been to a lot. I had the vegetarian croissant with basil mayo. I don't even like mayo, but I couldn't stop eating, even when I was full. It was that good. Everything comes out looking delicious. I haven't had a chance to try their pancakes yet, but I almost leaped at the plate of toffee/banana pancakes sitting on an adjacent table. Also, a big plus that their menu is seasonal. It shows they use the freshest, local ingredients (I hope). The place was extremely crowded, so expect a wait. Even though the male host rudely laughed in my face when, after about 45 minutes, I asked "Do you know how much longer the wait is?", I'll let it slide...
