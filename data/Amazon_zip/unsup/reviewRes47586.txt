The food is delicious and it has a great atmosphere. I like a good Brazilian steakhouse...but not as much as my boyfriend. This is the perfect place because it has all of the red meat that he loves, but it also has chicken, pork, and seafood options. Everything we have had there has been amazing. I also love the fact that they have a bus that you can schedule to pick you up and take home...for free! They also have an beautiful rooftop deck. It's a great place to grab drinks in the summer. I would definitely recommend this place!
