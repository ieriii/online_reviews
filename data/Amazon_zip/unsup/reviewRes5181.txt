Tasty tasty! Portions seem really tiny because it's tapas style, but we ordered 5 dishes for two people, and we were more than satisfied. We got an antipasti dish of tuna in olive oil. It was actually pretty delicious, considering it only consisted of tuna, olive oil, and beans. Very herbaceous tasting. We ordered the bone marrow smear. It was super interesting; definitely something you should try. It comes out legit inside a bone, so once you get past freaking out about it, it's actually pretty good. A very subtle taste. The bread was really good too. We also got the pigs ear. It was fried and very flavorful. Kind of reminded me of fried soft shell crab. The clams were whatever. Should have just gone with another pork dish. JLT- Soooo delicious! Seriously a party in my mouth. It was a huge burst of flavor. Very tasty, but I dont think I could have eaten a whole order by myself, which is good cause it's tapas style and meant to be shared! The egg matches so well with the pork and tomatoes. The tomatoes were awesome!! SO sweet! And the ham was like melt in my mouth tender and flavorful.
