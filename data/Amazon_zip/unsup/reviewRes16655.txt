We went to dinner at Carnivale on Christmas day and spent the last 10 minutes of our meal deciding how we would rate our dining experience. It was a battle between 4 and 5 stars... I feel like it should be 4 stars, but then what could they have done better to be 5? We ordered the Churrasco and Bistek Palomilla and both were delicious. The meat was cooked perfectly to our liking. The sauces and serving sizes were just right. The service was agreeable with the waitress checking in timely. The drinks are kid-sized so keep that in mind when you go. Food = 5 star. Decor is Latin-Kitch. Not bad, but not clean cut however it suits the atmosphere they're trying to create. Dinner for 3 consisted of 1 appetizer, an Entree each and a dessert (brownie..mmm) to share plus drinks came to $160. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed my experience and will definately be dining here again. I can't put my finger on why I can't give this place 5 stars... maybe it just missed the wow factor that I believe it's capable of.
