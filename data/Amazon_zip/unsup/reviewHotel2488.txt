Not sure we would have been quite as happy paying full price, but our $89 bid (for a Saturday night!) on Priceline made it worth it. According to the front desk, for $25 extra we could have snagged a lake view. Parking was ridiculous at the hotel ($45 for 24hrs) so we opted to park in a surface lot behind the hotel on Wabash for $25/24hrs. The only downfall is that you can't move your car in and out. Was just fine with us as we relied on pubic transportation anyway. Cab was $7 for 2 of us to get to the river for the Architectural cruise (at least a 20" walk) and $12 one way to get to Second City. Not bad. The room was small, but clean. Outdated, as others had posted. Pool looked really nice although we didn't have time to try it out. Did not try the hotel restaurants either- opted for Chicago fare w/ a dog at Portillos, and deep dish pizza from Giordanos. Location-wise, it's quite a hike from Magnificent Mile shopping, but do-able if you have the time.
