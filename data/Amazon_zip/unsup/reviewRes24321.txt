Love Irazu...the food is so delicious, huge, reasonably priced...the atmosphere is casual and fun and the service is perfect. The oatmeal shakes are to die for...also, try a chocolate corn meal shake if you are in the mood for chocolate. The Chifrijo (Black bean dip mixed with fried pork and sauteed veggies served with chips) is amazing! For an entree I have had both the veggie burrito and a garlic shrimp/veggie plate (on the specials at the time)...both were really tasty!
