Nothing special here, just a modern, commercialized-feeling breakfast place in a high-traffic area. Took forever to get a table and we were seated RIGHT next to the window where we had to watch all the hungry people waiting and staring at us :) A decent breakfast but would much rather go to Nookie's (Lincoln Park) if I'm going to wait that long.
