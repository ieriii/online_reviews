Came here for brunch and loved it. I highly recommend it to anyone who visits Chicago and wants to get out of the downtown area. They start you off with complimentary beignets--fresh out of the fryer and topped with powder sugar. WHAT A TREAT! Eggs new orleans--very good, the crab cakes are not as thick as I expected but they were full of flavor. I realized that there was very little bread crumbs and other filling in the cakes---it was all about the crab. the popover in which the crab cake and egg sits is a nice alternative to the traditional english muffin. and the creamy cheese grits--YUM. Gumbo ya ya--it was NOT the envisioned tomato-based shrimp gumbo. It was chicken and their homemade andouille sausage in a dark, smoky roux. Delicious with a spicy kick to it. I had never had anything like it, and i LOVED it. impeccable service!
