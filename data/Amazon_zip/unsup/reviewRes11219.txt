One of the best places to go for breakfast in the city. The food is simply amazing. The menu has plenty of mouth watering items to choose from. The wait is not that bad. 20 to 30 minutes is the average wait time.  The Eggs Benedict are extraordinary. You cant go wrong. I have had them multiple times, each time a different type. Excellent choice no matter which one you choose. The coconut pancakes are also a great choice. They were a little to sweet for me, but everyone else loved them.  Make sure to get a bloodymary if you like them. They come spicy with a skewer full of stuff.
