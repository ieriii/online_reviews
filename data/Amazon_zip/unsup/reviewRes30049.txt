Quality is 50/50. DON'T get the pork chops! The pie isn't very good either. Ice cream and brownies are decent though. If it gets busy enough it gets terribly noisy. Sometimes there are live performers, which can be good or bad. Staff is generally nice, but there a few bad apples. Very busy at breakfast and weekends! edit: I went here last night again. I've learned NEVER order anything but sandwiches here; which isn't my ideal restaurant experience anyway. And I though it was funny that a (literally) can of soda was 2 dollars. People say they dont take reservations, but the restaurant was closed recently for a large party for two hours, so I'm pretty sure they do.
