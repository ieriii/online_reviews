UPDATE: The management contacted me and I have consistently received correct change or change rounded in my favor for the past month. I'm upping them to 4 stars as a result. --------- It appears that the Pasta Bowl has run out of coins. For weeks on end, my servers have rounded the bill UP--sometimes by well more than 50 cents. A $14.35 lunch bill? I received $5 change for a $20. $29.45? We got $10 back. This practice really, really pissed me off. If your establishment doesn't have change, round the price DOWN to the next dollar. Stiff yourself, don't stiff your customers. And, of course, after ripping us off, the server has the gall to give all $1 bills as change...so we can more easily tip them for kicking us in the nuts. I let it slide the first time, but I asked for correct change the next three times and the servers' responses would lead you to believe that I had asked for their first born. They slumped off to the cashier because "that guy"--said with an eye roll over the shoulder--expects semi-accurate change.  I wonder how much extra money is in the till every night as a result of rounding up? 200 checks X 35 cents rounding per check. That's $70 a day going into the pocket of someone other than the customers. I'm confident the servers would be concerned if the owners rounded their paychecks down a few bucks. This practice is just plain rude.
