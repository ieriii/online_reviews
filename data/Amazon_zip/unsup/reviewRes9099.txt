Yum, absolutely delicious! I received a gift card from my wedding and took a friend here in my (poor shellfish allergic) husband's place. I wasn't sure where to start on the lengthy menu, so I asked our waiter for her top eats. She did not disappoint. Everything was scrumptious from the fresh shrimp spring rolls to the bouillabaisse saffron seafood stew with vermicelli and the tender beef filet cubes with sweet potatoes and green beans. Sigh.. I ate so much I could barely breathe. Darn those skinny jeans! The cocktails were incredible, effervescent, and refreshing. I had one mingled with cucumber, basil, and pear while my friend had a delectable pineapple concoction. My only complaints are the tables are teeny tiny and you have to maneuver around the plates scattered about, they rush you, and the busboys don't communicate with each other and ask you every few minutes if you're done eating. If not for that, the dining was delicious. My friend has been there twice before but ordered "safely" and said none of her visits had been that incredible. Try #40, the bouillabaisse!
