Delicious food. I have been here several times and continue to bring family and friends here. They also have the best mojitos I have ever had! They have a patio in the back which is nice when it's warm out. The only thing I wasn't as crazy about was the brunch. Maybe it was just what I ordered, but I've tried many of the entrees off the dinner menu and have never been disappointed.
