This pizza is a cheese lovers dream!! My friends and I ordered delivery which took about an hour but was well worth the wait. My guy friends, being the canavores they are, went with the meaty delight pan pizza and a thin crust canadien bacon. For me, the meaty was a little overboard when they add sliced beef in the mix w/ sausage, bacon, pepperoni, and God knows what else. But, like I said, the cheese was overabundant as well, which was well needed to compliment the meat. The thin crust was just okay. Over all, the meat, cheese, and sauce was excellent. The crust fell a bit short for me, as I thought it was a bit doughy. Perhaps it was just b/c of delivery that might have softened it up a bit, but I will definitely be eating here again sometime in the near future.
