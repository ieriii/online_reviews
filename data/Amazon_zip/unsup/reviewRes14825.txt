Today, my boyfriend wanted to have Cuban food and I said sure why not. So, were driving down Milwaukee and we came across 90miles. We walk in and were standing by the counter for roughly 5mins and if it wasn't for me asking the counter girl who do we talk to, to have a seat to I don't think anyone would've acknowledged us. She comes around the counter and asks how many? I told her 2, I ask her roughly how long the wait was. She says 30mins, it was 8:30 when she said 30mins. It was me and 2 other 2 people parties. 30mins later we see a lot of people leaving along with a few parties that left in the front end of the restaurant. No one came to seat along with people who came in after us who were 2 people parties were seated before us. My boyfriend goes up to one of the waiters and explains to him look we've been waiting for 40mins already people who came in after us were seated before us. The waiter then became ignorant and irritated because my boyfriend confronted him on the issue. He called another waiter to seat us when we get to the back room there were a lot of tables that were open. We get to our table and a busboy brought us water and we ended up sitting there for 30mins and again people who came in after us were already getting their order taken. When we have been sitting at that table for 30mins and not even a server came and asked us if we wanted to order anything to drink. This place is HORRIBLE ON SERVICE. No one ever came to our table to take any kind of order. So, we weren't even able to order any of this SO-CALLED good food. We just got up and walked the hell on out of there. They need to fix their service and not judge people.
