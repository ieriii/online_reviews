Went there last night for a bite with friends. Tried it once before it was remodeled. Nice changes. Recommend better seating through the hostess. Was in line waiting for a table for 4. People came in after us and got seated. She seated a table of 4 at a 6 top. She seated a party of 6 at a 6 topper. Not once was there an explanation. Frustrating! Total wait time 18 minutes while there were open tables. Really need to improve the manner in which people are seated. The food and Grand Manier Margaritas, excellent! Service was good too once we were seated. Will return and hopefully my frustration with seating will be resolved..
