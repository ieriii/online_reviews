The BEST RESTAURANT in China town that I have ever experience, although it can be a little pricey for China Town's standard but the food is good. My All time favorite everytime I go there is the "Steamed Fish", the fish is sooo freshhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!! Love it Love ittttt.... I have never tried their Hot Pot though, but from the looks of it.. everyone seems to be enjoying it. Would try it next time if I can resist my Steamed Fish temptations. :P
