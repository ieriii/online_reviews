I don't know what's going on, but I've been here 3 times and every time the food was awful. I left a review before and now its the last straw. I like Vietnamese food, but not this place. Flavors are bland, the snapper was transformed to dry jerky, the pho was a tasteless broth with gristle in it but no meat or anything palatable, the place wasn't the cleanest, and the service was mediocre to bad. I am really baffled by why this place gets such good reviews. I gave it 3 chances, and it failed, failed and failed. I can only assume that everyone who likes it is just a bunch of bandwagoners, like so many Chicagoans and Midwesterners (yes, my people. my own people!) are. Alas.
