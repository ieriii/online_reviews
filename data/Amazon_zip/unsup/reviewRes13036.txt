Had dinner here during Restaurant Week..was not disappointed. The service was very good and attentive..esp the gauchos. They swarmed us when we flipped our cards over and had every variety of meat at our disposal. The salad bar was more like tapas in that there were lots of cold meats, cheeses and marinated vegetables like heart of palm and artichoke hearts. Very nice tho to start off with. The meats tho were tasty but just a bit too salty for me, but had I asked I could have had a choice between the meats grilled w rock salt and w/out..so no fault of the restaurant. Def should go there once to try the experience and spend a few minutes watching the wine aerial acrobatic ladies hoisted abt while grabbing bottles of wine for you.
