Maybe I ordered the wrong food but this place did not do the trick for me.  In summary - GO ELSEWHERE. There are many other non-white-table-cloth places with authentic Vietnamese foods waaay better than Le Colonial. Try going up to Argyle and try Hai Yen. And as the waitress explained to us - it's not French Vietnamese - it's Vietnamese plated with French style...wtf So what did I eat that I liked? Pho. You can't mess this classic up. What was ok? Cha Gho, decently edible, nothing to rave about. What I hated: Ga Xao Xa Ot -- aka Lemon grass chicken and portobello with basil. That was probably the worst "fine dining" dish I have ever eaten in my life. Overly salted, lacked refinement. I wouldn't even pay $5 in an asian buffet to eat this. So - moral of the story is: go some where else and STOP eating here just because it's in a pretentious area and has a fancy name. This is NOT a place for true food lovers.
