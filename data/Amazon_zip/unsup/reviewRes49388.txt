Fellow wino's like myself will enjoy Bin 36. They not only have an awesome selection of wines, but their food is great as well. In addition, their staff is extremely helpful when it comes to finding a wine you like. A few weeks ago they introduced my friend & I to a sparkling dessert wine, which I believe may be the best wine I've ever had. Although I can't remember the name, I look forward to going back to try it again. My only complaint is that I noticed our bottle of wine cost $30 when the retail value of the bottle (at Bin 36) was only $13. I'm not sure if it's common for wine bars to mark up the prices this much? Edit 10/7/07: Had my engagement party here last night and thought the venue did a fabulous job. I worked with their events coordinator, Elizabeth, who was an absolute pleasure to work with! The room upstairs is very spacious- perfect for a group between 50-100 people. My one complaint was that the service was a little on the slow side (my mom had to keep telling them they needed to get the appetizers out faster), but besides that this is a lovely spot to throw a party!
