I think it's safe to say that with good pizza & beer at place like Piece you have to be prepared to wait. I'm not going to lower my rating over the wait because it was expected. I love this place- the pizza is amazing! The crust is thin and there are plenty of toppings to pick from. There is a wide variety of beers. Also, the service was very good considering the crowd. Our server was polite and checked in frequently. Definitely coming back!
