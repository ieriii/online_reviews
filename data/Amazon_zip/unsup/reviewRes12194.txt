oh my lord. this pizza is amazing. greasy, but amazing. pricey, but amazing. i just couldn't get enough of it. the waiter told me and my [one] friend to get a medium if we were really hungry and a small if we were only kind of hungry. we opted with the medium, and when it came we thought the guy was crazy thinking that any two girls could finish HALF of that even if they were starved. BUT upon the first piece, we just couldn't stop. We ate way more than we thought we would, and then had some to take home.! The only down is that it's very crowded and you can hear surrounding conversations better than who's sitting across the table.
