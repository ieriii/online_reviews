Ok I have been coming here for over 4 years and it is the best beer bar in the city! (yes thats right, way better than the Map Room, Beer Bistro, Clark Street Ale House...etc). The awesome thing about Hopleaf is not only do they have an amazing beer selection, excellent service but their food is spectacular. The mussels are a must try as well as the duck ruben. Everything I have ordered her has always been top notch and so good. If you want a great experience, try new unique beers you cant get anywhere else and have great food this place is one you need to try. You will not be let down!
