The first time I visited with a large raucous group of friends, and another with the hubby for our Anniversary dinner, and this place was perfect for both occasions. The dishes that really stood out for me were the grilled octopus with green beans and fingerlings, the fried pig's ear with crispy kale and a runny fried egg, the roasted bone marrow, and the white bean spread.  I also love the beer and wine options, which veer heavily towards small(er)-production European options. While normally I go for deeper, spicy reds, I asked the waitress to choose a tasty rose for me, and the French one she suggested--Whispering something--was complex and refreshing and not too sweet...perfect for the scorcher of a day we went on. This place is a bit of a splurge for us, but in all honesty, I didn't feel like anything was overpriced for the outstanding quality of the food. The portions were definitely not skimpy, either, considering that this is a tapas-style joint. I can't wait to return, for either a fun date night or a special occasion!
