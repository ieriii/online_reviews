Booked this hotel using Priceline's Negotiator app. Payed less than $100 all in. Great deal, clean room. The only thing that sucks is parking. It was $52 at the hotel and there's a lot (that's almost impossible to find) nearby that's $32. But you have to expect that you're going to pay that much for overnight parking downtown in any major city
