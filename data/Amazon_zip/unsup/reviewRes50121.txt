This joint's a prime example of the "New Wicker Park" vibe that's creeping in (and raising rents), but I figured I'd try it before I hated it. Color me impressed!  Sports bars blasting Cubs games are not exactly my idea of fun, but there was ample outdoor seating and it's right around the corner from my house. My friend and I were greeted by a friendly waiter who cracked jokes with us the whole time. When we sat down there was probably only one or two other tables, but by the time we left it looked like there was a wait. Our server (didn't catch his name) was terrific at handling the quick rush. The cocktails we ordered were DELICIOUS. I had some pink berry thing (it was a few weeks ago - I forgot the name) and my friend had this sugar and .... cinnamon(?) rimmed concoction and proclaimed it was made from "sweet, tiny babies" - because it was so good. Our goal was just to split some appetizers, have a couple fru-fru drinks and bask in the sun. Mission:Accomplished. Our appetizers were fantastic. The bruschetta was fresh and the nachos - man..... WIN! There was cheese sauce AND melted shredded cheddar (I hate those nachos that are only topped with shredded, oily cheddar).  Here's the thing - EVERYTHING I saw come out of that kitchen looked absolutely terrific. I even asked the girls next to us what they were having. Normally I'd feel more comfortable next door at Small bar, but this "yuppie douchebag" bar exceeded my expectations.  I'll be back for a real meal, for sure.
