The only reason I'm giving this 4 stars, is because I haven't actually eaten at Piece and have only had their take-out. I will gladly update this after eating in the restaurant, but so far, Piece is hands-down the best thin crust pizza I've had in Chicago. Take out service is quick and easy. We called in an order on Saturday night on our way home, and though the restaurant was absolutely packed (they were running an hour wait for tables), the side entrance for take-out orders was painless and the pizza was ready right on time. We got a large, which is gigantic, and the crust was perfectly thin and crispy all the way through. Unlike many thin crust pizza joints who cut the pizza into little squares, Piece's crust is so crispy, they are able to cut it in regular triangular slices, and not a single bit was floppy. We went with light cheese and extra sauce with added toppings of goat cheese and onions. Absolutely delicious and the best part was that it was just as delicious when we ate the leftovers the next day. This pizza is not cheap, but it's worth every penny.
