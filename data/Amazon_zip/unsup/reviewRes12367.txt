Wow - 703 reviews? I'm guessing that's about how many people were jammed in there when I met some friends here last weekend. The pizza is OK, not the super thin and crispy crust I am a fan of but solid flavors for sure. The communal tables, crowded and loud atmosphere is definitely not what I seek out but it seems to work for the eclectic crowd there. One note, I thought the crappy wine was overpriced for what it was.
