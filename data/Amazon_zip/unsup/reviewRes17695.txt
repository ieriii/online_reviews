Went for the buffet. The food was phenomenal, the service and selection were great. Plenty of vegetarian options, but also plenty of chicken dishes, some lamb and fish too. The tandoori chicken that they bring to your table is fantastic! Three desert options: all were very good. My only complaint is that it's a little too pricey. But I'll still go back because it's within walking distance, I love Indian food, and I can definitely eat $15 worth of food.
