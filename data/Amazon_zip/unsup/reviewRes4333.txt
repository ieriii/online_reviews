Al Capone, John Cusack, Frank Sinatra, many more. This place has seen some real characters in its day. Nothing more to say that anyone else hasn't said. Sit in the curved booth against the wall in the middle, this is "Uncle Al's" old seat. So that him and his men could watch both doors in case of an ambush. The only beef I have with this place is the fact that it's almost impossible to get into on weekends. But such is the nature of the beast; we all knew gentrification would hit Uptown sooner or later.
