This is one of the better tapas places ive been to in chicago. almost everything we ate here was excellent. the squash dumplings were especially excellent. The only complaint is that its a fairly expensive place and the service is only ok (waiter partially spilled my drink and never came to clean it up). But overall this place was very good.
