And yet again, Dale delivers perfection. This was my second tasting of an octopus prepared by this man, and I cannot believe we are not located right by the ocean where it came from. Unbelievably amazing. My second time eating his rabbit, prepared differently than the first, and more amazing happened. Then, came corn. Ice cream, caramel, popcorn, and every childhood memory of a carnival and every adult taste bud were brought to life. I just love this place. I can't wait to do brunch!
