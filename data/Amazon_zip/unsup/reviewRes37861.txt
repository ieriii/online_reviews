Didn't live up to the hype. Wanted to try this "world famous deep dish pizza" since it's so popular. It did nothing for me, I only finished the pizza because I paid for it but I didn't really like it at all. Good pizza is so hard to find. The place was also very crowded and there was a long wait...I wouldn't recommend the spot but if someone just wanted to experience it I wouldn't downgrade it or anything. My response would be..."well it's different but try it for yourself".
