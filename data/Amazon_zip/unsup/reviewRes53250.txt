I love this place! The owners have done an amazing job rennovating the old BBQ place that used to be there. The atmosphere is pleasant with seating inside, on the patio outside, or in the enclosed patio out back. The servers are always friendly and helpful. Most importantly, the food is fantastic. I haven't had a bad meal here yet. I especially love the Guajirito and the yuca frita. I'm so glad this is right down the street from my house.
