If I had to go to any bar on any given night, Hopleaf would be my number one choice. Besides the fabulous selection of import beers where I was introduced to and fell in love with Delirium Tremens (goblet of Belgian, strong blonde ale with excellent balance of sweet & dry for $7), it's also a great place to catch up with old friends. Yes, it's a small place, but there's difference between small & crowded versus small & intimate. Definitely the latter. A great place with the perfect ambiance for interventions and political debates...or even just to exchange day-to-day adventures. My friend tried the Mead the last time I was there, which they serve in double-shot glass. I tried it...and wanted to throw up. It wasn't really my style. Extremely thick with a really strong cinnamon flavor. But I did enjoy the fact that they offered it! Scored me 2 personal adventure points for trying.  Another time I tried the CB&J (house-made cashew butter, fig jam & morbier cheese on super-buttery, pan-fried, sour-dough bread) which was served with Stilton mac & cheese and house-made potato chips. The sandwich, was interesting. I loved every ingredient inside of it...I just wasn't sure if I liked them all together. It was too confusing, I practically had to stuff down the half I was eating. The mac & cheese was a little too bland, and potato chips were too salty. I'm still not very sure if I enjoyed that $10 meal, but I loved the fact I had the guts to try it. Definitely a place to be when you want to try new things. As Patricia Alexander once said: "Fear paralyzes. Curiosity empowers. Be more interested than afraid." .
