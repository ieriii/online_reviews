Been here several times now and the servers have always been nice, though they need work as far as having someone pay attention to you when you walk in the door - it is always a bit awkward. The veggie chili is delicious and perfectly spicy. Nachos were delicious as well. Veggie burger, was pretty mediocre unfortunately.... I can think of many places where they are far better (Leona's, Wishbone). You would think a veggie burger would be a specialty here, apparently not. Chicken Parmesan sandwich was also quite good, the faux chicken is awesome.
