Food was very well prepared, service was mediocre. The menu is daunting at more than 300 items, so if you don't know your way around, less likely to enjoy the experience. Took two newcomers to Indian food and so we tried several dishes. All were very good. Chicken tikka masala, lamb pasanda, lamb vindaloo, tandoori mixed grill (a little pricy, but good). Waiter was knowledgeable and attentive, but didn't seem interested in explaining anything or helping new guests enjoy the experience, seemed to have an attitude, spoke softly, and never smiled once. Extensive wine list with options for all tastes. Overall would recommend based on good food, and likely to return, though not before trying other places that might have better servers.
