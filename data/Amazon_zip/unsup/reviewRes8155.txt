Wow! This place is like meat heaven. I mean like,meat, meat, and more meat. I have to take a two day meat break. I don't want to see any meat right now. I really had a nice time at this place, the meat was seasoned just right, not too salty like Texas de Brazil. The salad bar items was so fresh, I could have gotten full from salads alone. You guys have to try the coleslaw, and don't forget a lemonade. It was pretty crowded, but it was a fun crowd, not wild and rowdy. I think I made a great fathers day choice, thanks to all my fellow yelper.
