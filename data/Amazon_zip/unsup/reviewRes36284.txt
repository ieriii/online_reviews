I love little breakfast places like this. I always like to see the differences between breakfast joints. This place always seem packed, but it's worth the small wait for a table. This place differs from the others because they make their own fresh juices. It is delicious and must try! This is always the place to be after a night of going out. They give you very generous portions also. My favorite things to get here are: - Classic Eggs Benedict - Veggie Omelette - Banana Pecan Waffles - Banana Crepes - Down on the Farm Skillet
