I probably haven't been here in over twenty years, when the family and I took a nostalgic trip to Chicago to visit all the places we used to eat when we were little. This is one of those places where it is so good that "some things never change!" We were not expecting to find the food to be of the same amazing quality it once was but yes, everything is the exact same (probably down to the wait staff). We had to start off with the Sauganaki (sp?) fried cheese (duh!) and the lemon-egg-rice soup. All very good! I got the lamb kabobs and they were the best I've ever had. Thanks you to Greek Islands for making our trip down memory lane so much fun!
