I'm a sucker for gin, GOOD gin, so V.H. gets big points for having some unique offerings. There is an intimate vibe, lots of moody candles, music's at the right volume and is chill. It's a pretty, unique spot...it's also pretty dark and pretty humorless. The waitress squinted blankly at my faint figure as I asked for a flashlight to find my way to the bathroom. That was a joke, sweetie. Poor lamb.
