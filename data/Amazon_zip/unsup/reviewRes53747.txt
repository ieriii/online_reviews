Terribly rude staff. I'll never go there again.Felt like I was under Nazi control, with their constant directives. Others sitting around us felt the same way.Staff also shouldn't drink on the job. I found that low-class.I don't care how legendary a bar is, there's no cause for the employees to behave in this manner.
