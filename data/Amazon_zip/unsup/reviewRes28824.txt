I have been to Frontera Grill for a few corporate events (where the food was just A-OK), and went again last night (Tuesday) around 8:30 for full-on dinner. It was still very crowded (thanks, Top Chef). Great atmosphere. Margs were delicious. We ordered the basic ceviche for an app, and had the duck tacos and steak tacos for entrees. Ironically -- both the duck and steak tasted the same. Couldn't really tell the difference. Plus, could have had more ceviche and guac for the $13... Would go back, but probably to Topolobombo or XOCO first. Then, over all three, I would recommend Chilam Balam in Lakeview. That place has innovative Mexican going on...
