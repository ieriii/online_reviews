Great neighborhood pizza joint. Been going there and ordering from there for about 20 yrs. Used to live a block away but still get food from there occasionally even though its nowhere near me. The thin crust is great, the thick crust is good, but my absolute favorite is the Stuffed Pizza with sausage and onions. Best I've had. My litmus test for Italian restaurants is whether they can make decent meatballs or not and LaVilla's are pretty good. Good Veal Parm as well. Stop by if your in the area.
