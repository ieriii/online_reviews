I had a great Friday night dinner here. The atmosphere is cute and cozy with dark lighting and white lights strung about. The restaurant has several rooms and is quite large, despite what its exterior might lead you to think. Dinner was a few hours long as I was catching up with a friend, and our server didn't seem to mind we were slower than usual. He was very friendly.  My food was delicious (gnocchi with pesto and sun-dried tomatoes). The portions are very large- I ate so much at dinner and still had leftovers. We split a bottle of wine and had two entrees, and the cost was $48 per person with tip. Given what we had ordered I thought this was slightly high, but definitely enjoyed the food and experience and would go back.
