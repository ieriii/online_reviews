Atmosphere/ambiance: nice, really niceService: attentiveDrinks: a bit priceyFood: mehhhIf "Wilde" intentionally wants to celebrate the generally bland and blah English cuisine of 100 years ago that Oscar himself would have recognized, it succeeds very well. However, for anyone who's been to the UK or Ireland since about 1950, the chow is a lot better there. My group had the meat loaf, fish & chips, and the grilled salmon over romaine lettuce. The first two get a C-, while the salmon earns a B+. Portions are BIG. As noted by others, drinks are pretty expensive. Interesting mix of diners. The eye candy gets better after 8 pm. All in all, it's an attractive place but again, pretty mediocre vittles.
