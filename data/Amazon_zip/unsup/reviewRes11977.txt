I went to Piece on Friday night with a few friends. We got there around 5:50pm and put our name in, walked around the neighborhood for a while, and returned at 6:40 and were seated almost immediately. The beer and pizza were both pretty good, though I'm not sure they deserve the raves I've heard. Certainly not worth the two hours a lot of people wait for a table on the weekends. (!!) I'll be back, but either on a weekday, or we'll repeat our plan of putting our name in early. All in all: good but not great, and don't be a sucker and wait two hours.
