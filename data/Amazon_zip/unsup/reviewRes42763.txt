Seriously- in my opinion, best stuffed deep dish in Chicago. The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of a stellar 5 is the price and delivery time. It can be expensive if you add a lot of toppings and be prepared to wait 90 minutes or more during dinner hours for delivery. I am content with just a cheese pizza, but when the parental units are in town we tend to splurge. My favorite combination (courtesy of my cousin John who introduced me to Art) is spinach, tomatoes, garlic and sausage! Also, one slice is PLENTY! Even a big eater would be hard pressed to finish two. You also get a free liter of pop with your order. I love this place!
