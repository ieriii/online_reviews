I went here one night for a birthday party. I had just gone to siboney the week before for a first time experience with cuban food and I was sooo pleased! So I was really excited about trying this place. Unfortunately I was so dissappointed. The food was not great. We ordered empanadas that were super cold in the middle and came with no sauce to dip it in. My entree was not cooked the way I had wanted it. My bf got the cuban sandwich which was completely bland and the yuca with it also extremely cold in the middle. Our server Ryan, was absolutely fantastic and the hostess was very nice. The ambience was awesome but not enough to get me to go back for that sad food. Im really disappointed bc it looks like a cool place.
