Well, they have maintained their quality of service and food yet once again. This was a repeat visit and well worth it. Service staff is outstanding and friendly from the valet, to the front desk, to the table. Bravo!!! The Chefs did an excellent job on the appetizers, soups, main courses and the deserts. I would highly recommend this restaurant to the avid Greek restaurant goers to the adventurous looking to take on a world of new flavors for their taste buds. I have eaten in many Greek restaurants both in the US and in Greece and would rank this restaurant in the top ten category. A must for anyone who likes Greek food or looking to try something new.
