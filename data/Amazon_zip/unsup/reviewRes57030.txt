Delish, delish, delish pizza everytime I go... which is often. My favorite is the white pizza with ricotta, fresh tomatoes and basil. Even my carnivore for a husband loves it! Yes, it does get stupid crowded and noisy on the weekends; my advice is to make Piece a mid-week destination. What's keeping this place from a 5-star in my book is the weekend noise level and rather unfriendly crew of patrons.
