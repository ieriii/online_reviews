Came here to have dinner after running the Chicago Marathon. The place is not very easy to find, but, we had no trouble locating it within Lincoln Park. As you step inside, the walls temporarily gets lower and closer to you until you hit the sliding doors which opens you to the first view of the restaurant. Chef Achatz has a modern feel to his establishment. We sat on the second floor with very attentive hosts the entire evening... felt like there were 4 attentive people caring for us the entire meal (lasted 3 hours). Let's see.... we got to sample his menu, which consisted of at least 10 items.... which were all exquisite in their respectiveness. I won't go thru the entire menu, but, my favorites included the Apple 'shot' with horseradish and celery, the pheasant with the scent of the burning autumn leaves, the maitake broth, and the nitrogen-freezed chocolate dessert. Everything tasted great and it's a once-in-a-lifetime experience that should be considered.  I was content of having the chance to dine here. If you make it to Chicago, consider Alinea!
