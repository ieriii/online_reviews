lao sze chuan delivers via grubhub! takes about 45mins-hour, but i'm okay with that.  i ordered dishes that you really shouldn't order as delivery (e.g. the spicy boiled beef dish that everyone raves about which also subsequently comes with a gallon of piping hot spicy soup). also just recently tried the three cup chicken, which tastes great heated up the next day. that sauce! poured over white rice! i ate this at lunch the next day and quietly smacked my lips in satisfaction. try delivery! not too shabby.
