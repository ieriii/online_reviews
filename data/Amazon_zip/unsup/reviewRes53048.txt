Great food, atmosphere and BYOB! Now, who can beat that? We decided, on a whim, to check this place out over the weekend. I had the tofu dish, though not traditional Cuban food, it was DElicious! I would definitely go back. The only reason I gave 90 Miles a 4 star rating is because when we arrived, we asked to be seated inside, being that it was a chilly June night, and was told that we would only have to wait 15 minutes for a table big enough to accommodate us. We sat out in front under a heat lamp that only warmed our foreheads. She never came back to us or moved us and we ended up sitting there the rest of the night. After drinks, we forgot about it..well, not really, but our drinks warmed us up. Our servers were great and very attentive! Great cozy summer spot, I like it !!
