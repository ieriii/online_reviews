Sultan's: Good, fast, cheap and reasonably healthy. The $3 falafel sandwich is probably the best I've ever eaten. The falafel is prepared crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, served in a warm pita with hummus and optional hot sauce, which I've never been offered at other Middle Eastern restaurants. It really adds a lot of flavor and compliments the falafel nicely. The chicken schwarma is good too, and I'm looking forward to trying other menu items. I'm blessed to have this place so close to me!
