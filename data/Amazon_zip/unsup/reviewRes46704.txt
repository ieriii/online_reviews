Love RJ grunts.. I had gone here many times when I lived in LP and had their burger and soups, and salad bar.. all of them to die for!! The best part though is the butternut squash soup that is served seasonally. So I went there only for the soup!! They did not serve it! I could not believe it!! so the waitress went and got the manager who said to go back there in a few hours and that he would arrange something about it.. so of course I went back!! I wanted the damn soup... I asked the hostess for the manager and I waited 5-10 mins and I got 2 bowls of yummy, delicious soup!! FOR FREE!! I could not believe it.. that's good management for you.. restaurant owners take note:) I wish they were located closer to me...
