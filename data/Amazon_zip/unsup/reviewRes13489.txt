I think Glenn's main function is seafood, but they do a pretty satisfactory breakfast and coffee too! Most of the breakfasts are standard fare: eggs, pancakes, french toast. They do have a couple of stand out items though, like homemade potato pancakes served instead of hash browns, crabcakes benadict, and pancakes made with red hots that i have to admit... I'm afraid to try. Oh, and bonus, breakfast is served all day... if you're into that sort of thing, which I am.
