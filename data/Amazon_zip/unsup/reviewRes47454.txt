I have been popping in here after my GF left town to work my way down the burger menu. The staff are super nice, and the metal-bar aesthetic is growing on me. Like a Metal concert, the place usually has tons of dudes, but the food is freaking awesome, and the servers are as nice as they come. I am a fan of "the Warden" (the salt is not as bad as it was the first time) and I can also suggest the "Punk Bitch" and "Electric Chair." Mac-n-Cheese for a little more makes it a mind-blowing meal. Yum. The GF loves the Purple Haz drink served in a pint-glass.
