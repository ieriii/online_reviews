We had been to the bar many times but decided to celebrate my finances birthday dinner here. I was immediately disappointed when they sat us upstairs. We were one of the only tables and lots of wait staff standing around talking joking etc. The food was good. Our server was a little too fake. He turned on his fake voice when presenting to us but then when we would banter with him, he was normal. It was kind of funny. There are really no veggie options but it's a steak house. My fianc enjoyed his steak and they brought us a chocolate cake slice for his bday. It was great but we did feel like we were missing out on the whole experience being upstairs.
