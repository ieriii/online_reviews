Ok so obviously this place is expensive but we wanted to do something special for our wedding night so we looked for deals and went with the W. Our honeymoon isn't until December so this looked fun. We booked with them and paid ahead of time; we had to do this because of the special we got for two nights. It was a great room overlooking the lake. The food sucked but whatever. A week later I noticed that I had been double charged. So I was now out $1200!!!! yup and I'm a teacher so you know I ain't got no money. The amount we paid ahead was $500 for two nights. Then suddenly we were charged another $700. Eventually it was all taken care of after many phone calls and much frustration. The only reason I'm giving at A-OK is because they offered that we stay there again for free to let us have a better experience. The second time we had the same type of room (only one night) and it was great. No room service this time since we had experience the bad food already!
