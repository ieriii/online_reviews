First off i'm going to start off by saying I NEVER write reviews for anything. Ever. But after reading all of the terrible reviews off of many different websites, I feel the need to share my experience! The staff was so helpful to me and some friends that stayed there 2/15 to 2/18. Anytime we needed help with something or needed a taxi, they immediately helped us out. The rooms were beautiful and had a 1920's vibe to it which I really enjoyed. it does get pretty hot in the room after a while, but its not hard to open a window and shut it when you get cold. The hot water does take a few extra minutes to come on, but I didn't find that a problem. The ONLY thing I have to complain about is how thin the walls are. We had a neighbor come to our room 3 times complaining of how loud we were, but we weren't even talking...it was our tv! Other than that this hotel was a wonderful place to stay and I don't regret it at all! So don't listen to all of the other bad reviews of the place. I believe you get what you pay for at the Congress Plaza. If you want a 5 star experience, then obiously you have to pay for it at a different hotel. No, the Congress Plaza wasn't a perfect hotel, but if you're just staying there for a few days and are looking for somewhere affordable with beautiful spacious rooms and a friendly staff, then I highly recommend you stay here! Yeah, the hotel is a bit run down, but its been in business for such a long time and I think that the history of the place is what makes it beautiful. Oh, and the strikers out front are no problem, they arent loud and they don't get in the way of anything. All in all, I highly recommend this hotel!
