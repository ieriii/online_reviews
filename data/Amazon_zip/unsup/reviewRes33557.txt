Stumbled in here on a Saturday morning after it was recommended by our concierge at the Blackstone. It was packed and we were hungry but the wait didn't take that long considering how many people were waiting. The menu is large and filled with a number of great sounding options. We shard a glass of delicious orange strawberry juice- wow! That stuff is seriously good! For breakfast, I went with a Garden Skillet to get all the veggie but added ham as well. Breakfast potatoes with scrambled eggs and tons of veggies(+ham) came out and I was in love! My sis had a bacon quesadilla which looked more like a burrito but tasted great. We also couldnt resist splitting a multi-grain pancake. HOlY COW those are tasty! We came back for breakfast again before our trip ended. THis time I had a veggie omlette, and again added ham. It was HUGE and perfectly done. Loved every bite. Sis tried Some savory crepes that were superb. They had egg an avocado and were the perfect mix of sweet and savory. The multi-grain pancake was, once again, a delightful cap to a self-indulgent gastronomic splurge!
