I just got home from the most insanely delicious meal of my life. Mondays they have a special where you can get a 4 course meal for $20 per person (2 appetizers, 2 soups/salads, 3 entrees, 1 dessert, that you choose from a large list of various dishes). My boyfriend and I got fried calamari and avocado bruschetta for our appetizers. The calamari was probably the low point of the whole meal, and even that was pretty tasty. The avocado bruschetta was awesome. For the next course we got delicious minestrone soup and a great salad with raspberries, apples, pine nuts, and chunks of provolone cheese. I could have eaten a whole bowl of the soup or the salad, but I'm glad I didn't, because next came rigatoni in an impressively meaty sauce, fluffy gnocchi in a pesto sauce that even my pesto-hating boyfriend had seconds of, and salmon that fell apart on your fork with squash and crispy delicious sweet potato fries. By the time we got to our impossibly light and creamy tiramisu, we were already planning what to get on our next visit. There was so much food that we brought home leftovers, only because I was physically unable to unhinge my jaw like a snake and shovel it all in. If I could have, I would have. Service was great, my wine and water glasses were never empty, and our plates were taken away the moment we were done with each course. I can't say enough about how great our meal was. I can't wait to go back again and try some more of the outrageously tasty food at this Italian gem.
