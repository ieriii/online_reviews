It's delicious and incredible. I never want to go again. The food was good and the wine pairings were wonderful. The service was so attentive it was almost over the top. If you are in dire need of an ego boost, you'll leave feeling like the world revolves around you. The thing is, I really don't want to spend 4 hours eating a meal. I felt like Gretel being plumped up. At the end of the night it was just so much food and the dessert really pushed me over that unhappily full edge. I wanted someone to stick me in a wheel barrow and roll me out. It's definitely worth going to and is certainly an experience. I'm happy I got to try it but this is on my once a decade list.
