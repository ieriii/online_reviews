Purple Pig is one of the best places I've ever eaten. Seriously. I love the semi-casual atmosphere. I love that they offer tall "communal" tables. They have a great beer and wine list. And the food! Um. I couldn't get enough. LOVE. I went work friends and we shared a bunch of things off the menu (which is the only way to eat here). When you eat here, experiment! Try lots of things and make sure to order desert to complete the meal. I will definitely be back. And maybe when I'm back I will run into you. Why? Because you have to eat here. That's why.
