OMG. PORTIONS ARE CRAZY. was SUPER hungry when i arrived so got calamari which was delicious. i like when there isn't too much batter and more squid there. but GAH, shouldve shared one pizza with my friend! We both got different pizzas, and i literally only ate 2 slices. i was also visiting out of town, so i couldn't even take the pizza home. so wasteful! its a bit more expensive since baked to order, so would definitely... be smart to share unless you are a big eater! i got pizza with jalapenos, sausage, and mushrooms... watch out jalapenos are HOT!
