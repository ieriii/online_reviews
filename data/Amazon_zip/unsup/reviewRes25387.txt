My friend and I came here for lunch on a warm, sunny day after that week of rainy cold weather this past month, and it felt like such a treat. We sat upstairs by the window and thoroughly enjoyed people-watching, talking, and devouring our food (I had the chicken and mozz artopita and he had the stuffed chicken special). We were in such a relaxed, indulgent mood that we decided to finish off lunch with a fabulous fruit tart and some flan. Artopolis was great. The only downside was having to spend $5 to use my credit card at the bakery counter, but that only forced me to get double the dessert (which actually isn't a bad thing). All in all, this place is quick and efficient (you choose your food, you pay for it, you seat yourself) but with generous splashes of character and comfort.
