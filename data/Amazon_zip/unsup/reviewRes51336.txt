My husband and I have only had the burritos and tacos and Garcia's and they are okay. I DO NOT recommend the chicken burrito - that might have been the worst burrito I have ever eaten. There is absolutely no spice or flavor to the chicken...it's like they just threw it in the microwave for a few minutes and then put it on the taco. However, the new decor/updated restaurant is nice. And the margaritas are huge, strong, and delicious. The guacamole was fine. It's not the best I've ever had (could use some lime) but it definitely satisfies my cravings. I I would recommend Garcia's if you just want some drinks, hang out at the bar, and much on chips.
