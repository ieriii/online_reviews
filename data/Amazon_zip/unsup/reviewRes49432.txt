The more I eat here, the less I like it. Seriously. I went with friends on a Friday right after work. I had to ask the server for clean utensils THREE TIMES and each time they had crusty things on them. Then my wine came in a chipped glass. How about a little quality control folks? Food was fine, but it's expensive and unimpressive. You're paying to eat downtown, not for great quality. When I returned with coworkers for a work lunch we found that the lunch menu is ridiculously limited and has maybe 2 veggie options (both of which are solid carbs and cheese) and our service was so slow I may have visibly aged. I have given Bin 36 numerous opportunities to impress me. I also don't have a miserable time when I'm there. BUT I would never choose to go there of my own accord. Dirty silverware and chipped glasses aside, I just think there are better options around.
