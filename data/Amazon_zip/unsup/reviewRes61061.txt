I WANT THIS PLACE TO BE BETTER.But it's not. My mom's side is from the South. SO I know good Southern food when it's put in front of me.I am always excited and enticed by the food and menu; but when it arrives I am always underwhelmed. My last experience was the jambalaya. It was nothing close to real down south Louisiana goodness. It's like they take Southern food and make it smarter so Midwesterners can eat it. It's not all bad.......My Maw maw and Wishbone must have the exact same cheese grits recipe!! In a pinch for some down home? Try it out. When I need my grit fix, I do it at WISHBONE.
