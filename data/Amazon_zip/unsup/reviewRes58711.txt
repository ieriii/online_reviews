I am a 22 year veteran of the annual National Restaurant Association Show in Chicago, and was delighted to be an invited guest for a reservation at Graham Elliot. While enjoying a drink before dinner and munching on the signature popcorn, our host and global wine expert commented on the unreasonably priced wine list....Our party of five was seated and treated to very fun and delicious first and second courses. I enjoyed the signature deconstructed caesar salad with brioche twinkie followed by superb foie gras.Sadly - My fond experience stopped, as my veal entree was difficult to eat with little flavor and chewy protein.Our table review was met with a variety of positive & negative comments on the evening, and shared our embarrassment for our gracious host.After reading this review, it is hard to believe that I am a fan of Chef Bowles; however, I believe in creativity and effort as an exhibit of anyone's passion in life and career.Take your chances, but bring your wallet.Ciao
