I made it a gastronomic goal to eat in every pizzeria that was touted by Chicago mag, the Reader, RedEye , etc because i love pizza and it's a popular way to end a movie outing. And Pequod's is across the street from Webster Place Theatre ... so. it is very unique, crusty, tasty, reasonably priced, fast from the oven and it does warm up in a microwave like no other pizza. What else could a pizza afficionado want? i gave it five stars for the food - i'm not into the sports bar atmosphere, but the Sunday we went there was a game on and the volume was low enough for conversation and enthusiastic fans were even polite.
