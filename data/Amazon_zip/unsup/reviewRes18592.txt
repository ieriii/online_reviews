This place is a true gem...and I don't use that language often. The ambiance, waiters, cooks, food, everything is top notch. Plus it's BYOB how can you get any better than that. I went for my birthday and it was wonderful. Our waiter was super nice and recommend different things to try, if you go do not order insalata caprese (which is shocking from me because that's my favorite thing in the world) instead order the green bean insalata it's so amazing. Order anything with porcini mushrooms. Everything, is freshly made and so delicious I don't think you could order something bad. They only take reservations for parties of 6 or more but usually the wait isn't too bad.
