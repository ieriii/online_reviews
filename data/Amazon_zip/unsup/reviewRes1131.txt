I'm not sure a Yelp review can say too much more than the average line you'll probably see outside Hot Doug's, but this place is the quintessential stop for lovers of encased meats. Doug's menu is split into 2 sections: the first features a dozen fixed-menu items that range from elaborately constructed pork and chicken sausages to seafood dogs. The second includes a rotating cycle of specialty dogs which are anything but plain. The last time I went, I got a sun-dried tomato and pesto pork sausage topped with melted gouda; it was just as amazing as it sounds. Go on a weekday and before noon or after 3pm if you want to dodge the lines, but no matter the wait, your food will be worth it.
