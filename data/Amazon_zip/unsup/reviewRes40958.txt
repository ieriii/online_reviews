$15 for fried calamari? You serious? No, I'm not cool with that. $8 for a bowl of pho? It amazes me how this place is always packed while they charge a premium for their food. There are 2 entrances, so naturally 2 lines are form for a wait. Yo, fix this, Tank. The servers are friendly, but sometimes we get neglected because of how packed it gets. Occasionally, you'll have to share a table with another small group. I'm cool with that. The atmosphere is really nice though with all the light coming through the windows since they have a corner space. The food is average, but definitely overpriced. But if you're feeling a little adventurous, they offer cow penis; not even joking. And for the record, I've never tried it and never will.
