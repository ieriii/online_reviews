I've been eating at 90 Mile for years and have admired their continued growth. If you are looking for a great atmosphere to laugh with friends/family, this is the place. Lately, I've noticed their menu prices have been rising, however, I expected this to happen. Food is fresh and you can't go wrong with any selection.
