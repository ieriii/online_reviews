You can call it overrated and overpriced, but the food's pretty yummy... so I can't hate on it too much.  My friends and I came to Grand Lux around 11 PM on a Saturday night. It was pretty empty, so we were seated right away in the rotunda area overlooking downtown. The venue was really large. They had several different dining areas and a large bar. It seemed like the perfect place for an intimate dinner or a huge party. Drinks are way too damn expensive. Don't order drinks here unless you're willing to pay an arm and a leg for it. Go for water or something.  I can't remember what our appetizer was or what my other friends ordered, but I got the Vegetables As a Meal dish. It was white rice and four vegetable dishes of my choice. I got: mashed sweet potatoes, asparagus, spinach, and pasta. I know pasta isn't a vegetable, but it was an option... and I love me some pasta. Haha. Anyways, everything was tasty, just kinda pricey. If you can hang with Cheesecake Factory quality food with a little bit higher of a price, Grand Lux wouldn't be a bad option.
