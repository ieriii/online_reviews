Maybe I'm not the best critic for this place since I'm not a huge meat lover. I like meat but I think this place was a little too much for me. Oddly enough, I enough the seared tuna and lobster bisque soup more than the meat. I really did enjoy some pieces of meat but there were others that were too salty. The servers are great. They're friendly and they really know what they're serving. My fiancee's pretty picking with his meats and wants it perfectly medium rare which they were able to meet his expectations. He, on the other hand, LOVES this place. I'm glad we had a buy one get on free dinner coupon since I definitely did not eat my share. If you're a meat LOVER, this is a great place for you but if not, I wouldn't pay the $50 to eat here...
