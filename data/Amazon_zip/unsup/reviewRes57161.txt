Absolutely LOVE Carnivale! We live very close and when we moved in we went REALLY REALLY often... had to slow down a bit. Everything we've had there is delicious. It always feels like a party. Definately not subdued or quiet elegance.... but FUN. Great music, great food, great drinks. Chef Mark uses as much local and organic as possible. Flavors are fabulous. Go!
