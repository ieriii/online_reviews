Avoid if you value your time! 40+ minute wait for a table on a Sunday at 12:00 PM...despite the fact that there were many open tables. Greeted by a Stand-Offish host. Decided to wait in the communal bar for the table. 15 minutes for the waiter to first take a drink order. One drink and never saw the waiter again for another 20+ minutes. You get the idea...slow service and understaffed. There is a good beer selection, but frankly many of the beers are common and horrendously marked-up. The Sunday Brunch menu is good, and the food is good. But it's breakfast food - honestly its difficult to mess it up. Oh, and out of the 12 items on the menu - they had sold out of 2 of them. And if you want any type of privacy while dining, this is not the place for you. The majority of the seats are at communal tables where you will be packed in like sardines. Summary: the restaurant is a scene. The food quality, and menu doesn't justify the poor service and excessive wait. There are many other better options in Chicago. Avoid!
