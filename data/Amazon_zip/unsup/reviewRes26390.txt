I came here alone tonight, which is always an interesting way to test the service, etc. Cool setting, too loud for these ears, though. I got fine service, perhaps a little slow. The soup con arroz was DELICIOUS, and so filling it made it hard to enjoy the two other dishes I ordered: pulpo con papas (needed salt) and butternut squash ravioli--delicious, but VERY rich. It's only 3 raviolis but I still couldn't finish it. Overall, a delicious and very authentic taste of Spain.
