for me, it's the beer that makes this place a hot spot. that Flat Iron stout just made my week. it's so good. dude, it's seriously so good. the pizza was better than decent but i found the crust a bit too, what's the word, not too crispy or hard but for some darn reason it just required too much effort to break of a piece into my mouth but once in there, man alive, was that pizza tasty! also, i'm a fan of the building's wood interior. it gives it a warm and at-home feel.
