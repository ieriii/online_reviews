I hosted a party of 8 at Graham Elliot this week, and it was every bit as good as the first time! The group I was with had a few people that were intimidated by the menu, and not used to the pacing of the meal. Although I understand that pacing, and when dining with loved ones, appreciate it, I had a group getting restless. I told the server who was able to pick up the pace and work with me to get things ordered before the next course was complete. I don't recall my server's name, but I have had truly amazing service both times that I have been to GE. These people are so knowledgeable and nice. The manager was cool and unpretentious when our party of 6 turned to a party of 8, which is difficult for them to accommodate. They didn't hurry us to our table from the bar even though our table was ready and we were a big party. This is a must try restaurant.
