Bottom line: great place and great food - but not sure if it is worth the hype/wait/cost. Must try (menus change every season - we went during summer/fall) -Small plate: Beef tongue -Entree: Chicken in clay pot ---Details below--- Context: -Came here with a couple of dudes for a late dinner (9:30pm) on a rainy day - was seating in only after 10 minutes. How much to order: -Split 5 small plates, 3 entrees between 5 people; it was plenty of food. Pros: -Great ambiance; relaxed setting that works for date night or just knocking back a couple beers -As expected, great service. Feel free to ask them to explain the menu - I did not know what half the words meant Cons: -Though I did not experience it, heard that waits are usually 40-60 mins; I would not go back if I had to wait that long -At $50 a head, there is better value to be found (would rather drop that cash at Joe's stone crab)
