They brew their own beers and have pretty good pizza when you get sick of Chicago-style pizza and wonder if there's any reputable non-Chicago-style pizza around the city. $20 kind of sucks for a pitcher, but it's worth a try. This place has been packed every time I've gone there and seems to be a hit with yuppies and fratty dudes. They even have karaoke night. Expect to hear "Don't Stop Believin" at some point. Okay, maybe I'll subtract one star based on the inevitable culmination of those factors. But you can only complain so much about good pizza + beer.
