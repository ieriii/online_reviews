I have no idea what to compare this place to because in Seattle we don't have a lot of good, authentic Mexican food. But these little things were really tasty. I tried the carne asada taco and the other taco with beef in it; both were good and distinctly different in flavor. Be prepared to have your fingers smelling like meat juice for the rest of the day! I do think the price is a bit on the high side for street food, but not so high that it detracted from the experience. It's just that the cheapness of good street food adds to the experience of making you feel like you are getting away such a deal. Here, you are feel like you're paying for what you get.
