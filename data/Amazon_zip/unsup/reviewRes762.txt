arrive at 10:30 sharp and people were standing outside already. so what's up with this place? got the original chicago hot dog-the dog with everything + sauerkraut and peppers comes in a poppyseed hot dog bun with a juicy, plump grilled sausage. there was a pop to each bite of the firm sausage. bread was so soft it was ripping from the bottom. love the pickles, tomatoes and veggies on top.  it was a good sausage, but will I really wait in line for hours for it.....probably not.
