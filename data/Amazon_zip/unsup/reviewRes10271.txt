A review for Ladies: This place is wonderful. I came to Chicago from the magical land of Eastern Time, and we do not have deep dish there and I still do not believe in it. Piece delivers on my need for pizza with crust "so thin you could read through it" and that would give it 5 stars all on its own. Leave the boys and the whiners at home and order every veggie you've ever missed in your entire life. if you are like me, you will finally fulfill your goal of getting a pizza so un-pizza like (no sauce, no mozzarella, all manner of olives and marinated things, goat cheese) that no one will love it but you and you will eat it for the next three glorious days. the beer was good too, but it doesn't matter. Unless you do have to bring boys or whiners. i'm still not sharing though
