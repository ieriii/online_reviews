When my friend suggested we go out to eat at an Irish Pub this afternoon, I hesitated a little. I didn't want to eat my lunch in a noisy, crowded, dirty bar. Well, that's the last time I judge an Irish pub by its stereotype. This place is stinkin' cool! It's like 50% restaurant, 35% bar, and 15% library. I loved it! The atmosphere was warm, friendly, and cozy. I swear that front door's a disguised transporter. It sucked me off of Broadway and dropped me into a comfortable long booth that glowed with the light of a cute chandelier.. not your typical pub. Food? Amazing! and BIG! I can't believe one individual was able to carry all of our dishes on one tray... on one shoulder! 4 out of the 5 of us had dishes that were served on gigantic platters.. platters that held delicious food. My beer battered cod sandwich was unreal. I don't think I've ever tasted anything like that before. Others ordered the meatloaf sandwich, bangers and mash, and Irish breakfast which had black pudding in it... nope, I didn't try it, but heard that it just tasted like sausage. Service was pleasant. I'll be back. =)
