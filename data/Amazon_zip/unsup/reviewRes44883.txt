I came here with 5 other girls and we had so much food left over. You need to try to pace yourself here cause the pizzas take about 45 mins to make so within that time, we had some beverages, shared some salads, and the fried appetizer plate. By the time 2 medium and 1 small deep dish pizza came out, most of us were kinda full. I tried to eat 2 pieces and didn't feel very good afterwards. We had at least half of the pizzas left over. Each of us ate about 1.5 pieces and then called it a day. The pizza was very good. I don't know it it was the best pizza I have ever had but it definitely was very tasty. We couldn't even think of dessert afterwards and I couldn't really breathe normally for a few hours after. The staff was all very nice, too.
