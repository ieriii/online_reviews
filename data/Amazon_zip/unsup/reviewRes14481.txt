I've been here several times, and it never disappoints. It is tiny, crowded, outdoor space is right on the street...doesn't matter, because the food is so fabulous that all that other stuff just adds to the experience. Absolutely outstanding fish, always fresh, perfectly cooked, creative preparations, what more can I say. Love the arctic char and the trout, recently had a dover sole that still makes my mouth water thinking about it. Clam chowder is definitely a cut above most other seafood places. Only minor disappointment I have ever had was a lobster sandwich -- I expected chuncks of lobster and it was tiny pieces and pretty bland. But why order a lobster sandwich when everything else is so exceptional? Can't wait to go back. P.S. Staff is so friendly and knowledgeable too.
