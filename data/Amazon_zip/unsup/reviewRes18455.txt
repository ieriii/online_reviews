This quaint little Italian restaurant on Wilson welcomes you with a warmly decorated interior enhanced by artworks by a featured young artist. My dilemma was what to choose --- the brasciole or the osso buco (two of my all-time favorite Italian dishes). I went with the latter and while it was a good solid dish of veal slathered with tomato sauce and sided with polenta, I have had better versions of osso buco elsewhere. The entrees come with either a house salad or a soup. The delicious soup I had included pasta, potato and a cheesy broth. The desserts looked good (lemon tartufo caught my eye on the card) but the otherwise vigilant service during the early dinner hour trickled to a slow grind once the restaurant filled up.
