The place needs a makeover. The atmosphere is nothing special. We had carpaccio for appetizer and it was outstanding, with fresh arugula and real Parmigiano. After that, we had high expectations for the entres but everything was really disappointing: even if the ingredients tasted fresh and flavorful, the base of our pizza had a strange garlicky taste and seemed to be frozen or/and precooked. One of us had spaghetti alla diavola con pollo wich looked like a soup: the sauce filled half of the bowl and spaghetti were flouting in it. When we ask about the food, we told our server that we were disappointed, so the manager showed up and promptly offered 50% off our check. We found it to be kind and professional.
