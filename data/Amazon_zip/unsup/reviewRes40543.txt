We actually came here from a recommendation from a bar tender in the loop.  None of us were expecting much, just some whiskey from around the globe. But the quality of the food and drinks were bar none. This bar probably delivered the best old fashion and Manhattan I have ever tasted. Honestly, its like you could literally taste the care in which the bartender put in to make those drinks. The cuisine was delicious as well. One may think it a little pricey, but the quality of the drink and even the food...definitely a bargain.  All in all, if your a lover of whiskey, this is the place to go. I've also been all over the world and that old fashion- will definitely have me coming back.
