A really fun family experience with our three little kids. We grilled beef and chicken + had the umpteen side dishes + an order of dumplings. Everyone found something to like, a great environment to encourage the kids to try something different. Fun to grill at the table. It's 5 minutes from our house, very affordable, no frills. We'll be back.
