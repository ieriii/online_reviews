When I got there, I found I had to share a room with a stranger (my co-worker I hadn't met). The company asked for a double bed room not single. When I went to the front desk the guy seemed uninterested in what I was telling him and got smart with me. Then, told me he couldn't help me "sorry, we are sold out." They were not sold out so he lied. I had to get my manager involved for them to do anything for me. Then, he had to get management involved. Finally, they put us in a double room. It was small but better than a small room with one bed. Be prepared to pay for forks and spoons when you get there. I think they probably charge for everything but the forks and spoons are $5.74. You could get a fast food meal with that or one of their drinks in the refrigerator. BTW, the frig is small and they load it with stuff you have to pay for. So make sure when you take it out, you put it back.  If you have a long stay there, you won't be getting a microwave either, FYI. I tried not to bother the front desk much since they seemed to unfeeling; however, the bar people were great! I spend a lot of time at the restaurant and bar.  Their Starbucks in there are slow too, they made me late for my bus when all they had to do was heat up my egg sandwich. Took them ten minutes and they knew I was waiting. They didn't do anything but refund my money or my inconvenience. Not sure if that has anything to do with the hotel but it is connected to the hotel.  I learned to go across the street after that which was not far from the bus stop.  Other than that the hotel was okay! Not the best but okay.
