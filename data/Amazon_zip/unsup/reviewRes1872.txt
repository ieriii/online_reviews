The are the best dogs I've ever had! And I hate condiments. Hot dogs can't be hot dogs without condiments, so I reluctantly ate them. I am SO glad I did. The food was amazing! On top of that, the service was great. Not much was expected since it's a fast food place. I came with 4 of my friends which is a big group for a smaller place like this. The guy helped us out by finding a table for us and seating us. Way beyond his responsibilities. My friend pointed out a subtlety that really contributed to an enjoyable experience. The guy taking our order, who I assumed is also the owner, timed his taking orders with the flow of people eating and leaving. While the wait in line is long, once you order your food you'll get a table and be able to take your time eating without the pressure of other people standing around you waiting for your table. Plus, if you are lucky, you can catch a glimpse of the bus boy dancing to "Come on Eileen."
