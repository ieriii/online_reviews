The food and ambiance at Gilt are great, but the terrible service sadly overshadowed that. I have eaten at Gilt a couple of times, and have had difficulty getting a table, so I made sure to make a reservation for a Tuesday night together with the girls after work. I was the first to arrive, and every single table was empty. It was one of those 100 degree days, so I would have preferred to have a seat and drink some water. When I checked in, the hostess told me that I needed everybody in my party to be seated, but I could have a seat at the bar to get a drink. The problem is, the bar wasn't that big (probably only seats about 10 or so) and that was completely full. It also didn't make any sense, because every single table was open. I waited, and finally when my friends arrived, we were seated. We ordered our first (and only) round of drinks, apps and entrees. We expected a night out of catching up over food and drinks. The waitress had another plan. From being seated to walking out the door, with apps, drinks, waiting for the food, meal and payment we were only there for 1 hour. The waitress really rushed us, didn't ask us if we wanted any drinks, and just dropped off the bill prematurely. I was going to order another round of drinks, but the waitress just dropped off the bill.  The ambiance is nice, the food was good and there are some good drinks and food deals on the menu, but I have a hard time going somewhere where the staff makes you feel like you're not valued, or that there are other important things or people to wait on.
