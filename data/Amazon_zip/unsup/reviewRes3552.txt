Heading out to the Bulls game and went to Yelp to locate someplace new to eat. That is where I found you. I wanted a place quick and somewhat close to Wrigleyville because we were planning to visit my daughter. As it turns out Crisp is one of my daughter's favorite places. She has been trying to get me there for some time. I had 10 wings half BBQ and Sassy Seoul. They were incredible. It surprised me but, I liked the BBQ a tad more. Not that the others were bad. They were great as well. The wings are uncut and huge. The "Crisp" coating was over the top. We have plans to go back the next time we're in the area. Small place, very casual and looks to be primarily a carry out joint. The gentleman taking our order was very nice and thank you for suggesting getting half BBQ as well. If you're into chicken wings and asian fare, I HIGHLY recommend!!! Thank you.
