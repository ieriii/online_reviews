Food was all excellent, especially the yellowtail ceviche. Blood Orange Margarita should not be missed. I had the skirt steak tacos, whose leftovers were great for lunch the next day. The reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because of the floor. Rick Bayless, you really need to do something about the floor. It has a serious pitch to it (specifically the wall that separates the bar and main floor). So much so that upon being seated at our table my drink was on the verge of spilling when it was placed on the table. So we were moved to another table. Same problem, although to a lesser degree.
