YUM! My advice to you is to not order appetizers no matter how hungry you are, because you want to save room for the fabulous pizza when it's finally ready. It's nice that you can order your pizza before you are seated so the kitchen can get a head start on it. I can seriously barely eat an entire slice, there is just a ridiculous amount of cheese in it!!  It's kind of a touristy place, but works for deep-dish in a pinch. I take out of town friends here and they love it.
