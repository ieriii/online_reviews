i've only been here once, and had the lunch portion of the southwest salad. obviously since it is related to the cheesecake factory the portions are huge, and lets just say i had enough for leftovers, even with my lunch portion. our waiter was great and explained everything we ordered (maybe they have too many people returning dishes? i mean he went over evvvverrrything -- 'black beans, tomato, cheese, etc' ok in that?).  my problem is the wait. an hour wait at 2 PM on a thursday? crazy. we ended up waiting for the grand room, or whatever in the world it is called, which was worth it. so pretty and bright. it is crazy to me that the other dining rooms had the same wait time, as well though. might as well go for the nicest one. :) the dessert was very good, though they need to get the cheesecake factory's red velvet cheesecake on their menu. asap.
