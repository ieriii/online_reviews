Well worth the wait, just go in the morning and wait till lunch time with everybody else! I love the fact that the crowd is well balanced between tourists and locals. Duck fat fries are over rated in my opinion... I'd rather save the kcals for more delicious hot dogs!!! The special dogs are wonderful, they seem to be very creative about what they can encase in the sausage, but definitely have to get the Chicago style dog!!!! It's amazing. Not veg friendly... Duh... But yeah, I love hot dougs!
