FAVORITE place in the city! If I could give it 10 stars (yes, out of 5) I would! It makes me sad reading many of the reviews that bash it. When going here you must realize one big thing: It's NOT Chicago pizza, silly! This is true Naples, Italy style pizza! It's made in a brick oven, so there will be some charred crust areas. Yes, it's very thin and yes the inside can get soggy. My husband and I have been to Naples and can attest that Spacca Napoli truly replicates their pizza (which, by the way, is where pizza is said to originate from). So cut up your pizza in at least 4s, fold the slice in half like you're supposed to, and ENJOY! I highly recommend trying to catch the burrata cheese as an appetizer. It is A-MA-ZING!! Sadly they don't offer it regularly, since it is shipped in from Italy and runs out quickly when it's there! I've tried burrata at other restaurants and have never found anything that compares to Spacca Napoli's (I think it's the sea-salted crostinis that make it magical!) Finish up your delicious meal with some limoncello. Looks like a shot but be sure to sip so you don't get funny looks. ;)
