Dear Indie, I didn't know how awesome you really were until I left Edgwater for West Town. After trying other Thai spots I realized how delicious you really were and how lucky I was to have you within walking distance. I took you for granted. I never even reviewed you for over three years! I want you to know that I miss you and you will always be the Crazy Basil Fried Rice that I use to judge all others. Yours forever, xoxo
