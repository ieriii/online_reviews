I love this spot because of the beer selection, mainly because they have a variety of belgians and I looooove belgians, esp when they come in goblets and bollekes. I like their cheese and sausage plates too. They're great if you just wanna hangout and drink while nibbling on something. Obvi if you go during peak dinner hours there's a wait, but they just expanded so the wait time has prob gotten better. I usually wait it out to sit outside in the back. 4 because I am not the biggest fan of the rest of the menu. The mussels are okay. I've had them be gritty and small a couple times though.
