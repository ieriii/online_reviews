Ok-I've eaten here several times. With a few mistakes with service, I have come back for the food.This time, I don't know if I'll be back.Maybe it's different when the owner is there.Even though I called ahead, there still was a wait for a table, even though we were all there and there were 4 open tables???So, a few spots opened at the bar, so we decided to sit there. The host was elated..We did bring our own wine. We waited a bit for glasses and a bucket. WE GOT NO WATER THE ENTIRE TIME AT THE BAR!!! NEVER OFFERED!!!!!NO BREAD!!!! NEVER OFFERED!!!We ordered the all you can eat shrimp. Took VERY LONG to come out, and no one checked on us. COUNTLESS people were in the back of the bar, but no one seemed to be helping each other out with serving us.IF YOU INCLUDE AN ITEM ON THE MENU, FOR A PRICE, IT SHOULD COME ON THE PLATE! We go no potato's with our meals. AND NO ONE BOTHERED TO EXPLAIN, until we asked. WE WAITED, some more, opened our own wine. EVEN THOUGH THEY CHARGED US FOR THE SECOND CORKAGE FEE!!! so bad.Finally go one second round of shrimp, after we ordered 3 more. Then, well, after we were all done, I got a small plate, with TWO, yes Two small boiled potato's.DON'T BOOK if you can't deliver. We sat there and notice how lovely all the other plates looked coming out. We still were paying the same amount! I was so annoyed. NO one seem to care. And it reflected on our pay check.I was a fan of this place. Maybe they need the owner there all the time to watch this SMALL dining room to be run properly.SO BAD!!!!!!!!
