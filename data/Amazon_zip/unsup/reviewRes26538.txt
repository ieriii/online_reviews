Pros: Hand made tortillas Good food BYOB Cheap Good service Cons: The seating can be a bit quirky. I am very glad we got seated in the second room. I felt kinda bad waiting in line because my ass was practically up against the tables that were sitting and eating. So try to get a spot outside the first room. Cash only. Interesting crowd. I thought the last B in BYOB meant beer. For some it meant beverage....whereby 2 liter bottles of coke were brought in from home. The food prices are so cheap do ya really need to bring in your own soda? But hey- to each his own.
