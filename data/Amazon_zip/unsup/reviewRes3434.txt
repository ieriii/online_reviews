Crisp is a successful execution of an Asian concept - one of millions that all of us Asians have in our head that never get implemented. Doug the owner is very friendly and as Asians normally have a good understanding of each other, he directed us to some crazy awesome food. - Their chicken wings are the best in town. Like the people who also reviewed Crisp, we got a half dozen of BBQ and Seoul each, the white boy from georgia that came with me didn't complain once. - We also go their super duper meat bowl that has a name that currently eludes me. Get that if you like meat! - I want to try their korean burrito............
