Tourist trap, therefore it's b-u-s-y. Food came out quickly, but the check took a while--so we ended up sitting around waiting a bit for it. Waiter forgot my friend's English muffin, after pointing out that he still needed to get it. And coffee refills were sloww), but these were minor things. Food was o-k, things were cooked well, but it wasn't anything special (no great seasoning/flavor). I probably wouldn't come here again. Not with other breakfast places so close by. I found their "Fresh Squeezed Strawberry-Orange Juice" misleading...but I guess they did "squeeze" it out of that gallon jug from the fridge. (Just kidding, it was two jugs, one for strawberry and one for orange juice.)
