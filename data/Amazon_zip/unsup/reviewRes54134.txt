I've always wanted to try one of Bayless's restaurants and came upon XOCO. I guess it depends on time of day, but there wasn't a huge line even if the place was hopping. All I have to say in this review is that just the mention of pork belly and/or Mexican restaurant immediately sends my mind to the Pork Belly and vermicelli soup at XOCO. The thought of it is mouth-watering. It is hearty, flavorful, has a little spice, just downright yummy. I would eat it weekly (not daily only because I crave other good foods...) given the opportunity. A meal in itself.
