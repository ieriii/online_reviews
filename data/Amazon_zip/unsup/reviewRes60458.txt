Never been treated so badly at a restaurant. In a nutshell...Running late for a 6:00 rez. Called and notified we'd be there at 6:15, was told no problem. Showed up at 6:20. One half of our party of 4 came to claim the table, while the other half went to park. At 6:25, the owner comes over and growls, "When's the rest of you're party coming?""They're parking, so whenever they find a spot." Saturday night in Andersonville. Who knows how long that'll take.Owner stomps away. Five minutes later, he comes over and says, "If they're not here in five or ten minutes, we'll have to do...something." Lots of attitude.I say, "Are you gonna throw us out?"He stammers for a second, then says, "It's been an hour. You're an hour late."I say, "It's been just over 30 minutes, and we called to tell you were were running late."He says, "It's not fair to the other customers. If they're not here in a couple of minutes, I'm gonna separate the table." (Meaning, I guess, that he was going to take the two two-tops that comprised our four top and split them apart.) Then he stomps away.We were just about to bail when the other half of our party showed up. It had taken them 20 minutes to park, and they weren't really into splitting, so we stayed and had a slightly-above-average, somewhat overpriced meal. (Both seafood dishes were way to fishy.) Our server was quite pleasant, but the irony is that he didn't try to rush us out like his boss probably would've wanted.Don't get me wrong: I understand where the dude was coming from. It was a crowded Saturday night, and things were hectic, but you never, ever, ever speak to your diners like that, no matter how trendoid you are.Never going back, and it would be great if y'all followed suit.
