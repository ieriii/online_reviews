Venimos aqui despues de tomarnos unas cerveza's en el Two way lounge. La compania era a todo dar! OH OH I better stop speaking Spanish before the Arizona police notices my awesome tan and demands documentation and proper ID from me......ha!! I was actually not sure what to expect coming here as everytime I drove past this joint it always looked packed full of Hipsters. But let me say I was pleasantly surprised walking in. It is a nice size and the bar is square in the middle. We got great seats at the bar(lucky us) and in front of a tv so we were able to watch the Blackhawks too! Nice....... The beer was good! I kinda forgot what we flexed here as the names arent coming to me at this moment. And no..........as you might probably assume I did not get ripped here! Im saving that for another occasion because I will be back !The bacon popcorn concoction was awesome!!!! Bacon cheese and popcorn together ....Dayuuummm SHake N Bake seal of approval! Hipster infestation level: 7 there is a number of literally Starvin artists/hipsters wandering in here. Hopefully the Bacon popcorn can fatten em up a bit.
