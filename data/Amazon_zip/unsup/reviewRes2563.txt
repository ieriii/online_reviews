hot doug's is awesome! they have the the weirdest and tastiest selection of hot dogs. if we lived in walking distance, my husband would probably eat there everyday. the duck fat fries on the weekends are to die for and in the long run, they will probably kill you. the only sad thing is that they are closed on sundays and early during the week which only leaves me craving for more! Cash only.
