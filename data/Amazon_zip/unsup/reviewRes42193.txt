LOVE everything about Gilt Bar. The dark, chic interior, upbeat yet relaxing music, and the fact that I feel like Nucky Thompson could waltz in at any second. Make no mistake - this place is as modern and cool as it gets - but with a strong prohibition era vibe. That's a vibe that's tough to modernize - but they did - sleekly and elegantly (yet casual at the same time - am I making sense?). Ok..on to more important things! The entire menu looks awesome. I have been 3 times, mainly for drinks and apps and I WILL return for dinner ASAP. The french fries are ridiculously good! They're hand cut kennebec potatoes which, I learned from our server, are starchier making for an amazingly crisp fry with a creamy melt-in-your-mouth center. They're perfectly seasoned and even more decadent with the garlic aioli. Also tried the toast which was grilled to perfection and had that hint of garlic that can only be achieved by rubbing a fresh clove on directly after grilling. Our table had it served with creamy burrata, chunky fresh pea puree with thinly shaved radishes - AH-mazing! I loved both sparkling cocktails I've tried (disclosure: anything with bubbles has my name on it) - the Le Bar St. Germain and the French 75 at Curio (lower level lounge). Both are perfectly enhanced with their respective additions, and most importantly not too sweet....perfect for summertime. Basically, I would live here if they allowed it.
