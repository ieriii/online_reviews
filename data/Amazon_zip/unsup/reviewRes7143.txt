A large portion of my big crazy Italian family showed up in Chicago over the weekend of my birthday, so I booked a reservation for 14 at Sapori. We all had a fantastic time and I am thrilled to say that I had a great birthday thanks in part to the great service and overall great night we had at this establishment. First of all, the table they had set up for us had personalized menus that said "Sapori Trattoria wishes Lisa a Happy Birthday!"..... I absolutely ate this up. I will absolutely remember this if I ever need to book another occasion; they know how to accommodate. The service for a party of 14 was excellent; everything came out of the kitchen like clockwork. Now.... the lobster ravioli.... oh, the lobster ravioli... *sigh*. Let's just say a) I almost licked my plate and b) I have no desire to know the nutrition facts on these little bundles of pasta perfection..... I just want to eat them all the time. The veal my bf enjoyed was also delish. I didn't manage to taste anyone else's food, but everyone was extremely happy with their meal. Sapori also let me bring in my own birthday cake, which scores even more points in the "good service/highly accommodating" category. The only thing to note about this place is that it's CROWDED. Make a reservation. (I mean, obvi make a reservation for a party as large as 14 like I had.... but what I'm getting at is just make a reservation, period.)
