The unorthodox logistics add to the anticipation (or frustration). The food is delicious and the accompaniments are even better: chocolate drinks, churros, flavored agua of the day. Yet I have to hold back on that 4th star because I don't feel at all compelled to return. Something is missing. It might be that the meat portions are so small, which makes the prices harder to justify. That, I suppose, is Xoco's Rick Bayless tax.
