I LOVE Garcia's. I grew up in the suburbs never knowing what I was missing out on! I was introduced to this restaurant when my fiance took me there for one of our first dates.  Ever since that date I've been obessed with Garcia's. Their salsa, tacos, enchiliadas, burritos- you name it. There is not one dish that has let me down. The staff is friendly and the owner is so sweet. Everything about it is what makes Garcia's my favorite Mexican restaurant. WAIT- I do take it back- they let me down once- summer of 09. After a long day I made it out to the city to find that they were remodeling, but it's ok the drive to their other location was just a couple miles down. :)
