Coast...you are losing your luster with your cheap electric candles that they turn on when you sit at the table. I think Coast is good....do I think Coast is any better than other cheaper BYOB places...not really.  Out of smoked salmon on a Sunday night at 7PM?? HUH? No Toro either??? I thought this place was supposed to be the upscale BYOB to all of the other evil step sister places...guess not.
