not really sure if you can call this korean food, but it's definitely tasty. all of the different types of fried chicken are excellent and the bibimbop burrito with brown rice is strangely addicting. the place itself is a little cramp so i would recommend take out or delivery since the food stands up pretty well to the commute. it may be a little on the pricey side, but the food is pretty distinct and a nice change of pace from typical asian fare.
