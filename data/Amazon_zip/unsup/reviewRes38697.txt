i give this place most of the stars for the decor and decent beer selection. the food was not impressive at all, in fact i could barely finish it. we had the onion rings to start, but they were contructed more like "onion straws," and soaked in so much oil i had to put down my fork after 3 bites. next we split the duck reuben, which was decent, but it to felt like it had been deep fried. all in all my experience was alright, but probably won't return. i can find better food with a much shorter wait, even in that area.
