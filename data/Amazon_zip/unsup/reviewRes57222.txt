We love the Bad Apple & have gone several times since moving to the neighborhood. They have a great selection of interesting burgers, the beef is grass fed, and the beer list is awesome. My favorite burgers are the Slow Burn, the Frenchie and the Edmund Fitzgerald. We almost always come with our three-year-old & they are always very accommodating.
