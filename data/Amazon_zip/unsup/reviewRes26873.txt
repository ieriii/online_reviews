I don't know what else I can say that'll change the existing compliments. Not hype at all, but this is definitely a special occasion type of restaurant so be ready to foot the bill, not only for the food but the wine. Servers and hosts are attentive and knowledgeable, quick to answer any questions and requests. And yes, plates are small, as with all restaurants of this caliber. These are not meant to be scarfed down, homies. You are not at ma's diner. These are tastings. This is refined dining. Think and eat, think and eat. APPRECIATE. There is a place and time for meals that'll add 3 inches to your waistline. The menu is divided into Cold and Hot (starters) and Sea and Land (main courses). No worries, there's a dessert menu, too for other sweet toothers like myself. Truffle popcorn is complimentary and delicious, as a few other complimentary chef selection's throughout the meal, which depends on the night you go, season, etc. My personal favorite was the take on American pie: in one bite of cheese, cinnamon tuile, and apple gelee I transformed into a giggly 10 y.o. eating my pop's pies. Personally I didn't want to opt for the prix-fixe. I don't think it's a "must" unless you're not used to how certain tastes go together, in which you may need a little helping hand to guide you... completely understandable. As for me, I wanted to pick things to my liking, and it would've rounded out to about the same price anyway. As far as the complaints about the entire table participation for the tasting menu, this is not the first restaurant in the world to do this, yet alone Chicago. Highlights: Hog cheek with hominy spaetzle, vidalia onion, dandelion green, pork rind. Heirloom duck with jerusalem artichoke, nappa cabbage, toast powder, apple butter.
