Love. This. Place. I ended up taking my friend there after she got a little lit at a company happy hour. We enjoyed the chicken sandwich, some churros and hot chocolate. I think if you're wanting a delicious meal but don't want to wait for Frontera or Topo, this is a perfect choice. Additionally, if you want a quick bite in a casual restaurant! The location is great and is easily accessible. Other favorites would be the veg soup, braised beef dish and delicious guacamole. The guac is enough for you to nosh on for 30 minutes with some drinks and be completely satisfied.
