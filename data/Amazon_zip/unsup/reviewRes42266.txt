My gosh, the people of The Art of Pizza truly are Leonardo DaVincis in terms of pizza dough and sauce. YUM YUM YUM. So delicious. Go for the deep dish/stuffed because you know you want it. My friends and I ordered stuffed pizza with green peppers. The crust was simply amazing- like eating breadsticks with your pizza. The green peppers were a great added flavor- not overpowering and very fresh. The sauce they use is amazing, and the seasoning on top of the pizza (which I am most certain there was, and it wasn't part of the sauce itself) added so much in a good, good way. The cheese- oh the cheese. It was top quality- not stretchy and stringy, but oooey and goooey. I was in heaven with this pizza. The only thing to slap me back down to earth was the fact that I was full, and had to stop eating the pizza from above. What you get for the price is soooo worth it. Edible masterpieces, my friends.
