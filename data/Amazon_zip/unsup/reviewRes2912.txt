This is by far my favorite upscale restaurant. I have been there about 5 times now and everytime is out of this world. It is very pricey especially if you get the wine pairings, but it is well worth the experience. I would highly recommend trying this place at least once. With the wine pairings and the chef's selection, you are looking at about $500 for two people. That is of course the biggest chef's station they offer, but if you are going to go that is the way to go for sure.
