Worth the hike... We try something new every time we're here and haven't been disappointed yet.  The menu can be a little daunting- it's like a mini novel with page after page of options.  I think my favorite discovery has been the chicken sizzling rice soup. It was a cold day and I was looking for tasty bowl of soup, but wanted to branch out beyond the standard egg drop/wonton/hot & sour options and I am so, so, so glad I did. It's now a standby, and one of those random things I'll get a serious craving for.
