I came here the other night, and thought the food was pretty damn good. I got the skirt steak and the macaroni and cheese, and ya i still like mac and cheese with everything!!!! The price was a bit pricey but overall thought the food was good. I had this shrimp appetizer and these cheese appetizers, the cheddar one i had was amazing, but the other one was nastier than bleu cheese, and tasted like 3 feet in my mouth. yuck!!!
