The ambiance at 90 miles is very welcoming. From the salsa music, to the bright murals, to the TV playing black and white Cuban movies, it's an interesting setting. Not sure if it's authentic or hokey (leaning towards the latter), but it is pleasant nonetheless. The food is mostly very good. Tostones (fried savory plantains) are a little dry but interesting, and the choripan (chorizo, onions, and peppers on bruschetta) is a nice, if messy, appetizer. The main courses are also pretty good, but not spectacular: the churrasco (grilled skirt steak served with chimichurri and yuca con mojo) is good, although rather than all the steak being cooked medium rare as I ordered it, some were medium and others were rare. Still, a delicious and cheap steak dish. Braised beef is delicious, as is the red snapper. In summary: An interesting alternative to the plethora of Taquerias in Chicago. I will likely be back!
