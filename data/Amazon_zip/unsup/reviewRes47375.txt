A group of friends wanted to find a rock bar similar to Kuma's, but didn't require you to camp outside the doors over night and possibly get a table by the next Olympics. As you could probably tell from the name, Lockdown's ambiance is meant to replicate that of a prison with only a .91% chance of any actual sodomy. Steel chairs and tables, steel wallpaper, and various cages with puppets inside might be a bit of an exaggeration to what a state prison really looks like, but if you're willing to sell bootleg snuff DVDs outside of city hall without a permit and prove me wrong, I'll buy you a carton of smokes. The menu is mainly your basic pub grub, but they give every item a cleverly violent nickname which I'll admit is catchy. While I didn't have any of the food when I went there, my peers seemed to think it was very tasty, and not too overly priced. I was pretty impressed with their selection of beers until I realized that most of them were bottled. I normally don't like going out and spending six dollars on a bottle of beer when I can buy a six pack for a few dollars more and drink at home, but their beer menu is very good for beer lovers, and to be honest, quite a few of their bottles can't be found in most liquor stores. They do have an average draft selection so it's really nothing to frown over. This bar deals mainly with metal music, which coming from an Industrial fan who thinks any other kind of music is inferior, I think it fits the atmosphere nicely. It's not a "bring your grandmother here and watch her freak!" kind of place, but more tongue in cheek gimmicky kind of setting that works for what it is. The staff was very friendly, it wasn't too loud to where you couldn't hear the person next to you, and most of all, I think this is a type of rock bar that doesn't require its customers to be into the scene to have a good time. If you're ever in the area with some friends and you want a place to hang out, stop in and have a round or two.
