My girlfriends took me here for my bachelorette party and it. was. awesome!! Go here and have a great time.  Also, they let my now-husband (woot!) send out champagne for the whole party over the phone and made it totally easy on him. He regrets that he can't remember the woman's name who helped him, but he said she was totally awesome. He thinks it starts with a "B"...ask for someone whose name starts with a "B".
