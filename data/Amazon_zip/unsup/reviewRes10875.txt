Absolutely my favorite pizza place in Chicago. Who want that thick, heavy crust with allt he topping dictated to you when you can have this yummy thin crust pizza and pick your own combo!? And, the best part: they don't drown the pie in cheese! Perfect... Oh, and quite possibly the best beer in Chicago. The stout is a must try beverage. It is a little loud though, so if you are thinking of going on a date, prepare to wait and to yell to your companion. Good part, if you think the date might be boring, plenty of people to watch and loads of tvs!!!
