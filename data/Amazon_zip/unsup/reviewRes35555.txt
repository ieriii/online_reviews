While Sun Wah is not a regular staple, I've been there many times over the years. It's cleaner now than it has been in the past, and the staff is friendlier as well.  I was there last night and order the Salt Baked Chicken (loved it, my compadre did not but he doesn't know what's good for him), vegetables with rice noodles (light and delicious flavor, a bit too heavy on the oil though) and won ton & noodles soup (delicious). The portions are HUGE -- I suggest getting a few things and ordering small sizes (which are not small and average around $4.00 per order).  Yes, there are dead-b-qued ducks hanging in the window, close your eyes is this is gonna freak you out. I still have a ton of left overs, anyone hungry?
