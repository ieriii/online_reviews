The snob in me wants to like Violet Hour - an unmarked lounge that you can only spot by the meandering crowds at the address where you expect to find it, drinks that have the right touches of unusual to be memorable, a chic interior that is more SoHo than Wicker Park...but the Chicagoan in me goes - what the heck does Violet Hour represent?! It's a great date venue, if your idea of a great date involves sitting upright in a high-back and sipping your fancy drink that you ordered if you managed to read the menu in the flickering light of a little candle! It's a great space to mingle - with those you know and you came with, cos the spaced isn't exactly geared towards walking the halls and saying hi to the random stranger - of course those opportunities are in abundance when you wait forever in the line inside, outside or leading to the common restrooms. I don't dislike Violet Hour; rather I really liked my spiced nuts sustenance; the Juliet and Romeo ( not the other way round mind you - maybe it was the rosewater!) was one the best gin drinks I've had in a while, and the ability to have a conversation without screaming at the top of my lungs didn't hurt either...but the exclusivity and air of it all seems rather misplaced for both the neighborhood and the experience inside. Maybe it's just a sign I am spending too much time in the midwest...
