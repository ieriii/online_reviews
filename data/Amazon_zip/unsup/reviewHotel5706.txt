This hotel was amazing. It sits at a great location, you walk out the door and you get a great view of the river front and buildings all around E Wacker and Michigan. The amenities inside the hotel are pretty thoughtful too: every floor has a water purifier water and water bottles that you can fill up yourself. At $139 a night it was a great deal for something with a great view and being inside the loop. P.S. free wifi!
