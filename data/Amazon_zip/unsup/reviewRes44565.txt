Cupcakes - subpar. They've always been dry as dust when I've gotten them (and I've tried them mutiple times). And not delicious-but-dry, just dry. Paczyki - deeeee-licious! Though I had them in 2006, and my sister just had them this year and said they were, what else, dry. I like the cakes they have in the window, though...
