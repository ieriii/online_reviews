There are so many restaurants in Greektown that it can be difficult to choose, but Greek Islands is my fave among the bunch. It's enormous so you can always get a table (although they do take reservations), affordable and I find their food to be pretty good too. The menu is quite large and can be a bit overwhelming, but I've found the following options are the best: * flaming saganaki cheese * cold spread sampler * gyros On my most recent visit I decided to be "healthy" (New Years Resolutions) and get the chicken kabobs. It didn't quite do it for me and I ended up indulging in my friend's patichio instead. Also good, but not quite healthy. They don't deliver (bummer), but we like getting take-out from here. And the loud atmosphere is also a great place to take the little ones.
