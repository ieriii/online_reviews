Best thing ever: sliced apples in their cheese fondue. I thought I was a hardcore ONLY bread and veggies dipped in cheese fondue, but that is not the case. As a matter of fact, I felt their cheese had a little too much bite on the savory items.  My friend and I went on a Wednesday or Thursday night and we got the cheese and chocolate fondue--we did not do a meat course. it was more than enough food by far and ended up being quite affordable even with a glass of wine each. If you don't want to spend a lot, it's a great option.
