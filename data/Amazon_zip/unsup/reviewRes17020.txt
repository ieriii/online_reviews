Out of the Indian restaurants I've tried in the downtown Chicago area, I have to say India House is the best so far. There are a few places I haven't been to though, like the new Gaylord and Jasmine. But as of now, this is my favorite around here. The food was excellent when we ordered for dinner. Lunch buffet is also good, but I feel buffets are never as good as ordering from the menu. You know how Mexican places will start you off with free chips and salsa? Well, India House gives you little bits of Naan with a dipping sauce that tastes like the gravy from Paneer Makhani. Wow... delicious. That's gotta be one of the best ideas ever.
