My first Brazilian steakhouse was a success! All the meats were cooked to perfection. I love how each slab of meat contained your preference of cooking - whether it'be medium or rare. Each type had its distinct taste that makes you yearn for more. Located a few blocks from Fogo, which by the way is cheaper in price than Fogo. Ambience is great, and service is impecable. They even have complimentary valet durin lunch hours. I will definitely go back! Can't wait!
