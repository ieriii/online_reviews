Ohhh SunWah. We have come along way, haven't we? I remember when sunwah's old location right around the corner. They have really stepped up their game. This renovation opened it up to Chicago instead of hiding their delicious treats. I family and I like to come here on special occasions. Most of the time: they are busy...not at all a surprise because that should be testament to their yummy eats. We happen to come here so much that we know the waiters/waitresses/owners....its ridiculous. I suggest you call in advance and make reservations, especially on weekends. They have a pretty comprehensive menu for all types of eaters. Obviously, their specialties are barbecues. They have a whole roasted duck which comes to your table on a rolling carving station and the carver cuts it before your eyes. The duck is sliced on your plate. Its a beautiful was to cut such a succulent duck. It was juicy and well cooked. The skin was crispy and the seasonings didn't over power the duck. The roasted pork is also just as tasty with their special sauce. Here are a few more suggestions on what you should get: crisp pan friend noodles with shrimp and vegetables, combination fried rice, and watercress in garlic sauce. They also have "over rice" dishes for those who would like a quick bite. They have a fully stocked bar but they also have BYOB for a small corkage fee. The restaurant is clean, the service is fast and friendly ....as well as informative on their menu, and the food is beyond excellent. I am glad they revamped their style but their food has always been good. A must see if you are in the argyle area.
