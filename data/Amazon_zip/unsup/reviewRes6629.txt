This place is awesome! Came with a group of 10, told they didn't take reservations so I put my name down at 1930 and we hung out at the bar. Bar was nice, good beer selection, and of course plenty of wine options. Bartender was also pretty efficient so we never had to wait. Time flew by but we were getting hungry. At 2030, asked again and was told maybe 15 minutes. Hung out for a bit longer, and a 2100 asked again - this time the manager was really apologetic and said it'll be ready very soon. We get seated about 2115 and then out comes 2 orders of bruschetta and 2 pizzas - gratis for having to wait so long! Food was awesome, and the 'small plates' concept works well. Unlike most other tapas/small plates restaurants - I think you actually get a decent amount of food for the cost. Wine selection was massive and it was great to be able to just pick a bottle off the wall and know what it looks like and costs (which is a steal compared to any other italian restaurant I've been to range $12-35 per bottle). We all ordered a bunch of entrees and shared them and I didn't taste anything I didn't like. The rigatoni with sausage was excellent, and every kind of pizza was solid. I would especially recommend the pizza with the fried egg on top - incredible. Skipped dessert because were were full but even will all the bottles of wine and entrees, the bill came to $23 a person including tip! Not a bad deal at all! Service was really top-notch and the staff seems to take some pride in working there and actually enjoy their job. Davanti Enoteca is different Italian place for Taylor St. It's not the intimate atmosphere you get at Francescas, and the food and restaurant design really cater to a group dining experience. I think this is a welcome, and excellent addition to the neighborhood - I hope they stick around for a while.
