Some quick tips: - The wait is like torture, especially if you're hungry and all you can do is watch people stuff their faces with fresh out of the oven pizza - The pizza is fresh out of the oven (it's hot!) ... so don't burn the roof of your impatient mouth like I did - Wicker Park is kinda bougie, so expect bougie prices ... each topping is $1.75 - $2.00 - As good as Piece is, it's not a New York Pizza ... do not be misled - Totally worth hitting up if you've got some extra dough and you don't mind waiting ... last night's white pizza (olive oil, garlic, mozz/parmesan) with mushrooms, ricotta and meatballs did not disappoint.
