Really great pizza and outstanding micro brew. However, they didn't do a good job on the building. I like the architecture but it does not follow function as the fundamentals of design go. All that aside I go there often even some times just to pick up a growler of the blond ale. It's all really good stuff if you can take the massive crowds there.. Do it and decide on your own.
