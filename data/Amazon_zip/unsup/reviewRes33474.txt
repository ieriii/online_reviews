If you're hungry near the Museum Campus but not keen on museum food, this could be a good choice. It's loud, probably a fine place to take kids. Friendly helpful staff. I liked my veggie omelet (or garden omelet?) -- zucchini, tomatoes, asparagus, mushrooms, onions, monterey jack, and sour cream. It was massive (maybe too massive?) but had a good variety of textures and flavors. The eggs themselves were nicely fluffy. I didn't find it cheesy or salty enough, but take that with a grain of salt, as I tend to put salt on everything. I also added tabasco, which gave it more kick. There are lots of counter seats, so it's a decent spot for solo diners. (Though the counter was packed so tight it was hard to spread out a newspaper or magazine).
