My husband and I had date night a few weeks ago and headed out to Carnivale. We had a great meal, friendly service and a wonderful time. Even though the restaurant is huge, we had an intimate feeling at our table. The waitress was informative and was able to suggest a rum flight for my husband, which he loved and the food, oh the food. It was fabulous. I can still taste the braised beef short rib. We had such a nice time that will be remembered for years to come. Thanks for creating a special date night for us!
