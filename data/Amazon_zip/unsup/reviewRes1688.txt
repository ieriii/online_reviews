I guess this review is more for my benefit than for Yelp's...704 reviews holy crap! I was driving "through" Chicago (Naperville to Milwaukee--slight detour) and figured this was my last chance to go to Hot Doug's since I'm quitting my travel-heavy job next month. So I went, it was chilly and raining and the line really wasn't too bad. It was about 1:30 and the end of the line was maybe 5 or 6 people outside the door. I had been expecting worse and I had an umbrella, so happy day. Unfortunately I was alone, so I couldn't split a bunch of dogs with a bunch of friends and just ordered one of the specials: whiskey and fennel sausage with a red pepper mayo and burning nettles cheese (whatever that is). It wasn't a life-changing experience but it was damn good and definitely worth $8. I wouldn't order it again if only because there are so many other dogs I want to try! I think what impressed me most about this place was that when I got to the front of the line, the guy (Doug himself, I presume?) was totally friendly and patient. Back east the guy at the front of that line would be an angry, condescending asshole and people would love him for his arrogance, but at Hot Doug's I got service with a smile. Just one of the many reasons I really, really, really like Chicago. Thanks, Doug.
