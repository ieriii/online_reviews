The fried chicken looks and smells delicious, but I was in the mood for a rice bowl. I had the Chi-town chicken bowl which consists of white rice and chicken sauteed chicken with creamy, garlicky and slightly tangy sauce topped with scallions. The food came out very quickly but appeared fresh nonetheless. I'll have to come back and try the bimbop bowls, all of which look yummy and intriguing (with nontradional items like corn).
