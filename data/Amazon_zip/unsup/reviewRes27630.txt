I liked Frontera Grill. I've eaten at Xoco many times, and I'm quite familiar with the career arc of Chef Bayless. The food at Frontera was good - the quality was what I expected. The service was friendly and professional, too. So I'm definitely a fan. But for me it didn't break into my rank of favorites. Maybe it was my dish, which was good, but just not very interesting. The description sounded fantastic, and it did taste good, but it was much less interesting, both visually and taste-wise, than the description led me to believe it would be.  So, bottom line, it was good food - certainly better than average for this price point. I enjoyed my visit and I don't have any real complaints. But I think for me to give them five stars, I'd have to want to wait in their super-long lines (I was there under one of their rare reservations that seem to be allowed mostly for out-of-towners like the couple I ate with). I'd happily go again with a reservation or on some rainy night when people haven't mobbed it, but I don't think I'd be willing to wait in a long line for it, which is why I am a fan, but not a five-starred one.
