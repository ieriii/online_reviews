Anniversary of 13 years brought us to Piccolo Sogno. I wish I could figure out the mixed reviews, from five stars down to one! Is everyone's tastes and expectations that different?  The one low score I had to laugh at was the review from a gal that complained that the seats outside were wet after a downpour. Like they should have controlled the weather better! Franco was our waiter who provided excellent service. One of the specials was a pasta with black truffles. I thought this might be too rich - since I am fond of truffles just as a garnish, so our waiter suggested having it split as an appetizer. Glad we did. I couldn't believe the fantastic flavor it possessed.  Sea bass was excellent. Dessert plates had happy anniversary written in chocolate - nice touch.  Only thing i can say for constructive advice is to give more room between the tables. But the place was packed as it was. They must be doing something right!!!
