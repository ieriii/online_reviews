Like hair metal, The Cosby Show and your older brother, Bongo Room used to be cool. I can only assume people are waiting around for an hour because they are trying to relive Bongo Room experiences from 2001. Here's the thing, though, none of the stuff I listed is actually as good as you remember. You are better off with your faded and dusty memories than you are rubbing elbows with the mondo condo set wondering how you ever claimed the Bongo Room breakfast burrito once made you orgasm loudly. Maybe Bongo Room will be cool again. Like parachute pants and eating goose liver. Crown jewel: My fuzzy happy recollection of walking over and getting a table in five minutes for some unhurried and lovingly prepared morsels. Avoid: Hell, if you are into it, keep going so I won't see you hogging the tables at the places that are good now.
