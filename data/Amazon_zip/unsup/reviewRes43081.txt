Winter in Chicago is getting old. Delivery is a lifesaver, especially when you live close but are still lazy when faced with wind chill. Now, one of my favorite pizzas in the city belongs to Pizza, Art of. Their butter crust is similar to Lou Malnati's, but liked it better overall. They could probably get away with charging more given their competitors in the city, but don't tell them I said that.
