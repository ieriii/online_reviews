big fan of chicago korean food. unfortunately this place has been disappointing all 3 times i've gone. i've had lunch there with a friend, dined alone and took a group of 8 people. service terribly inconsistent and downright rude. they never come to check once you get your food. meat portions small. waited very long for food. never asked if we wanted another round of beverages. finally, they are pricier than other korean restaurants nearby with better food and service.
