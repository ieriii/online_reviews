I had high expectations and was let down by this place. What's the hype all about? You can get flatbread and salads with funky greens and bland dressings anywhere. Half of the menu has flatbread pizzas, the one we ordered was boring and bland. The heart of palm salad was tasteless. The olives were good, but how hard is it to warm up some olives? The rigatoni was hard and the sauce was nothing for me to write home about.  MUCH better Italian places in this neighborhood. I feel like they are running with the small, shared plate trend and charging way too much money for ordinary food. Oh and by the way, the waiter was rude and snobby. Made my husband and I feel like it was a pain for him that he got our table (we came at about 4:30 on a Sunday with my 1 1/2 year old son). Disappointment.
