This place is great. The atmosphere is really cute and the staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The wine list is pretty extensive and a little intimidating since I had never heard of ANY of the italian wines that were listed, but our waitress was very patient with us and inquired about what qualities we like in wine and then gave us a great recommendation. The salads and main dishes were very good at just the right proportion size. I left feeling totally satisfied without that overstuffed italian food feeling
