This is a really nice golden-age hotel on the waterfront. I have to say, I didn't explore the dance floor, but the room had one of the best hotel beds.... I suppose you come to expect all-down bedding and an ultra-plush pillowtop mattress from a hotel at this level, but it was like sleeping in a cloud. The mini bar was stocked with the good stuff, including Bombay Sapphire (my personal fave). Classy bar, classy mirrored elevator.... smallish reception desk. I think people need to give the hotel a break.... it was built before swimming pools were common. My one prob with the hotel room was the bathroom. It did not have a tub, but a walk-in glass walled shower. So there was no way to have a bubble bath, first off. Secondly, the glass sCrEeched! When the door was closed, as it was glass-on-glass. Needless to say, since there was no seal, water leaked onto the bathroom floor. The other problem was the rain shower. You could only turn on the water and adjust the temperature while standing next to the hand held spigot ... right under the rain showerhead!! So.... you are forced to endure a few seconds of cold water from the shower head (even my attempts to squeeze into a corner of the shower stall did not spare me) as you switch from the handheld to the shower head. BAD design... I also had gotten the Groupon for $89 and spent Valentine's evening here, and I admit I might be giving it three stars if I'd paid full retail price. However, with the discount, the big bed, the cleanliness, and the super location, I am satisfied.
