The Publican is a lot of fun. I've been twice now, having been turned onto it by Chicagoland friends. The beer list is extensive and varied: my fave is the Three Floyds Gumball Head because of the local flavor. Today we had: Hamachi and grapefruit: wonderful Fries with egg: stupid good Couscous with beef tongue and other meats: savory but all the meats save the tongue were too fatty for my taste; that is my own ethnocentrism however Radish salad: tasty and fresh with the greens; raw Beats: good but nothing special Steak tartar: fennel and radishes; this was amazingly savory and really popped Definitely worth a visit.....before you try to squeeze into the Girl and the Goat, come to the Publican
