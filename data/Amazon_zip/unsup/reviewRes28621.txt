food- small portions, but don't go if you are really hungry/a foodie. go for the amazing libations. alex, the bartender is amazing.... down to earth and just spot on with a mix of knowledge, personality, and the ambience speaks for itself. go, just go for the bar alone. if i would run this joint i'd talk up the bar over the food, b/c it's just better all around. you will NOT be left unhappy.
