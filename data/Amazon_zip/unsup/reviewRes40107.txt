Another establishment that moves to Logan Square and trumps anything in Lakeview. Great bar to stop in for a drink, and you should never worry about the wait. They mix a proper Old Fashioned which will keep you company. Nice set of bar snacks, but that is what they are for: the bar. Don't complain about a small plate, as the prices are low enough to build a full menu and share tastes. For a proper sized appetizer, grab something of the plate menu. I was most impressed by the dinner, as the veal and the pork comfit were exceptional. Even with drinks it was reasonable.  In summary, you can eat VERY well here for $30-$50/person with drinks. Expect to pay $8/drink for a mixed drink, $12 for a sandwich, and $18-25 for an entree.
