The line is long, but it is totally worth it! With prices so low on such high quality food, it is no wonder people will stand in line. Three of us shared three courses and all got our own hot cocos for $15 a person. Not only do they have great chocolate everything, but it is the only chocolate without perspectives in Chicago.
