This place is what I would call a classy sports bar. I came here during the winter months of 2011 and it had a very nice atmosphere and the place looked really nice. The greatest part of this place was the quality of drink. The bartenders put a lot of booze in the drinks, which is always a sign of good quality. Aside from that, this place can get very crowded, especially at the height of any Chicago sporting event.
