The food was Americanized. WE got Family Style---What a joke. Childsize portions and way overpriced. Rude waiter, and above all it was for my birthday. They ran out of lamb and white meat chicken after one helping. I would go to any other restaurant out of the 1,000s in Greektown above this place anyday. Choose another restaurant!!!
