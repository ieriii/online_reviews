Two words: Yummmm And Meh... The hot chocoate and churros are wonderful! The pepito...meh. Honestly, for $12 one would expect a little more than a few pieces of beef on a roll. Granted, the roll was good quality and the beef was ok, but the price is a little outrageous. I'll give it a second chance though. I'd like to try the caldos which look pretty good. I just wish the name wouldn't jack up the prices.
