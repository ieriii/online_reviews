Sushi X is loved in our household. If we want to go out for dinner, it isn't too far away from our house, is BYOB (which is a big plus in my book) and parking isn't horrible. We have never had any great problem getting a seat and once we do, we love the sushi!  I typically judge every sushi place on the Spicy Tuna and I really like Sushi X's. But it is the strength of the other rolls that keeps me coming back. They are dolled up rolls, but as someone who is new to sushi, it was a great way for me to try new fishes or be a little more adventurous.  We have always had courteous interaction with the employees whether we went into the store front or we ordered delivery.
