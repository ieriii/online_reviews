Wow, what diversity in a hot dog place!!! A little over the edge for my standards and I eat just about anything. This place is always packed, and there's a good reason for it. Get there early before noon or after 1:30 unless you enjoy waiting in line for about a half hour. Well worth the wait though if your in the mood for a hot dog, polish, or brat with a twist of whatever Doug's got on his ever changing menu. Thank God (and Doug) for encased meat!!
