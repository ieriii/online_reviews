hands down, my favorite Greek restaurant of all time.  authentic Greek food, SUPERattentive wait staff that speak to one another (& the clientele should they also speak the language) in Greek, and surroundings that feel and smell like your in the islands.  though quite touristy, my Greek friends also come here at midnight on Easter with their entire family - i'm talking 25-30 people (all of which will vouch for the food). i have brought my friends/family here and we've always had good, good times. must haves: saganaki, avgolemono, dolmades, mousaka, grilled baby octopus. for first timers, try the combination plate and/or vegetarian plate for a lil' bite of everything. Yes, OPA! bring me more saganaki.
