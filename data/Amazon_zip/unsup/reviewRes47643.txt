THE REVIEW This year I got to celebrate my B-Day twice! I chose the venue and my friends picked up the tab. Awesome friends, I know. Zed451 has two parts: the steakhouse and the lounge/patio bar I ate at the steakhouse which is $55 a person and modeled after a Churrascaria. Oops! I didn't know that! So my poor friends which have varying incomes were forced to spend $55 plus 10% tax and 20% tip just for the price of admission. Ouch! I'd love to say that a Max M Birthday is worth that price, but I'd be smoking crack. So I felt guilty, but I figured that Zed451 would vindicate my choice of venue. It is a beautifully designed steakhouse that could easily pass as one of Vegas' upscale restaurants. Fiamma or Craftsteak at the MGM Grand comes to mind. Fireplaces, clean lines, intimate lighting are just a few of the aesthetic strengths. We had a beautiful table towards the back of the restaurant. Big mistake. This table was the only one able to accomodate our party of 10. It was right below the heating vents. Needless to say, everyone started getting shiny faces. It took 4 requests before they turned down the heat. By then ,everyone was ready to strip. Note to self: request large table for 10 when accompanied by hot females. We ordered 2 different bottles of wine to start. The server asked some guests if they needed a glass change when switching wines. Hello??? Umm, Yes! Cabernet? Syrah? Malbec? Who cares? It's all the same. "C'mon Zed. Get your act together! You're making the host look bad on his B-Day!" At this point, I'm praying that the food saves the day. "Steak is pretty money", I tell myself. If this place is as good as Texas de Brazil, then I'll save face. The salad bar selection isn't as good or vast as Texas de Brazil's. Unfortuntely, the meat isn't as good either. Zed's does score points for creativity. Instead of using the green puck or coaster, they use river stones. You simply just place a river stone by your napkin to cue the servers. The servers took way too long in between servings. That has NEVER happened to me at a Churrascaria. Usually, you have to fend the waiters off. I was tempted to throw the river stone at the servers. The meat wasn't seasoned well. Some pieces were still mooing. The selection wasn't very deep or broad. The best thing I ate was the tempura Sea Bass! I repeat: The best thing that i ate was the tempura Sea Bass...we're in a steakhouse. The best things that i had were: Sirloin Soy Ginger Glazed Flat-iron Flank steak Tempura Sea Bass Short Ribs Granted, none of this tasted better than Texas de Brazil. Dessert is also not included. When the check finally arrived, I had given good thought to jumping into their gigantic flame oven. I didn't see the check, but I estimate the average came out to $120-$130 a head! Yowsers! Thank god that I have terrific friends. As of now, they still return my text messages, phone calls, and emails. Then again, they could be waiting for me to return the favor. Let me guess, we're heading to Charlie Trotter's or Joe's Stone Crab and Steak and Max is picking up the tab. =) I'll be back to chill on the patio when the weather warms up. Until then... http://www.youtube.com/w ...Zed's dead baby. Zed's dead.
