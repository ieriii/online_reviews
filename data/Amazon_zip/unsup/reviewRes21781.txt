According to Justin Timberlake, good things come in boxes. Superdawg is no exception. I'm hunched at my desk, mindlessly chowing down on my awesome hot dog, and I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place. It gets a lot of attention due to its drive-in, 50s decor, and of course the two twelve-foot-high hot dogs perched on the roof (Maurie and Flaurie, respectively). So yeah, there's the novelty factor, but what keeps me coming back is the quality of the food. Better beef (at least, better beef in a box) you won't find anywhere. The menu is limited - think lots of red meat with some grilled cheese and ice cream concoctions thrown in for good measure. You can order at the counter (tip: it's usually less crowded there) or from your car (more fun and 'authentic', especially for newcomers). Service? Well, let's just say this isn't the Nordstroms of red-hot joints. But it's decent enough, and I've certainly never had a problem.  It can get crowded around mealtimes, and the parking lot is probably one of the more unnavigable in Chicago. Expect your trip there to be a production - but once you hand over your cash (between $5-8, per person) you'll find a delicious combo of Superdawg, fries and a pickle crammed into a tiny, goofily decorated box. Sold!
