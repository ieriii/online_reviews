****4.5 STARS**** OH MAGNIFICENT SULTAN!!! RAIN DOWN UPON US YOUR DELICIOUS FALAFEL!!  Yeah...this place is pretty damn good!! I think it's probably the best place in the city to get Middle Eastern food (best falafel for sure). I'm sure someone knows about some little obscure place in West Rogers Park, but that's like 60 blocks north dude and I'm not goin' up there, so Sultan's is for me!  The food is really good, and that's a great place to start. They have many different menu items and also degrees of spiciness for their food, so you can choose like 5 different degrees of spice (appeal to the masses...I like it). The decor inside is great. It's dark, cozy and exotic, and there are always people here, so it never feels dull. They have some great "little things" that add to the charm, like the different middle-eastern candies and drinks they sell by the counter, and I have never been unhappy with the service (lived nearby, frequent customer). The only reason I cannot give 4 stars is because I have had many parking related issues in the neighborhood. if Sultans would let me park in their alley, they would get 5 stars for sure!
