This place is extra sexy with some of the best sushi I've ever tasted! It's best to have a reservation, but they will seat you at the sushi bar or community table without one. The service is great! If you are a sushi lover, you will not be disappointed. Also, try the "oh no you didn't"...it's extra yummy!
