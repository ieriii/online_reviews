I went to Chicago with my girlfriend over Memorial Day Weekend, and she had a tour book that recommended three different Chicago-style pizza places. Those recommendations were Giordano's (the guide book's favorite), Gino's East, and Pequod's. The one we didn't try was Giordano's, so I am eagerly looking forward to visiting Chicago again to try it, because if it's better than Pequod's, I may just move there. Since this is a review about Pequod's, maybe I should mention it. It was outstanding. Being from the San Francisco Bay Area, I've gotten used to Zachary's Chicago style pizza in Berkeley. While Gino's East was different but ultimately a notch below Zachary's, Pequod's stood right up to it. The caramelized cheese was great, the sauce was delicious... I've been thinking about that place for two solid months since leaving. I'm desperately thinking of a reason to return to Chicago, just so I can get some more Pequod's. And I'm definitely buying a T-shirt next time, just so I can advertise for them out in CA. This may be blasphemous, but if they opened up one in the Bay Area, there's an outside chance I would never eat Zachary's again.
