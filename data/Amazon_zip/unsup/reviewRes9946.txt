I finally had the opportunity to check this place out a few weeks ago. I typically like a "breadier" pizza crust then the thin crust Piece uses, but I thought it was a very fresh tasting pizza. I could taste the fresh ingredients. My date and I had a large red pizza with sausage, mushrooms, and red peppers. Overall, it was a good pizza (though Lou Malnati's is my all time favorite). For me, this place really shined because of the beer they brew. My date and I had the Worryin Ale - Rye Beer and the Top Heavy Hefeweizen - South German-style Hefeweizen. The hefeweizen was so good, I had to order two. The ambiance was ok and it was a bit loud, but then again it should be expected since it's a busy venue with a clean bar feel. I'd definitely go again... but the pizza won't be what draws me back. It's the hefeweizen!
