Great company, service, atmosphere, and food. In that order. It's "finer" dining, but I wouldn't consider this fine dining. We tried their "surprise Sunday" 7-course menu, where the chefs pick out the freshest ingredients from the local markets and then see what yummy food he can make out of the ingredients. Food was interesting, I would say every other dish was really good. We were a bit taken back by the opening app...sashimi, ok, fine. Fig, great. Sunflower center? Ok, never tried it, good. But fried veal brain? Uh...ate it and it was kinda gross. 2nd up was the scallops..wow, that was amazing. Then came the cold watermelon soup with a few drops of hot sauce...it's ok, but didn't love it. And the 4th dish was good again...grilled cod and duck confit, outstanding. By this time, we were already pretty full, but we couldn't resist when the pork belly, grilled pork, soba noodle, and wild mushroom came. Then it's time for dessert...two desserts. First one is the butterscoth sorbet with ginger salt, sesame shave, and mint. And to be honest, I forgot what the next dessert was exactly, but I remember it being pretty unique and tasty as well. All in all, it's worth a trip here, but if you are looking for a fine dining experience, or for something truly unique, this place is close, but not exactly it.
