In a blind taste test versus all other deep dish pizzerias in Chicago Art of Pizza would win hands down. I still have to say that nostalgia makes me love crunchy cornmeal crust like at Gino's, Lou's sauce, and Giordano's spinach filling. But Art wins across the board for freshness and flavor in all of its ingredients, alone or together. I highly recommend going for tomato, spinach, onion and garlic deep dish. Addendum: This is day four on eating the Art of Pizza from the fridge. After reheating it in the oven every day since we overordered, I have got to recant on saying any crust was superior to Art's. It came slightly damp from condensation, but the oven made the carryout perfectly crisp. I wish it was like Strega Nona's pot of everflowing noodles. Addendum #2: On the Pan v. Deep Dish Wars: Just ordered the pan style, same ingredients as above. Not as mind blowing as the deep dish because it lacks the luscious layer of red sauce-- in the pan, sauce is more of a glaze, and breadiness and cheese dominate. Also, the tomatoes and onions are not as thoroughly cooked as the pan. Go with stuffed/deep dish.
