Why is the pig purple? Just thought of that now.... We had an early lunch here when we arrived in Chicago and had really amazing food. We chose a few items including croquettes, the porchetta, prosciutto and salad. Wished I had some of the smears and a few of their homemade cheeses. Loved the atmosphere, busy, loud, a real "tapas-y" type of joint.  They lose a star because our waitress was a fri-gid. Didn't crack a smile once, but I figured it was because she hated tourists or something. Despite her, I would still go back and order another round of many a varied things. Get the pork shoulder in milk-apparently it's a hot item.
