I had a craving for Italian and we decided to go here because of their $30 menu for ANY app, meal, desert -or- app, 1/2 pasta, meal.  It's a great way to try anything on their menu without spending too much. The total amount of food we had was enough to stuff two starving people. Everything we ate was really good. The grilled octopus was very very tender. Our server was awesome! Gave great recommendations. We will be back.
