I love this place! I haven't tried the whole menu but the Fried Chicken and Buddha Bowls are amazing. The Crispy BBQ and Seoul Sassy flavors are the two best. The people who work there are always very friendly and you can normally chat with the owner while you munch away on the delicious mess of fried chicken. I suggest trying the chicken the first time there and then going back for a Buddha Bowl. For those of you who are unfamiliar with a Buddha Bowl. Its basically a bunch of brown rice and delicious vegetables thrown together with a over-easy egg on top. They have three variations of the Bowl with each containing more veggies than the last. I get the bad boy with beef added as suggested by the owner. Two words for you "MUST TRY" -E
