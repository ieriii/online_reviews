670 Reviews !! That's the current number of reviews that the Bongo room has. That should tell you the volume of awesomeness that this brunch place gets. Get there early, before it opens and you will get seated right away. Red velvet pancakes are to die for. The service is brisk but decent. The line that you see when you come down is worth waiting for.  Come try a little slice of heaven in Wicker park :)
