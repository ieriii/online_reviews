Get the pork belly. The communal tables can be a big winner or big loser, great for eaves dropping on people. We happen to sit by some people where so ridiculous it was almost more entertaining than a statement on how pathetic society is...  Our Service we ok, (almost alone worth giving 3 stars). Our server must have been in the weeds, the manager was helping quite a bit and was good but some of what we asked for was lost in translation. It took forever to get our check when it wasn't all that busy - which is a frustrating way to end the night. As for the food, we go the trio of ham which was good, my wife loved them, I just don't get excited about saved meat anymore. My wife had the mussels which she still hasn't stopped talking about 2 weeks later.... I thought they were good, but the broth lacked the bread dipped flavor I so love. For dessert we had the waffle, nothing to write home about -- the ridiculous people next to us wouldn't stop raving about it and we ended up falling for it hook, line and sinker. Be aware, half the restaurant is communal seating the other half is four seater booths w/ saloon doors -- odd but could be fun..... (maybe next time)
