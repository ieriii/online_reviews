mmmmmmmm this place has it all, good cheap food, friendly staff and some goodies you can buy from around the world. My husband and I got a dinner for two (with leftovers) for under $20. We both had a spicy falafel sandwich, lentil soup and I tried an egg and cheese pastry that was very unique and pretty good. We will be going back and I think I may try the 5.99 buffet, it looked pretty interesting.
