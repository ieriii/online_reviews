I love the crust! That is the best part! It's crumbly and light - not too doughy like a lot of deep dish places in the city. The caramelized edges are so good. We got Green Pepper and Tomato - our favorite combo.  I could care less about the service at a pizza joint - it was really busy the door kept opening like every 2 minutes....but the staff handled it well. We didn't wait for anything expect our check.  Great pizza!!!! I will certainly go back :)
