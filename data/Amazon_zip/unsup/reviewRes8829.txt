This place is great; good prices, good atmosphere and not too noisy given a relatively small space. Plus Ravenswood is always a delight and parking is a breeze. One thing to note: this place *only* does pizza(plus dessert and appetizers), so if you're thinking "oh, we can get pizza for the kids and maybe some pasta or something else", that ain't gonna happen. Also, this place gets busy so you might want to call ahead. We were lucky enough to reserve but I heard time quotes of up to a half an hour wait for indoor seating(this was around 7:30 on Friday...the owner was around to hand out samples to those having to wait. He was very friendly and you could tell he loves what he does) The good news is the pizza here is really good. The "crust" is not your typical bread. It tastes incredibly fresh and chewy without being mushy. I usually skip pizza crust at the end but I ate mine up. We ordered 3 pizzas which was good for 4 people(plus a small appetizer and a bottle of wine). Standouts were the spinach and goat cheese as well as the prosciutto. The mushroom was slightly disappointing. We were expecting portobello but they were kind of boring button mushrooms. Still tasted good though(again, that bread..). I will say, the flavors were very subtle. We ordered a bottle of Syrah that had some zip and it kind of overwhelmed the pizza a bit. I'm not a big wine snob, but i definitely would have chosen a more mellow wine. Total bill with dessert and coffee came to about $130 with tip. Not bad at all and we will definitely be back.
