I don't remember the last time I've enjoyed a restaurant so much. From the atmosphere to the drinks to every last bite off my plate, Graham Elliot is a genius. The ambiance is very relaxed rock and roll its the food of RL without the stuffiness which is exactly what I love. We started with drinks at the bar cause the restaurant was booked for the night, no surprise there. The wine pours were generous and fantastic. We got the caprese salads and buffalo chicken for appetizers. The balsamic sorbet with the caprese is out of this world and the sauce on the chicken is unlike anything Ive ever tried. We finished with the gyro which was so flavorful. During the whole meal we snacked on the truffle popcorn. This man is a genius and deserves all of his success. At the end of our meal we were fortunate enough to meet him. Real nice guy and amazing time, Ill be back soon.
