3.5 stars Bin 36 is a wine bar and restaurant. This spot is pretty popular on weekends. They offer several wine flights. you can savor artisanal cheeses with the wines. The wines were okay. So I wouldn't expect amazing wine here. It's just a nice spot to chill for a couple of hours over a couple flights of wine, cheese, and their bread sticks. The prices here are very reasonable. The flights will cost $12-$15 for 4 glasses of 1.5-2.0 ounce pours. I did order the Grilled Hanger Steak with blue cheese streudel, leeks, and red wine sauce. This was really yummy for only $23.50! The steak portion was very generous. I love Hanger Steak which is a very unusual cut to find on restaurant menus. The streudel was love rolled up into a buttery flaky piece of pastry dough. The blue cheese isn't overbearing at all. My only complaint is that the red wine glaze was too sweet. I've yet to experience a wine bar in Chicago that I adore. Bin 36 is respectable, though. I recommend it for groups of 3-4 people.
