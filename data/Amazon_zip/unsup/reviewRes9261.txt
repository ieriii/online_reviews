I can never understand it when people say they don't understand the French/Vietnamese combo. Vietnam was colonized by France and it's influences are still strong there. It' a completely normal and delicious combination. That said, the dishes at Le Colonial are light and refreshing. I don't know that I'd say that anything I had was amazing. The food is very fresh and delicious. For dinner I had the beef salad. It was very good, filled with basil, lemongrass and with a delicious chili lime vinaigrette.  People say this is an expensive meal, and I agree that it isn't cheap, but I think the price is well worth it. Fresh ingredients prepared well is worth the cost, I think. And, for 3 appetizers, one main course and dessert, $55 wasn't too bad!
