VERY VERY OVERRATED. The dogs were decent, The fries were alright, a little soggy. The price is waaaay too much for what your getting. Really I can go anywhere else in the city get a better hot dog and fries for under $2.50. I understand that its a chicago icon, but that doesn't mean you should be able to rip your customers off.
