Five stars for everything except the price. The meal for two people with wine pairing was almost $1000! It was a FANTASTIC experience. Their service was exceptional and they made you feel REALLY exclusive. Oh yes, as I left the restroom on the way back to my table at the restaurant, a handsome gentleman smiled at me and I smiled back. Five seconds after that, I realized that was ZAC EFRON! Haha! The food: They have a prix fixe menu everyday so I can't really recommend what to order. Of course people that go their trust the chefs and let them decide. I had a 18-course dinner that night, every single one was excellent! Very novel presentation of the food and perfect combination of different flavors. My personal favorites were the hot potato cold potato and the black truffle explosion. Phenomenal!!!
