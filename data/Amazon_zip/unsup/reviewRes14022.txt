I want to give this place 5 stars. But I gotta knock one off just as a personal preference. That is, you can barely hear the music. So for 2 hours, your ears are filled with the loud chatter of the crowd. Again, just a personal preference. It's hard to find the perfect balance between the music and allowing people to carry table conversations. Now to the good stuff...I sincerely can't see how anyone can knock this place's food and decor. It's a big space with cool seating areas. Like another poster said there are nice spacious places to wait for your table. Huge bar with a large counter. Perfect size for a meal. The food...............5 star!!! No exxageration. We had the wings, mussels, mushroom burger and the smoked tomato pizza. Every dish was tasty and left me wanting more.
