I had read good reviews for India House, but I gotta tell you - not that great. I'd give them a solid "meh." Their menu has over 200 dishes to chose from, which is about 188 too many.  We asked the waiter for his recommendations and got a swordfish and chicken dish. The chicken, which boasted of being internationally acclaimed, was way over cooked and the swordfish tasted less than fresh. My friend and I each had 2 glasses of wine and walked outta there with a $100 bill. The meal was fine, but not great, and definitely over priced. Meh.
