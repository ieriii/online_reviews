Another place I've only been to once but I still have wet dreams about. Foie gras dog? Yeah probably the best "hot dog" I've ever had. The Chicago dog I had was easily one of the best I've ever had as well. I still need to experience the duck fat fries, so I guess my testimony for Hot Doug's is a bit lacking. But at least I know that I need to return. Soon.
