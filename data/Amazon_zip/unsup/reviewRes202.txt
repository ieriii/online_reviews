I admit, I'm a sick, twisted person who went out of my way to find fault with Alinea. Impossible. Yes, could have spent the money on a year's worth of groceries, but am perfectly content with the decision to blow it on 24 courses here. It's a 3 hour plus experience of impeccable, impossible-to-replicate flavors and service, all worthy of the hype. Dishes served on aromatic lavender pillows that deflate with each bite. Nuclear butter balls the size of pennies that erupt with a puncture, perfectly saturating nearby lobster. Explosions of black truffle, which, if you ignore the instructions of eating with your mouth closed, have superhero potential to careen out of your mouth at high speeds and decapitate others. And bacon, bubble gum, wagyu, foie gras, bass, and much much more taken to sublime levels of culinary genius and creative mastery. Did the wine pairing, which was also a gift for the birthday boy. Our goal was to be wildly drunk when the bill came. Sadly, 24 courses have the uncanny power to absorb endless wine, so this did not happen. Next time, may need to bring a flask for this sole purpose. A bedazzled one of course, to match the classy ambiance. You should know that hours later, I woke up violently ill. Though I was tempted to blame courses 3, 7, 13 and 19 in order to get a partial refund, the more appropriate culprit is likely my kitchen floor. In preparation for the feast, I'm not ashamed to say I starved myself to the point where I was licking it in order to accomplish the dual task of mildly quenching my hunger, while also buffing it to a healthy shine.
