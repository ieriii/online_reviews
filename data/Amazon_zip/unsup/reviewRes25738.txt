This place rocks! Great cocktails, great food, great service. I went there for the first time on Saturday with a friend and was pleasantly surprised. The portions are small, but as expected in a tapas restaurant. But the dishes are insanely good. Great flavor combinations and innovative items. Try the mojito too...tasty little cocktail!
