This place is packed on a Friday night as to be expected. Once we got in the service was actually pretty good considering. The pizza was good, maybe not the best ever but definately good. Lots of cheese and their pizza sauce is excellent. There are probably better places for Chicago style deep dish but this is a good choice.
