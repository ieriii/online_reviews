I feel like the black sheep of Yelp for giving this place only 3 stars but I can't seem to justify giving it more than that. My coworkers took me to FG for lunch to welcome me to the team. Had my company not taken care of the check, it's doubtful after one look at the menu and its prices (but without reading its Yelp reviews, as I see everyone loves it) that I would have come here on my own, especially for lunch. We ordered guacamole and some cheese dish for the table as an appetizer. The guac was decent but was too onion-y and in all honesty my Italian ex-roommate makes a better guac than that. All 5 of us ordered chicken tacos (which were in actuality fajitas.) They weren't bad, but there is a Mexican restaurant a mile or 2 from my house in Jersey that makes their fajitas with more flavor, double the size, served with a never-ending basket of chips, for $5 less and with a killer country music soundtrack, which makes for a fantastic dining experience.  Everyone seemed fairly pleased by their order but the only items that really received 5 star reviews from my table were the drinks. Maybe if we would have ordered more exciting dishes, I would be echoing the rave reviews before me. I would eventually like to go back and give it another shot, but if I'm picking up my own tab, I'm heading to De Cero.
