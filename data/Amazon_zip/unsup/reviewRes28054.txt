i've been coming here since junior high. it's changed, but not all that much. what's nice is that immediately they bring you some fresh chips and salsa and a sample of whatever they have going that day.. maybe a little stew or soup. pretty much anything on the menu is decent. you get just what you should expect from a decent mexican joint. come with friends, bring some booze, live it up.
