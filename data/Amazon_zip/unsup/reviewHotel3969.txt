I really enjoyed my first stay here, however upon my return the staff was rude, there are still employees striking and they made us prepay at the restaurant while letting other people go in without doing it! when we pointed out that they hadn't made us prepay the day before they were outright rude. when i asked if there was fruit for my cottage cheese (which was 7 bucks) they said no, and then i saw all sorts of fruit on the $20 buffet, which looked pretty rough. the reception was pretty spotty, and the whole place smells like stale cigarettes. ugh.
