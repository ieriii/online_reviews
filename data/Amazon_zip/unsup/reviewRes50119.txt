After spending a weekend attending a kiddie music class and THREE kiddie birthday parties I desperately needed to be around adults who weren't tethered to toddlers-- and alcohol. This predicament lead me to FIfty/50. While getting a deluxe wash at Wicker Wash, I got the bright idea to quell that desire for alcohol so I shimmied over to Fifty/50 to grab a quick drink. Another one of those places I pass by all the time but never ventured inside. At 4:30 on a Monday afternoon it was quite dead (compared to the throngs of people I would see kicking it al fresco style in the summer) but that was fine. I copped a seat at the bar ordered a margarita and two of the sliders. Pretty good. Ryan, the very cute and friendly bartender, chatted me up and told me about the best nights to come and how buckwild it gets on the weekend. He also gave me a copy of Chicago Scene and pointed out the fact that Fifty /50 was nominated the best bar in Wicker Park. He also told they have some of the best wings in the city. Apparently they're coming out with a new menu later this week, as well. It was a nice and chill time by myself, but I will definitely come back with some friends real soon.
