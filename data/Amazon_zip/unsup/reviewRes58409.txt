As for Piccolo Sogno, I give it a C-. When I called to make a reservation, the girl said, 5 or 9!! I said 5 and we were promptly there at 5. The patio was filled with men all dressed in black. The stick man 6 ft. 5 110 lbs. who greeted us said Sit at the bar!! which we did. We ordered a drink. B4 the bartender had time to make our drinks at the bar, someone had opened the trap door in the patio and all the little men in black disappeared. I figured they were running a class, teaching the men in black how to wait tables...they led us to the fake leaf wall in the back and seated us. My guest was seated FACING THE WALL!! instead of the dining room. A senior citizen (dressed all in black) came and gave us menus. After we had time to decide what to order, the little man in black came running, grabbed the menus from us and said Those are lunch menus!! like it was our fault. He then gave us dinner menus. By this time, I noticed that all the early diners were seated in the last row next to the fake leaf wall.I ordered lasagna. Let me tell you what I got was something else. A bow knot pasta in CLEAR WATER and inside the bow knot was a 1/3 tsp. of ??? something......If this were the only Italian restaurant in Chicago, I would go downstairs to L'Appetito in my building, buy a bag of pasta (serves 3), a container of puttanesco sauce (both $5.50 each), a combination salad ($4.50, serves 4), serve it on bone china in my apartment with a glass of red table wine.Would we go back??No! No! No!
