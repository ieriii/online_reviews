We went to Chicago Q today (opening day) at around 3:30 pm. The exterior is understated and easy to miss, look up for the big Q between Il Mulino and Starbucks. We started with the complimentary sweet and crunchy bread and butter pickles, and then had the hush puppies, the sampler trio (chicken, pulled pork, kobe beef brisket), and the full rack of competition style St. Louis ribs. Everything was super delicious, but the 2 things that we thought were simply AMAZING were the kobe brisket and the competition ribs. The brisket had a great smoky flavor, and was tender and juicy whilst maintaining a beefy texture (we like the brisket at Smoque, but the texture of that brisket is a bit too soft). The ribs.....I can't even begin to describe how absolutely perfect they were. Really great smoky flavor, extremely tender and juicy on the inside, with a slightly sweet mapley glaze on the outside.  The three sauces are also really good. There's a spicy, a mild, and a vinegary Carolina one.  We didn't have room for dessert after eating all that food, but the menu looked great and I'm going to try to save some room next time! Definitely go and check out Chicago Q, you won't regret it!
