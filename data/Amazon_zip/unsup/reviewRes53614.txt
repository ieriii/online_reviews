So I have to say that I registered just so I could review this restaurant.  As I started looking through reviews, I realized that I am not the only one who is pissed about the treatment by the management. Not only did our reservation get rudely and inconsiderately cancelled an hour before our reservations, but two of my friends had the same experience independently the subsequent weekend. The worst and most pathetic thing is that the management keeps coming up with ridiculous excuses for cancellations. I didn't realize the complete disregard that the restaurant has for their patrons. There are plenty of good restaurants in Chicago on the same level so there is absolutely no need to try to go to this one. I am certainly never coming there after knowing what I know.
