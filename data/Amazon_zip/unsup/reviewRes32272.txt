Soooo good! I'm veggie and my friend's daughter is a Celiac this place suits us both. Parking can be a pain. Its not super cool inside but is comfy and welcoming. The food is so yummy and good value for money , massive portions, I advise sharing some stuff. They gave the kids colouring and had lots of milkshakes etc and kids meals.The waitress was super helpful about the menu and very friendly.We will be going again for sure.
