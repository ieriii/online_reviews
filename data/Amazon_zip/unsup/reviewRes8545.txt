If you're a carnivour, this is the place for you. I liked the decour and ambience of this restaurant, but the meat was the real seller. I've been to a few of the other churrascarias, but Fogo de Chao definitely had the best meat. I went for lunch and felt that $30 was a great deal for the quality of the food and great service. I'll definitely be back soon!
