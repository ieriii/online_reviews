M&H, How have I not reviewed you? You are my neighbor and favorite lunch place, yet I have seemed to overlooked you. You always offer quality, fresh food....and although the menu doesn't change I still manage to frequent you and commend myself afterwards. Yes, you can get crowded, but if you go at the right times that line that seems scary, goes by quickly. And on the weekend I can get the amazing huevos rancheros in the little bowl. Again, sorry I missed you, I will be back shortly to get the chicken BLT and rectify the situation.
