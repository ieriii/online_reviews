I've been to this place before and each time when I actually eat in I get distracted by their good sushi BUT there must be something wrong because things are going downhill... And fast. Not only did the delivery take eons not once but two times but the food was blander than bland. The pad Thai had no spice whatsoever. Like eating plain noodles... Ramen tastes better. The pad see ew was def ewwww! Never again.
