I wish this place was just a little closer to where I lived because it's really good! I had the black 'n blue burger, which was delicious. The beef itself was a little on the salty side...but that didn't stop me from nearly finishing it - it's huge. Their french fries are really good and their ranch dressing is seriously some of the best I've ever had. I know, you're thinking "what? ranch dressing, seriously?" Yes. I'm picky. I also tried a few bites of the big texan. Um...hello. Nearly orgasmic things happening inside my mouth.  Their portions are very generous and the place itself is entertaining. There's a game room full of fun and the decor is really decent. They also have a great beer/drink list with plenty to choose from. It's safe to say that I will be back...several times.
