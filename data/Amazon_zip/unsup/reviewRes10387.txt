I really really liked the atmosphere and the service. The owner came over to talk to us for a little bit which I don't think ive experienced at a restaurant so that part was exciting. with the service and the decor i really wanted to like the food. The meat/veggie platter I thought was a great idea and it was good. However my dish, i had the beef. while was fall apart delicious, the polenta didn't have much flavor as well as the greens i did not like at all. My friend had the spicy penne which was not very spicy, and my fiancee had the risotto special, which i didn't think was cooked all the way.
