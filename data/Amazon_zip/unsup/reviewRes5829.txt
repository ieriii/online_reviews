Whatever the female version of getting a "culinary boner" is, that is what describes what eating fried chicken does to me. Their Monday night fried chicken special prompted Jennifer I. to meet me for a decadent, artery-clogging dinner last night. We both settled on the fried chicken special, which, priced at $17.95, ain't cheap, especially considering their sister restaurant, Joe's, is only $14.95, and it's among the best. We were dismayed that the fried chicken ended up being boneless cutlets of chicken instead of on-the-bone pieces. My primary motivation for feasting on fried chicken is the crispy skin, and this had none. It was more like eating chicken from a tv dinner (and not in a good way). The breading on the chicken didn't really stay on when you cut into it and the chicken was also a little dry. Fried chicken on the bone generally stays moister. I was pretty disappointed and I also felt deceived; the menu should state that this is not traditional fried chicken. I'll still keep it at three stars because everything else is usually pretty good. Steaks and chicken are all fine, if not extraordinary. Standout sides include creamed spinach, au gratin potatoes, and brown-sugar rubbed sweet potatoes. Their salads are always fresh and plentiful. My favorite dessert at WF is their key lime pie, which is a small round pie, with crushed gingersnap cookies, tangy lime filling, and a small mountain of fluffy whipped cream sprinkled with fresh lime zest. It's tart, creamy, and wonderful. I've eaten at each and every location of Wildfire. You've eaten at one, you've eaten at 'em all. The service is always pleasant and efficient, and the food is consistent. Judging by the crowds, Wildfire remains a crowd pleaser for its reliable and dependable fare.
