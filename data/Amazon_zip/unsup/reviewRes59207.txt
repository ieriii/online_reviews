I've only been here once, but my experience was fantastic! We were immediately seated and our waitress always tended to our drinks whenever needed. When I went we got the roasted duck meal where they slice it right at your table. The duck was absolutely amazing and it is now my favorite meal. I have never had such a fabulous duck. The meat was perfect and the sauce it came with made it ten times better. I definitely would like to come back here soon!
