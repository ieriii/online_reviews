San Soo Gab San has been my go to spot for Korean BBQ for quite a while now! Some things never change. I took a friend for her first experience earlier today and I was still as satisfied as ever! It was super busy but the 20-30 min was well worth it. If it's your first time, I suggest you go on a weekday. That way you won't feel overwhelm and the staff would be able to assist you more during the process. The side dishes are remarkable and the ladies never turn me away when I ask for more potatoe salad. Five stars for SSGS!
