First of all their pizza is the BEST pizza I have had in the city!!! Secondly they have some of the best home brew beers in the city!!! Our favorite pizza is the plain style with whatever we decide should go on it for that day. Their plain style is less cheese than a normal pizza but has all the satisfying flavor because of the garlicky red sauce. If your on a first date I might suggest against another style ;) My favorite beer... wow... that is a hard choice. I would have to say it is.... not a decision I can make. Try every single one. They are all good! Jonathan Cutler (the brewer) you are my hero.... and I would love to shake your hand some day!
