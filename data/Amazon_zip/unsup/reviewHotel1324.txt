the best service EVER. i had my birthday "coming out" party here and the attendants were phenomenal. l'occitane products, fantastic rooms, jaw-dropping interior design in the grand ballroom and in the lobby of the hotel. very pricey but not at all a detriment. you get what you pay for. the reason why i give it only 4 stars though is because the event-coordinator of the hotel was implying that there was something minutely wrong that most of my guests were of a certain discent which i found very very offensive. i know his point, that the ritz is this prostigious place.. pretty much wasp and probably never experienced this kind of event with so many, let's say, asians that weren't all so neatly groomed. but they were my family so i didn't believe it was right to question it- my parents paid twp arms and two legs for the hotel's ballroom services and we weren't disrupting the hotel in any way. he could have at least acted like it was alright. sheesh. and what's with the pool? just a lap pool? for a 5 star hotel i was expecting at least a nicer recreation type pool.
