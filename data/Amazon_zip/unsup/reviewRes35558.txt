The new place is HUGE! and it still gets packed! I came on a Sunday for lunch with some friends. We got a Peking Duck and 2 other dishes: fried sole and chinese vegetables is delicous as well as the giant prawns with eggplant!!! Roast pork appetizer is salty with crunchy skins. Yummmy!!!  Plenty of food for 7 people!  Cheap cheap cheap to boot!  Oh, the men's bathroom is pretty clean too. which is very very unusual for restaurants in this area...
