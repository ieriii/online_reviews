The portions are HUGE, which is reflected in the price, and the food was delicious! The staff were all friendly and the service was fast. The chocolate tower of french toast was...for the first time in my LIFE...just too much chocolate for me. It was big enough to share with 4 people, if they had a smaller portion size, I'd be all over that! A tip - when it's 90+ degrees out this is not the place to be. There was a 15 minute wait (outside, of course) then when we got seated, as expected - it was near the doors. Every time the door opened you could feel the AC disappear, and a rush of disgustingly hot air surrounded the area.
