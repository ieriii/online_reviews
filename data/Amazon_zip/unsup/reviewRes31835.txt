Second chance for Sunda = Five stars! Perhaps the key to enjoying Sunda is to come with a group. I noticed that couples sitting at those communal tables looked absolutely miserable while groups of 4-8 having dinner at the round tables were having the time of their lives. I think Sunda is meant to be more of a celebration atmosphere. The food at Sunda is incredible, but sometimes it means going all out and ordering the specials, which can be extremely pricey. Again, it's nice to be in a big group where you can try lots of different items.  My second go-around at Sunda was fabulous....impeccable service, amazing food, and a fun environment. Can't wait for my third trip!
