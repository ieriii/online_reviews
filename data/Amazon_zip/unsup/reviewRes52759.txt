I live in the neighborhood and have driven, walked by dozens of times so my partner and I decided to give it a try. What a mistake. Walked in and a women signaled to a waiter to seat us. We told him two for outside, and he grabbed the menus and said, follow me. Another women rudely stopped the waiter and proceeded to tell us there is a 20 minute wait and it might rain soon, so maybe you shouldn't eat outside.  Now there were no reservations being taken that evening and I assumed that the back patio was "outside" also. I guess they don't consider that "outside", which no one bothered to inform us of that. I see two or three open table outside, (the real outside) and I asked why can't we sit there? "Oh, there is a line for those," the hostess responds. Really, why are the couple that CAME IN BEHIND US being seated there???? And why was the waiter half way there, with us to seat us there, when you abruptly stopped him?  I asked for the manager Anthony, and he gave us the same BS that they were in line. Really? When they came in AFTER us, and there were no reservations being taken that evening. I work in the service industry for 30 plus years, so it really irks me when people who control a menu and seating think they are god. I've made a (good) career out of it, you are doing a temporary job while you put yourself through acting school or DeVry, so adjust and learn some people skills. We were dressed nice, so I don't know what they had against us, but I will never eat there. It's a shame too, I own property not two blocks from there, and like to support the neighborhood.
