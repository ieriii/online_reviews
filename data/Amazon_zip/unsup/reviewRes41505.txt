This is the only Ruths Chris I've been to that has escargot, and it tastes great. The beefsteak tomatoes are also grilled to perfection - firm and sweet. But of course the main star here is the petite fillet mignon. The meat here is so tender, yet firm and flavorful that I don't have the words to accurately describe it. "Melt in your mouth" has been used too often to be a meaningful description, but this Ruths Chris accurately makes it happen. And when I order medium rare, they actually get it just the way I want it, pink but evenly textured (no firm red bulb in the middle). Their wine selection is great too. I don't know why but the steaks at the Ruths Chris in Washington DC and New York are terrible compared to Chicago.  Be sure to reserve ahead for the second floor, to avoid all the riff-raff beside the bar.
