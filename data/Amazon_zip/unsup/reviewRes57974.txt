Experience - Dined here 1st time on restaurant anniversary. Will not return as Italian food is not hard to do, and there are plenty of neighborhood options. See management comment below.Food - Tastes ok, Decent size portionPrice - fairWait Staff & Management - patrons were offered to put their name on a special drawing for the anniversary. Management did not offer us any concession, even when they found out our name was vehemently left out of the drawing.Wait time - lousy - especially for middle of week early dinner. got put on wait list at 6pm, didn't get seated till 7:30, got appetizer at 8:10.Environment - noisy
