My boyfriend and I came here for a romantic night out. I couldn't have asked for more. We waited at the bar for a few minutes for a booth spot- it was worth the wait! We snuggled in the corner on the candle-lit room and dined for 3 fabulous hours on some of the most incredible food in the city. Come here for a romantic evening and you will remember it forever!
