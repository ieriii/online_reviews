Soso. We were wow'd by the service but the food was ok. It was less than fantastic, which is surprising because of the tv chef status of Rick Bayless and the huge wait for 30 minutes. The ambience is good if you like the busy restaurant vibe with loud chatter and bustling waiters and loud music. The vegetarian caldo was salty and I could not finish it. The chicken tinga was ok, but reminded me of pizza sauce. The chicken milanesa was the only good menu item we ordered. The watermelon agua fresca is nice, but the hibiscus and lemongrass is too tangy for my taste.
