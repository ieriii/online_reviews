These guys have the sunny weekend morning cafe act down pat. The walls are a cheery yellow, and there's an abundance of floral paintings and light wood finishes, all of which help improve your own (possibly) grumpy disposition on a gloomy Sunday. And it doesn't hurt that the food's great either! Meli has a lot of egg based dishes, and they're usually spot on with flavor and seasonings. They round outt the huge menu with a variety of pancakes, waffles and the rest. They advertise themselves as a juice bar as well, but I'm yet to be wowed by any of their creations...hmm, although that might be because I'm so busy eating. Oh, and just on a sidenote: their location in Greektown seems to be a complete coincidence. The only thing Greek about Meli is their name. Hey, I'm not complaining!
