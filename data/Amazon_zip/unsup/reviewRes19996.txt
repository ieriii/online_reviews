Let me start by saying that I am not a big fan of simple foods that are often overpriced. But Xoco does an excellent job of providing its customers with good quality materials and preparing them in a marvelous way all for a very reasonable price. Definitely a place for a great culinary experience overseen by a top chef master. I started with the Gunthorp Chicken Torta that was cooked to perfection. Juicy chicken with an array of fresh vegetables and cheese all fused together in a brick oven. Light crispy exterior surrounding a flavor explosion inside. With the hot sauce, just a pleasure... Followed this up with the duck pozole. Omg, that was such a pleasure to eat. Each ingredient was handled perfectly and together was perfect spicy harmony. There was hen of the woods, with green apple, and potato topped with fresh radish and raw spinach. Definitely worth my time! End this well prepared dinner with the churros. Again, love that these simple Mexican desserts were handled with such care and attention to detail. It definitely shows!
