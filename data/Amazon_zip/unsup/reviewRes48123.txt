This place was pretty yummy; had a good amt of food and it was decently priced. Had the pork shoulder - SOO good; the ribs .. OMG EVEN BETTER.. it was fatty but it was sooo delicious.. cooked to perfection. Im a fan of broccoli rabe and this was cooked very nicely as well!! the rabbit papperdelle was one of my favorite dish.. i loved the pasta and the rabbit had a pretty good texture as well =) all in all .. yummy!!!
