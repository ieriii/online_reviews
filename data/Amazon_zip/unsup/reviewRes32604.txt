The food was great. We had a bunch of sushi rolls that were very good. The duck bao buns were great. There were a couple of salads (roasted duck hash was the best) that were very good too. The tuna sashimi was excellent as was the uni. There wasn't anything that we tried from the menu that wasn't very tasty. Prepare to pay a lot if you're adventurous and order a lot of dishes or drinks. The bar was ok. Not a big sake fan and their scotch list was limited. The place was packed when we went there. The bar and lounge are small and it was difficult to have a conversation. The restaurant was nice. Great crowd there for people watching.
