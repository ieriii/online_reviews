ONCE YOU GO BLACK... Apparently you never go back. I am of course referring to black pasta, specifically Piccolo Sogno's incredible spaghetti neri frutti di mare. It sounds simple, but this is really an all-star dish. Perfectly cooked, toothsome squid ink pasta, a bright tomato sauce, and PERFECTLY cooked seafood. Seriously, every piece of squid was tender and luscious. It would be so easy to screw this dish up, but Piccolo makes this dish sing. After passing by this place for years, I'm glad I finally stopped in. Great food, great wine, great service, and great ambiance. I'll definitely be back.
