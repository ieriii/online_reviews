We visited the brilliant Michael Carlson and his fantastic crew on 3/4/10. We found out after arriving that 10 had cancelled at the last minute - shame on them. I'm sure they have their names on file. :-)  Anyway, we came in with the usual group, although this time we brought in one buddy who was in from Napa, and another from New York. Both were blown away by the whole experience. For those of you who've not yet had the pleasure of an evening at Schwa - it's an experience duplicated by none other. From the oyster shooter amuse, to the "biscuits and gravy", to the always appreciated quail egg ravioli, everything was amazing as always. Who would ever think both fish and marshmallows could ever be plated together? Michael Carlson - and he hit a homerun. It was a favorite around the entire table. Personally, I think Schwa is a magical place. One that should never be taken for granted, but one that should be savored and truly appreciated for all that it is: A one-of-a-kind treasure that I personally appreciate because of Carlson's vision. Thanks again to Michael and his crew. We had a great night as always! Drew
