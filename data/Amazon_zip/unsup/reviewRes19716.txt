What kind of name is this? I had no interest in coming here, until we saw the classy interier, and amazing menu for lunch/brunch options. My sushi craving was put aside for an irish breakfast. The place is next to milenium park, with patio and inside seating. The rooms are compartmentalized, so it feels cozy inside. The food was excellent. I got eggs benedict with the sauce on the side. Yummy! The potatos were crispy (which I love), but i'm not a brie/potato fan. I wish we could come back for dinner. Next time!
