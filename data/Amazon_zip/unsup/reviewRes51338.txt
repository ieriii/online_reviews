Sometimes one just gets a taste for cheap Mexican in Lincoln Square, and then, ok, Garcia's (insert shrug here). When it's good, it's good, and usually good just means a lot of cheese and generous portions. I like the red sauce, it tastes homemade and is full of peppers. On the flip side, food quality and preparation is inconsistent and leaning toward the bland, and what is consistent is that the service is slightly, and needlessly, contemptuous. Pretty bathroom.
