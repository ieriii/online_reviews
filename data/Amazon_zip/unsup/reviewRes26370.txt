God...it has been like 5 years since I have been here and now thinking about it makes me want to go back...like now!! This is, by far, the best fondue restaurant I have ever been to. I mean the atmosphere is so romantic and the food is excellent!! I wasn't old enough to drink when I went so I can't comment on the wine list, but I can guess that it is pretty good. I loved everything about this place, from the colors, the dim lighting and the guy playing a little guitar very softly so you could still carry on a conversation. I believe we had the International dinner which comes with the cheese fondue, regular fondue with beef tenderloin, chicken and shrimp and then the flaming chocolate fondue to finish it off. We were probably there for a good 2 hours, too, and it was great. I would definitely recommend a reservation because we went there one time, not caring about the wait because we wanted to walk around, and we waited almost 2 hours to get in, but obviously it was worth it. We will make reservations next time, unless we are compelled to walk around Lincoln Park again. Guys out there...if you are looking to score some points with your wife/girlfirend/boyfriend then make a reservation here and blow their socks off!!
