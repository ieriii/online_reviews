so after a chance encounter with one of the owners who wanted to "make right" his "customer service wrong", i was treated to a fantastic dinner on a bustling friday night. quickly seated, we recieved service from one of the friendliest waitresses i've ever met (i'm bummed i can't remember her name... it begins with a "c"), enjoyed incredibly delicious pizza as well as fantastic house brews, and a complimentary birthday shot for the group (we were there celebrating a 21st birthday). things to note: spinach dip is yummy, the blonde beer that's listed first is super nice for those of us who enjoy blue moon/stella. a large pizza in intensely huge! this is also a great place to take the fam, (somewhere you can feel comfortable bringing mom/dad/grandpa in the sea of trendy youthful restaurant/bars in the area).
