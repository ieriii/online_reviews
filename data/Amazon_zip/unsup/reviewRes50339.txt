I have been here several times and think the food is absolutely delicious. The service has always been great as well. Sadly, what brought me to Yelp was the fact that my most recent trip to Big Jones was ruined by a loud and rude kitchen staffer that seemed to have no respect for those of us who were seated in the back...........or his co-workers for that matter. Definitely will keep coming, but will be requesting a table near the windows.
