I would give a 5 star ,but we tried everything except for the Churrasco( flank steak )which the server keep on evading our table, he comes with another steak(skirt steak) telling us it was his favorite but the Churrasco , I noticed he would offer it to other table that was dressed up in suit's we are al wearing casual clothes but none of us are wearing shirt ,slipper or shorts and after trying all grill varieties the receptionist asked us if everything is OK my friend replied we are waiting for the Churrasco then it was finally served on our table but he skip a couple of plates We did not complaint (dont wanna ruin our day) I just decided to post it here in yelp,in fairness of the courtesy of all the staff and the receptionist and of course the food my friend shared some of His Churrasco to those who got none it was worth waiting and asking for but thanks to" Server Skip table" you blew it,
