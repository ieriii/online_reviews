I went here a few weeks ago after seeing a review on TV. I'm glad I did. The pizza is pretty good and there are lots of choices to choose from. I had a red pizza with pepperoni and olives. I might have to try the red pizza bbq style next time. The beer is excellent too. The Inaugarale had a good flavor to it. Place was a little crowded for midweek, but thinned out after the dinner rush.
