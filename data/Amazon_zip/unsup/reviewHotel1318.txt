Very swift and easy check in with the warmth and respect that you expect from the four seasons and Ritz Carlton. The gym is great, plenty of equipment and peppermint infused towels to help you cool down after. The concierge is fantastic and was quick to find us a great dinner spot as well as a place to have a few drinks for a casual lunch. Great view of Navy Pier and the lake from the room. Comfortable sheets that feel great to snuggle up in.
