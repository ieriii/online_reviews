My wonderful beautiful girlfriend had to work in Chicago in just flew back with pizza'(S) from every top reviewed pizzeria-this is my 3rd sampling and so far my favorite. The crust has a buttery crunch, that combined with (what I will refer to as) the "wall of sausage" gives a unique salty/savory sensation. Plus the "wall of sausage" is just freakin' cool. The sauce has enough kick to it but not too much to take away from the taste of the cheese and toppings.  This was my 3rd favorite out of all 4 that I tried Note: when reheating pizzas flown to LA from Chicago-always go with the stove and not the microwave to avoid sogginess! (I am the wonderful GF that brought back 4 pizza's to try...the service here was phenomenal!! They wrapped it up nicely for me! Yay!)
