I think this might be the BEST pizza I've ever had. I'm a simple girl that is very happy with just a cheese pizza and this place is perfect for that. The pizza was cheesy, not too much tomato sauce and the deep dish crust was amazing.  The downside... it's a busy place which we expected, but we felt it was a little confusing when you go to the hostess stand and they tell you how long the wait will be, but no matter what they quote they tell you to order your pizza at the counter to the right in 15 minutes. It was also disappointing that you can't order food (only drink and apps) at the bar tables. We were planning on having dinner and watching the NBA finals. Lucky for us we must have got the timing just right and a couple was leaving the bar top which allowed us to take their seats to enjoy our drinks, watch the game and order a pizza. We waited close to an hour for our pizza, but it was totally worth the wait - and we were drinking and enjoying the game. Be warned - they card everyone at this place so if you're the one that goes to the bar to order all your friends drinks make sure to bring their IDs with you. It's an ID for every drink ordered.
