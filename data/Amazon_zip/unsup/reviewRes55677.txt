I saw this place on tv one night I can't believe the quality of this place my father and I went there and he who is picky thought the clam chowder soup was the best he has ever had and I agree. The fish was fresh the potatoe pancake and asparagus was great. The blood Mary with shrimp in it was awesome. I will come back many times to enjoy the things I didn;t have today. Herb
