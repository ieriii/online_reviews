We took my parents and kids here and everyone had a fantastic time. The food was terrific and generous. We had the bulkoki, galbi and rib-eye for the beef, and also the squid. (The squid was so-so at first, but it was better with the sauces and also after picking up some of the beef flavor off the grill!). For appetizers, try the seafood/onion panackes. Really great! Even the miso soup, which comes with the meals, was more flavorful than the bland versions you often get. We got here just before 6 on Saturday and had no trouble getting a table -- but 15 minutes later there was a long line. We've had Korean food in several other places, but this is the best.
