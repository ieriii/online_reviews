If you don't like duck, go to Sun Wah!  I was not particularly in love with the idea of going here but since our guests from out of town wanted to experience peking duck, I couldn't object. For a party of seven, we decided on one duck and some extra goodies. The duck was amazing! Also, the soup that came with the duck special was very tasty. In addition, we had two orders of fried rice and a large bbq platter. Everything was delicious. (Two sorbets for seven at the end of the meal was a little strange.)  Fun place to go with a large group!
