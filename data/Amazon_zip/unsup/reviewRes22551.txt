THIS IS THE REAL SHIZZ. I actually called my mom to tell her she needs to come visit Chicago so I can take her here (she's half Szechuanese). We had the dry chili chicken (boyf's fave) and the spicy crispy eggplant (I effing love eggplant). Both were really good, although I wish the eggplant was a little more flavorful. Also love the spicy cabbage app, yum! We finished everything, and the dishes were big. I was a little sad face because the tea was cold though...
