Environment - a single large room with (mostly) community seating that is a fun place for a party of three/four or more. The aesthetics were simple with warm lighting and a great staff. The entire restaurant was full filling the space with loud chatter - a turn off at first, but our ears adapted. Meals are designed to be shared - always a plus when a decision for a single dish is not easy. We arrived early and ordered appetizers/drinks at the bar. Publican's drink menu is robust rendering me unable to make a decision. Our waitress wa knowledgeable about the menu and was able to make a perfect recommendation. We ordered AMAZING spicy pork grinds for an appetizer. So good, try them. Our party included three adults, each ordering a single entree. My original choice was bone marrow, unfortunately it was sold out; luckily for me my second choice, a plate of duck hearts, was still available. White anchovies and pork ribs completed our meal. Once the food arrived we requested a plate of collard greens. Anchovies and the duck hearts were great, the pork was a bit fatty, and the collard greens made everybody happy. Portions were enough to fill all three us. We concluded the meal with coffee (Intelligentsia) and a chocolate dessert.  Publican is without frivolous distractions in the space and on the menu. If you are looking for a fun restaurant with a good menu and reasonable prices this is an ideal restaurant. Enjoy.
