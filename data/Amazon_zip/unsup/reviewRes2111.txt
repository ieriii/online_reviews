SO GOOD. We went today thinking that the lines on a Friday afternoon would be more forgiving, but there was a largish line even at 11am. So worth it, though. I had the cheddar and bacon elk sausage and my husband had the pork jerk sausage, and we shared duck fat fries. Delicious! (but the duck fat fries really need to be eaten while hot -- when they're lukewarm, they really are not that diff from the regular fries) Cash only here, but all prices include tax. We'll probably run back over to Hot Doug's later in the week to try the alligator sausage. Bring something to read in line on the weekends, or bring a friend who won't mind sweating it out in the sun with you while you wait.
