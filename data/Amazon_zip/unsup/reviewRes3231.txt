I'm fortunate to live around the corner from Crisp, but far enough that I actually do go other places. Seriously, if I lived next door, I think I'd look like a chicken. I doubt I would look Korean though, given the genetic impossibilities of that. With 700+ reviews, there's probably not much I can add, but here goes... Pros - Um, the chicken. And the sauces. And the yadda yadda you've already read this in every review. - The free Onion newspapers. In the rare times I'm not distracted by my phone during a quick bite to eat here, it's nice to have entertainment provided for me. Con - Crisp can get REALLY crowded REALLY quickly. I went today right when it opened at 11:30am, for instance, and by the time I left at noon, the tables were starting to fill up. If you're in the neighborhood, go to Crisp. Trust me.
