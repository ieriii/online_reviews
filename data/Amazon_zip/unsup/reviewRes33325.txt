I'm an eggs benedict fiend. I drove all the way to Chicago from Ann Arbor to eat a decent plate of eggs benny and this place delivered! The Benedict deconstructed: About the meat to bread ratio: Perfectly balanced! Canadian bacon slice wasn't too skimpy or too thick, it was just right. About the hollandaise sauce: fully made from scratch and ever-so-slightly tart with a hint of tabasco. Eggs: poached to perfection. Whites are firm, but oh, how the yolk drizzles out! P.S. They could work on the home fries; they were kinda *meh.* And the fruit? That's an added bonus and guilt reliever when you're ingesting your week's worth of cholesterol, but seriously, put it in a bowl or something--I don't like hollandaise touching anything healthy on my plate.  P.S.S. Eggs Benedict is one of the best meals on earth. There's a reason why James Bond constantly orders it in the novels. Man's got taste!
