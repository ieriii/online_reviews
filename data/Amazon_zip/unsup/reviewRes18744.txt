Loved the atmosphere, the back section gives off a bit of a dive bar feel. Burgers were more than generous, cooked well, but mine wasn't exploding with flavor. Fries were good, you are able to choose a seasoning like garlic or firecracker. They have an extensive craft beer menu along with beer cocktails. Tried the beer-mosa and loved it! Another friend had a gin/beer combo while another had a margarita/beer combo.... all were surprisingly delish!
