My friend Scott has been here so many times his name is on the wall (literally). After introducing the H and I to the Wildfire, we've been a couple of times and I have to say I'm a fan. I'm a fan of their blue cheese crusted steak, and H got a porterhouse the size of his head. Somehow (read: knew we didn't have room but we powered through anyway) we even saved room for desert, which they serve half portions of. The only downside is since it's always packed, the service can be a little rushed for the prices. But if you want a good steak, this is a place to do it.
