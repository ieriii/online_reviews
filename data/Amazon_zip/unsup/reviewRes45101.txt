How do I even begin to explain my newly found love for Anteprima?!?!?! I love the feel... it's very Italy-esque with the warm space.. delicious aromas in the air, friendly waiters... and fellow customers :] I guess the owner knew we were "foodies" from all the non-typical food items we ordered...... he was super sweet and actually gave us "special" olive oil to drizzle on our food and salumi and a special something something "XX" drink afterwards. Even a complimentary truffled pecorino and poached pear. My favs of the night were.. omg, ALL OF IT.. but if I had to choose.. the grilled octopus... the garganelli, pancetta & tomato ragu, homemade ricotta.... (which has trotters in it) andddddddd... their pasta is cooked to perfection and so fresh and delicious. PERFECT proportions!!! (my biggest rant @ italian american places is WAY too much food... and WAY too much sauce.. here it's perfectly balanced.. it's the PASTA that's the star of the show and it's accented by the perfect amount of delicious sauce...) omg their specials are amazing. fried anchovies were amazing. THE GOAT!!!!! their yogurt/honey dessert.. oh me oh my!!!
