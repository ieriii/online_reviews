I've only visited the actual restaurant once when picking up food and the space seemed a bit small. The inside was a bit dark, but that's obviously what they're going for. The other times I've had the food it was delivery and its been good. The prices are reasonable and the menu has most things you're looking for. I would recommend other spots for a night out over this place, but its decent if you live in the area for takeout purposes only in my opinion.
