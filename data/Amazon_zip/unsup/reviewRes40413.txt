I was a little skiddish about this place after seeing the yelp reviews, but I have to say, I think people are being way harsh on this place. Everyone was SUPER friendly, from the bartender - to the server - to the floor manager. Everyone seemed to genuinely care about whether or not we were having a good time. Once the bar started filling up the hostess came over and asked us how we were doing, and she could ask the other patrons to move if we wanted - no problem - they're fine we said!  I was hot on trying the bone marrow, which was pretty good. My only complaint was that the smaller bone was much more well cooked than the larger bone, it was much more tender and flavorful. I also had the Pigs Head plate which was EXCELLENT, so unlike anything i've had before. I'm not really even sure what they did, I guess they took all the meat from the head, shredded it and wrapped it in some sort of fatty goodness then fried it? (very healthy indeed) But it was very, very good. We also got the cheese plate - on which the cheese selection was excellent - but here was my very small whine: When I order a plate of excellent cheeses, I want something to go with them that doesn't overtake the taste of the cheese - a small cracker, some sort of bread short on taste - they served crostini that tasted like bagel chips, so they overtook the taste of the cheese.  I'd say the prices were incredibly reasonable - although my friend ordered the scallops and they seemed super tiny, whereas my pig head app was definitely enough for dinner. So just make sure and ask your server about the size of the meal before you order (although in L&E's defense here, the server definitely warned her it was going to be on the smaller, she was just a little low on moolah that night). I will definitely be back! I can't wait, actually! I want to try that beef toungue hash with quail egg mmm mmm.
