I think that this is by far the best breakfast place in the city. I have gone both on the weekend and during the week. Just beware that if you do go on a Saturday or Sunday, your food does take a while for you to get it. Though, to add to that, when its busy, how can you expect your food to come out right away?I think the strawberry orange juice is fantastic! I have a juicer and this juice is definitely freshly squeezed! I think that their pancakes are great and that their scrambled eggs (ask for cheese!) are also fantastic!I highly suggest this place because it has great food and a fun vibe to it!
