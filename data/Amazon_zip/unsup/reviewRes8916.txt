My absolute favorite place for Persian food in the entire world! It's a small place, but so worth the wait. I saw this restaurant on an episode of Check, Please a few years ago, and that is how I (and so many other people) came to find this place. The service is always great. The pita bread is always warm, and hummus is delish! I always get the steak/chicken kabobs with a mix of dill and white rice. There is always leftovers for another meal, also! I have nothing bad to say about this place.
