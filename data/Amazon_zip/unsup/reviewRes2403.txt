Everything on the menu is great. Perfect sized meal for $20-$30. BYOB.  Tips: - Check the website before going. You will find the weekly specials. Also, the restaurant may shut down for periods for staff vacations. I'm pretty sure that Doug takes every single order. - Don't be afraid to try something. It is cheap. The Foie Gras Dog is amazing. - On a random weekday, just get there @ 10:20. You will be able to get your food by 10:40. This has worked for me 50+ times so far.
