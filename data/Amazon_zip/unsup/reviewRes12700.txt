Probably the best coconut shrimp in the city. Not your typical breaded and fried shrimp either. Fresh coconut shavings sprinkled over sweet rice served with seasoned and grilled shrimp. Added bonus- plantains. If sweet is not your thing than probably not for you- but man, I could eat this daily. Yum.
