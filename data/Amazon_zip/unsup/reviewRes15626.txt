I don't know what took me so long to come to Carnivale, but I can't wait to go back! My party of 10 first had drinks at the main lobby bar. The staff is QUICK! It's like they are mind readers too, they know that you're going to have another delicious drink and they are right there to make sure you get it quickly. My drink of choice for the night was red Sangria...it's delish and does the trick! After departing the bar, we head to our table. I love the dining room. It's large. It's colorful. It's like Punky Brewster came and decorated the room. I love it. So we have Andrea (I'm pretty sure that's her name) as our server. She's sweet, she's very helpful, and she's loud...you've gotta be loud here because it's a loud restaurant. We started with a couple of meat & cheese platters. I could have ate that cheese for days, but a girls gotta keep room for the next course. If you love blue cheese, I recommend that one for sure. The next course was appetizers. GET THE GUACAMOLE. The Ropa Vieja was also very good, but...GET THE GUACAMOLE if you're only having one appetizer. Next on the menu (as suggested by Andrea) was my main dish of Churrasco (which is, Nicaraguan style wood grilled beef tenderloin, boniato puree, truffle oil, choclo corn, herb chimichurri). This meat is so tender and so delicious, it'll knock your socks off. I'm not kidding here guys, it really was out of this world. I tried a couple of the other dishes (Salmon, Chuleta, and Arrachera) but I think the Churrasco was by far the best. Unfortunately I had to scoot out before dessert. I love dessert. I was so pissed. I was even more pissed the next day when I heard about how good the dessert was. What have we learned here today kids? GET THE GUACAMOLE! Seriously though, come here! It's pretty amazing!
