Certainly, Superdawg is among the great hot dog establishments in Chicago. Their 100% all-beef dawgs are tasty, larger than Vienna (as other folks already say) and can come with all your standard fixings, or can be custom-ordered with only certain sides. But for me, If I'm going to have a dawg, I also want good fries. Not the limp soggy kind, but the hot, crispy outside, light/fluffy inside that is the signature of a lauded fried potato. To TRADEMARK the name "SUPERFRIES" is not only brash but borderline insanity. I mean - really? Their fries are the world's only super kind? They're so insanely great that they own their super-ness? All other fries are completely less-super than theirs in the whole entire Chicagoland area and the US? Wow - I mean - that takes balls.  That said - the fries fit the bill. You don't get a ton of them with your Superdawg, but they are the right kind of crisp, the right kind of salty and the right kind of hot. They aren't overly huge (wedges) and they aren't toothpicky-small. Thanks to Superdawg for making my Saturday post-hangover comfort-lunch an enjoyable one. Remember: CASH ONLY. There's a Chase ATM in the Walgreen's across the street if you forget to bring cash with you.
