We tried this place on Valentine's Day, which obviously is one of the worst nights to go anywhere. Surprisingly, we only had to wait like 20 minutes, even though the place was packed. We were seated at a table for two, right next to a 2' by 2' vent, which was absolutely filthy and covered with dust. It was a turnoff, but I'd give the food a chance. We ordered drinks and our food, and got our drinks right away. I knew it was busy, so after an hour wait I decided to flag down our server. She asked if we were ready for dessert! I told her we never got our food, and her face went blank. We got our food about 5 minutes later and it was actually pretty good! Still, I couldn't give this place more than two stars considering how dirty it was. I'd like it better if I lived closer and went on a normal weeknight I suppose.
