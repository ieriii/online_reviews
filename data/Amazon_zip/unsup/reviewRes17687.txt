My first Violet Hour experience was earlier this year, in the springtime. I went with four of my girlfriends on a random weeknight, so the wait was bearable. We all agreed that the white sangria sounded refreshing, and VH gladly accommodated our request for a punchbowl version. Perfectly chilled and bursting with tart blackberries, I loved every sip. As for the eats...o-m-g you have to try their pulled pork biscuits. Hot pepper jelly and crumbly buttery biscuits create a spicy sweet plate that will, in all likelihood, prompt an exclamation of "HOT DAMN!" My second Violet Hour experience was last week on a Friday night. I returned to this fine establishment with two of the said girlfriends. The wait was about 1 1/2 hours, but we already knew the quality drinks and sexy candlelit atmosphere that was in our near future, so we stuck it out. This time, however, we requested three seats at the bar, and the experience was wonderful! Henry is an amazing bartender-- attentive, causal, has a calm demeanor about him, despite the flowing demand of drinks. I ordered the Sao Paolo jockey club-- a sparkling refreshment infused with pineapple and fresh mint. I absolutely fell in love with it. The ice block in the tall glass kept it chilly and added a sculpted aesthetic. This time, I ordered Val's Housemade Doughnuts-- a SYMPHONY of cinnamon-sugar, slightly warmed with a pillowy, slightly dry-dough center. Not a problem, because I had my cocktail ready to wet my whistle. I highly recommend sitting at the bar. Bring a couple of your most genuine and interesting friends, and you are in for a relaxing, quality-conversational night. p.s. Don't even think about Grey Goose, light beer, or Cosmos. You get the good stuff @ Violet Hour-- bitters, Pimmes, amazing gin.
