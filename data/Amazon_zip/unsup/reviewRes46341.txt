The food and service was good/great. But..........WHILE WAITING TO BE SEATED ON THE FIRST FLOOR A ROACH RAN ACROSS SOMEONES FOOT. My mom didn't want to cause a fuss and ruin others time so she didn't say a word until the next day. Not sure if I will return...but i have a gift card to this place.  : P
