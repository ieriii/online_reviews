all honesty it should be a 2.5. i feel uncomfortable rating it a 2 because the place has some pluses... the website, menu, and some reviews worried me...but a couple of people (who obviously i will not listen to again) had recommended this place to me as the best italian restaurant in chicago...man, they were out of their minds.. the place is spooky...belongs to a small town americana of 30 years ago...so many dusty plastic grape and grape vine decorations...so dark...the mentality is PORTION...big huge dishes... no wonder there were so many old and fat people there....none i hope to sit next to me in a cramped airplane... but everybody (all customers and aforementioned people) seemed like nice people...the waitstaff were attentive...the fresh bread was good...the pizza bread brought to my table free was not worth it .... the minestrone soup was actually good...the salad was ok...and big... when my main dish arrived, i was already full...i ate some ...again the portion huge... look - this is not a culinary experience...this is not a home food experience either.....and i do not think they pretend to be any of that...but they are also not an honest to goodness gino & georgetti we are what we are and are great at what we do place... as i write these, i am worried i may sound like a snob but joke not, i prefer dives...i thrive on good cheap restaurants in bad areas, or really nice and fancy ones...this one is like drinking tap water with chlorine... anyways i think if the portions were about half as big, and the price was about 1/3 less, then it would have been worth it (still not solidly recommended) and i would have given it a solid 3.
