I ADORE this place! Yes there's a line and usually a wait and yes the space is on the small side but the dogs are monumentally good! I had no idea that something as simple as a hot dog coud have so many thoughtful variations. I love coming here and going out of my comfort zone trying venison hot dogs and unusual sauces. In my opinion this place is a fun destination for a food experience. Plus if you are friendly you can meet some really fun people in the line and the wait seems less painful.
