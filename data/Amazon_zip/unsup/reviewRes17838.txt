i've decided i'm not going to give too many negative reviews on here. i would rather people know of the great places to go. but after this place gave me what seemed like a touch of west nile mixed with ebola with a little bit of bird flu sprinkled on top i decided it was my DUTY to let others know. this food made me vomit twice in the middle of the night & basically I crapped myself over & over equalling a total of about 11 or so times. we did get this delivery so maybe the sit down experience is different, but i am not willing to try it again. i hope for the readers health it was a one time off night. the one star is A- because i can't right a review without giving a star & B- the delivery guy was wearing a suit. GOOD LUCK.
