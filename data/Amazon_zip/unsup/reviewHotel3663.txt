My review is not about the Hotel it self but about their Tea Service. If you have never done High Tea, it is very fun. You sit on either cushy sofas by the plants or in chairs by the fountain. You pick out your tea from a list and depending on preference you can also get a flute of champagne. You then start out with scones and other sweet breads included are clotted cream and jam, this is followed by finger sandwiches, I think there are four or five different kinds, and finished with a variety of little desserts. It is a great experience to try with your girlfriends or take your female family members to. Just remember nothing is served in great quantity and while I would not recommend stuffing your self before you go, also do not come starving.
