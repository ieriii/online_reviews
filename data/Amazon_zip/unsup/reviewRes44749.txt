My first Chicago deep dish pizza was Giordano's but I had it in Orlando FL. I didn't like it. It was too cheesy.  Now I live next to Giordano and the plan is to order take out there every month.  Spinach and mushroom is yummy but my fiance will not let me order it so we will be having sausage and onion. So what has changed since Orlando? I don't know but Giordano in Chicago is good.
