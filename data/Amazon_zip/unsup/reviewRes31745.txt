Just went there today on a beautiful but very odd for August weather Chicago. Low 70s... really? I'll take it. Anywho, back to the Chicago Diner. We sat on the patio, seating was pretty close and you didn't have much privacy. But that didn't matter because the crowd looked like people I'd hang out with on a normal basis and everyone was very sweet.  I'm no vegetarian but I love to eat healthy and one of my besties is, so onward with the menu choice. I chose the Philly Cheese Steak and I'd have to say, with real cheese, it was a very delicious sandwich. Sweet potatoe fries always a good move! Wasn't a big fan of the mac 'n cheese I got but again, I'm a fan of real cheese.  Overall, I will definitely go back and try out more of the menu. Prices aren't too bad and everyone was very nice and friendly. Even received a compliment on my glasses from another customer.
