Disappointed and Disgusted with Texas de Brazil in Chicago. Last week I visited Chicago for the first time and Texas de Brazil was one restaurant my husband and I wanted to have dinner at this exquisite restaurant. However, to our deception before even having a chance to enter through the main doors a gentleman (putting it nicely) standing by the door immediately blocked the entrance and refused to let us in the restaurant. This door person stopped us from entering and asked if we had reservations and of course being our first time in Chicago, we replied Do we need reservations to dine here? and the door person did not respond. He also gave us his fixed price menu and continued staring at us from head to toes. I know racial profiling law in Arizona is trying to be enforced by law makers; however, I didn't know the staff had taken it to that extend as well. Since the last time I check the color of money it's still GREEN and is still GLOBAL. Therefore, to all Latinos' beware when trying to eat at this restaurant. Overall, we loved Chicago! And hopefully if I ever go to Chicago again I hope not to see a sign at this establishment stating NO MEXICANS
