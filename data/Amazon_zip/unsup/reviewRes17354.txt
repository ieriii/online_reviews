Consistently good Indian food outside the usual Devon St. I've never been to the lunch buffet, so I can't comment on it-- but I have always been pleased with their dinner selections. Spend a few minutes looking at the menu. The menu is quite extensive, yet IH does not seem to sacrifice quality by the extensive menu.
