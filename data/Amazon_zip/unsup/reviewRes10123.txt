My God, they will make vegan pizza and not stare you down like you're crazy when you ask for no cheese! The first time I went there, the waiter actually asked me if I was vegan and was very accommodating. And cute, but that's beside the point. I grew up on the East coast, so it's like eating a slice of home. My favorite combination so far is plain without cheese and with green olives and spinach. They put a nice amount of garlic in the sauce, so while it is on the toppings menu, you do not want to add garlic to your pizza. Please trust me on this. If you go, try and go before 6 or 7. After that, there is a wait, and unfortunately they don't take reservations. They do have a good deal for personal pizzas during lunch though.
