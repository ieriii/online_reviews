Went on a Monday night for a dinner with a group of 15. We had a semi private room. The waiter was pushy yet entertaining and funny. I had a virigin pinacolda with mint which was very good. The others had wine and mojitos and they all liked theirs. We got two appetizers to share on the table. One was the mixed ceviche which was great (except the oyster one) and the other was a shredded beef on fried plantain which was super tasty. We also got some guacamole for everyone and it was extremely good along with the seasoned chips they provided. I got the sea bass and they prepared it blackened style for me. Many people had the seafood stew and the steak and loved it. The desserts were amazingly yummy. We got one sharing dessert which had many things along with a watermelon flavored cotton candy, which was a fun, whimsical touch. I ate a red velvet cake and that was to die for. It was light, not too sweet and with a hint of lemon. Restaurant has a cool vibe and great food and the service was great too. Really enjoyed the experience.
