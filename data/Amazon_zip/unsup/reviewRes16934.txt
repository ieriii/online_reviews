GF and I met 4 friends here tonight. We spent some time in the bar and had a couple of caipirinhas. Good, but didn't strike me as good at what I've had a Cuatro.  We got seated promptly and got good service. We had guacamole for the table which was outstanding. I switched it up to the mojitos and they seemed more in the groove. Everyone really enjoyed their meals and there were no complaints. I'd love to tell you all the names of the dishes, but I can never remember. I got the beef something and it was really good. GF got the tuna something, also good. Wrapped it up with blueberry tres leches and espresso infused sippin' tequila. The tres leches was excellent, but the tequila tasted like kahlua, so i was kind of disappointed. Not bad, but not the tequila fueled adventure I was looking for. The valet situation was utter anarchy. It is only $5 but there were tons of people waiting on their vehics. I don't know that it's representative. Had more of the feel that someone (or someones) didn't show up for work. Regardless valet demand far outstripped valet supply. This is the third time I've been here and gotten a great meal every time. Go here (but take a cab).
