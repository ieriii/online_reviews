Went here with a friend at about 7:30 on a Friday night expecting a wait, and there was one. 45 minutes on a patio, but there's a bar out there so the wait goes by quickly (but...why are the drinks 50 cents - $1 more outside than they are inside?). She had some sort of burger that was super tall and had fried onions with sweet potato fries, I had the gyros with the garlic ginger flash greens (kale, I think). Anywayssss, all of the food was great (I'm not vegetarian, but she is) and we each had a (vegan) milkshake, which were phenomenal. Definitely recommended, but expect a wait.
