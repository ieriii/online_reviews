I've heard so many great reviews of this place, so I decided to check it out with my friend on Friday. We're both from So Cal, so we have alot of experience eating great Chinese food. Overall, this place rocks. It can get really crowded, so make reservations ahead of time. You can get a full roasted duck for about $36 and it is enough to feed about 4 people...or 2 people with plenty of leftovers. The duck comes out and the server will carve it table-side for you. Then, they take the rest of the meat and make duck fried rice and a melon soup. If you've never had Peking Duck before, you should come here. It's a hearty meal and not something you should eat every week....but VERY tasty. You'll have duck skin, duck meat, hoisin sauce, and some pickled vegetables to put in your steamed bun dough. If you're not feeling Peking duck, Sun Wah has PLENTY of other food options and noodles that aren't very expensive at all. Noodle bowls are $5-$7 and full entrees range from $6-$12 ish.  Anyways, I won't go on repeating what everyone has said, but do yourself a favor and check this place out.
