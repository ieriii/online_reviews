I will definitely be back! I love Fogo however, the salad bar at Texas De Brazil is a winner-hands down. The meat selection was fine, however there were some cuts that we asked for in medium rare and they were more on the rare side.  Me and my boyfriend( ho had never been to a brazilian steakhouse before) truly enjoyed ourselves. The young ladies who perform in the wine cellar are great entertainment. We were actually seated right at the door of the wine cellar. The entire restaurant is decorated nicely as well, with an upstairs overlooking the lower level. While we did have reservations, yes we still had to wait, as one reviewer mentioned, we still had great waiter service and our table was consistently attended to. By the way, I also used a groupon with no problem on a Friday night.  My boyfriend cant wait to go back. Make sure you eat in moderation-yes eat some salad, and yes eat some meat. Wait a little and eat more!
