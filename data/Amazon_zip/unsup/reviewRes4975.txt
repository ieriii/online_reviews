This place deserves all the hype - I ordered way too much food for me and a friend when we headed here for lunch one day right when it opened so we could avoid any wait (in December - woops, sorry!). We only paid about $25 per person (decided not to drink at lunch). For some reason I have a harder time writing reviews of my favorite places compared to those that I'm less satisfied with. All of the food I loved with the exception of one dish: braised artichokes - but I'm OK with that. When they saw that we weren't eating our 'healthier' option - our server kindly asked us if we had enjoyed the dish. I'm honest -and said that it wasn't really what I had been expecting (one reason- it was cold and I was expecting warm), and The Purple Pig comped it for us. That's true service - especially because we hadn't been ordering drinks and our bill wasn't too high to begin with! All of the other food we loved: Brussels sprouts, bone marrow smear (brought extra toast points when they saw we were running low), chorizo stuffed, fried olives (love love these), and my favorite pick - the ham, egg, and mushrooms over toast. We wanted to try more dishes since the menu is so extensive but already had too much food on our table. Make sure you bring people who enjoy trying different dishes- I know for a fact I'll be back again for the great service, prices, and atmosphere. It's also very easy to access since you know you'll be shopping on Michigan Ave anyways.
