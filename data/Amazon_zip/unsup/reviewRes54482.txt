I love everything about this place. Awesome food, good serving sizes, and wonderful drunk inducing drinks. All the best you could ask for from a vegetarian restaurant. On top of all of this, the service, even when slow, is among the nicest and most genuine I have ever experienced. I find most of the other reviews here shocking, as all are completely contrary to anything I have ever experienced. The only downfall would be that they mopped the floor around my table the last time I was there and covered my coat in bleach mop water, thanks.
