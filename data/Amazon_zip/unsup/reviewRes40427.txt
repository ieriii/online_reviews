I don't know why there are 3 La Pasaditas. Truth is, I don't really care because they are all delicious and they throw tacos together faster than I can perform any instinctual task; however just keep in mind that if you ask someone to meet you there, you should probably be specific...especially at 2 in the morning. I usually end up with several tacos that I cannot eat just because ordering 7 barbacoa tacos for $10 just seemed like a great idea at the time...
