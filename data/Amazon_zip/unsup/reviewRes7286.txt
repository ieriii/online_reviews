Whenever a restaurant puts bbq potato chips and bread & butter pickles on the table when you arrive, you know that it is gonna be good! I went here on a Saturday evening with two other people. We didn't know what to get and the server was extremely helpful. We ended up sharing the q3 with pulled pork, brisket and st. louis style ribs. We also got honey butter cornbread, french fries and bacon cheddar hush puppies. All of the bbq meats were delicious and had a great smoke flavor. The ribs were by far the best, with a dry rub and falling off the bone! Corn bread and fries were also wonderful. I felt the hush puppies could have been more flavorful. I didn't really get the bacon/cheddar flavor. The service was awesome! Extremely attentive, maybe sometimes too attentive. The only reason this place didn't get 5 stars is because it is pretty expensive for what you get. Almost $7 for 5 hush puppies....
