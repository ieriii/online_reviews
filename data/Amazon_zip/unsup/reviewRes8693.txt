I have to agree with Wendy V! My wife and I had been going to Spacca every so often over the last few years, and we always enjoyed it. Pizza reminded us of our trip to Cetona, Italy. Light, flaky, FLAVORFUL! Went back there last weekend after a year, and my wife almost cried! Gone were the effervescent flavors and the flaky crust. The fava bean soup was BLAND. The fried zucchini was BLAND. The pizza was BLAND. We were thoroughly disappointed. The only non-bland thing was the very jovial owner handing us a dessert as we left. He was happy b/c the place was full. We were not happy to say the least. Is it back to Pizza D.O.C.?
