I have been going to Cafe Meli since they opened several years ago (if I revisit a restaurant its generally because the food is pretty darn exceptional). I love that they always have fresh butter and jam and the ingredients used to prepare all their dishes prove to be fresh time and time again. I don't think I've ever left Cafe Meli w/ a bad taste in my mouth. Well, until now..... I'm really disappointed at their new business model. I realize times are tough but seriously, do you have to charge extra for everything? My friend wanted a little extra syrup for his pancakes...umm, extra charge. That little nub of butter not enough to smother your pancakes with?...umm, extra charge. I REALLY flipped my lid when I saw that my request for a cheese substitution cost me $2.25! Yeap... a piece of cheese (swap) cost me a 1/4 of what the actual whole sandwich cost me! Seriously???? I'm surprised they weren't charging for the extra coffee fill ups! Anyways, there is no doubt that the food is great, flavorful and all of that stuff BUT dining out is about the experience too. Who wants to feel like they are going to be charged every time they have an additional request? I liked Cafe Meli much better when it first opened and they actually wanted their customers to come back!
