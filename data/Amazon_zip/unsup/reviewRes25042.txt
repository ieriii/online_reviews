I love coming here to hang out on a "slow" night. Good food, drinks and sweets are all you need. I usually get the chicken spinach lasagna or the chicken tortellini (on the special days).  I always take family and friends who are hesitant to trying Greek food for the first time. Then we can branch out to the other restaurants on Halsted. Plus, for the price, I find it is always well worth it. I just had to take away one star because of some poor service that I have received here a couple of times, but it hasn't been bad enough so far to make me stop coming!
