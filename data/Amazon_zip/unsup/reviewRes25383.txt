First, let me say I love the decor--totally my style. They have two tables on a loft style level, which were closed when we came; but would have been off the chain to sit and watch from above! Maybe next time... Service started out awesome...and dwindled down to sub-par as the place picked up and got busy. Almond stuff dates rocked my world, and most of the plates we were ordered were very tasty. The server mentioned that they would automatically course and pace our dinner, which again, started out off to a great start when the place was about half full....but then all of a sudden SLAM! We had 6 plates for 2 people sitting on our table getting cold. Just to warn you...if you're on a "romantic" date, tables are very close together and it might make you feel claustrophobic and as if you're on a double date with the couple sitting next to you. I also noticed how there were several "parties" happening on a Friday evening, which got a little out of control and the staff didn't seem to notice or say anything about the level of volume and drinks being spilled everywhere. Overall, it was an OK experience, for which the quality and taste of the food made up for. Might not be a regular dining experience, as it tends to be a little more pricey than the average fare of the South Loop, but good for a nice evening.
