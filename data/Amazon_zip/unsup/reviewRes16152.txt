Jesus F-Bomb Christ! This is seriously the best place I have ever been in my life. When I die, this is where I want to spend eternity. Every detail of this place was so well thought out. The exterior is beautiful. No sign, so frills, just a wall with a little graffiti, with a door and a yellow light bulb above it. Thanks all. When you step inside you walk through two giant blue curtains and enter the lounge... A giant, clean, impeccably put together space, separated into three areas by more giant blue curtains. The house rules are fantastic, they keep the experience what it should be. All cocktails are $12, unless you get a bowl of punch... those are $30 and feed about 3 or 4 people. My favorites are The original Sazerac, the Sidecar and the Jonestown Punch... although, no matter what you get, it will be great. The music is always different and never disappointing. The staff is super nice and knowledgeable. A word of warning... when you leave this place you will be drunker than you thought you could get.
