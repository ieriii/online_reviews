LOVE this place!  Ever since the weather turned warm (okay, ever since it turned mild...) I've been wanting to hit up the much talked about patio. And it was totally worth the wait. Perfectly laid out, as if it were staged and lit for an Architectural Digest shoot, this is my favorite outdoor dining spot in the city. The food was delish - a prosciutto and mozzarella app was light and flavorful, my gnocchi entree was fluffy and perfectly textured...the pana cotta dessert wasn't as good as Anteprima's in Andersonville, but pretty close. The server was maybe not the most attentive ever, but the food was so great it didn't matter. Is their entire staff Italian? Seemed like it. Can't wait to go back (I'd sit in the patio even if it's 30 below).
