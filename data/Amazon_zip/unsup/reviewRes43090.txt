They can't get the pizza hot! I have been here a few times. The first time the pizza was not hot at all (I picked it up but live only five minutes away) and I e-mailed the next day to let them know. No response. Just ordered a pizza last night, told them about the problem before about a lukewarm pizza, got there early again, waited for the pizza ten minutes past the time promised, got home in five minutes - and a very cool-ish pizza upon arrival. I can't figure it out and they clearly don't seem to care. Although I like the pizza it is not particularly cheap - and if they can't make it hot - there are plenty of worthy alternatives.
