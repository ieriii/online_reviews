My wife and I "discovered" this place for our anniversary, back in October 2011. We were so taken we asked "management" if DE would be open Christmas Eve. We traditionally go to different restaurants every year. We have a sizable group of kids and sons-in-law to accommodate. Sure, "management" said, but we don't take reservations. We were a little surprised, but since "management" assured us that our projected 5PM to 5:30PM arrival time would "be no problem", we planned on it.  My wife called DE twice during the week preceding Christmas Eve to make sure we were OK. Imagine our surprise when we were told at the door that we couldn't be immediately seated because two of our members were missing, and then that we didn't have a reservation. When my wife and I protested, I was brusquely informed by "management" that they only started taking reservations this week, and that there was nothing he could do about it since "management" makes the rules and he ("management?") only "works here". When I protested over seating at a "high top" because my wife had just had hip surgery and had difficulty getting into the "high chairs", I was told by "management" that since we had no reservation the high top table was the best they could do - essentially take it or leave it. When I said, "but YOU were the "management" that told us there would be no reservations for Christmas Eve and that our arrival time would be no problem", "management" got hostile, denied ever saying it, adding, "are you calling me a liar"? We give the food a solid 4 Stars; Customer Service 4 Stars; "Management" -4 Stars. Neither the food nor the wait staff deserve a poor rating. Unfortunately, "Management" set the tone for the evening at the door. We will look elsewhere next Christmas Eve.
