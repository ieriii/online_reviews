I've eaten a XOCO twice for lunch - the last time on 11/18. Someone in Rick Bayless's empire deserves a Pulitzer or should be indicted for mind control - the menu descriptions are crazy perfect: short descriptions - no wasted words - that generate a sense of intrigue, awe and hunger (La Querica Prosciutto AND Otter Creek Organic Cheddar - I've never had either but it must be delicious!)  The first time I went I ate the Woodland Mushroom Torta and loved it. The second time I ate Choriqueso Torta and liked it - it had ever so slight of a funky taste to it - I kept expecting to see some sort of greens mixed in (to explain the funk) . . . perhaps my taste buds were malfunctioning that day. The chips were good and the guacamole was great. I can't verify that the Prosciutto was La Querica or the Cheddar was Otter Creek but I do know that the chips were not "just made" both by taste and by the large containers of chips stacked behind the counter. I love the concept and design. Is it the best Mexican inspired food I have ever eaten? No. But the food remains tasty and intriguing enough that I will go back and continue to work my way through the menu.
