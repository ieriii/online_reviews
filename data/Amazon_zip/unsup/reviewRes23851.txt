This is one of my favorite places in the city to go for a casual breakfast, lunch, or dinner. The crepes are excellent. Seriously, I could eat there everyday. If we go for breakfast, we'll usually get a sweet crepe. My favorite sweet crepe is the Crepe Salem, with pineapple, walnuts, and honey. My fiance will usually gets the Crepe Perla, which has dulce de leche, bananas, and coconut. If we go for lunch or dinner, we'll usually chose a savory crepe. All of the savory crepes come with a vegetable puree soup, which is good. I particularly like the Palace Crepe or the Crepe de Roma. The Turkish coffee is good and strong and, if you are in the mood for something sweeter, the dulche de leche coffee is delicious. We've always found the service to be pretty good, if sometimes a tad bit slow. But, as we tend to enjoy lingering over our meals, we don't really mind.
