Great for a filling fresh meal. Authentic Vietnamese food, huge selection of dishes, generous portions. And it's inexpensive. Seating is somewhat communal. There's a number of 2-person tables but most seating is rows of tables, so you may be sitting right next to strangers. Not a place for intimate conversation.
