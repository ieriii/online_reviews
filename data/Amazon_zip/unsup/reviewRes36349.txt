Not quite a "meh" for Meli...but this is not a 4 star experience. This was my second visit, first time not waiting an ungodly amount of time. The key is to come here on a weekday morning around 7:45-ish. No wait required. The menu is extensive and my choice of the turkey sausage scramble was a good one. I am allergic to grasses so I merely got a whiff of my companion's shot glass of the murky green wheat grass concoction that everyone seems to love. My goodness, the things people will drink in the name of health. But I digress... The waitress was friendly and efficient and the food was tasty enough. The atmosphere was bright and sunny...I think I can only muster up 3 stars because of the host, whom I presume is an owner. A little advice: spend a little less time smoothing down your hair and a little more time practicing the art of the smile and a "good morning." I don't want you to scowl at me and my friend when we enter. We are ladies, we look and act like ladies...so please treat us as such. I don't require fawning...just a little basic friendliness. So perhaps I'll be back but not anytime soon.
