I can't speak for the food, but the brews are superb. We stopped by around 11, cozied-up to the bar and enjoyed a nice pint. If we hadn't stuffed ourselves an hour before I would have loved to sample the menu. Everything on the menu looked great although not overly inventive. The decor was great incorporating the revolution logo (extended arm/fist) into woodworking around the bar and using broken-down casks as "wallpaper." The ceiling tiles looked to be original which was a nice touch to leave. The open kitchen was with the woodfire oven made for a nice backdrop. Nice place even if you just stop in for a beer.
