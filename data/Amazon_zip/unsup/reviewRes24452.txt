Well, Garces's Chicago outpost is also the only one that I don't absolutely love. Don't get me wrong, the food and service were both great, but I found it to be a bit too similar to Amada for my liking. I guess living in Philly has ruined me, as I rather think of Mercat as a slightly watered-down combination of elements of his other seven restaurants. A Chicagoan would probably never notice. Despite everything I said above, the restaurant is actually quite good on the whole, just a bit lackluster when compared to the other jewels in the Garces crown. It was the best meal I had in Chicago. Except for the drunk Dominos delivery. That was killer.
