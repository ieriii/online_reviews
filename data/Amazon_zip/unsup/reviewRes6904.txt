Pros: great food, service was excellent, great moscato Cons: n/a Been here before on family style Monday's and thought the food was awesome. Service was the downside that day but I can't say anything bad about this place this time around. Went here for a post birthday dinner and everyone that I was with enjoyed their food. Everyone including me thought the place inside looked terrific. My girlfriend and I had eaten outside before which is always nice to do during the summer months in the Chi. I had ordered the gnocchi which came with just enough pesto and grana padano. I let everyone taste mine and have had my fair share of poorly made gnocchi but this was far better. Not gummy or over cooked like most places. The others from my group had the lobster ravioli, chilean sea bass, and seafood risotto which I had tried again except for the sea bass . Not surprised that it tasted as good as the first time. I'm more impressed that the food came out the same or even better than the last. Great job on consistency. I'll make sure to try the dessert next time and come on Tuesday's for tapas.
