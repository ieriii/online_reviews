#2 of the now Francesca mini-empire is still great, but I'm only giving it 3 stars. Why? Because just 5 minutes north is the same thing with no wait at Francesca's at Bryn Mawr. Food is still great (starting with killer bread), martinis are nice and fat and still less than $10, and they still make one of the best red sauces in the city. However, the wait. Went in on a Wednesday, and had a 30 minute wait. Some restaurants are worth it, but the way I figure, why not try to reclaim that 30 minutes of my life by hiking up north a bit? That way, more time for critical activities, such as catching up on my DVR's taped shows. Anyway, Francesca's is still great (loved the pumpkin ravioli), just save some time and head north unless you have a reservation.
