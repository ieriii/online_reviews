I'm here right this second, working this smart phone like a Cardiac Surgeon. Anyone know the BCS Championship score? Fourth time here since they opened it. I don't have much time, because my client is going to be back shortly. He got an important phone call from the Mrs. that he elected to take outdoors as things heated up, but it's about 18 below out, so I know my time is limited. First of all, go here, end of discussion. The hot new thing in Chicago these days is to label a new place over-hyped a year later after it comes out of the gates blazing with rave reviews and fanfare. After all, it's the cool thing to do in that quest for the next big thing, especially in the downtown locations. I'm a throwback, so I'm a fan of many of the old Chicago staples that peaked and crashed faster than your favorite Reality TV show that many locals now dismiss as "Too touristy" or having much better options at some secluded shoebox in Andersonville, Lincoln Square, or Wicker Park......sigh.  This place is legit. Layout: 5 Star Talent: 4 Star (3 in the Winter, 5 in the Summer, typical Chicago) Service: 5 Star Food: 3 Star Decor: 5 Star Intangibles: 5 Star My top 5 favorite Items on the menu: 1) Lemongrass Beef Lollipops 2) Crab Cake Crusted Ahi Tuna Sashimi 3) Wild Asian Mushroom And Asparagus Toban (vegetarian, tastes phenomenal, only thing I've gotten each time) 4) Spicy Tako Roll - octopus, tobiko, scallion, cucumber, spicy mayo & I'm slim, so screw it...... 5) The Ridiculous - a hot carrot cake with nuts and hot creamy sauce wrapped around a thick hard Gigantic scoop of Vanilla Ice Cream.  The menu is so deep you could come in ten times over and it'd be a unique experience. Go with a large group and load up on booze and rolls, and I guarantee you a top-shelf evening. Ok, I gotta bounce, he's coming back, and my ice cream is melting...
