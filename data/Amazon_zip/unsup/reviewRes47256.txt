Our order got lost once and the manager comped our meal even though we didnt ask. That's great customer service. My only complaint with the food is that the macaroni and cheese uses either american cheese or velveeta. More chedder please. The burgers are amazing though, try the federales or fat elvis (its better than you think). Way easier to get into than Kumas. They just need to answer the phone when I call to make an order for pickup!
