Some may find it tacky, but I think it's really interesting in here! I have flashbacks of The Drink there, and it's cool how they turned it into a restaurant. Also, you can find a recurring theme in all the photos --- it's quite a collection. It's loud and crazy, but there does seem to be some organization amongst all the madness. I can't remember the exact name of the dish I had - maybe the king salmon? What got me is that the waiting proudly told us it had double the fat content of 'regular' salmon. At first, that turned me off - who wants to eat fatty food? Well, at least it's rich in Omega 3's. ;) Anyway, he convinced me, and well, it was delicious! We also had the ceviche, which was also yummy, and some salad with heirloom tomatoes. Not cheap, but you pay for the entire experience.
