Was in Chicago visiting a few of my besties and they took me to Longman & Eagle and I was impressed! Even the hipster crowd was tolerable since the food was fabulous. It was a warm summer night so we sat outside in the outdoor patio. The beer selection was excellent - tried the Bell's Oberon (closest to a hefeweizen) and New Belgium Eric's Ale. Flipped the page on the menu and there is a page of just whiskey! For $3 a shot, you can try any whiskey to have ever existed because as they say, "whiskey is for your mouth, not for our shelf". For dinner, we had the seared scallops (cooked to perfection), foie gras (best I've ever had), and the grilled berkshire pork cheek with gnocchi. Everything on the menu looked delicious. It was surprisingly crowded on a Thursday evening but the wait staff was quick and extraordinarily friendly. The crowd was diverse. The restaurant was intimate and inviting. If I'm in Chicago again, I definitely plan to return!
