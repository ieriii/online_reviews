We had an overall diappointing experience here recently. I reserved on opentable for 8:15pm on a TH, arrived on time, and was told we would have to wait 20 minutes. We were seated at 9:00pm, at a bar table, only after I asked whether we should leave. There were a lot of irritated to angry patrons piled up at the bar. Apparently, this restaurant, like some other fashionable spots, does not take the concept of a reservation seriously. The service was very good -- enthusiastic and reasonably attentive, given how busy it was. The room is a spectacle -- huge and highly designed. The food was very creative and used the freshest and highest quality ingredients. And the presentation was very professional and attractive. However, some dishes were knockouts and others disappointed. At this price point, nearly every dish should be very good to excellent. Overall, a big tab for a mixed dining experience at an obnoxiously managed establishment. For the same price, I would rather eat five meals at more casual tapas places run by nicer people.
