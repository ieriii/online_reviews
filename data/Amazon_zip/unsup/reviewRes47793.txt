I have now been to Zed 451 for dinner, drinks, bar food and just the harvest table a number of times. I love the location, the layout is just great for people watching from the bar as well as in the dining area. The food is unbelievable! If you think Brazzaz's and Fogo are all that then you have never been to Zed's. Zed's is the upscale versions of Brazzaz and Fogo. If you are looking for a place that has a variety of meats and changes monthly/weekly/daily then you need to go to Zed's! My recommendation is to start with a drink at the bar then mosey on over to the dining area. I have had a couple of their signature martini's that are to die for, the white grape and rosemary and the clementini. Definitely be adventurous when you are at the bar. They have a decent sized bar menu and it will be expanding soon from what I have heard. I recommend the tuna carpaccio, the wild boar ribs and the various sliders. It is not a place to go alone, take someone with or even a group, you will have a blast. During the warmer days the rooftop is open for cocktails and has a great view of the city. If you have the chance and it is present on the charcuterie table, try the duck salami!!! It is to die for if you love aged meats!! There are a couple of great dishes the chefs bring to your table that you should try and they are the Ahi with 2 diferent types of sauce on the top and bottom of the plating, the venison with a bordelaise sauce and sauted onions and the roasted duck breast with a grand marnier sauce with mandarin oranges. The salmon, Moroccan chicken and prime rib are good choices that are brought around by the chefs. Try to save room for dessert, they have a very, very tasty smores treat that is to die for!!! I cannot wait to plan my birthday party in May!!!
