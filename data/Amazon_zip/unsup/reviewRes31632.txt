One of my favorite restaurants in Chicago! The Buddha Burger is absolutely delicious, as are the ridiculously rich and creamy vegan shakes! The service is great and the waiters are so nice. Chicago Diner is perfect for vegetarians, vegans, and gluten free foodies, but meat eaters can find plenty to enjoy here too! I would recommend this place to anyone!
