Love the atmosohere of this place. It is very bright, open, and can put anyone in a good mood. The food is awesome and they have a solid drink menu that is full of different mojito creations. My favorite menu items are the skirt steak and the ahi tuna... but everything is good. There is also a beef and plaintain appetizer that you can not miss. This is a fun place for groups. It is my go to spot if I am planning a work dinner or a celebration with friends.
