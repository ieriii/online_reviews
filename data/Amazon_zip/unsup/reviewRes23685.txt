I went to this restaurant after work on a whim. Quite simply, the food was not that good. It was very Americanized Greek food, lacking any real kicks of distinguishable flavor. Also, our meals came out to us, literally, 2 minutes after ordering them. This makes me ask how pre-made and heat lamped these dishes were (hell....I've had to wait longer at McDonald's). This place is like the Applebee's of the Greek restaurant world: 80% forced ambiance 20% quality food. Sure, the Greek Islands has valet and white table cloths....but its only there to justify prices, the second you sit down your being "nudged" to finish up and get the hell out. The staff was not friendly, the food was mediocre, and you will be herded like cattle to finish your meal so that new customers can be seated.
