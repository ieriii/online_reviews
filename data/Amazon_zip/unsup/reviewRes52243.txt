yes, i am a tourist. i wanted to try the deep dish pizza experience. actually, i've had it before but i haven't had in a lonnng time and when i went here i was not happy. the place claims the pizza is 'worth the wait' (45+ minutes?!?!) but it really wasn't. i'm not a fan of dry, cornbread crust. the marinara sauce served w/ the fried ravioli was good... and the waitstaff seemed nice enough... plus i got to write on the walls and color. points for those things... but minus lots of points for the food and long wait. i probably won't go to gino's east again if i'm ever in chicago... maybe i'll try giordano's or trek to 'art of pizza'.
