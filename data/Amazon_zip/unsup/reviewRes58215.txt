Didn't have the chicken like most folks who come here, instead I had the Baby Buddha Bi Bim Bop ..... it was alright, nothing special. One comment I have is the egg that is one top of the rice had it's egg white edges cut off. Strange. Why do that and where do the edges go? Just leave the egg alone, please!Next time I'll try the fried chicken.
