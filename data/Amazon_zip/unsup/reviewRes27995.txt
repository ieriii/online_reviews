I haven't been to Frontera since the 90's. The food was great: ceviche, guacamole, little cheese empanada things, chicken taquitos. I had the chicken enchiladas with mole, deeply delicious and satisfying. Flan and chocolate pecan pie topped it off with a sweet and tasty ending. The three stars are for the very spotty service. Two people at my table had their orders messed up and had to wait while the rest of us started eating. That's just bad all around. Should this be happening at one of the most popular restaurants in the city?
