I used to work around here and my co-workers were always ordering. I loathe hotdogs (except when I was pregnant - I ate like 1,000) and have always been a little grossed out by not-dogs. Anyway, I love all the condiments and everything. I finally ordered a not-dog and it was good. It did creep me out a little because it tasted like real meat. I had to call and verify that it was indeed a fake-meat hot dog. Whoever I spoke with was very nice and proud of the kind of fake hot dogs they serve. Kudos for a place that serves duck-fat-french-fries for also serving quality meatless hot dogs. PS. It's been a few years, so I hope they still serve the meatless hot dogs!
