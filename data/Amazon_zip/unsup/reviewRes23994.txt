This Greek themed restaurant seems like something I'd find in Disney World. It felt more theatrical than authentic. After watching an Anthony Bourdain special on Greece, I expected that the entire menu would be greens picked from a rooftop garden. Hoping for greens, I was surprised to only find a small side of spinach, tomato and rice. I enjoyed my food, including grilled octopus salad, but I would not come back for more.
