I have been meaning to try this place for the longest time. My friend who loves good brunch spots was in from NYC so I knew we had to experience Yoke. We stopped on our way to the Hyde Park Jazz Fest about 12:30 pm on a Saturday. Of course, the line was out the door. Put our name in for the 40 minute wait. I think we got in under 25 minutes. Be prepared to wait in line. So the decor is super cute. Really positive and upbeat but not too obnoxious. This is a breakfast place after all. Server came right over who is just a doll. Filled us up on coffee. Food came out what appeared to be 15 minutes later. Perfect. My friend had The Ricky: Spinach omelette with charizo, avocado, green pepper, onions, jack and sour cream. She upgraded her side with an extra $ 1.95 to fruit and nut pancakes. That's right, a side option to the omelette is their to-die-for pancakes. Totally satisfied. I did the Big Texas Fajita Omelette with grilled chicken, onion, green pepper and salsa. Comes with cheese and sour cream but I passed on both. Had it made with egg whites for no extra cost which was really good. Only complaint was the chicken: more shredded Chicken than fajita style tender strips I was expecting but none-the-less really good. He even brought me extra salsa. Side of fruit was amazing. Huge portions for a good price. Plus they get such a diverse crowd of people that its refreshing experience compared to the stuffies up in my neighborhood. Oh and i guess you can get a % off your total if you go to Columbia College. When we were paying at the counter some U of C "kids" were giving the guy a hard time because "we got the discount in the past." Clearly this is not the case but he still gave them the discount. What a great guy. My friend is in Grad school at Columbia College in NYC...tried for the discount. No dice. :) Totally happy with this place and will for sure go back.
