Well i ordered wrong when I went here. I got a chicken wrap and while it was fine, i was so bummed I didn't order the pork sandwich that my BF got. I hate when we order the same thing so i changed my mind ....and after taking one bite i immediately regretted it! The salad bar was cool, I didn't order it but it looks fun. We went there about 3 weeks ago and I'm still thinking about the pork sandwich. I guess that means I'll have to go back ...but probably on a night when its less packed -- the tables are so close together, so rather than feeling like i was sitting at a table of 2, i felt like it was a table of 8 and there were many strangers who were in my bubble.
