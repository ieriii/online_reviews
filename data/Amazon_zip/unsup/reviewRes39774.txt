Ugh, I am getting soooo freaking sick of all the new hot spots around town that are trying to be overly clever and tricky with their food. It feels utterly pretentious, fake and idiotic. This joint was no exception. While paging through the menu, each dish had some merit, however one or two ingredients seemed to be thrown in there for some 'wow' factor. Bone marrow??? Please. I ended up ordering the olive dish and a salad. 2 stars for the nice waitress, simple decor (thank goodness something was), and cool artwork. I won't be returning anytime soon.
