This is a perfect place to take people from out of town, and probably is in the top three for deep dish in this city. I left a piece in the back of a cab once, and I'll never forgive myself.It's more of a delivery or pick up kind of place, since the area to eat is more like a mcdonalds, but who cares-This stuff is GOLD.
