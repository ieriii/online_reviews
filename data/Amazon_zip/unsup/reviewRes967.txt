Un. F*cking. Believable. The fois gras and sauternes duck dog with truffle aioli was hands down the best encased meat dish I have ever tasted, and was probably in the top 10 all-time lunches of my life time. It might seem like hyperbole, but honestly, you gotta try this hot dog. I went at 12:45pm on a Tuesday, and there were probably 20 people in line in front of me. As I waited (about 30 min), the line behind me grew steadily. But when I crossed thru the threshold of the door, I saw that there was plenty of seating inside. They've got a good system, and it is WELL worth the wait. I was on a solo mission, and when I got closer to the counter, I realized it was CASH ONLY. I only had $11 cash on me. Panic ensued. I'm frantic, thinking what do I do? Will someone hold my spot? Where is there an ATM?? And I call myself a pro Yelper! How could I let this happen? Ok, get a grip, I think to myself. The fois gras dog is listed as $9, tax included in all listed prices. I'll just get a cup of water to go with it. I get to the front of the line, and there he is: Doug himself, taking orders in his hipster glasses and tshirt. I mention something casually about only having enough cash for a foie gras dog, and he INSISTS that I get fries and a fountain drink with it, refusing to charge me for the fries and drink. He's all like, you waited in line, you came all this way, you gotta try some fries. What?!? This is a rare Tuesday miracle! But that's just the kind of guy Doug is, and that's the kind of place this is. So, long story long, I would make a trip to Chicago just to come back here. And I live in New Orleans. Wow.
