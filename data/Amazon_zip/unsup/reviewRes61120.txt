My family and I have been going here since I was little and it's probably my favorite place to go in Chicago to eat. It's where we take family if they haven't been to Chicago, it's where we go with a lot of people to celebrate. It is a lot of food for cheap, it tastes excellent and is filling.Their burritos are probably what they're most famous for and they're excellent. Dinners and Tortas are also very good but you should probably share with one other person because they are huge and maybe even more filling than the burritos. As far as I know the food is authentic (enough for me anyways) but whether or not it is it's delicious.
