My favorite place to dine in the city is Sapori. I adore the food, the service, the ambiance. It's a fantastic place! My favorites: the avocado crostini and the Cappellacci di Zucca. I've never had a bad meal here and I have been way too many times to count. Every out of towner I have brought here still raves about.
