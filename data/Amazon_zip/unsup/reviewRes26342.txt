D-d-d-damn, son! This pizza was incredible. Layers of delicious cheese, a tasty sauce that beats out most of the competition and the crust. Oh my god, the crust. Caramelized cheese on the crust was the most brilliant thing about Pequod's. Last night I ate like a fat kid going out of style and already I'm looking forward to lunch today. Moral of the story: stop reading reviews and go get some. You won't be sorry.
