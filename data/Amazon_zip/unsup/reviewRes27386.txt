I really enjoy, as both a customer and as industry, when the chef comes out of the kitchen to check on the tables. Chef Bowels did exactly that as we were snacking on popcorn waiting for our entrees after our delicious appetizers (holy hell, the gnocci.). I had the Pork chop with Rootbeer barbeque sauce, and my friend had the Skatewing. Both were textually perfect and the sauces were innovative and different, but well balanced. the chop was HUGE and I couldn't get thru the whole thing. For dessert, we had the chocolate cake with the crushed whoppers (i thought it was going to be a gimmick but no, it was delicious) and the lemon blueberry dessert. So tasty and light, i wanted to order seconds. Everything on the menu is innovative and there is a real attention to detail when it comes to presentation and the way flavours mix. I will definitly be back to try more items on the menu. Oh! and the cocktails are wonderfully seasonal and light.
