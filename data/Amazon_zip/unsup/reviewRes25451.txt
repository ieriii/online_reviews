Such a fun alternative to the standard fancy dinner! Definitely a much better experience than the only other fondue place I'm aware of - Melting Pot. Very quaint and unique atmosphere, although the romantic part is a little confusing. It was mostly groups, friends, double dates, etc when my boyfriend and I went. Not that it makes for a bad date, but it could be fun in lots of other scenarios too. It's all prefixed dinners, where you get the cheese appetizer course and chocolate dessert course, and each person can pick their meat course. I'm very glad that each diner can pick a different one, since I'm more of a seafood person, and the bf of course wanted meat. The service was great, food as good as fondue is expected to be, and prices not bad at all. Definitely worth going if you have one of those buy one get one coupons they send out constantly.
