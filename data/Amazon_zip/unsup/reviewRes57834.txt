We tried Nana for lunch with a group from the office. The expectations were high as we had read great reviews and some of the group had been before and loved the food. I had the Mushroom burger with a Cauliflower soup, there were both excellent, portions were huge. My friend had chilaquiles and while not 100% autentic (they are made layered like lasagna and with poblano in the sauce vs the green tomatillo that is how its done authentically) it was a great new take on chilaquiles. Someone had a chicken sandwich HUGE and really good. The food will definitely make me come back for lunch or breakfast. I was, however, dissapointed at the service, the place was busy with large group and maybe that had someting to do with it, while friendy and smiley it lacked that something that makes service great. A couple of things forgotten in the order, etc just not to par with the food. I definitely recommend it for the food.
