My boyfriend and I grabbed a bottle of saki and had our friday night date at Coast. Hands down the best sushi I have ever had in Chicago... or anywhere. Our server Devin was great and went over all the specials and off the menu items. We took his suggestions and had the summer roll. It was very fresh and light. We also order the dragon roll, I could have eaten 10 more. The perfect combo of flavors and textures. Perfect place for a date night or just to grab a bit. We will be back!
