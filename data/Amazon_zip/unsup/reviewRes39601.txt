What can I say? if you want authentic Korean food and and especially late at night, this is the place to go. I was taken here by some friends on a random night out, and I left here completely happy, not only by the food but the fact that it was open late, and just hit that right spot after a night out. Its really authentic, (soju with food is always a bonus) The best part of being here was the beginning when there are like 20 little side dishes to start you off before the main meal comes, i loved it and even took pictures...will post soon. In the end, a great place, great food, and well worth it!
