Solid food, fantastic coffee, convenient location. But....... However, I'm sorry M & H, but I'm bored and irritated. I've been coming to your cafe for 3 years now and its the same small selection. On top of that, you've hired one or two rude servers who have actually inspired me to forfeit my spot in line and leave 2 times in the last year. If you weren't located so close and didn't serve the number one hangover cure (huevos rancheros) I wouldn't keep coming back for the abuse.  I'm sorry, but I've replaced you with the Birchwood Kitchen on North- they've taken your concept and done it better with a wider menu and better service.
