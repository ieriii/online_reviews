I'm upgrading my review from 4 to 5 stars because I LOVE this pizza. Piece's "red" pizza has the perfect crust. A combination of chewy and crispy with just the right thickness. They don't skimp on toppings. And they have some delicious beer too. It gets crazy on weekends at night. I went on Saturday at 8pm and it was packed. Scenario-- 3 hungry girls, we spent the last 5 hours moving furniture from the burbs into the city. Rather than wait an hour for a table, we ordered a pizza to go and grabbed beers while we waited. Since our stomachs were empty, the beers hit us pretty hard. We walked home with our pizza practically singing in the streets and DEVOURED the food in record time. It was half jalapeno/sausage and half clams/onions. The clam/onion side was surprisingly great. I was left in a beer & pizza induced state of euphoria. Life is good. fyi, they deliver now. $3.
