Piccolo Signo is a shmancy restaurant that knows what it's doing. Everything was organized, well-paced, and well-executed by a large and efficient staff. The food was very good! I particularly enjoyed my pear and goat cheese salad.  I would recommend this restaurant for special family or romantic occasions. The acoustics were great, reducing background noise despite the high volume of people. The lighting was ambient without being dark.  The location is strange, but it's not the type of casual restaurant one just happens upon, so if you plan your trip it's fine.
