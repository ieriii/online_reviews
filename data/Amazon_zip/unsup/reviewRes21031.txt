I was sick for a week after eating here. English style "gastropub" read expensive pub food. The waiter was pretty uninterested in me and my girlfriend for reasons we couldn't fathom. It wasn't that busy, he just seemed disappointed by everything we ordered. My filet mignon was terrible. My girlfriend chicken was slightly better. I'm sure if you drink enough booze you'll not notice how awful the food is. Just like a real English pub.
