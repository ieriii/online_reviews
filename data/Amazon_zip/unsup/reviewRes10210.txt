New Year's Eve at Piccolo Sogno = best NYE ever! We came for dinner, and since it was NYE we received a glass of complimentary champagne as soon as we sat down at our table. Such a nice touch.... Piccolo Sogno has an incredible menu...pastas that can be created as appetizers, so you have the option to try many different pasta dishes. Many salads, pizzas, and fish to choose from as well. The gnocchi might just be the best gnocchi in Chicago! The atmosphere here is true upscale Italian Chicago: excellent service, prompt delivery of the meal, and a cozy environment. And Piccolo Sogno is one of those rare restaurants that works both as a restaurant for romantic dinners for two as well as a restaurant that works well for large parties. I would recommend this restaurant to everyone!
