Service: God Awful! Food: Just okay I have been to a number of Indian Restaurants and found the buffet was decent but nothing special. The naan was subpar, dry and cold and I have had better just about anywhere on Devon. The buffet staples such as chicken tikka masala were a bit lacking in flavor. Now, on to the service which was, as I said, probably some of the worst service I've had anywhere. We had a reservation for 10 and expected that if we showed up on time ( to a substantially less-than-packed house no less) we would be accomodated. This was not the case. Our server then dumped half a martini on my coworker while unelegantly serving our drinks. An honest mistake, but he didn't bother to apologize, offer a replacement, take it off the bill, or even acknowledge. Just went right along yelling out drinks for us to claim (since he clearly had no recollection of who ordered what). Once the drinks were literally "dumped off" we never saw our server again until he brought the bill around. The general attitude amongst hosts, servers, etc. was that they were doing you a favor. Will never be back.
