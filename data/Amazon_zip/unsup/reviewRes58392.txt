WHAT WERE WE THINKING? We'd been going to a few different Middle Eastern style restaurants, more conveniently located to our home. Yet, none of them could compare to the the perfect Persian provender of Noon O Kebab! The food here is excellent. The Hummus and Baba Ghannouj were fresh, light, silky smooth and accompanied by just-from-the-oven naan. Next, we had the Koubideh combo: one skewer of seasoned ground beef and one of seasoned ground chicken, both flavor-filled, melt-in-your-mouth, meat treats! I threw in an extra lamb kabob, which was also throw-away-the-steak-knife tender and succulent. The kabobs were served with light and fluffy Persian white or dill rice and slightly charbroiled tomato wedges. The Baklava for dessert, was a nice, sweet night cap to this Persian fare. Additionally, they have a decent wine and beer selection. For beer drinkers, skip the Turkish Efe Pilsner and try the Argentinian Quilmes or Brazilian Palma Louca Lagers. The entire staff is extremely nice, welcoming and accommodating. Our server was a bit absent for the 2nd half of the meal, but a couple of other servers noticed and came to her aid - so, thank you to them. Impeccable food, friendly service and a nice atmosphere make Noon O Kebab our favorite place for Middle Eastern style cuisine.
