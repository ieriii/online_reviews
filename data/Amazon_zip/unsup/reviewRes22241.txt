I was just writing another review when thoughts of Lao Sze Chuan crept into my head. Yes, this place gets busy. Yes, the waitstaff could be friendlier. But yes, the food is amazing! If you don't mind a long wait this place is worth it! My BF always orders the spicy chicken -the soupy one, not the dry one- and I always try something new. My latest love is there sole fish filet. We will definitely go back but not on a Saturday night!
