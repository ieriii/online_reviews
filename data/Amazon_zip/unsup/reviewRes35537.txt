My friend had a Lettuce Entertain You giftcard so after much deliberation we decided to spend it at Shaws and definitely were not disappointed. The whole affair seemed very old New York, wait staff that took care of you from start to finish and an atmosphere that had a warm, jazzy vibe, even on a sub-zero January night. Our waiter was very attentive and helpful -- after mentioning it was our first time there he made some wonderful suggestions and, at the end of the meal, gave us a free slice of pie since it was our first visit. The food was fantastic. We started with the seafood fritters which were light and airy and had a spicy remoulade. I had the Dungeness and King crab plate and my friend had the surf and turf. Everything was cooked perfectly. We also ordered the potatoes au gratin and the braised brussell sprouts. Though I thought the potatoes were a bit too heavy (a little too much baked on cheese on the top) the brussell sprouts were to die for. I rarely leave leftovers on my plate but everything was so good I was stuffed to the brim and couldn't eat anymore. It is quite pricey (we probably wouldn't have gone without the giftcard) but worth it for the service and the food.
