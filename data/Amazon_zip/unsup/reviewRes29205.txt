Before I discovered Pequods, I was a stalwart supporter of the Lou Malnati deep dish, but the caramelized cheese crust is the best I've ever had. Its nary burnt and is complimented by a saltier, sweeter, sauce than Lou's. Its cheaper too, and the kitchen's open til 2am most days allowing you to gorge late at night. The lunch special, a personal pan pizza, is size of almost two slices and comes with a pint of beer or pop for 5 bucks. The staff is always super nice, even late as hell when you think you're being a bother. Calling ahead is always a great idea when ordering deep dish otherwise you'll have a 45 min wait. This place is hands down my favorite deep dish pizza in Chicago.
