I would give this restaurant 0 stars. While I have been a patron for several years, this restaurant has changed and I would NOT recommend it to anyone - no matter the price of the meal. The owner and manager are very rude and cursed me out in person and on the phone when I tried to discuss the unacceptable experience we had dining at Caro Mio. The service was horrendous, the food was not edible, the dishes and silverware were filthy - need I say more. Furthermore, the server brought us the wrong food - not one of the dishes we ordered was delivered to us, but rather we were given food that was not identifiable and not edible. I guess they had to clean out the old food in the kitchen and serve it to what they thought were unsuspecting customers. When the manager stopped by to see how we were enjoying the meal, we asked him if he wanted the truth and then politely expressed our thoughts. He proceeded to threaten us, threw the bill at us and kicked us out of the restaurant. We paid the FULL bill in cash as we were afraid he would come after us - in hind site we should have just left as we didn't touch any of the food for fear we would get sick. Upon trying to speak with the owner about the incident, we learned that the manager complained we didn't pay the bill - it appears as though he must have pocketed the $100 in cash we left.With so many great restaurants in Chicago, why would anyone want to go to Caro Mio and get abused and possible sick from their rancid food and dirty environment.
