One random Saturday afternoon Aaron picked up our food network magazine to see a spread about the fifty states and the best pizza in each one, we decided to see for ourselves if this place could beat out Uno;s and Lou's. It's a divey dark, kinda small but with a second floor kind of bar setting place. The waitstaff adorn shirts of the mascot which is a whale with a pair of panties on it's head. I couldn't figure out what the joke was there, but ah well. Everyone was friendly enough. Aaron and I decided to order up a deep dish pepperoni pizza and the fried appetizer platter. The timing was good because the appetizer came out fairly quickly. Everything on it was good, the stand out though, were the Jalapeno poppers. They had cheddar cheese in the middle rather than the more standard cream cheese. It was a really nice and tasty touch. The pizza was also fantastic. I loved the touch of the burnt parm cheese cooked on top of the crust. It was also a very balanced za just the right amount of sauce and cheese on it. The dough had almost an olive oil taste to it, and I swear that the sauce had a touch of red wine in it. The pep[eroni was nice and crisp and thin sliced with a hint of spice in it. All in all it was a great dinner. I keep telling Aaron that we need to make a return trip because that za was crave worthy.
