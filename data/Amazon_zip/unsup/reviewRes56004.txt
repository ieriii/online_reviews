If I could, I'd give this place a negative rating. I didn't even try the water, but based on the terrible treatment from merely walking in the door one Sunday morning to have brunch, starting with the discourteous treatment from the 'hostess', and then being escorted past literally dozens of empty tables, and some tables occupied by people similarly dressed to my friend and me, we were seated at the very back of the restaurant, with only one other occupied table even within view, and immediately next to the kitchen (which is not separated by any door or any other noise-muffling barrier). We sat to peruse the menu for just a minute before deciding to leave and go to a place which treats their patrons better.
