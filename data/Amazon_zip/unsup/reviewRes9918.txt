The pizzas we got were AMAZING! Best pizza I've had in years. Get here early on Friday nights or prepare for the longest wait of your life. (but it is worth it!) Our waitress was not so great, she would disappear for long periods of time and wasn't very friendly at all. Wasn't bad enough to take a star though. The pizza quality makes up for it.
