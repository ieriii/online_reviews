Superdawg is the best place for a true Chicago-style hot dog. Superdawg is just that little bit better than other places and has more stuff on their menu than just hot dogs. The hot dog is so juicy and huge (I always get cheese on mine try it) and the bun is soft and warm. The Fries are crispy and soft and yummy! My boyfriend always get the burgers and shakes from here too and they are pretty good too! Its not too pricey. It can be a long wait if you go during lunch or the weekends but so worth the wait. I think it's a cute join and the guys there are pretty nice too and get your order up quickly as possible.
