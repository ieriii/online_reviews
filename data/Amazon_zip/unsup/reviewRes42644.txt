Rode the "L" here from Wrigleyville around 11:45 pm not really sure what we had in mind because we weren't hungry and neither of us drink. I'm directionally challenged so it was relieving that the moment we stepped off the train I could see the sign for Gilt Bar. Walking in the lighting was perfect, not too dark. A lot of hustle and bustle but not too loud. Music playlist was very eclectic; it was nice to hear something different for a change. A minor situation with the restroom where I walked in on a drunk couple, and being screamed at to close the door. What I want to know is why the boyfriend was supervising her in this process? To my amusement I stood right outside the door so she had to walk past me on her way out. Talk about walk of shame. Celine and I narrowed it down to dessert yet again (we had a long day) with scoops of ice cream. Rocky road for her and mint n' chip for me. I've never had such a full on mint flavor from an ice cream before, it was definitely worth the trip. Her rocky road was full of fluffy marshmallows and nuts and was easily the best rocky road I've ever had. We asked our waitress if they make their own ice cream and she told us they do. I'm totally tempted to come back for dinner and see what else they have to offer.
