Aggravating & disappointing. I would pay the prices if it was worth it. The staff are completely delusional. Half empty restaurant & it takes the hostess way too long to pretend to find us a seat. the first time we were there we had to send an entree back because the fried accompaniment was still frozen-twice! Since they gave us a gift card to return we decided to give Sprout another shot. We do like the chef-he seems sweet! However, we were disappointed again. Toast w the lox barely edible, service retarded & the drinks were horrid. Next time bartend don't taste the drink & put the spoon back into it! Gross! We left with still a $70 bill -ridiculous for what we ate. Oh & the buns-don't bother. I have to say the decor is pretty, the chef is cute & the plating & some flavors are nice, but step it up please!! I really wanted to like this place!
