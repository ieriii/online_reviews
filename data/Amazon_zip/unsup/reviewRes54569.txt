Chicago. I'm sorry. You just don't know what good Lebanese food is. Maybe, you personally didn't vote for this being the best Middle Eastern in Chicago, somebody keeps doing it. I guess I'm spoiled because I come from Detroit and the Dearborn area surrounding it has the largest population of Middle Easterners outside of the Middle East and therefore has tons of excellent Middle Eastern restauraunts. I've been searching for a good one in the entire Chicago area for almost six years and just haven't found one that holds a candle to the Detroit establishments.   This place, to me, is just flavorless. The hummous is lacks any bite to it, the baba is funky, the grape leaves mushy. There isn't tahini sauce anywhere to be seen. People, do yourself a favor, and if you happen to be going to Detroit, stop by one of the many far superior Middle Eastern establishments in the metro Detroit area. Some that immediately come to mind are Beirut Palace (3 locations), Cedar Garden in Harper Woods, Cedarland in Dearborn. You could try anywhere and you would never step into another Middle Eastern restaurant in Chicago again. Also, I agree with somebody who also said that they felt that the staff seemed as if they were doing you a favor.   If you're looking for a bland food experience and like to hang around trust fund hipsters, maybe this is your place.
