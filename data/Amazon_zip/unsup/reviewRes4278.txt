I took my grandmother here about a month ago so that she could reminisce the days when she used to dance at the Green Mill. We walked in the door and she told the bartender "The last time I was here it was 1948 and it was a dance hall". It was a really special moment! The Green Mill has such a special atmosphere. It is very real, authentic, homey! For being somewhat of a tourist destination, its pretty amazing it maintains this atmosphere.
