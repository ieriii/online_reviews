I am a Chinese. We've ordered flaming cheese, stuffed lamb loin and stuffed calamari. Flaming cheese is very fancy but too salty. I do not like it. Stuff calamari is cheap (around $11) and tastes good. Stuffed lamb loin is OK. Compared to its price (around $16), it is less appealing than the calamari.  The overall decoration is exotic. The service is so so. Because there are too many people, they are very busy and have less time on you. But they do ask you about the food and service.
