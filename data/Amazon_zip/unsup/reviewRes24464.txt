Had another quick meal here. The crostini appetizer and fries with dijon and feta were yummy. The iced cappuccino was excellent as always. I wasn't feeling their wood fired pizza though. The crust was heavy and the sauce was seemingly absent. Recommend avoiding the pizza and sticking to dessert and food here.
