This may be the only time I've ever written this in my life: Worth the wait. Since I'm not the subject of this review, I'm not gonna go on about how impatient I am or how I hate to wait. But, allow an extra hour (half?) for lunch here on the weekend. To the Doug's. Delicious! EXACTLY what I want- great food, fun place, and amazing food. The food was really good too. In fact- if I could have my 'would rathers', I would eat at places like this all the time, it kind of ruined my last few weeks of dining out, quite frankly - to sit down in shorts and a tshirt, not deal with shitty service, pretentious staff, or over-written menus and just have GREAT FOOD is SO refreshing! Incredible flavors, amazing presentation (who doesn't love a sausage on a bun in a plastic basket), and basically incredible all around. I tried 4 sausages and I'm not gonna list them, but I didn't have a single thing that I wasn't CRAZY about. Cheers to you, Mr. Sausage man.
