Yumm yumm yummmThe big bad wold huffed and puffed and got the best wine and swine meal ever!!!I love love love this restaurant, i have been there maybe 7 time know and will continue to go! The beet salad, the eggplant and bread dish and he chicken thigh is sooo good, as well as all the other dishes i had but cant remembe the names for were delicious too. I love the decor i feel like im back in spain even though i would classify the restaurant as meditereanan tapas. regardless a must try in chicago!!
