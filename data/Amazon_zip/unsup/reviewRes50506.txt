I recently ate here for both brunch and dinner and while most of what we had was very good (dinner: chicken fried steak, veggie gumbo; brunch: New Orleans Benedict), I think the highlight was our server Laura. As a former server I know it's a tough job, dishes aren't always on time from the kitchen and diners can be pretty pissy and feel entitled for dropping $20 on a place, but she was one of the most friendly servers I've had. She knew every dish on the menu and was very helpful when our dinner party asked about 15 questions. Also I honestly can't imagine why this place isn't more crowded, even with the economy being horrible there is still way too long of lines at much less interesting places. I won't name them but I live in Bucktown and I don't have to look far for mediocre spots. If you're there for dinner make sure to save room for a slice of red velvet cake. Some of the best I've had and I like their use of beets rather than red #40. Say yes to all that is great about beets, no to associated neurotoxicity.
