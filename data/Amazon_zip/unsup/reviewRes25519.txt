Love this place... from good drinks to good food and great pastries. It is one of the best cafe's in Greek town and most loyal to a diverse clientele. I have to say everything is great but I must admit... I don't like "feta cheese" in 90% of the foods including pizza.  And... it does close a little early.  So it forces me to go to the lesser area's in Greektown in which I tend to refuse.  Generally... its an awesome place with good service,
