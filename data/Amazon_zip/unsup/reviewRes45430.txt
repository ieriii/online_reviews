After much anticipation the wife, a few friends and myself hit up Wilde around 10pm last Friday night. As expected Wilde is a beautiful place and absolutely huge! I am still amazed at how big it is. That being said, it took some work to get a table, the place was packed and the hostess was sitting people arbitrarily. Otherwise, the food was great, beer came quick and we had a great time although service could improve a little. I do have one major point of constructive criticism here. They have a DJ booth in the back and at 11:00pm he started spinning Boystown's top dance hits very loudly and the lights were dimmed. By 11:15, the place had emptied out with about 20 stragglers hanging out by the bar. Why???? Because there is no dance floor, just empty tables and the skinny Irish bouncer was the only one dancing. So the dancers couldn't dance and the loungers couldn't lounge as the best of "Gay Party Hits '07" was at full volume. Now I understand that Wilde was named after the dandiest of all Dandies, but it needs to decide what it wants to be. It can be an upscale Gastro Pub where post dinner patrons can enjoy a good drink and some lively conversation amidst a great setting and low key music. Or it could be a dinner/dance club, but then it would need a dance floor, all they have to do is remove the tables in the back bar area. Anyway, it just needs to make a choice and I hope it does as I plan on coming here frequently no matter what the choice is.
