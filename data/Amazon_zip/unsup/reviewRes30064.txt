I've been on this brunch kick lately. I mean, I always love brunch... but lately, I want it everyday, for every meal, ALL THE TIME. BRUNCH. It's awesome. So on friday, I went to brunch, even though a lot of places don't serve brunch on fridays. They serve breakfast. What's the difference? I don't really know. I think brunch may include sandwiches. Anyway, at 3rd coast I got a breakfast sandwich with the following corrections... INSTEAD of sourdough (blehg) I got it on an english muffin (yum) and I added bacon (Yu--huuuummm) that the server said was the BEST BACON IN CHICAGO. True? Maybe. It was good, thick. We asked him how the bacon got so good... are they stashing some pigs in back? He said no, it's all about the cut and the way it's cooked. Anyway, the sandwich was good. Not too amazing, but I was pleased. Also got freshly squeezed orange juice that was good. I'd like to come here for a proper brunch sometime, and not "breakfast" because I think their brunch menu is larger.  Also a side note, this place reminded me of my grandparents. Probably because it's a block away from the condo they used to live in... but maybe they even brought me here when I was young and naive?  much like how many likes it takes to get to the tootsie roll center of a tootsie pop, the world may never know.
