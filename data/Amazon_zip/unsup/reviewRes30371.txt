The 3rd coast is a nice low profile classy cafe. It's perfect for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Their menu features breakfast all day, which is a plus for me because I love breakfast. Their location is just off the beat and path surrounded by town homes and apartment buildings. The environment is that of a peaceful cafe. Although it was a little busy, it was still quiet and I was able to enjoy my meal in peace. The 3rd's food was superb. You would expect to pay more, but I'm glad we didn't. I had the veggie skillet. I was impressed with the potatoes. In addition, they feature beer, wine and cocktails at a reasonable price.
