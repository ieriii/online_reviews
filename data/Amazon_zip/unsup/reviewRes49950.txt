I had the Hell Burger, thinking I was man enough to challenge this ungodly mouth burner. Needless to say, I finished it and wielded a giant snot bubble that I didn't notice until my friends laughed hysterically at me. Well, this was the price I had to pay for an unchecked ego! However, i've been here several times and I really enjoy the atmosphere. The food is great, from the sliders to the fish n chips and various drinks, its a neighborhood bar and grill thats easy to access, is dog friendly and is located in a very nice area. I exclusively sit in the outdoor patio area and enjoy my experience every time I hang out here. The servers are courteous, and prompt. I've never had a problem. Just remind me never to touch the Hell burger again. Cheesus Rice.
