GREAT service. Especially compared to many of the other northside bars, this place is head and shoulders above the rest when it comes to service. Water was filled, server was attentive, etc. Wings are huuuuuuuuuuuge. When I saw the wings were $10 for 8, I thought that was an outrageous price. However, when they arrived, I realized why they were so expensive. Gigantic. Definitely worth the price. That said, they weren't the most flavorful I've had but still good. Cool decor, great outdoor sidewalk seating with two big TVs outside, and huge wings. Drink prices are on par for similar bars in the area. They need more bathrooms though. Now for the only part of the review that matters....will I be back or not? Yes, for sure.
