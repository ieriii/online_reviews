We tried two dishes: Lobster ravioli and a jumbo shrimp garlic pasta. The pasta was fresh and the garlic sauce was delicious. The lobster ravioli was not so tasty, the filling was good but the ravioli itself was too dense and the it came with a very very tangy, thick tomato cream sauce that did not taste good at all, we were very disappointed. Portion sizes vary, some dishes (like the jumbo shrimp pasta) are just huge and could be shared. The other dish had only 6 ravioli...which is nothing, but they were so dense and unappetizing that I was glad there weren't any more. The only good thing about the bread was that it was warm and crusty, the inside was quite dense. I really liked our server so we tipped a lot, otherwise I would have felt like I overpaid for the meal. I expected much better from this restaurant based on yelp reviews.
