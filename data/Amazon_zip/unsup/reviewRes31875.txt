We wondered if the restaurant would be over-busy with having just been featured on some local dining show, but we found the place to be warm and the servers genuinely glad to have us visiting their restaurant, even with it full. The food itself is good quality all across the board, or should I say across the injera. We enjoyed a great variety of flavors that others have described well in other posts, so I won't bore with rehashing. This is one of several high quality Ethiopian restaurants in the area, but what set Demera apart is their good sense of service...not that other places are bad, but Demera's service stands out. They are friendly and happy to provide recommendations and explanations with as much description and patience needed.
