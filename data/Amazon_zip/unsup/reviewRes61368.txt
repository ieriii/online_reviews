Brazzaz is a food lover's heaven. Everything about this place is amazing the decor, the service, and especially the food. All the meats were delicious and the salad bar alone could provide a five-star meal. Matter of fact my mouth is watering just think of the experience. Although (per my waiter) Fogo del Chao and Brazzaz are owned by the same people, Brazzaz is 10 times better. I dear to say this is the best Brazilian Steakhouse in Chicago.
