Been here 3 times and i was dying to give them 5 stars but our last visit was not as great as the first two. I understand people and restaurants have off nights. I work in the industry and am very forgiving in these matters, but I have noticed some trends at 90 miles. My gf always, ALWAYS asks for extra hot sauce or chimichuri or whatever spicy sauce is to be had at wherever we are eating. Every time we have been to 90 miles she has asked for extra hot sauce and never has it been brought to us upon our first request. No big deal, she's needy sometimes and I love her for it. The last visit our server was friendly and knowledgeable. Two traits that go a long way with me as a diner. But, he was overextended in his section and told us so. Perhaps a server called in, someone got fired, who knows? So, we didnt have silverware when our appetizers came, had to wait several minutes before someone on the staff could help us. Our server gave us our pitcher of Mojito mix without a spoon. How the hell do we dig out the ice cubes? A fork? Our grubby alcoholic fingers?? The hot sauce thing again. Asked for extra limes, took forever to get them. Basically we got poor service from a cool dude in a place we love to go to. I dont know if the service concerns at 90 miles are indicative of deeper issues at the restaurant, but I hope they get resolved. When this place is ON, it is one of my favorite all time Chicago spots.
