Great for business travel. You're right downtown, an easy walk to the towers, and really not that far of a walk or short cab ride to a ton of evening dining or bar & grilles. If you're lucky enough to get a river side room (50% chance), you can't beat the view, and as the hotel is the upper floors of an office building, you're never lower than 15. Inside amenities are normal for a Holiday Inn in a business end of town. On the main floor is an over-priced bar but with a nice view, and a relatively attractive looking but otherwise mediocre restaurant (at least for breakfast as I didn't use it any other time). Floor 16 hosts an indoor pool (a little small for those really into lap swimming, but otherwise just fine) and a fitness room with a good amount of cardio, some free weights, and a few awkwardly placed cable/smith setups. You can get in a good enough exercise to do the job.  If you want more, the internal stairs are all open for use between floors 15 and 23, so you can make use of those as well. Rooms are average for a HI; OK quality mattress, smattering of lower-end wood furniture, in-room WiFi (free), mini-coffee setup, ironing board, room service, etc.  I was happy to see that the bathrooms were updated at some point. Only thing I didn't like was the air conditioning unit from 1974 that was the size of a piece of furniture and as loud as an idling car when on (which it had to be a lot for this week of 90+ weather), but a few ear plugs to make it through the night and you're good as the rest of the hotel was nice and quiet. For the price and location, this is a great business stay.
