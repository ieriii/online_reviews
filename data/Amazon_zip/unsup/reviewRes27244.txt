I am a bit baffled by the previous reviews I read...after eating dinner at GE last weekend, I feel the previous reviews are almost dishonest. I almost decided to book a reservation for my birthday somewhere else, but I am glad I went with my gut instinct and chose GE in the end.  First off, if you don't know anything about Graham Elliot Bowles before you go to GE, you're really doing your self a disservice. Graham is not only one of Chicago's top chefs, but he is probably our most eccentric. I felt the restaurant reflected everything I knew about him. The atmosphere is relaxed as is the wait staff. Our waitress was phenomenal. She had a flawless knowledge of the menu and wine-list. She took great care of us and kept us entertained.  The food was everything I expected. Full of different flavors that all went together exquisitely. We went with the 5 course tasting menu and did not regret the decision at all. The flavors were always multi-dimensional and perfectly apportioned. I would warn you that you should be ready for your palette to be tested a little bit...unless you are used to eating things like root beer bbq sauce, or garlic marshmallows. That being said, if you're not looking for something different, there are plenty of other restaurants in Chicago for you.  I can't wait to go back, I'm excited for what Graham will throw at us next time!
