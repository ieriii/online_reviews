I have never had better Mexican food, ever. We were in Chicago for the day so my husband called about a reservation for lunch. They were booked solid but invited us to come by anyway as they would do their best to fit us in. We walked in and were immediately greeted by a hostess who could seat us right away. Our waiter stopped by quickly and he was really helpful. He would explain anything on the menu we were interested in, but mostly I was interested in a margarita. So we both ordered one and really enjoyed to fresh taste. We ordered a bowl of Sopa Azteca (tortilla soup) to split. It was delicious, flavorful with a nice spice. For lunch, I ordered Cazuela de Pollo and it came in a dish filled with fresh vegetables and large chunks of chicken. My husband ordered Pescado del Dia, which is the catch of the day. That turned out to be mahi-mahi in a tomatillo sauce with garlic mashed potatoes and organic green beans. Both entrees were incredible. The flavors in the sauces were well balanced with the great flavors of Mexico. They dishes were served with fresh corn tortillas that were better than ever. And the quality was apparent with each bite. We skipped dessert, since the lunches were so good that we finished all of it. Mexican food will never be the same after this.
