My wife and I went back to Ruth's Chris for dinner on Saturday Valentine's Day. We arrived a few minutes late, and were whisked to our table immediately. Service was extremely attentive throughout the evening. Our dinner was great, we had the prix fixe and added some crab legs to the dinner for an extra punch of luxury. We had a few glasses of wine as well. The steaks were done to perfection, and the sides and lobster bisque we started with did not disappoint. Perhaps the only place for improvement was the music, which seemed a little loud at times, and didn't quite match the mood. Otherwise, everything throughout the evening was great.
