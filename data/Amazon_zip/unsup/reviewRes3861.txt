Not knowing what to expect when a friend suggested that we hit up Crisp I ordered the Seoul Sensation and loved it!. The Seoul Sensation is a "korean burrito" filled with rice, onions, tomatoes, chives and Korean beef, (Bulgogi), wrapped in a flour tortilla. You can choose white or brown rice. The burrito doesn't look huge when you get it (and I was pretty hungry) but it was the perfect amount of food, I was stuffed when finished, but in a good way, not in that greasy gross, regret filled way. I would totally recommend this place and I look forward to going back!
