what can i say that hasnt been said about the pasta bowl? for one its cheap as can be for such good food. the place is pretty cool. i like how its all cozy and what not. used to frequent this joint when i was in lincoln park more often but not as much anymore. maybe ill head back. great booze selection. ive had a lot of stuff on their menu and was never disappointed. the service is hit or miss, but for the most part just average. eat some pasta and take a walk around the neighborhood to let the food settle. lots of little shops and what not see on a sunny afternoon.
