I love this restaurant -- when the Indian in-laws come to town, if we're not heading to Devon, we're heading here. All of the food is very rich and well-spiced, and the desserts (if you like the Indian super-sweets, as I do) are amazing. (Kheer and gulab jamun are my drugs.) There's an impressive bar and good service, too.
