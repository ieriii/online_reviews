the parade of hicks standing outside waiting to get in this place should be your first clue ... nobody with any sort of discerning taste would be caught dead in this joint! the food is neither bad nor good - not memorable in any way the service is about the worst in town - they just don't care but it's the combination of hillbillies, hicks, rednecks, rubes and dimwits that frequent this place that should make you cross it off your list (unless you're one of them! in which case: your people are waiting for you at the corner of Superior and Rush!!)
