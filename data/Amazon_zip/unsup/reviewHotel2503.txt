One of the best hotels in the city by far. After attending fundraisers, conferences and overnight visits at this hotel, I have come to appreciate it more and more. The staff (no matter if they are waiting on you or you are working with them for an event) are excellent. Very comfortable rooms too. Also...little hint...the majority of the time you can get excellent deals on this hotel on hotwire!
