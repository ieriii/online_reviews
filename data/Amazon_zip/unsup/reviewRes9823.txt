Granted my review and rating is completely biased to the outdoor seating. The atmosphere gets a 5, while the food and service average out to a 3.  First the outdoor seating; it's completely beautiful and provides the experience as you are eating in a garden in Italy. We had dinner on a cool 70 degree Chicago night. It was gorgeous. The food then hit. We began with the peach salad which is subpar at most. The highlight is the goat cheese that they used. The peaches didn't taste special. It should be the highlight of the dish, but nothing memorable. We then shared two appetizer portions of the black truffle ravioli and black spaghetti. The black truffle was not great. Just because a restaurant uses truffles doesn't elevate the dish, you still have to execute the recipe. However, the black spaghetti was amazing! The sauce and seafood was so amazing! We then split the grilled steak with arugula and grape Tomatoes. This was ok, not amazing and worth $29. We then finished off with the hazelnut chocolate cake which was fantastic! It was a great way to end a decent meal. I wouldn't go back immediately, only if the gf and I are craving black spaghetti and hazelnut chocolate cake.
