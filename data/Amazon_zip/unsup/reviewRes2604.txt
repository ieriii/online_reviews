O why, pray tell, has no one sung praises of Hot Doug's on Yelp? I've heard so much harping and chirping from my friends that I thought there would be a string of reviews, like the lines that go out the door at Hot Doug's. My visit to the "sausage superstore and encased meat emporium" was all I expected and more. They have everything from the quintessential Chicago dog to brats, kielbasas, veggie dogs, and--the showstopper--the game of the week which features sausages made from game (y'know...boar, pheasant, venison, etc.) meat. I've heard that Hot Doug himself has had culinary school training, hence a little bit of haute cuisine mingles with a whole lotta encased meats made with love and Chicago pride.  When I was there, the game of the week was pheasant with cognac, and it was so delicious that every bite was heaven, but also hell because I knew it would put me that much closer to the end of the sausage. There are various ways you can gussy up your dog including four kinds of mustard, caramelized onions, relish, celery salt, etc. On Fridays and Satudays, Hot Doug's serves fresh cut fries made in duck fat, in addition to regular fresh cut fries. I implore you to spend the extra $2.25 to try the duck fries because, while the regular fries are good, the duck fat imparts a subtle richness that goes so well with the slightly sweet starchiness of the potatoes. The joint opens at 10:30am and closes at 4pm; around noon, the line starts going out the door. You can check the menu and find out what this week's game sausage is at http://www.hotdougs.com
