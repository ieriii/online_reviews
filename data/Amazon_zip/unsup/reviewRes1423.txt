Yes, I have fallen prey to the wonder that is Travel Channel. This place is a plethora of meat in intestinal casings! I love duck and I love foie gras so thankfully they had a creation to fulfill my needs.  One subway ride + one bus ride later, I arrive to a line about the length and duration of space mountain at Disneyland. I can't wait to see what awaits me inside. After mingling with some of the locals, they told me the duck fat fries is a must try. I take note of the advice and order my duck sausage + foie gras and a side of duck fat fries.  I take a seat at the counter facing outside the establishment and wait for my order to come. I waste no time shoveling food into my foodhole, I was waiting in line for 2 hours and time is of the essense. I took a bite of the duck sausage with a good helping of foie gras, my mouth was overwhelmed with fatty flavor... mmmm.... within 3 bites my hot dog was gone.. aw. The size was a little small for a 8 dollar dog. The duck fat fries were ok. The first couple of bites was wow, but the novelty soon wore off.  I recommend this place if you're nearby and check out kuma's korner if you're on a foodie run, it's just down the street.
