Uneven service. It took 15 minutes for our order to even be taken. When I asked the waitress a few questions about the menu, she acted like she didn't have time to explain anything to me. She was rude. The place wasn't even full. I won't be returning to this place. The food was not worth the service issues. I had the pulled pork sandwich....there was no sauce. So needleas to say it was really dry. The cabbage slaw was eeally good and the beets were okay. My husband had the biscuits with duck. He saud it okay, but nothing special. The sweet potato chips he ordered on the side were almost good-if only they had bothered to salt them.  Bad service, over-priced, mediocre food.
