Amazing BBQ has landed downtown! I love BBQ and I always find myself driving out in the city just to find a good Pulled Pork or Beef Brisket sandwich. Chicago Q has filled a void in the culinary makeup of downtown Chicago. The decor of what used to be Tsunami (overpriced sushi) has been transformed into a space that somehow takes me out of the city and into a chic southern BBQ restaurant. Oh the Kobe brisket is wonderful, ribs just as amazing. And the entry on the menu suggesting there is better BBQ ribs for competitions? Maybe next time I'll have to decide to have BBQ 24hrs in advance... Another great experience at Chicago Q, and it will be gaining a 5 star review from me.
