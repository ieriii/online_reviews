Fantastic location -- great food too. I admit I'm not much of a fish-freak but I almost always get a cup of chowder with any entree. The spinach salad tends to take care of the rest of my tummy on my behalf.One of my favourite haunts -- and when it's summer and the patio is open -- ah! I could live at Glenn's :)
