I'll admit it, I really liked this asian-fusion restaurant. I had low-ish expectations, cuz in my mind, Billy Dec= rockit and jen scheft, i.e. All American, Baseball cap wearing...you know what I mean? I just couldn't reconcile Billy Dec with trendy asian AND good.  welpers yelpers, I was pleasantly surprised! first thing walking in, this place is beautiful. I love how it's decorated. It's kinda crazy... with 3 different seating options... the sushi bar, the communal tables (cafeteria style seating), and individual tables. I'm not quite sure the reasoning behind that but more power to ya. We sat in the individual seats. The waitress convinced us to order the watermelon/unagi 'bacon' salad. She was going on and on about how interesting the flavors were together but honestly, it tasted like watermelon and unagi. There wasn't anything too special, but the combo together was good. We also ordered the crispy rice with spicy tuna/jalepeno 'roll'-- this this is GOOD. The tuna is super fresh and I love it to pieces.  We also ordered a rainbow roll which was standard but good. The crab inside tasted really fresh. Annnd the last thing was the 'golden child' roll. I forgot exactly what it had inside but I believe it's some sort of tuna and a veg, on top is mango creme and kin (gold pieces), this was also super delicious! I'm usually not one for 'weird' sushi, i.e. super out there combos, but the chef at Sunda does an amazing job and I can't wait to go back. Plus, for a dinner that consisted of mainly sushi, our meal came out to less than 20 bux each and we were full.
