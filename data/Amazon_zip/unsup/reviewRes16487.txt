shhhhh, don't tell anyone about this awesome place I discovered, called.....the Violet Hour I think? You will thank me for telling you about it. Just give them my name at the door, and they'll be like "Oh yes, Miss Araya, she has blessed our floor on two separate occasions, once for her 26th birthday, even, and we were so honored. She has really helped spread the news of our existence" The door is UNMARKED, isn't that trippy? I know, I know, I'm nice to let you in on this segredo, but I just have a knack for finding prohibition-like underground bars. The rum drinks are my favorite, and they have these cool tube ice cubes that make you feel all sexy-like. Try to sit in the front, because the tall chairs make you feel a little like you're Alice in Wonderland. You might feel like you fit in more if you wear a stick-on tattoo on your chest (like a sewing machine or a pencil, something different) and have sexy hair that looks undone, yet done at the same time. Also, dressing up works well here, but try to look like you didn't think about your outfit. AKA, a vintage pencil skirt with an 80s tshirt and a headband. You're welcome for the tips. Have fun.
