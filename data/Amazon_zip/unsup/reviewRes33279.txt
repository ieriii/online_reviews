Went there last week, when I presented the http://Restaurant.com certificate, Branko (the owner) was very rude and said we would have to spend $45 instead of $35,(even though my certificate said $35 minimum). We agreed then he went on to rant about how he was trying to get out of accepting the certificates, He completely ruined my night out, I should have walked out at that point. The portion sizes are too small considering the prices. Veal paprikash was $22, this same dish can be found at other restaurants nearby for $5-6 dollars less. I think overall the prices are too high for the Irving Park neighborhood. I will never go back to this place.
