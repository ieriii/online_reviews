Let's put it this way. I had dinner here with my girlfriend ordered 2 appetizers and 2 entrees and after we had spent 126.00 I had to go to 5 guys for a cheeseburger all-out and fries. The food comes in portions fit for Keebler elves. The food does taste good. We had the deconstructed Caesar and duck satay for apps which tasted great. The portions were not as egregious as the main course.  My girlfriend had the pork while I had the lamb. The pork was definitely the heartier of the 2. The lamb was essentially equivalent to a single skewer worth of food including vegetables. Bottom line I believe a restaurant should leave you feeling satisfied. I'm not looking for a buffet, but I do expect that I will not be hungry after a dinner service. Perhaps I'm supposed to order the 165 per person tasting menu. Sorry, not willing to spend over 300 for food at this place. Will not be returning for a 2nd time. Ever.
