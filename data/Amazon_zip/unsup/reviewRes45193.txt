I was looking for the a place to have some dessert and love every bite. However when I took a look at the menu, I got hungry and decided to try something. We got the assorted starters, I only like 2 of them. HINT their goat tart is really good. I was going to go for the dessert, but the Risotto sound it good... It was by far the saltiest thing I've ever had. I don't like sending food back, so we finished it, but it was almost painful to eat it at the end. Drinks were okay, I've never seen a sazerac served on the rocks... As I said before dessert was extremely good. Server was pretty slow and just weird, very weird.
