THEY HAVE TOPLESS TUESDAYS? Unfortunately no. But they do have Tapas Tuesday, which is arguably less expensive and more satisfying than the former would be. In any case, on to the review...  This was actually my first visit to Sapori and after my meal I had two reactions: 1.) Where the hell have I been and why was I not made aware of this place sooner? 2.) Coupons? They mail coupons? I'm sure I have one sitting at home (I actually had 3 sitting at home).  I was glad to have dined here on tapas Tuesday because I got to sample VERY GENEROUS tapas-sized portions of a variety of dishes.  Hits: -Gnocchi Bolognese; Fluffy potato pillows bathed in one of the best bolognese sauces in the city -Veal Meatballs; simply perfect, I could've eaten a dozen more -Milk & Honey Ribs; tender braised ribs with intensely rich earthy flavors (actually better as a tapas portion as a full-slab would be too rich and overwhelming) -Wine list; good selection, reasonable prices -FREE Parking (They have a lot about a block away...just get a pass from the host) Misses: -Mushroom Rissoto; chock full of mushrooms...and grit unfortunately. -Sausage and Polenta; polenta was good, but the sausage was nothing special When all was said and done, I left Sapori with a full stomach, lunch for the next day, and a big smile on my face. I'll definitely be back (with my coupon of course)!
