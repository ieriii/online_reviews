Slightly better then ok (so maybe 3.5 stars). Everyone raves about this restaurant, so I must have expected something way above the norm. I visited this restaurant on a Saturday night for a girls night out. The restaurant was of course packed and there is very little room between the tables, but the service was great and the food was served quickly. Our waiter even recommended a different glass of wine when I chose one that he thought was sub par. I had mushroom ravioli for dinner, which was good, but not excellent.   I have heard that the restaurant change their menu often, so I will have to give this restaurant a second chance in the future.
