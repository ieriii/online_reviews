I had been a vegitarian for four years and a vegan for two of those years when I fist ate at Chicago diner. I reeeeeaaaally wanted to like it but it pretty much tasted like the inside of a fryer. Thier secret recipe is basically stiking anything in the deep fryer and adding salt. Vegitarian or not, the food is terrible. I went back several times because I wanted to find something redeeming....but everytime, no matter what the dish it was the same thing. The only thing that was worth getting was the vegan milk shakes....but most of you can just skip the vegan and go to your local greasy spoon to get the real deal.
