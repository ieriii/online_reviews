Really enjoyed this place, I was a bit skeptical walking in based upon some of the crepe concoctions I read about. As mentioned below, the water with cucumbers in it was refreshing. I also chose the vegetable puree soup that comes with the savory crepes, which was amazing. The Turkish Cafe had a hint of spice and just the right potency to keep me adequately wired throughout the meal. Finally, the crepe I had (I believe it was called the Roma) was exceptional, everything was fresh and the fruit served with it was amazingly good as well. Our server was gracious, and I think my friend now has a crush. I will plan to go back.
