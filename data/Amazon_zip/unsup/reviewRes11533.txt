Went to Piece last night, after hearing rave reviews from nearly anyone and everyone I've ever been in contact with. "Oh, you live in Wicker Park? Have you ever been to Piece!? I loooooove Piece." The pizza was fine, but I'd say walk a few more blocks south to Crust and get a lot more variety and quality. It was suuuuper loud, which is to be expected of a over-priced pizza joint, no? I was not pleased with the copious amounts of screaming children surrounding me--I moved out of Lincoln Park for a reason... All in all, the pizza was descent, but nothing I'd write home about. Our service was good--easy and relaxed--just the way i like it.
