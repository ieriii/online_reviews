Their noodle dishes are pleasingly free of that red grease you find at some other thai places, and their curries are the best I've found in Chicago so far. The green curry with eggplant is super good, and the red curry with catfish is shoot yourself in the head, all other Thai curries ruined forever good. An overstatement? Maybe. But why, oh why, do they have to nickel and dime you on the rice? Eight big ones is already on the high side for a simple bowl of red curry, and then they charge you an extra dollar for, let's be honest, about 4 cents worth of white rice. Scummy tactic. Costs them a star. I'd rather they just price them at $9.
