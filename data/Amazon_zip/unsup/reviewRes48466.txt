Publican is a terrific, unique, and rather pricey evening out. I just can't bring myself to call it 5 stars. Some of the food adventures are inconsistent (like an apricot and ricotta side plate -- interesting concept, not executed well). The tables are too small. And it can be hard to get in. However, I was recently here on a Monday night and found Publican half full. The beer and cheese selections are all top notch. I will defer to others on the pork, since I don't eat it. I've spent between $25 and $75 a head here depending mostly on how much we were drinking. Publican is well worth a visit. Or four. UPDATE: Just had brunch at Publican for the first time. Brunch exhibits the same strong points and oddities as other meals I've had here. While all the food was very good, I couldn't understand why my quiche was a snack, at best, while the dishes ordered by my dining companions were all the right size for a meal. Pay attention to what you're ordering, ask questions, and make sure you are getting what you want.
