It's been a while since I've visited Sultan's Market, but after a bunch of years I was hungry from some quick and delicious Middle Eastern food. We went there about an hour before closing and had a good selection of fresh foods still on the grill. The salad bar is reasonable and full of tasty treats. I love their selection of beverages. I had a Limonata that is about 10 shades too tart. (But I like that sorta thing.) Also looks like they're going to be selling coffees and espresso. Was that a Sushi/Sashimi fridge I saw in the front too? Strongly recommend it -- excellent if you're in a hurry.
