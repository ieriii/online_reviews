this is my favorite deep dish pizza place in Chicago! i've been to Chicago a few times and have tried all the famous places (Lou Malnati's, Gino's East, Pizzeria Uno) but I have to say Giordanos is the best! yes you can expect to wait about 45 minutes but if you pre-order the pizza, by the time you're seated the pizza will be served in a timely manner. the bf and i ordered the 'special' that came with sausage, mushroom, onions and peppers - so good! we ordered the small pizza but we still left with half the pizza for leftovers haha. i love their doughy crust and i think that's what makes giordanos stand out above the other deep dish pizza places. pricing is pretty reasonable too. our small pizza cost us $19 but it lasts for at least a few meals haha. this location is pretty convenient to the Magnificent Mile shops so if you're a tourist in the area, this is a must eat!
