Incredible food. Great for a small group. We went before a concert at Soldier Field, perfectly located for that. Our server was GREAT, very attentive and knowledgable about the menu. He seemed to have tried everything and had some excellent suggestions. We tried a little bit of everything on the menu and everythign was excellent. We especially liked the simple grilled items, we tried grilled baby octopus. The traditional tapas items you find at other restaurants, were done here in a modern playful, and extremely tasty manner, especially the potatas bravas. Be warned, it is pricier then your standard Chicago tapas restaurant for dinner. But the food is worth every penny and the portions are enough to fill you up if your order the amount recommended by the server. The sangrias are different and very good as well.  The atmosphere is very "clubby", but has different areas to choose from. We were at a table "upstairs" that was a bit weird to get to, but then gave us more privacy and quiet. They also have outdoor seating if you desire.
