I usually don't give out the 5 star rating but I was extremely pleased with this place. It's inexpensive, delicious, good beer/cheap beer, and the atmosphere was nice. When I first walked in I saw the cafeteria styled seating area and I was a little thrown off and wondered if I had to order at the windows and bring the food to my table. But a lady stepped up and seated us and said our waiter will be with you soon. That settled my little I-hope-this-isn't-what-I-think-it-is-moment. The menu is extensive, as most Chinese food menus are. Sometimes I just want to say "to hell with it" and order everything....but then I'll be broke :[... lol. Anyway, we ordered the roasted duck, shrimp dumplings with noodles, eggplants stuffed with shrimp, and some kind of noodle dish with shrimp and pork. (I feel like I'm always writing "some kind of noodle dish" when I yelp about a Chinese restaurant, lol, I can never remember the name....anyway) 1.)The roasted duck was a bit salty but still had a nice flavor and texture to it. 2.)The shrimp dumplings with noodles were pretty good, the dumplings were nice and fat and the noodles were nicely cooked. 3.) The eggplant was really good, I thought it would be sweet but the sauce on it was more of a gravy that added to it, really good. 4.)The random noodle dish was delicious, nice flavor. Also they have Chicago beer 312 and man, it went well with the food. hahaha. I left sated but not weighed down by it. Which was great. I definitely recommend this place and would go again in a heartbeat.
