Overall, great experience. We were a bit worried prior to the dinner due to mixed reviews received by the place. However, everything we had that night was good to very good. The foie lollipops were tasty and fun. The white tuna sashimi with avocado, passionfruit, etc was great. The halibut was awesome.. the smokiness of the eggplant puree was great. The kung pao sweetbreads were tasty, although we thought the sauce overpowered the sweetbreads a bit. Also lamb with refried chickpeas were nice, but not as "wow" as the halibut. Desserts (choco cake and the darjeeling panna cotta) were delish. Nice balance of flavors and not too heavy. Great cocktails too!
