We had a groupon and decided to give the lunch buffet a chance. The service was good. Water refreshed as needed. When we went to buffet upon return was not only naan but tandoori chicken sizzling away. It was very tasty. The chicken tiki masala was fine but we thought the vegetarian dishes like the chickpeas and lentils were the standouts. Samosa was fine but not outstanding--but it's on a buffet, you got to lower standards a bit :) I had chai which I thought was a tad weak. Overall, a good choice in the area.
