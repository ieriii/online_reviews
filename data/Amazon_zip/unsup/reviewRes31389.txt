Tried Nana based on a friends recommendation and their appearance on diners drive-ins and dives. The place looks great, it didn't take long for us to be seated, and the service was friendly and patient. All that got them two stars. Now to the missing three that are being passed out by others. The food was just ok to me, and the two others with me. The pork sausage was gross (i'm talking really nasty) and I think they should STOP putting arugula on everything! Oh, and there was a hair in my guacamole (they didn't charge me for it but didn't comp me a new meal (I'm cool with that, just saying)). In the end we paid $87 for three adults and a toddler (his was $5). We were in shocked only because we didn't feel like it was worth that but paid. We would have tipped our waitress better (wish I remembered her name) because she was such a sweety but we hadn't planned on spending that much on breakfast. Sorry lady. SMH!
