Sapori really is fantastic. There are lots of Italian places in Chicago, but for an intimate evening, this is one of the best I've found.  I knew little about it, having stumbled onto it via Living Social. Getting a reservation (even on a Monday night) was a good idea. It wasn't packed, but certainly filled. The service was friendly, attentive and professional from hostess to the waiters to the bus staff. We never felt rushed and the pace of the meal and service was great. The menu is diverse, with lots to try. The caesar salad was fresh and crisp, if not a little heavy on the fresh squeezed lemon. Mussels in white wine were spot on. The lobster ravioli was creamy and dually rich and light. I got the Zuppa de Pesce, one of their house specials, which has enough seafood for two or three people with linguini in a lightly spicy sauce. The tiramisu might be the best I've ever had, and I do not say that lightly. All of that, and the bartender makes a good Negroni? I'll definitely be back. It's not cheap, but absolutely reasonable. Do for yourself. Do it for date night. While not necessarily a feature of the restaurant itself, there were some fascinating conversations to eavesdrop on that evening. Can't beat entertainment and a meal.
