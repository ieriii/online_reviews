I hate writing this review because the more people that write about how good it is the harder it will be to get a table. I have been frequenting Wak for several years and the place is consistently one of the best in the city (especially considering the price point). The head sushi chef Alfredo is a super cool dude and the fish is always fresh. Higly recommend!
