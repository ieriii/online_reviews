Five stars of YUM! One of my San Francisco foodie friends came to visit, and I decided it was the perfect opportunity to finally give Publican a try. We were so stuffed it was hard to get up at the end of the meal, but here's what we ordered: - Oysters: solid, fresh, delicious - Hamachi crude: great combination of flavors, perfectly light and delicate, and gone in a heartbeat - Fig and burrata salad: I have a personal weakness for figs. I mean a real weakness. And burrata? And peaches? Talk about a home run. So delicious - Market salad: A really different take on a salad, full of quinoa and green beans, but again, a perfect combination of flavors and rich in both flavor and texture - Half chicken with summer sausage and fries: So good, and the chicken was even better the next day. The fries were perfectly crisp, and I have a sneaking suspicion they may have been cooked in duck fat. The sausage was also juicy and perfect - Can't remember the name, but an amazing pork entree. Juicy, delicious, falling off the non-existent bone. I could barely fit anything more in my stomach at this point, but it was just so good. Literally everything we ordered was outstanding, and I might just have to have my birthday party here if I can find enough foodie friends.
