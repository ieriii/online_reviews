For the price you pay, the environment and quality of the food, I guess it was worth it. I was with a large group, so they had us sitting on wooden bar stools, which is fine at a bar or for a drink before a meal, but with a large group and dinner lasting close to 2 hours it wasn't comfortable at all. This place is really nice to go to with friends, but if you are looking for somewhere on the romantic side it was very loud here so I'd go elsewhere. But other than that I think I will be back.
