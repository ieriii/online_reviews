The atmosphere is intolerable, and an in-your-face reminder of how unlike Chicago this place is. The food is terribly salty, the seating is pretty crammed, and it doesn't have a mediterranean feel in its menu options or otherwise. I did like the mushroom soup, and their flat breads are good. My fiance thoroughly enjoyed the squid in its own ink on pasta. They also make great drinks. Do these make up for how over-stimulated I was by something that should've been relaxing and enjoyable? No, and I hope we can go back to this restaurant as few times as possible.
