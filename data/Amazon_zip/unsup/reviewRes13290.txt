Wow. This is not a normal diner. I will definitely be back for the fish. There are lots of gimmicks here that make it entertaining for a foodie: the specials on blackboards, the large menu, the interesting beer selection, the cereal on the wall. The potato and asparagus standard side with every fish is average. But the fish selections are not. I tried 5 different fish items within our group and everyone had an oustandingly fresh and interestingly companioned and covered fish item. My trout was not correctly deboned, but the butter pecan glaze was great without being too sweet. The bathrooms are weirdly ambiguous which is which - a waitress then told me they were unisex. I wish they'd just been labeled as such. The waiter doesn't communicate where at the table the meals go to the server -- this area of service could be improved. At the end, it irritated us that they wouldn't do specific amounts on cards for a large group. There were 3 yelp elites at our table and this left us grumbling about customer service. I want to know if I could order cereal and a beer here. Not many places you can do that. I'll try it sometime.
