We ate at Yolk this morning and I am so glad we did. I was surprised how packed it was but we were seated right away. The decor was very modern. I ordered the bacon egg and cheese quesadilla. The coffee was good and the waitress made sure our cups were never empty. The only thing I would have liked more is if the milk came in a little serving cup instead of packets. My breakfast also came with diced potatoes which were very thick and tasty. The prices are just a tad higher than I would have liked to pay but the food, service, and cleanliness more than made up for that. I left stuffed. We even got to see Brian Urlacher eating breakfast before todays game.
