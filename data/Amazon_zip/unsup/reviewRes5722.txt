We went on Thursday night at 7:30 and there was an hour and a half wait. We asked if we could go somewhere for a drink while we waited b/c there was no room to stand or move while we waited. The hostess told us that the only way we could is if we went to Eno. We waited at Eno for over an hour with no call so we called PP and they said they were just getting our table ready. We went back and were seated at the very end of a large table where there was not enough room the legs of the tables were in the way and we were squished. The hostess said sorry there is nothing she could do and to wait until the large group of loud ladies next to us left and then move over. We were thoroughly disappointed by the hostess she seemed rude and snobby. There were some fantastic dishes we had and some not as good like the Wagu Beef was not cooked correctly (we ordered MR and got really rare), the squash was delicious, they were out of the eggs which we were looking forward to.  I would give this place one more chance as people seem to like it and have had better experience than us but the service really, really brought my impression down.
