I'm not vegan, but I could be if I had unlimited access to this menu! I was in town with a veg friend and decided to give this a try based on reviews. It was fabulous. We got nachos for the table, and I got the veg chicken fried steak and my friend got the veg BBQ chicken wrap and a pumpkin shake. Soooooo, good. Tasted as good as the real deal (if not better) with a fun hipster-meets-diner vibe.
