"Who knew pork could be so precious???" This was a quote from my lukewarm first review of Publican. It's been two years since I dined here. There was nothing 'precious' about the meal last night. In fact, last night was downright X-Rated version of Porky's Revenge. It was a gluttonous glorious display of pork in all its fatty delicious goodness. Thanks to my wonderful dining companion Floyd E., the gf and I chowed down like King & Queen in one of the cool booths. We started with Charcuterie Plate: Ham Pie - Yummy Roulade with Pork Pate - Rich & Creamy Head Cheese - More Please Sausage - Me likes Salami - Yes Sir Paired with Saison Beer - Terrific & Perfect Complement http://bit.ly/PublicanCh Potee: Roast Pork Loin - Tender Lovin' with delicate flavor of shallots Sausage - Jimmy Dean wishes he could make this Pork Confit - Yep Veggies - Leeks and Brussels Sprouts bathed in pork fat Boudin (a.k.a. Blood Sausage) May have been one of the best interpretations I've ever had. The texture can be off-putting; not this version. Sweetbreads Crispy. Creamy center. Brightened with Tzatziki which really cut through the richness. Pork Rinds Signature snack was crunchy and yummy Porchetta At this point , I was so far beyond full. Yet, I enjoyed the crispy fatty skin and the nectarines that topped this thunderous portion of pork. Fries with Aoili Floyd proclaimed that these were 'the best fries'. He is right. Publican is right. I was wrong. Publican gave this Chinese pork loving chef a terrific experience.
