God this place is amazing. Their Peking Duck dinner is by far the best duck I've ever had. And I've eaten duck at the restaurant in central Beijing that China took the olympic committee to when bidding for the games... that was some good duck. This is better. Basically, you call ahead and order the duck meal. And let me say it is a HUGE meal, it alone will feed 4 or 5 people. They carve the duck right in front of you, and you make little bao/sandwiches with buns, sauce, and some veggies they give you. It is like biting into a little piece of Heaven. The first time I tasted the combination I was floored, it is SO GOOD. Then, while you are enjoying the amazingness of the duck sandwiches, they use the rest of the duck to make duck soup and duck fried rice, also both amazing. And all for 30 bucks....... are they serious? Such a great deal. They also have other great dishes too that are good as appetizers while you wait for your duck. I don't think it's on the menu, but ask for the pork stuffed tofu... it is awesome. I also loved the service. The waitress I had the first time was really helpful and sarcastic/funny. Loved her! I think it is definitely a family run operation, as the waitress I had the second time definitely looked like her sister... anyway, THIS PLACE RULES!!
