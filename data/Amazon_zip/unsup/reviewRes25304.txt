I made the trek (as a tourist) from dtown Chicago...jumped on red line & walked for 15-20mins. IT WAS WORTH IT! Although the fried zucchini were just par for the course, they keep me occupied while I wait the prerequisite 30 mins for good deep dish. I ordered the pepp & sausage pan w caramelized crust and it did not disappoint. Staff was friendly and the Official Blackhawks bar took me back to the Roenick & Chelios days. Now if have to carry my leftovers back :)
