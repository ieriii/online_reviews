I'm torn on this place. I have come here about once a week for the last year so obviously I am a fan of the food. The menu is pretty good, what you order is usually great, and the prices are certainly fair. The real issue and reason for giving it 3 stars is the service which is sometimes comically bad. The issue is beyond having to flag down a waitress, I have on occasion ordered coffee more than three times before getting it. If your entree comes with soup, there is a 30% chance that it is going to be forgotten entirely. Having been a regular for a while now, I have noticed that most waitresses don't stick around for more than a few months-which I think is probably pretty average for the industry, but it seems like they don't really get any training at all before being sent out on the very crowded and slow moving floor. If you are in the mood for a crepe I would say give it a shot for dinner or on a week day. They are also BYOB which is a plus.
