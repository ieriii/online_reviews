I'm a meat eater but Chicago Diner's food doesn't make me feel like I'm missing out on anything. So far I've had the Titanic BLT (it had a surprisingly meaty texture),the Dagwood (reminded me of a philly cheesesteak, the chili (an incredibly hearty dish) and the potato skins (which had a delicious creamy filling, probably my favorite thing to order there). The servings here are generous and the waitstaff is attentive. I like that this restaurant isn't in-your-face vegan, it's actually incredibly welcoming so I recommend this place to anyone who likes to try new things.
