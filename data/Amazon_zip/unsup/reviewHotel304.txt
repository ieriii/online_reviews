Let me start with the most important part of my experience at City Suites:  My boyfriend, who's black, was greeted by one of the front desk staff with a cold stare and a stern "What floor are you on?" a couple days into our stay. When he told the attendant our room number, she mumbled something about a guest's missing property. We still can't figure out what she meant, but I think you get the point. In 2009, in Chicago, we had hoped for better. Here's the other critical part of our experience: Anyone who says you can ignore sounds from "El" trains next to the hotel is lying. The noise in rooms is brutal. You hear everything -- trains pulling in and out, conductors' voices, door-closing chimes. We also woke up to construction outside our window from 7am both weekdays of our stay. Rooms don't seem to be soundproofed, so sounds almost seemed amplified. Some less important points, but equally unpleasant: Housekeeping was lazy, leaving towels strewn on sofas and cabinet doors. I've never stayed in a hotel where the cleaners didn't return towels to the bathroom, or just replace them. FInally, the property's in poor shape. While the lobby's clean, the facilities in general feel more "hostel" than "hotel". Bottom line: I'm staying at the Days Inn next time I'm in Chicago. Better value, better location, better hotel.
