We had an AWESOME stay here. And I must say that the $35 late check out fee is the best $35 dollars I've ever spent. We had to check out by 3 and conveniently we needed to leave by 3:15 so it worked out great. As others have mentioned, the lobby is awe-inspiring. This is a lovely, lovely hotel aesthetically. The room was large, clean and comfortable and the soap/shampoo/lotion etc. all smelled divine. There is a Starbucks in the lobby which for me is a big plus. I NEED to start my days with a shaken green tea/lemonade. This property is close to a lot of Chicago's most awesome attractions. We did the architecture tour which was just a short cab ride away, went to the Hancock Building, did some shopping on the Miracle Mile, hung out at some cool places in the Viagra Triangle, walked to Millennium and Grant Park. Right outside is a train line. And across the street is a Walgreen's, next door is a pub, plenty of restaurants around (including two in the hotel itself) and a 7-11 just on the corner. We will definitely be staying at the Palmer House on our trip to Chicago next year. Friendly staff, BEAUTIFUL hotel, great location. Nothing to dislike!
