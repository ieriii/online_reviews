Best place in Chinatown. Walk past Joy Yee's on your way to LSC and sneer at all those chumps overpaying for noodle soups they could have got from Whole Foods. LSC does it right-- greasy, spicy, large portions (share!), and good service. My only complaint is that the menu is poorly organized and hard to decipher (though the sad translations do make for fun reading). You can bring veg and vegan pals too! My fave is the Ma Pao Tofu. I also recommend most of the spicy chicken dishes and the beef with oyster sauce.
