Eating at Frontera Grill makes me so happy! I've eaten here twice - once at dinner with 3 other people and once at brunch - all before the Top Chef victory. Didn't have a reservation either time, so enjoyed checking the place out and having a wonderful margarita at the bar for a few minutes before being promptly seated. Started off the various meals with queso fundido and guacamole - and they were both so savory and delicious. The guac was just chunky enough...it was heaven (and I've had lots of bad guac at other restaurants). For brunch, we had tacos and chilaquiles - and I think that these chilaquiles are my new comfort food.  For dinner, I don't recall the rest of my parties dishes (although they all walked away happy) but I had and savored the chicken mole. Oh my goodness. The flavors were intense and rich. Just wanted to lick the plate when I was done! Just the thought of going back to Frontera makes me happy...these were some of the best meals that I've eaten...ever.
