Went for the first time and can't wait to go back! Pho, as others have said, is fantastic, as well as the squid dish we had (lemongrass squid, I think? The number escapes me). I had an iced coffee which was a bit steep ($4) but soooo good I would still order it again every time I come. Wait staff was just pleasant and cute as can be. The restaurant itself is a little jarring at first. Very simple mom & pop set-up which is always a little loud and crowded. We were seated at a long community table next to another group, but we had so much fun eavesdropping on them that we didn't mind. The beer we brought helped too, I'm sure. tl, dr: Go! Take a date, bring some beers, get pho & something else to share and have an amazing time.
