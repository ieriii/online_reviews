Good bar with top notch staff and a lot of people having a good time. Almost too many beer options. (If that's possible) The only downside is that the place gets too busy and if you don't have a place to sit, you're bouncing off other people. If you're going for your first time you might want to find a slow weeknight to go and sample some of the beers. That way when you go back on a busy night (Friday to Sunday) you know what to order.
