I went here over the weekend with my roommate and had a fun experience. Since they do not take reservations, we left our name and waited about an hour to get seated. Luckily, we got a nice table outside right by the light pole(sp)? The decor was super cute and the atmosphere was very chill which I liked. Our server was very attentive and informed us of all the specials and what's popular in the restaurant. We started out with wine and ordered couple things off the menu. We ordered the roasted bone marrow smears, fried manchego, and the octopus dish. I loved the octopus dish and the roasted bone marrow smears! Very delicious! Then for our dessert, we ordered sicilian iris which was amazing!! I will def. visit again since this restaurant is open late night :)
