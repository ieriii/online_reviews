I wasn't that impressed. I mean I am a lover of all encased meats, but sometimes it just seems like more is not better. The duck fat fries were good, but didn't seem like they were that spectacular. One thing that is great is Doug. He's awesome. He's friendly, he's great at giving suggestions and he's just pleasant to deal with. I am sure that I'll be back and try something else, maybe I just ordered wrong, but I think the line is keeping me away.
