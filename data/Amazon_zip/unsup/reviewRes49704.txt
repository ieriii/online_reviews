I bought a groupon for this place and that's what prompts me to try it out. Service is good. Everyone is friendly. I had the combination of skirt steak and shrimp. It is delicious!! Skirt steak is perfectly grilled with the right amount of spices and tender juicy. Shrimp is shrimp.... it's good... nothing too special about it.
