wait staff was very nice. interior was clean, cool eating area outside. Looking like it'd be a great meal! I got bacon and an omelet. How can you mess that up? Bacon was inedible. It was like someone soaked it in salt for a week, and then added more salt before serving it to me. The advertised special mushroom omelet had maybe 4 mushrooms inside, and zero flavor!! ugh...so bummed. My husband had a mexican style dish that was from the chefs specialty part of the menu, and he also commented, "no flavor."....mexican food with no flavor? for real?? Too bad.
