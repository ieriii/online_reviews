We had an 8:30 reservation on Friday and showed up prior to that, but weren't seated till 9pm. The place was packed. My wife had some kind of seafood pasta, and it was pretty good. I had the cured/air pizza; it was different and okay in my opinion. I had some of my wife's pasta and I enjoyed that more. We did try the dessert - cake and gelato (first thing on the dessert menu), and it was really good, but really small. I do give this restaurant a lot of credit b/c my wife left her purse under the table when we left the restaurant. We got all the way home before realizing that. We immediately called them and one of the waiters had picked it up and turned it in. We picked up her purse right then, and everything was still in her purse. We really appreciated that they found her purse and returned it to us. Thanks!
