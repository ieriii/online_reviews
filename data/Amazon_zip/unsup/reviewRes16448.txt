This place is amazing all around, you wouldnt even know it was there unless someone told you, no signs and no door ways- the door is behind a mural next to a National City bank in wicker park. you go in a curtained room when you enter and wait in another curtained off section for the host to seat you. The chairs are high backed and huge, yet positioned in twos or there are booths where multiple people can sit. It is all low lighting and candle lit, VERY ROMANTIC! The bars are large and stretch then length of the place, the bartenders or should I say Mixologists wear vests and bow ties, very old regal and Sinatra mentality and feel with the egg white whipped frothy drinks and the use of bitters and homemade ingredients with each drink. Each drink takes 10 minutes to order, the server was very informed and I just told her what types of drinks I like and she directed me in the right direction. I went on a wed night and it was decently busy. I would DEF go back! LOVE THIS PLACE!
