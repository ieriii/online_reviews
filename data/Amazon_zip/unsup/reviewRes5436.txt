The Purple Pig is a tapas style restaurant with heavy emphasis on pig products. A popular place with long wait even during off-hour. We ordered the coppa cured meat, roasted bone marrow, milk braised pork shoulder, pig's tail, and prosciutto bread ball. The pig's tail was truly outstanding (4 stars). The balsamic really bring it to the next level. The roasted bone marrow was nicely seasoned (3 stars).  The prosciutto bread balls didn't quite do it for me (2 stars). The pork shoulder was nice and tender (3 stars). My only complain is the restaurant layout. One of the communal tables was placed right up against the window. I literally had to climb over people to get to the other side.
