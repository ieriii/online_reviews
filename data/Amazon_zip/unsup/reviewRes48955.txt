Went here last night and as everyone has been saying it was Pork galore! There was a halibut on the menu which looked good--regretting not trying it! Anyways we ordered (in order of favorites) three hams, pork rinds, rilette, pickles, potee, and sweetbreads( my least fave of the night and I do like sweetbreads, just not from here). If there are only two of you going, I would ask for a two top table when you make reservations--it makes the experience that much better!
