Everybody knows Revolution Brewing brews great beer and has great food to match, but can they throw a party? We found out for ourselves when we had our rehearsal dinner there. They were awesome. Everything they promised, they delivered on. My brother-in-law played his guitar and sang a song for us, and all the necessary audio equipment for that was there. The bartenders were great. The food was plentiful and just as tasty as it is downstairs (the event space is upstairs--very comfortable for all ages, and stylish to boot). They even had centerpieces, complete with hops and candles, at all the tables. Meghan, their event coordinator, was a pleasure to work with prior to the event and was extremely responsive to any questions/concerns we had. We couldn't have been happier with how things went with our dinner at Revolution.
