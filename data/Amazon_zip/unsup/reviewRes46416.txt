I first became enamored by this restaurant in the Venetian in Las Vegas, having no idea that there was a location in Chicago and that it was related to the Cheesecake Factory! What a delight! Yes, there are long long waits for tables. Yes, it's huge and touristy. Yes, it's pricey. But it's also super-delicious! I LOVE the Asian Nachos and I had a sour apple martini that was better than most. More upscale than Cheesecake and they have a more manageable menu. It's fun and yummy for an occasional dinner out.
