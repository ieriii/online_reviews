2 designer cookies packaged for $ 5,99 and a professional Midwestern gal with no make up and expensive but practical work out clothes ordering a salmon burger at the deli counter with no bun and a salad substituting for the fries sums up the basic nature of this grocery store: bitchy.  Candy station, cheese station, wine aisle and other luxurious expensive gourmand goods dominates the shelves. Hoteling close by provides some sensible purchases like fruit or yogurt, a bottle of wine or a vacation splurge if you've been good.
