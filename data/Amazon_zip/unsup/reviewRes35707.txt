I just tried Shaw's Sunday brunch and it was amazing! It's pricey at $40 per person, but it's got a wonderful authentic old school Speakeasy-ish Chicago feel to it, and anything with seafood (lobster brie penne, crab legs, raw oysters, cooked and smoked salmon, crabcakes, etc) except for the maki was amazing, the breakfast and dessert spreads were quite impressive, and the service was great. It's nice to take your parents who are visiting in from out of town, without the cheesy touristy feel to it.
