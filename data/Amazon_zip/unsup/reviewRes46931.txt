Went to Uncommon Ground to celebrate a new job a few weeks back and could not have been happier with the experience. The food was amazing. The service was above and beyond our expectations. The entire staff was friendly, knowledgeable, and welcoming. The wine list could have been a little longer, but we were completely happy with our selection. We started with the pork belly appetizer and it was as perfect a bite of food as I have ever had. Pure decadence in the form of tasty bacony goodness. Our main dishes did not let up on the indulgent theme of the meal. My fianc and I were both extremely pleased with our selections - she had a hearty and rich beef stew and I went with the steak special with creamy (almost butterscotch) sweet potato puree. Perfection. We have also had the brunch here and though the option here are lighter and less expensive they are no less delicious and well thought out. Don't pass up the drink options here for either meal. The bloody Mary is spicy, rich, and complex. Their seasonal drink specials compliment any meal and their selection of local and regional beers will introduce you to new brew options to enjoy with a meal or on their own. For a special occasion meal, a unique drink, a hard-to-find micro brew, or a hearty and tasty breakfast option this is the place.
