Food is great and the portions are huge. The inside is georgous! I've had the Shepard's Pie and the Pot Pie. Great servers. My biggest complaint is that guinness shouldn't be $7.50 ... seriously. AND I went there on St. Patrick's day and they played a couple of Irish songs. The second time I went there it was just blaring spice girls music when the place was half empty.
