Let's keep this as short and simple as possible. The food is good, but then again, I like Mexican food and unless a place is absolutely horrible, then all Mexican food is good by default. It's not OHMYGOD amazing, but if I'm in the area or close enough, I'll head here. What amazes me is the flour tortillas. How many Mexicans do you know that eat flour tortillas? We don't. I can't think of any, unless it's a fajita, and even then it's begrudgingly. The first time I came here was years ago and my friend was all "YOU MUST EAT THIS, IT'S SO GOOD, YOU WILL BE A FLOUR LOVER!!!!" I refused to order my tortillas as flour, so naturally, she gave me one of hers. She was right, it was indeed the best flour tortilla I've had. In all fairness, I don't eat them (often), but every now and then I'll try one and think to myself "this is why I don't eat flour tortillas".  I like you Nuevo Leon, and while I won't order your flour tortillas, I'll probably convince someone else to so I can steal some of theirs.
