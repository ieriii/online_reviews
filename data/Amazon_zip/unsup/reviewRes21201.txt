This was the CMYE: @ Sapori Trattoria after party for me and a couple of fellow Yelpers who did not wanted to call it a night, instead they wanted to go for 1/2 priced Margaritas. I'm not a huge fan of Margaritas I just wanted to sober up (since I had to drive back to the South Side) however, I had a Taco I really did not liked the ingredients that came with it like the iceberg lettuce and tomatoes. I guess I have experienced better but, the Tortilla and Carne Asada were delicious. I was extremely content with the service especially with the waitress (She was sweet as hell!) Overall, I had great time socializing with fellow Yelpers, even though we got kicked out due to closing time.
