The pizza here is excellent and one of the best pizza places I have visited. The deep dish pizza takes about 35 mins to bake but it's worth the wait for sure. Each slice is about equal to 2 slices of "regular pizza" and my wife and I weren't able to finish the medium pizza. There are layers of cheese and toppings, you might even have to eat part of it with a knife and fork. Try it and you won't be disappointed.
