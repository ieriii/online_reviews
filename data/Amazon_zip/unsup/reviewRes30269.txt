Business lunch here. YES! I've been wanting to come here for quite some time so when I was delegated as the authority to pick a lunch spot for a business meeting, Sunda was on the top of the list. The interior is pimp and unique. The day I was there the male waiters looked like models (seriously they were all attractive) and dressed super sharp in their double breasted military inspired jackets. Our waiter was awesome and gave great recommendations including the brussel sprout salad. I hesitated when he suggested it b/c I'm not a fan of brussel sprouts but he assured me it was worth it and good lord, this salad was super, super tasty! Note...it is not located on the lunch menu but he said it would be no problem to make it. We also had the following: Rock shrimp tempura - tasty..what you would expect though as a rock shrimp app Signature sushi with tuna and kobe beef - lovely Tail of 2 Tunas roll - a great roll for Tuna lovers Firecracker - advertises itself as spicy but it could use more kick Mushroom lover roll - Ugh. I did not like the texture of this in my mouth.  I came on a Friday during Lent so were were a bit limited in ordering meat dishes but I will be back to indulge in them. This is a great spot for lunch or dinner.
