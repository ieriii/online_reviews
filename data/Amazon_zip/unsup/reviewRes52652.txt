I've been here a couple times and I have to admit I love their food and salad bar. Their salad bar has more variety than other brazilian steakhouses. Love the grilled shrimp and pineapple at dinner time. Haven't been to any other brazilian steakhouses that serves that. That is why I keep coming back.
