It's always a good time at Carnivale! The food is always top notch. The selection of different steaks is really fantastic. I especially like that their entrees are all different sizes - some dishes pack a lot of food, while others are a bit smaller. Ropa vieja appetizer is my favorite dish. I think we ended up ordering two. Also love the guacamole. Beef tenderloin is a HUGE entree. Two huge pieces of beef. I ate one that night, and one as left overs. It might have been even better as leftovers than it was originally. Minus one star because the bar tends to run slowly, so you wait a while to get your drinks after ordering them, and because the dessert selection could be improved (i.e., they should offer the Kleiner elements separately if you only want one awesome component - such as the ice cream sundae or the cotton candy!)
