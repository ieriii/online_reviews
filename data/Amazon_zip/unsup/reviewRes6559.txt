Pretty hard to top Wildfire when it comes to quality and consistancy. The place is always at the top of their game. The room itself is beautful and relaxing, albiet a bit noisy when crowded. Portions are large and cooked perfectly. The pistascio encrusted Halibut is not to be missed - truly one of Chicago's best entrees in my book. And in typical Lettuce Entertain You form, the servers are always knowledgable and friendly.
