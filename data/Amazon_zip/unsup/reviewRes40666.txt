Don't know which of the 3 locations this is for but this place is the shiz-nit!  I started with the lil hole in the wall joint and I was honestly scared! There were 3 fights before I finished my 3 YUMMERS asada tacos. I didn't even mind the cops and the managers yelling right next to me and the other 20 people waiting for there tacos.  The next time I ventured all the way across the street to their other location and this was more of my taste. The chips and salsa were to die for and the late night crowd in there seemed a little better but great anyways.  I have one more stop to make. ;o)
