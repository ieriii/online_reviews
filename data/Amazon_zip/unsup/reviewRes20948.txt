After reading the reviews of Coast on Yelp, my boyfriend and I decided to try it out on Thursday evening. I am not impressed. Admittedly, the spicy miso soup was fantastic, but the sushi really fell short. We started with the tuna tartar which was miniscule and very dry. We tried the famous white dragon roll and we couldn't finish it. My bf described it as "McDonald's suishi" which is the perfect description. It was cloyingly sweet and there was so much going on that the taste of the fish was completely lost We also had the Wasabi roll, the Spicy Tuna, and another salmon roll which, while ok, was certainly not worth the price. Our server was very monotone throughout the evening and kept trying to hurry us out the door as soon as we finished our meal. If you want a great byob sushi in the neighborhood, try Hachi's Kitchen. Better decor, better sushi, and better all-around ambiance. Also, this is not a wheelchair accessible restaurant. My bf said the bathrooms were impossible to get into.
