Took my little sister here for her "I got a new job celebration lunch," and had a good experience.  We sat outside - wish we would have sat inside. I felt like the ambiance out there was a little awkward. The vibe inside seemed a lot more communal and cool.  My favorite was the pork cheek gravy - must try. I would pass on the Pork Sweetbreads with Fennel & Apricots - as much as I love sweetbreads, I was not a huge fan of the way these were cooked. Weird aftertaste and kind of blah. They were sold out of the bone-marrow smear, so I plan to go back just so I can try it.
