The food was just as I would expect. Fresh, unique, and robust with flavor.... particularly garlic. Yet, what really moved me and ultimately made my experience 5 star worthy was the exceptional staff. Upon enter, all eyes were on me.....which isn't unusual.....yet in this instance, people were smiling rather than whispering *wink*. Everyone from the host to the server, to even the bussers greated me with a smile as asked how my experience was going. SHOCKING!!!!! Especially when you have a busser engaging in conversation with you. NOw, this was a dinner for two, but it felt more like a small dinner party for 12, because the staff was relentless when it came to asking how things were. Either this place is really looking to raise the customer service bar, or they've seen my past reviews with other restaurants here on YELP. KUDOS to Zed 451.
