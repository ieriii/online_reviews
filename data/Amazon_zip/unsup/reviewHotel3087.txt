Location is wonderful with fabulous views of the pier from some rooms.  Vibrant trendy lobby area with attentive staff. Seemed like the music was always pulsing and fashionable people milling around looking to socialize. I really enjoyed the lounge chairs outside facing the lake. Restaurant in the lobby area was quite alright, and not too expensive mediterranean influenced fare. Rooms are decently sized and very comfortable linens and beds. The standard flat screen tv and well stocked mini fridge. Very nice little set of Bliss products (I see people ebaying these for $10-20!). facewash, soap, body butter, shampoo, conditioner. One major drawback for me was the very open design of the bathroom. Looks cute, but I found it icky. The bathroom has shutters that open out into the living space and a door that doesn't really close but is just a hollowcore door that slides. It seems to be a trend, and it's one I don't like. Maybe I'm too uptight. I don't enjoy hearing every minutiae of my travelmate's hygiene routines and I don't want them to hear mine. Overall though, enjoyable stay. Would book again at the right price.
