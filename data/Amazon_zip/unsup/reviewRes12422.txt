Every time when one of my friends comes back to Chicago (usually 2-3 times a year), she throws a shindig at Cafe 28, one of her old haunts from when she lived here. It's always a great time - good people, good fun, and Cafe 28 lives up to their end. The decor and lighting is wonderful for setting ambiance and the owner gets us anything we need. A bevy of food and spirits are ordered by all; my companion and I decided to get: * Green Tamales * Coconut Shrimp * Trio of Lemon Sorbet, Chocolate Chip Gelato, and Burnt Caramel Gelato * Virgin Mojito (2) The tamales are usually amazing; this time, they were disappointingly dry in places and flavorless. The coconut shrimp were up to form: not the breaded in coconut batter and fried kind, but glazed with a sweet coconut glaze and served with a little sweet salsa over curried rice. Delish! My two mojitos were awesome. The second, unfortunately, came full-strength; after two sips, I grabbed the owner and told her "let's try this one again." She said "Oh, I'm positive it's virgin." I started to frown and say, "No, trust me, it's boozed." but she grabbed the drink and said "I'll have them remake it just to be safe." Uncomfortable scene averted! We were there for four hours (not sure how I lasted) and nobody objected, it was just pure fun, and Cafe 28 is to thank for supporting that and making it possible.
