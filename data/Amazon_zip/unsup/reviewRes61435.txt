My Mom's been ordering from here for as long as I can remember. When I moved out, I kept the tradition. Only ever having a problem once, and that was because they had a hard time finding our house and didn't happen to take our phone number down! (So make sure you give them your number if it's your first time ordering!) Other than that, we've always had fast deliveries and the pizza is always hot and delicious. This is the thin square-cut pizza that is cooked with all the ingredients UNDER a layer of cheese. Very tasty stuff! I recommend their pepperoni!
