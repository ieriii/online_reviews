This place is one of my favorite romantic restaurants in Chicago. I recently took my boyfriend here for our one year anniversary and it was wonderful. Our waiter was the best and very helpful when it came to finding a wine we enjoyed within our price range. You are never rushed here and the waiters check-in on you with out you noticing which is perfect for the setting. It is one the pricey side but its worth it for the special occasions or if you just want to go in for dessert that works too and is more affordable per person.
