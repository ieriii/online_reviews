oops I went here a while ago and forgot to review! This is a great place for drink and food! We started with beef tartare - very light and delicious, perfect way to start the meal we got the special which was the filet, cooked medium rare, it was so tender and juicy, just how all perfect steaks should be. we got the spagetti bolgonese - it was ok but it just wasn't as memorable. OMG get the blacked cauliflower, it was awesome!! Sounds kinda weird but you won't regret it! I really enjoyed my experience at Gilt bar, can't wait to go back!
