I went here for the first time on friday and boy was I suprised. I had heard a lot of things about this place but when i get there I was more than satisfied. The food was excellent; i had the wild boar sloppy joe and the oxtail and scallops. I skipped the dessert because i was too full by that point. Also, the drinks were fantastic. I had one of their Yuzu Hot Toddy's. Yum Yum. I highly recommend checking it out.
