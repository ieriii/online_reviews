I agree, five stars. The staff was very friendly, professional and quick. They had the perfect recommendations for sightseeing, dining and drinking. Hangover cure breakfast @ 1 pm - the Temple Cafe was the right suggestion. The room was modern and sleek, with the most comfortable bed out of any hotel I have stayed at (and I travel for work plenty). Continental breakfast on every floor - thus allowing the guests to sneak out in pjamas, grab delicious fluffy croissants, and run away back to the room. The location was perfect - minutes from the CTA, right next to the river, and walking distance to many sights, Mag Mile, dinning and boozing. Yay Amalfi...thanks for the wonderful time.
