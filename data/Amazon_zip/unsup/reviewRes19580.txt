Great casual dining, soup and sandwiches (Caldos y Tortas) with really great seasonal ingredients. Knocked off a star for the wait time and cramped quarters.  Loved the Hibiscus and lemongrass tea! It was heavier on the hibiscus. I really want to try the flan + cake dessert, or the homemade soft serve, not sure which next. Every Caldo (soup) I tried was hearty and delicious. Perfect for the cold outside.
