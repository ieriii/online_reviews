They have piggy paws, bone marrow, and piggy ears. Sounds appetizing right? For some people probably not, but it harbored my interest immediately. I've been dying to try this place and finally went last night with a girlfriend. We got in around right before 7 and the place was packed. The hostess told us the wait would be 30 mins and we saw two seats at the bar so I went to go snag them. But for some reason I guess the hostess miscalculated because there was a table available outside for two. Well why didn't you say it earlier? Oh, the indoor part of the restaurant is SO SMALL. I was doing my bag-lady look yesterday and I totally bumped into everybody and everything. Oops. So before you go, de-bag! We really enjoyed the outdoor seating esp since it was such a fab night. We got a half bottle of Moscato and 4 plates to share: roasted corn, bone marrow, melted cheese with truffle oil, and the fries of the sea. Everything was really delish. I think the roasted corn was our fave. The bone marrow was good but too much of it kinda made me feel a lil sick. The service was a little slow, but due to the crampiness, I don't know if they can stick another waiter/waitress in there. It's def a must-try if you like interesting dishes, sitting really close to other ppl, and bumping into everybody and their mothers.
