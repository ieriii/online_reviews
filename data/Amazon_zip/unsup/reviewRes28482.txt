So, I've been saving my 100th time for someone special and I think Graham Elliot qualifies. There were highlights and some disappointments to the meal. Overall I thought it was an awesome experience, some dishes just need a little work. I'll start off with what I liked the least and work my way back to what was the best. We started with the crab gazpacho. The bowl it came in, (although it looked nice) was very hard to eat out of. The soup was quite bland. I don't know, maybe it needed more curry foam. The next, surprised me it ranked so low on my list, was the cheez-it risotto. To me this also lacked some flavor. I was looking for something bolder when I tasted it. The next was the cesar. I would say from the cesar on... everything was very good just some stood out as the best. Obviously the famous parmesan twinkie was awesome. The beet salad was next and I actually thought that with the whipped goat cheese it was a little better than the cesar. The best 3 dishes came from the Hot section. The white truffle gnocchi was really good. Anything topped with a fried egg is good in my book. The buffalo chicken wing was awesome as well. I loved that it was a deconstructed version of the buffalo wing. The sauces that it came with were extremely tasty. And the number one thing we had was... (drum roll)...the Kobe Beef Tartare with smoked ice cream. Everything in this dish just really worked well together. The smoked ice cream put it over the top though. As everyone else said, you are served a bowl of the truffle oil popcorn which is really good. I need to figure out how to make that. For desert we had the peanut butter cup brownie. The desert was out of this world, could have used a little more ice cream for the very rich brownie though. I will definitely be back and hopefully they will have flavored up a few of those first mentioned dishes.
