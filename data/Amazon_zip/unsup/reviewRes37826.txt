I visited Hop Leaf for the first time before becoming obsessed with beer. I was overwhelmed by a) the beer list and b) the crowds. I visited Hop Leaf a few times AFTER becoming obsessed with beer and was overwhelmed by a) the beer list (in a good way!!!) and b) the crowds. I was extremely underwhelmed by the food. Mussels were yummy, steak was pretty tough and disappointing. Onion fries were melt-in-your-mouth sinful. Can't remember exactly what friends ordered, but I remember not being impressed... and obviously what they had was unmemorable. Maybe it's good "bar food". Meh. I wish the *bar* of the Hop Leaf were in my backyard. I would be there every night for a drink - it seems like such a great hang up front. But, I guess I will have to settle for a trip to Binny's and hanging out on my front porch instead - which is not all that bad, and, I can make my own steak to go with it (and it'll probably taste a lot better).
