Ah, Irazu you've spoiled me. Veggie burritos are so yummy, and the guacamole is thick, creamy and wonderful with their homemade chips. Love the tilapia, the plantains, yucca, just about everything and yes, those oatmeal/soy shakes. Now that they deliver, it's disgusting how often we pig out on their food. One of Bucktown's finest.
