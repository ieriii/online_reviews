Best specials in the neighborhood. Half off every draft? Are you serious? YES YOU ARE! Food is really good from the apps to the burgers. It seems like someone really put some effort to appeal to the veggie lovers like me and having to not pay an upcharge for a good salad instead of fries gets me every time. I love even more that they recently took a rez for my date and I for the UFC fight with GSP. I've never had that and was so sick of fifty/50 and they're deep fried menu this was a welcome sight. The manager even sold me some wine from a personal bottle he got from upstairs because they don't sell wine anymore. This place is the shit and I'm happy to be a patron.
