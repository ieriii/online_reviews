you know it's hard for me to give any breakfast place 5 stars. milk and honey is a solid 4 star establishment. this place was super busy during the summer when i went. i ordered a very traditional sandwich. it was good. the place is cute and kind of reminds me of tartine in SF - minus the to-die-for croissants. this is a fun place to go for brunch.
