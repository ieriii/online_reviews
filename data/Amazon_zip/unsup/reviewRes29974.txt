this place loses a star b/c my serve was TERRIBLE. absolutely terrible that i want to say he was kind of racist. he went to all the tables around ours at LEAST 3 times before he would come to our table to ask if everything was ok. and we ordered appetizers, small tapa dishes, sides and entrees! but it was always someone else bringing out the food and it literally took 2.5-3 hours just to finish the meal b/c we spent probably 1.5 hours just sitting there waiting to be helped besides that though, the food was delicious. i would definitely come back here, no questions asked. probably go around 5 or a little before 5 though b/c i went at 8 and wasn't seated until 10. granted, it was a saturday night... anyway, i had the calamari ceviche and the chicken small tapa (REALLY good w/ the side of mexican rice that i got) and also was able to try the duck entree which i would say wasn't TOO great b/c the meat wasn't as tender as i thought it would be, but my bf really liked it
