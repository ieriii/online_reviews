if i want non-thin crust pizza, i prefer pequods over everything. their pan/deep dish is so good, i often eat too much and have to sit around for a while before i am able to move again. if i die from eating pizza (god willing), i hope there's a slice of this stuff hanging out of my mouth. it's a little expensive unless you have a larger group. their beer prices are atrocious, but i don't want to fill up on drinks so i usually just get water. i've never had to wait for a table because the have two floors of seating, but i have had to wait longer than i'd like to actually get my pizza. the wait staff is nice and, and i like that they serve everyone their first piece when they bring it out. i've shared a lot of good memories with friends and family at pequods, and when someone comes in from out of town, this is often a first choice for dinner. there's not much else to say except that if you love pizza, you'll love pequods.
