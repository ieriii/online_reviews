I wanted to like this place, I wanted to like Chicago Deep Dish Pizza...I really did...unfortunately it did not live up to my expectations. It was simply just...TOO MUCH. Too cheesy, too fattening, too salty for me. I mean, it was good for the first 3 bites but my body started protesting after that. Felt like I was eating a heart attack LOL. We also made the mistake of ordering 2 (1 small & 1 medium). Our group of 4 could barely finish 1 I guess Chicago Deep Dish Pizza: 1, Emmie: 0
