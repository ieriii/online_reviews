I like this place to go with a big group and get their speciality rolls! I personally LOVE sashimi! And not many people do, so they ease into sushi with Rolls and Coast is GREAT for that! Their Speciality Rolls are unsual and unique: The White Dragon is a nice alternative to the traditional Dragon roll! I love the Sunrise Roll b/c of the Mango! The Coast Crab is actually fantastic: I'm the last person in the World that would order Crab at a sushi restaurant. The other thing that Coast does that is trully amazing is their combo of Jalapeno and Hamachi or Tuna... If you do get the Hamachi Jalapeno Roll, ask them to add Cilantro! You won't regret it! Plus keep in mind that you usually get drunk at Coast! I always make the mistake of drinking a bottle wine while I wait for table. But thats what makes dining at Coast an Event!!
