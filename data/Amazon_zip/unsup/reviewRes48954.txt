We arrived at shortly before 7pm on a Friday. We were seated immediately. Service was great with a whole cast of people attending to our dining needs. Food was good... the muscles were cooked to perfection. The fries were tasty too. The beer menu is extensive with more brews than food. We'd probably go back if in the area.
