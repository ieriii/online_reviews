Kind of disappointed. My boyfriend made reservations for a Friday night at 8:15. They were not ready for us, so we waited. At about 8:30, my boyfriend who is very nice, asked again if they were ready for us. No. At 8:45 (the East Coaster in me got a little upset), I asked why 30 minutes had passed and we were still not seated. The host apologized and offered us free drinks. We took him up on it and were given mojitos and promptly taken to a seat. The mojitos were not good. The bench style seat was extremely uncomfortable and had me sitting about 3 inches lower than my boyfriend (who sat in an actual chair across the table from me). I hate when a bench and chair do not sit you at the same height...seriously...poor planning! On to the food. We ordered bacon wrapped dates. The bacon was all fat. I usually love bacon wrapped dates, I couldn't stomach these. Table bread was tasteless. At this point, I didn't trust the Cuban food (I am Cuban), so I ordered the salmon. It was way overdone. The couscous that came with it was great...the best part of the meal. My boyfriend ordered Cuban chicken and thought it was okay. He brought some home and the picky cat ate it, so it must have been pretty good. Overall, I would not come back. There are plenty of other Cuban restaurants and Mexican restaurants to try in Chicago. I don't know about mixing Cuban food with Mexican food anyway as they are totally different and not real compatible in my mind. For great Cuban food, go to 90 Miles!!!
