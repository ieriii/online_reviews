Best crepes. I'm not a huge crepe fan, but this place has convinced me! Try the Bananas Nutella or the Crepe de Amore. Also, the brown sugar and butter, need I say more?! Best bet is to not go during lunchtime. Although the staff is very nice and polite, it takes a bit longer to get in and out if you're in a hurry. I suggest 2:00 p.m. if you try to go in the afternoon. The best thing about Icosium is that it's inexpensive, fast, and they deliver too!
