I took my daughter and 30 friends and family to the Grand Lux Cafe for her high school graduation. We waited two and a half hours just to be seated (there was no place to sit, so we stood outside). Then once we place our order, we waited another hour before our food actually came. I could have gotten what they served from a neighborhood restaurant - the food was not worth the price we paid for it and everyone in my party agreed. It was so bad that I agreed to pay for everyones bill - I was that embarassed. Needless to say, I've never been back, nor do I ever plan to patronize this establishment again. It's just not worth the wait. There are too may exquisite restaurants in Chicago that HAVE reservations and high qualiity food that I don't have to waste my time having a horrible experience with Grand Lux Cafe again. Tourist, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!!!! Lawry's Steakhouse is right across the street - EXCELLENT!!
