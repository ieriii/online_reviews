I've only been to the gage a few times, and only during happy hour. So my review will be solely based on my experiences at the bar, drinking the gage old fashioned and eating fries with curry gravy. That said, I keep coming back. It's always packed in here during rush hour. But if you get your drink, stand around for a few minutes, and act aggressively, you'll get a small table or spot at the bar to enjoy your curry fries. The drinks have been consistent (love the cherries in the old fashioned- I think they're brandied or something), as well as the must-have curry fries. The only downside is that, as a 20-something who usually comes here with female friends of the same age, we often spend more time than we'd like fending off middle aged gentlemen trying to make conversation. Which is fine, but when you're just here to catch up with a friend over a drink, can get tiresome. I'm not sure that I'd come here for a proper meal, because I'm not in love with the ambiance or menu, but for happy hour it's a perfectly nice and convenient place to stop by.
