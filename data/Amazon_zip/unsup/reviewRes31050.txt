Gilt City had a decent coupon for us to try a tasting menu so we were looking forward to it. The salad was flavorful and good, but the lettuce pieces were too big and not cut up. Too hard to eat. The rock tempura shrimp was actually not very good, it was essentially Chinese walnut shrimp... I thought I was getting ripped off. The sushi rolls were decent... nothing to complain about. The fish was fresh tasting. The steak filet that we got was actually pretty bad. It was extremely chewy. One of the worst steaks I've had in a while. It was served in chunks and there was one that I could not chew up and I had to spit it out. It is rare to do that in a restaurant for me. However, even with some of my negative reviews, the pork belly, two long strips of pork, was the best pork belly I've ever had. Extremely tender, flavorful, just the perfect amount of fat and char. The mochi dessert was good, a lot of different flavors. I will go back just to have the pork belly.
