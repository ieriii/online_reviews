LOVE IT!!! BJ the maitre d' was very intune to the needs of my quests!! If you are a fan of southern homestyle cooking, this is the place to go. The wait staff are very friendly, sometimes towards the end of dinner- too smothering...kind of a hurry and get out feel. Still, I would come back - I've taken four different groups of clients in the last month...so yeah, I'm in love and will continue to support Q!
