So happy to have Simply It just down the street from me! I grew up eating Vietnamese food and always crave it, but never have the time to go all of the way up to Argyle. Their pho is great, and I love how they do it the authentic way when I order it delivered and leave the thinly sliced raw beef on the side to pour the boiling broth over. Love ordering bun bo xao va cha gio, super healthy, fresh, light, and yummy. Added bonus? It's a BYOB and super affordable for a casual night out with friends.
