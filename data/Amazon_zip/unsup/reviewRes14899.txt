stopped in recently to verify all the good reviews I had read plus i love a good cuban sandwich. For anyone who has been to Havana Sandwich on Buford Highway in the ATL then you know all cuban sandwiches from their on are compared to Havana...  90 miles has a good vibe when you walk in and the owner was very personable. The cuban was tasty and I will definitely be back - could have had a little better balance on the pork & ham (not enough pork) and the bread was OK. I also tried the tostones which were good as well but a bit too much garlic. The steak sandwiches looked pretty tasty so I think I will give that a try next time.
