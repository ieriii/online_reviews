I love Mexican food and this Saturday I have a chance to try the relatively new Xoco restaurant in Chicago. The proprietor of Xoco is Chicago's Mexico food guru Rick Bayless who also owns Topolobambo and Frontea Grill. The theme of Xoco is Mexico street food elevated. The restaurant is not very big and has a casual dining atmosphere. My wife and I arrived at about 11:30am and by noon, the line was out the door. The popularity of the restaurant was evident. The wait staff were friendly and efficient. We ordered the following: -a. Shortrib Red Chile Soup (braised tallgrass shortribs, red chile broth, roasted vegetables, epazote, wild arugula, lime).b. Pork Belly Vermicelli (crispy-tender pork belly, toasty-tender noodles, woodland mushrooms, zucchini, avocado, salsa negra).c. Pibil (wood-roasted suckling pig with achiote, black beans, pickled onion, habanero salsa).d. Mocha Tres Leches Cake as a desert.d. Aztec chocolate (chile, all spice) as beverage. The shortrib red chile soup came in a red hot broths. I thought it was going to be very spicy. Surprisingly it was relatively mild. It had very good favor and the short rib was very tender. I only wished there was more short rib in the bowl.The pork belly vermicelli was actually a little more spicier than the shortrib red chile soup. The pork belly was both crispy and tender. Personally, I felt that the soup was a little sweet for my taste, but my wife loved it.The Pibil was excellent. The bread was toasted, but not overly crispy. The pork was tender. The wait staff was very considerate by putting the habanero salsa on the side, as it was really quite hot.We both like the Mocha Tres Leches cake very much. It was very light, airy and moderately sweet, topped with a generous supply of flame-torched whipped cream. The Aztec chocolate was very thick with an intense favor. It had a texture of runny melted chocolate.All in all, we had a very nice dining experience and I would not hesitate to go back again.
