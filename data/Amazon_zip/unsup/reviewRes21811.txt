Went here at 3pm on a Saturday and still had to wait forty five minutes for a table but it was worth the wait for a really good sandwich aka Torta. We got the woodland mushroom torta - A great combo of fresh ingredients and goat cheese made this yummy. We also ordered the pork belly vermicelli caldos. It was a unique broth, a bit too salty for my tastes but I did enjoy the sesame seeds in it. As for the crispy fried pork belly in it..meh. It was my first time trying it and it was way too fatty for me. We couldn't resist the hot chocolates. I tried the almond milk one which was better as I kept on sipping it. The one without milk was more sour than rich and creamy. Last comment-the cinnamony shortbread cookie was sooooo good. I wish the wait wasn't so long...kind of defeats the purpose of this place. But the originality of the sandwiches and soups do make it hard not to go back.
