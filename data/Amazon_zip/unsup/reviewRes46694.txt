I really really really like this restaurant. I only gave it four stars because of a few minor issues. One is size, it can be very cramped inside here. Another has to do with the up charge for getting chicken or any sort of meat for your salad from the salad bar. It is the only salad bar that I know of that does that. While I am sure there are others, it definitely does not seem to be the standard. The food is always top notch, and the salad bar is always fresh.
