I like everything about Cafe 28, the unlikely pairing of Cuban and Mexican cuisines, the dining room, the service, the location, the availability of parking etc etc... except I have a few problems with the food. The "Taste of Cuba" starter was delicious -- the empanadas and croquettes were lightly fried, everything was well seasoned and the dipping sauce provided a nice compliment. The Tortilla Cobb salad was refreshing and tasty. The bread they offered on the table was addictive... However, the sandwiches could use some work. I was very excited to try the Ropa Vieja but the meat was a bit tough and lacked flavor. The Mexican torta was a pretty standard (and bland) grilled chicken sandwich with guacamole -- a bit underwhelming. The chilaquiles were definitely the best out of everything we ordered. My biggest complaint is the restaurant's restraint on the level of spice. Latin flavors tend to be big and bold, spicy and hot, in your face and unapologetic. Cafe 28 could use a bit more of that across the board. Maybe they save all the punch for dinner and spare lunch-goers much of the gut-busting... I'll have to give the dinner menu a try one of these days to find out.
