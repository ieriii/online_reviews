Sunda is typically a place that I avoid because it's ultra-trendy and awash with VIPs, but I was really pleasantly surprised. The food was solidly good. A few dishes were stand-outs, like the brussel sprout salad which was excellent (and I don't even like brussel sprouts that much!). The pork belly dish was quite good as well. Cocktails are interesting and pack a punch. Service was good natured and attentive despite the huge crowd in there. It was very loud as other reviewers have said, but overall, I'd certainly recommend it.
