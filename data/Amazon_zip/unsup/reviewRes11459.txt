After avoiding the weekend lines for years I decided to check out The Bongo Room on a Monday. My fianc and I showed up just before noon and even though the place was packed we had no trouble getting a table for two. We were able to get our coffee and place our order very quickly. Which was great because I was pretty hungry. But then the wait began. The waitress never came back to see how we were doing or to see if we needed more coffee or anything else. 30 minutes after we ordered, the food showed up. I know the place was busy but we both ordered sandwiches, those aren't that complicated to make. Our waitress was just bad because the people behind us had a different waitress and she apologized to them for the wait. The service might of soured me a tad on the food but overall I wasn't blown away. The apple club was tasty but really heavy and the crab club was just so so. After we were done I guess our waitress figured we didn't need or want anything else because she just brought the check over and didn't even ask how everything was or if we needed anything else. The place was a bit over hyped for me. There are plenty of other great places in the area with less of wait and better service. I'd love to give The Bongo Room another try sometime but I'm not waiting two hours on the weekend. Maybe another Monday in the future...
