Okay Irazu, there's so many things that I liked about you... the oatmeal shake, the fried plantains, the rice.. sigh. Unfortunately, there were a couple of things I wasn't a fan of either such as the flavorless guacamole, slow service (only ONE server in the dining room? what is that??) and the sad skirt steak milanesa. I had high hopes of milanesas thanks to Cemitas Puebla, but Irazu's was like a squishy steak parmesan (its topped with tomato sauce and Chihuahua cheese, MEH) Irazu, I'm willing to give you another chance. Maybe I just ordered a weird dish on a not so good night. I'll come back for those plantains, another milkshake, and maybe an empanada or three.
