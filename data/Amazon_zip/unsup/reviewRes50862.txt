I'm going to agree with the stellar service, unexceptional food theme that seems to pervade many of these reviews. I needed to find a location for a bookclub brunch and found myself having difficulty locating a restaurant that would take brunch reservations. An Open Table search indicated that Big Jones would and since I'd been meaning to give this place a shot anyway and it was within walking distance of my house (always a bonus for a Sunday morning) I was sold. My group arrived and was seated immediately. Our server was fantastic and kept our (enormous) coffee mugs filled throughout the entire brunch (I wasn't overly fond of the coffee, which our server informed us was Intelligentsia). She didn't mind that we were so busy chatting that it took us awhile to put in our food orders. We started off with complimentary beignet-like things that were, for me at least, the highlight of the meal. The vegetarians were disappointed to find there weren't very many meat free options on the menu, but our sever accommodated them by substituting fried green tomatoes for the meat sides on several of the breakfast platters. I ordered cheddar corn cakes with eggs, which is served over red beans (this does not appear on the current menu on the website). I thought the dish was passable but bland, which seemed to be the consensus of everyone at the table (the one exception was the Eggs New Orleans, which my legitimately Southern friend said was fantastic).  Overall, I feel the prices at Big Jones are a little high for the taste of the food served, though I have no doubt the organic ingredients contribute to the higher prices. Big Jones was an ok choice for our bookclub, but I'm in no hurry to go back.
