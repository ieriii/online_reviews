Sultan's Market is a good place to stop in for a sandwich or a really casual meal with some friends. They have wonderful falafel (as everyone has already said), but I've had the chicken and the lamb shwarma wraps and there is just something off about their hummus. It has an odd aftertaste--like...the zoo. I'm just gonna leave it there, but yeah--weird. That aside, the service is good, the food is decent, and this place is quite comfortable.
