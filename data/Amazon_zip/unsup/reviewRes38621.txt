After several visits to Hopleaf, I still find myself torn between 3 and 4 stars. I'm going with 3, because while I agree that the beer selection is fantastic and the bartenders are very knowledgable and friendly, I can't shake the feeling that the attitude of the establishment sometimes is that patrons should feel really lucky to be there. Don't get me wrong, it's a great little neighbhorhood bar, with a great beer selection, but service can be a bit iffy (particularly in the restuarant), and the bouncers can be gruff when there is absolutely no reason to be.  If they worked on that a bit, they'd get another star from me.
