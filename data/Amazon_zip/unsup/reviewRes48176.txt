I'm the umpteenth person who has reviewed The Publican, but I'm happy to add to its praises. The vibe of the place is awesome. It's hip without pretension, it's homey and cool and you just want to sit there and settle in. We had no problems with the service. Our server was knowledgeable, helpful, friendly, and just generally cool. The food was impeccable. We had the chef's choice oysters, the trio of hams, steak tartare, frites, mussels and one of their desserts. Everything was ridiculously awesome. The return plotting has already begun...
