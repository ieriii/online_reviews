Service is good and friendly, i like the feel of the space; my favorite thing they have are the breakfast and mashed potatos. But for some reason eggs are always over cooked and rubbery, perhaps it is a hint that they don't want me to be eating said eggs but I really don't think it would be hard to learn to fry them properly. Coffee is also oddly expensive and some of the meat substitutes are very over-spiced or sweetened. I love the location and am greatful there is a place like this in meatso fatso Chicago, but a few little things keep it from being great.
