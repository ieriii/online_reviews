I almost hate to review this place as I don't know a lot about it's number one purpose...whiskey. I can enjoy a great bourbon, but I can't pretend to know a lot about them. Despite that, I sill very much enjoyed L&E.  I sat at the bar for a bit listening to the staff discuss whiskey with some interested patrons and it was certainly interesting. Also, at our table, a few folks tried a flight of whiskeys and all were outstanding. A standout was definitely the Elmer T. Lee. It was about as smooth a whiskey as I've had (in my limited experience.)  For me, despite their claim as a whiskey bar, the highlight was the food. As many on Yelp had suggested I ordered the wild boar sloppy joe. It was perfectly done...an ode to good ole' sloppy joes, but so much tastier with the perfect amount of spice. While simple, it was one of the best sandwiches I've had in a while. I can also share that others at the table truly enjoyed their meals. The hanger steak was incredibly well received.  I'm not much of a dessert person, but the creme brulee fell into my category of 'special.' There's plenty of good out there to eat, but only the very best are termed 'special.' That creme brulee was just that.  While I can't speak to first hand experience, my assumption is that those who love whiskey and quality gastropub food will rather enjoy L&E. It's a terrific addition to a nice little stretch of food right across from the Blue Line.
