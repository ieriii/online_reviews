A fantastically hidden location with romantic/jazzy atmosphere and music you can actually hear over! And Pimms!! I never would have found this place on my own because the door is built into the wall/mural - my friend introduced me to the Violet Hour upon my return from London and I'm absolutely diggin' it. The best of all - they serve Pimms! The best summer drink of all time and one I can't do without. Although we had to wait a bit for a Tuesday evening, it was well worth it. The staff was attentive and apologetic about the wait, and came up after we were seated at the bar to see if we wanted a table. We opted to stay at the bar and didn't miss the booth - we were able to speak over the music and swap seats to change up conversation. I was sad to see the Pimms drink lacking fruit - that's the real way to serve it - but still gave me a lovely little buzz. Everything about this place was fabulous - from the velvet curtains, to the suspenders, to the spheres of ice. I can't wait to go back!
