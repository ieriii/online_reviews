I feel bad passing such a low review to the masses but Garcia's needs a face lift. We just moved to Lincoln Square and found that Garcia's was always busy. Naturally, we hustled over there as soon as a Mexican craving hit and waited for 20 minutes until a table opened up. Unfortunately we sat on the West end of the restaurant instead on the East and caught the door draft every couple of minutes. I had a mean craving for quesadilla & was disappointed to find that my dinner didn't even come with guacamole or sour cream. I cannot eat quesadilla plain! Service was pretty poor and so was the overall environment. The corner that we were stashed in had all of its lights burnt out so we were trapped in a cold dark corner where nobody was helping us. What more can I say. The one star is because we got served food and it was cheap, cheap, cheap.
