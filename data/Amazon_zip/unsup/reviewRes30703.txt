Before going to Nana's, you need to ask yourself a vital question: 'Am I in a hurry?' If the answer is yes, go directly to jail (aka another restaurant), do not pass go, do not collect $200 (aka Nana's food). If the answer is no, then you are about to learn what they mean when they say "good things come to those that wait". Now, before I dive into a discussion of the food (yummy, organic, properly portioned food...), I'd like to say that if you look up "really nice, mellow people" in the dictionary (What, my dictionary has phrases in it...doesn't yours?? You better return that thing!) you'd see "Nana's staff" under the synonyms list. The are good (albeit slow) people. Anyway, onto the good thing you waited for: the food! Major props to them for organic and vegetarian friendly menu. Their seasonal menu is always fabulous, and their staples are...well...staples for a reason. And they seriously have THE BEST SOUPS, EVER. Today I had a Maple Pumpkin soup....yum, yum, yum! I also like that they don't seem big into food waste or overfeeding people. Normally at restaurants, my options are a.) stuff myself and feel both gross and guilty b.) waste food and have them throw it out or c.) carry around one of those dumb doggie bags. Its nice to be served healthy portion sizes. The only thing that is a bit off is that the prices are fairly high - I know, organic and creative menu and all...but they still seem a bit high all things considered.
