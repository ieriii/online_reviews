I think I understand why the reviews are so polarizing for VH. On one hand, the place is basically Disneyland for booze. Most everything, right down to the ice is different. Further, at $12 a cocktail - it's really a good value when compared to places which are charging $20 for a Belvidere Tonic. Goes without saying that the room is swanky and with the guidelines for seated guests only it will never seem crowded. On the flip-side, if I had waited an hour in that hallway followed by another 30 minutes for my first drink... this would have been a very different review. Simply, I would have been hugely disappointed - nothing is THAT cool. So, in total - I think VH is the sort of place that, even if you love it, you'll go 3 or 4 times and then be over it. In the meantime, get a seat at the bar and learn some of the history and background of what they're doing, it's pretty cool stuff.
