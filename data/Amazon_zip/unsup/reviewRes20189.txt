Definitely in my top 3 of sushi places in Chicago. I absolutely love this place. I was lucky enough to have the girlfriend take me out here, and I was very impressed. We ended up waiting a long time for a table around 8 on a Friday night, but that's expected here. When we finally sat down our waitress was very attentive, and I thought we had very good service. The rolls were impeccable and very tasty.. My favorite part...its BYOB!! The prices can be higher than most other sushi joints, but why not splurge once every couple months for some amazing sushi?!
