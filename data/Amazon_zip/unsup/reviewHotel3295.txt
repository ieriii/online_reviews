Beautiful hotel but not the best service. During our two day stay at Hard Rock, to satisfy our midnight craving and thirst my boyfriend and I wanted to check out what's in the mini bar and the drawers but nothing really caught our interest so we decided to head out in stead. Next morning before our check out, we were charged for things we didn't even use! The front desk agent said it was a mistake, and that the mini bar and the drawers are sensitive to touch! What the heck is that??? I think that's kind of absurd.
