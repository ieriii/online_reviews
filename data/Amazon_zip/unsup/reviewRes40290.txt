It's late night on a Sunday, so my expectations aren't high. Just moved in this neighborhood, so had to check out the local mexican joints, especially that which has 3 joints right next to each other. Very misleading. After waiting over 30 minutes in an empty restaurant for takeout, there was already a bad taste in my mouth. I hoped the quesadilla would rid that. Nope, super soggy quesadilla didn't help. The chips and salsa that were missing made it worse. The burrito with sour cream and cheese loaded at the butt so that every bite had none except the last pissed off my boyfriend. And it was cold. And $19. Angry. All of these other 'great' experiences make me wonder why our Sunday night jaunt was so unsuccessful. I guess it's hit or miss at this place, but I won't try again to see if we get a hit. Mexican is too easy to come by in this town and I won't settle for disappointments!
