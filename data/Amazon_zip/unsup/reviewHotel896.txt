The hotel is right in the heart of Chicago. Perfect location. It's on the corner of State Street and Washington. A couple blocks one way is Millennium Park. A couple blocks the other way is the Chicago River. A short walk away from the Art Institute. A couple blocks away from Metro and bus stops. Making the entire city easily accessible. The hotel room was great. We asked from a room facing State Street when we checked in because there is some construction across Washington. We got an end room on the 12th floor. Great view down Washington toward Millennium Park and also down State Street toward the Chicago River, with a view of the Chicago Theater. The room was a modest size. The bathroom was nice. One thing that we found amusing was that the shower head was about 6-7 inches above my head, and I'm 6'3". That hardly ever happens. The fitness room was small. Not much to it. There are two treadmills, one elliptical, one bike, and a set of free weights. It was a means to get our workout done. There are water and towels provided. The hotel restaurant was one of the better reviewed restaurants in the city. Some thing we didn't expect. I was recommended to eat at the Atwood Cafe and upon looking it up, I discovered it was at our hotel. The food was very good. Reservations are recommended. You can make those easily through http://opentable.com. Overall, we had a great trip to Chicago. And we feel this was due in large part to the hotel experience. We would definitely stay at this hotel again. You can't beat the location and service. And if you keep your eyes open for deals, you can stay here for a great price.
