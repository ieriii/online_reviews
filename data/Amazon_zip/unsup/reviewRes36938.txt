When a place has been reviewed over 1000 times, I truly wonder if I have anything to add to the discussion. Maybe I'm just parroting what's already been said, but here's my two cents. Hopleaf is great. They have a four page draught and twenty four page bottled beer menu. What's more, the menus are detailed and descriptive, so beer expert or not you'll find what you're looking for. The Hopleaf business has recently expanded so there is usually sufficient seating. You can also drop by for lunch or dinner. All in all, this is one of the best bars on the North side of town, and not excessively priced for the experience.
