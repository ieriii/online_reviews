This is a great place to go for a special occasion (at least for me, it is too expensive for just a regular night out). They have great mojitos, and the food is delicious and beautifully presented. The space is colorful and festive with a swanky feel. Our desserts were gorgeous, and our waiter was very helpful and patient (my friend has some dietary restrictions, and they were more than happy to double check on ingredients and even make substitutions for her). And did I mention the mojitos?
