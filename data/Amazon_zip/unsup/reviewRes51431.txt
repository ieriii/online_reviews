When you leave, odds are, you will smell like Garcia's. That being said, are you down for burritos the size of your head? Amazing guacamole, salsa, and sour cream like nothing you've ever tasted? Tons and tons of quesadilla cheese, marinated chicken and amazing steak? Fajitas, tacos al pastor, horchatra that I could probably drink myself to death on, and the most amazing margaritas. Sometimes they play mariachi, and sometimes there's so many people, all you hear is the din. All I have to say is, "Yes."
