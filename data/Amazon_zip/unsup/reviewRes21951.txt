We had some good and bad points to the meal. Started off with the guacamole which was excellent, we love it when they supplement the avocado with other stuff too (tomatoes, onions, cilantro), however the "homemade" tortilla chips tasted stale! Seems like they were homemade from a couple of days ago...and there definitely wasn't enough of them! Had the ahodaga with was pork carnitas. It came served in tomato broth which is all wrong. Half the sandwich was soggy! And the carnitas were tender but lacking favor! i think the best part of the sandwich was the pickled onions, very disappointing. I would have preferred the tomato broth as a side to the sandwich, not having the sandwich drenched in it. Also had the pepito which was braised shortribs with carmelized onions, cheese, black beans and if we judged our meal on that dish alone, it would be a 5! It was delicious! Now everyone talks about the hot chocolate so we had the barcelona which was sooo disappointing. It was a good size for what you paid, however i expected a hot chocolate that you find in spain, which tastes like a bar of chocolate melted and is thick and viscous. This was not that at all, instead it tasted grainy and was not super chocolately and watery too. We actually couldn't finish it at the end because it was pretty gross. At least the one sandwich was good...
