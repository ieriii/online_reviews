I stayed here a couple of weeks ago for a conference. The room was very nice, with two bathrooms in the double rooms. The restaurants are pretty good, too. I had breakfast at the buffet, which was good. The bar (Kitty O'Sheas) had much better food than I expected.  The staff is very helpful. Especially the concierge desk, which got me preferred seating at a several really nice restaurants. I just told them what I was in the mood for and they got me all set up. They were much more helpful than many other concierge desks in other hotels.
