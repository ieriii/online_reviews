This is probably my favorite restaurant! The drive from the south suburbs is well worth it, and we've never been disappointed by this place. We always get so much for our money--we typically order two appetizers, soup, two entrees, and sometimes dessert--and our bill is pretty reasonable (and there are ALWAYS tasty leftovers). The staff is very friendly and they always remember us, even if we haven't visited in several months. The best part is that even when you're stuffed, it's not a why-did-I-eat-that stuffed. The food isn't heavy or greasy, and you can actually have a very healthy meal here.
