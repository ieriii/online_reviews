It's not that great, everybody. We sat outside (a plus), had a good appetizer (big plus), ordered a pizza - what else ((meh), had some wine that wasn't really a glass of...(meh), was intimidated by the waiter for an innocent enough question asking if they made there own cheeses (a negative), and got the bill (a negative). It might have been a draw when it first opened, but those days are gone. It's now just another brick-oven pizzeria.  To the Waiter: Oh, and by the way, buffalo milk can be shipped to the USA as easily as the cheese might be and can be made in Chicago. "How do you know", you ask? I checked.
