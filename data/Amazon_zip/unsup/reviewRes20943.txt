Finally tried this place and I have to say, it's great! I'm not a fan of Mexican food but this place really pleased my palate. I'm a vegetarian and the mushroom sandwich (one of the only veggie sandwiches on the menu) was far better than I had expected. I'm confident to even say it was probably the best sandwich I have ever had. The mixture of the cheese and mushrooms was incredible and you can taste the freshness of the ingredients used to make it. I also had a side salad which was simple, yet excellent. For dessert, we kept hearing about how we MUST try the hot chocolate so we did and every drop to the tongue was heaven. It's a small cup but so concentrated that it's even too much for one person to handle. We had it with almond milk (YUM!). Then, finally came the churros. I didn't want any because I HATE churros so my husband bought 3 for $3 and begged me to try a piece. Well, I ended up going back and ordering another 3, they were that incredible. Please don't leave this place without getting at least one and eating it right away when it's hot. Unique dining experience, fantastic, gourmet-Mexican food in a casual setting. A must try in Chicago but expect to wait about 30 minutes on a Fri or Sat.  PS: they do takeout but you can't order in advance, have to come there to place your order and they claim it takes about 10-15 minutes.
