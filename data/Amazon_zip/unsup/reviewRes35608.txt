If I didn't have manners and there was nobody around watching, I'd eat the whole duck MYSELF.  Tips: 1. Make a reservation. Don't be the poor saps waiting at the door observing the duck feast. 2. Order a veggie dish because you'll be waiting a while for that good duck. I recommend SNOW PEA TIPS.  3. SAVOR the first bite of the soft "bread" with the duck inside and make sure to use ALL the complements: pickled radish, green onions, carrots, and sauce. Chew slowly and enjoy! 4. Don't neglect the duck soup! It is so tasty because of the duck bones. The duck fried rice was...too fried. 5. Enjoy the atmosphere. You feel (and you are) in the middle of a huge bustling kitchen.  6. Rejoice in the fact that you can eat DECADENT DUCK for so cheap. A great deal and an amazing find in the city of Chicago! **Thanksgiving special! They can roast your turkey for you (beijing duck style?)**
