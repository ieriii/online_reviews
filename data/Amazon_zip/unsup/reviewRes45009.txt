Good deep dish pizza. Blown away by how filling it is. An associate and i ordered a medium and the honest waiter told us that would be too much food and encouraged us to order a small. We did and there was still one piece left. That honesty was nice. The pizza was great, service was great (and it was right in the middle of dinner), plus the beers were very reasonably priced, especially for this area of Chicago.
