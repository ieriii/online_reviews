So much fun! I've been to many of the top restaurants in Chicago, but this one was one of the best experiences! It's a little bit unorthodox but that's what makes it so good. The dining room is small, there are only a few tables, and you are served by the chef's. They blast rock music from the kitchen as they bring out dishes of some of the best food around. You really get a chance to get into the spirit of things as you banter with the chef's and enjoy your BYOB drinks. Don't forget to bring enough to share! Update: Went back for a second visit. Shouldn't have! I had such a fabulous time the first time that this second visit totally ruined it. Went earlier in the night with a bigger group and the intimacy just wasn't there. Food was still very interesting and fun but just overall didn't have the same je ne sais quoi.
