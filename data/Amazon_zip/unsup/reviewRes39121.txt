There has never been a moment of going to this restaurant that I have not eaten to the point where it hurts. But it hurts so good. Chop chae. Bulgolgi. Marinated chicken. And all those small bowls of complements. You have to do the hibachi barbecue to appreciate the restaurant. And any of the non-barbecue dishes will also please the palate. Whenever I want some good Korean barbecue, San Soon Gab San is where you will find me.
