Yummmmmm!!!! The best pizza ever... Reasonably priced too! Fast delivery & hot pizza! Dude hauled it all the way up to my 4th floor apt... I know he was like wtf?! Haha, the delivery guys are always pleasant tho! The only pizza place I order for delivery from home! Haven't dined in there yet, review to come soon :)
