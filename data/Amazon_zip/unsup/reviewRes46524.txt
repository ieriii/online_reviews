My fiance and I have wanted to try RJ Grunts for a while. We passed by it every day on the bus going to work. We decided that we wanted to finally make our way over there, but before going we had a look at their website. In three different areas on the website there were links to make a reservation. Rather than doing this (as it was a Sunday afternoon) we decided to call. The gentleman that answered seemed amused by our asking if we needed a reservation and invited us to come as there was no wait. Upon arriving about 10 minutes later, we were greeted by a sea of people and a one hour wait time. I explained to the hostess that we had just called, not trying to move ahead in line but to find out why we were blatantly lied to - her response: a shrug of her shoulders and a smug grin. This review has nothing to do with the food, wait staff, cleanliness etc, I'm a firm believer in first impressions and this is just bad business.
