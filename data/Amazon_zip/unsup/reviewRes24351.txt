I'm not sure if we hit a bad night, but of all we ordered, 80% was way over cooked. The bacon wrapped dates, the spicy potatoes, and the pork belly Wes so over cooked and dry, we couldn't finish any of them. My favorite dish we had was the halibut which was cooked nicely and had good flavor. I have to agree with other Yelpers that it was very loud, but the place is beautifully decorated. . We tried the red and white sangria, which were not good enough to order again, so we switched to wine. But the spicy potatoes ( which for me were like bad tater tots) and dry, over cooked dates did this place in for me. We will not be returning.
