I wanted to give this place 4 stars but their new BYOB policy kind of ticked me off. Actually, the new policy isn't what actually did it, it was the 'two' people dining with a bottle of wine and a bottle of champagne which they clearly drank. I was told on the phone of their new policy, but apparently it's not heeded by all staff. I think the new policy should be such that if it's busy we'll ask you to either finish fast or move to the bar area.  That being said, as usual our sushi is pretty good. The apps were good, some hamachi special was DELISH. Our maki were good as always, white dragoon, volcano and spicy crunchy tuna and a couple of others. We got a few of the specials but only one proved to be as good as our usual standard maki.  This is no Mirai sushi, but it's damn good and w/o the liquor bill you come out definitely ahead. I've always had good service here. Nothing to complain about in that area. Our poor waitress was SO nice. I wish I could remember her name. However, one of our diners screwed up the bill and our waitress had to do a lot of voiding and recharging and she was as nice as pie about it. THANK YOU, whoever you are.
