Bonsoiree is a B.Y.O.B. fine dining-ish restaurant that serves an 8 course and 13 course tasting menu for $95 and $150 respectively. The food is part molecular gastronomy (I'm looking at you powdered octopus) and part modern haute cuisine (hello summer squash soup). The menu is updated seasonally and features... wait for it... seasonally appropriate ingredients. Bonsoiree offers significant value for its price in that the food is masterfully prepared, beautifully presented, and the cumulation of the various dishes provides for a satisfying meal. Additionally, the restaurant is attentively B.Y.O.B. (they open your wine and top you off, etc.). More importantly, the food is creative and fun. I ate lobster ice cream, I had a conversation about cilantro gel, and I was pleasantly surprised by a soft boiled quail egg with horseradish. The meal lasted around 2.5 hours for the 8 courses and it never felt tedious or boring. As evidenced in my 5 star endorsement, I would strongly recommend Bonsoiree.
