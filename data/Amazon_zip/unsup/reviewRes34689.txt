I love middle eastern food. Sometimes I eat pounds of tabbouleh salad. Hummus runs through my veins. This is definitely not the best middle eastern food I have ever had. This place has it's hits and misses. Good are the lentil soup and chicken shawarma. Most of the sandwiches are decent and cheap. I find the tabbouleh to be very dry, the hummus meh and Jerusalem salad gross and tasteless. Sultans is middle eastern fast food- cheap, fast and dirty. Yes, it's OK but nothing to rave over. Please, if anyone knows a GREAT middle eastern place let me know.
