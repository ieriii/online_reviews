This place lives up to the hype. I don't think any hot dog is worth a 2 hour wait, but I always go during non-peak hours.The duck fries are good but the hot dogs really steal the show. I love the spicy thai dog. I usually get 2 dogs and skip the fries.I have met some very nice people while waiting in line. It's really an experience at Doug's.Make sure you bring cash. Doug is very nice.
