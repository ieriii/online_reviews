I'm no Chicago deep dish connoisseur (my experience goes as far as Uno's); in fact I was skeptical about all the hullabahoo around this Windy City phenom. As a first time taster and visitor to Chicago, I have to say my mind was fixed on this deep dish for much longer than my one-week stay. ...I'm chasing down the Pi Truck in DC to try and recreate that 30-minute moment of gastronomic bliss.
