Distinctively Chicago.  Located in Uptown...this area was once the main spot in Chicago for watching a live show (in the 30's, 40's)...from that high point to skid row in the 80's and early 90's...but now it's on a slow comeback and through it all, Green Mill has survived.  Sunday night...the Kimberly Gordon Trio is a good night to unwind and hear some classics.
