I went to this restaurant back in July, i know, i should've written a review a long time ago. Anyways, the food was handsdown amazing! However, our server and the manager were super snobby and super rude. Our server got upset with me and my boyfriend and would talk about how much she didnt like us. I'm assuming she thought we didnt understand english very much, but seriously? The manager was also rude. I'm not usually one to complain about things like that, but this was ridiculous. I had never been to a fancy restaurant like this before, and here these uptight employees managed to make me feel like i shouldn't be dining there. But, like i said, the food was what probably saved me from making a scene. I think i would like to go back....but not anytime soon.
