You really have to live in a place like Davenport, Iowa to appreciate an all vegetarian/vegan diner. Seriously, when I lived in Davenport (and even most of the time in Iowa City), I had to rely on appetizers and cheese based entrees or I wasn't eating. The first time I walked into The Chicago Diner, I could hardly handle my excitement because I have never ever been able to just walk into a restaurant and just point at anything on the menu and be able to eat it. That's a great feeling. Anyway, I had the BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger and the sweet potato fries, both of which were delicious. I even had to take half of the burger home because I couldn't finish it in one sitting. My meat-eating boyfriend ordered the Dagwood (I think?) sandwich and he loved it too. Great atmosphere and great music to dine too. Our waitress was super attentive, but it was quiet in there when we went, so I can't say it's always like that. Minus one star for mixing up our beer orders (giving us the wrong brews by the right brewers) and the fact that the menu is pretty much completely faux-meat based. I like faux meat sometimes, but sometimes its too close to the real thing.
