A BYOB with delicious, reasonably priced food in the heart of Chicago? YES PLEASE. Simply great. With an extensive menu, I doubt you can go wrong with anything you order. I called at 7:21pm on a Saturday night to get reservations for two at 8pm that same night. No problem. We got there and since our table wasn't ready yet, the owner, Tuan, is the cutest little man who quickly supplied us with water and two seats while we waited (maybe 5 minutes). We started with steamed chicken dumplings - which were amazing and so fresh. Then I had the beef fried rice which was DELICIOUS and a generous portion. My friend had the beef & asparagus dish, which I volunteered to try and was not let down. A quaint-sized place with a heart of gold. I can't wait to go back.
