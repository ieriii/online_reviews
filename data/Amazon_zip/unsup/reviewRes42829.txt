Appetizer/salad, entree, and one drink will run you about $35-$40 per person, which I thought was a great price for the quality of food we received. I went with a group of 4, and we did not order 1 item we did not thoroughly enjoy. The blue cheese and spinich appetizer was on point, the pastas are fantastic and appear to be homemade, and the ambiance provides a little bit of energy after work. I will definitely be returning.
