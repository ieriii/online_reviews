Went out for a late meal after a night of clubbin, expecting a nice quiet meal. This was my first, and last meal to be had here. My friends and I ordered orecchiette, an individual pizza and spaghetti with clams and mussels. Both bowls of orecchiette were undercooked to the point of being crunchy inside. They were replaced, one made with orecchiette as before and the other made with spaghetti. The spaghetti was as undercooked as the first dish, and the replaced orecchiette bowl was just barely cooked enough to be edible, but now came out being terribly over-salted. So much so that it made the roof of my mouth tender!Instead of comping the entrees in question, they gave a pitiful discount that didn't even cover the cost of the tip. Additionally, aside from the food, the restaurant is small, the wait staff seemingly unhappy and omg...it could not have been any louder in there! In the words of my friend...never again.
