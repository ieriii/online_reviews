A trip to Cuba may be out of the question, but that doesn't mean you'll never indulge in their savory foods! 90 Miles is more than a Cuban restaurant. It's a piece of Cuba! Be sure to take advantage of their specialty foods. The Ropa Vieja platter was ridiculously delicious! Try their empanadas and plantains. Also, this place is BYOB! Bring them rum, and you get Mojitos. Bring them wine, and they make you sangria. Now, tell me that's not fantastic?
