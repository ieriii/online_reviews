i have always enjoyed stopping by shaw's for a few cold beers and some oysters. i always sit at the bar, listen to the cool live jazz music, and tell the barkeep to keep the oysters coming. there is usually a special on certain oysters from 4-6pm when you sit at the bar. also, service is always great at the bar.
