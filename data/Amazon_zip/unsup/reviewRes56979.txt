I had a good meal here recently, but i'm not sure it deserves four stars.1. They only offer 3 salads, which is really weak. The mixed greens, however, was pretty darn good; though my friend thought the dressing was way too tart.2. The pizza takes a long time, but it's good.3. I tried 2 of their beers and didn't care for either one. With the explosion of craft beers, it's easy for the good to stand out from the not-so-good.Decent overall. I'd go back; but wouldn't go out of my way.
