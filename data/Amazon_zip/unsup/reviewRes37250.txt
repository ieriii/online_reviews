Always Loved this place, top notch beer selection makes it hard to decide which one, or two, or three, or four, or five (and so on and so forth) you want to drink. Food is great, although not much of a selection on the menu, maybe 10 different entrees, which are all good......HAM SANDWICH=SECKS in MOUTH DUCK REUBEN=SECKs IN MOUTH. The place is off and on packed with Wrigleyville db's and beer snobs alike, but I choose to ignore customers of the various establishments that I go to, I don't let them bring down my mojo, I focus on whats good in the place, unless the place is totally over run....which at times Hopleaf is over run by db customers, but I digress. This place is a perfect start to your Friday or Saturday evening I highly recommend that EVERYONE that is a beer drinker in or around Chicago, checks this place out
