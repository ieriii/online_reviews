Amazing food and a great beer selection. People call it a beer, oyster, and pork restuarant and all of those are amazing. It's a restaurant for people who love food. Not for people who just like food or are "picky" eaters. It's for people who have adventurous palates and pay close attention to what they're eating. If not, don't spend the money. Part of the menu is set and part is seasonal. I tend to go in a group of at least four people and get a combination of both. The oysters and pork belly are pretty much standard for me and I like to try some of the thigns that aren't always on the menu. The waitstaff knows their stuff and I'd rely on them to choose beer. And, I'd go with beer over wine with dinner there. It is a trendy restaurant and I find I have to try to ignore some of the otehr folks who are there. One can do that most effectively by asking to be seated in one of the stalls. I think they only seat four people. If not, ask to be seated by the window.
