i love this place--for their homemade pasta, the bustling room, and the delicious panna cottas. the wine list is fun, and the staff is very knowledgeable. what i love about anteprima is that the owner is there often enough, and he doesn't parade around like he owns the place--he actually works and helps the staff and serves the guests.  if you're lucky, they'll be serving stuffed zucchini blossoms and you'll get a table on the beautiful back patio. add the pea shoot pasta dish and a quartino of your choice, and you'll know what living is like! UPDATE: i went there last week, after writing this review, and they were serving the wonderful zucchini flowers! my summer is complete!
