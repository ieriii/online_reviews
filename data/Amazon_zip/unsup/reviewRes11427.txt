I dont care about the wait, this place is worth it. I have been to the Bongo Room umpteen times in my life and everytime I wait, the food reminds me of why you wait!!! I've brought multiple sets of people here and the review is the same everytime: incredible. My all time favorite is the white chocolate pretzel pancakes. Wait, hold on, I dont think you heard me correctly. White chocolate pretzel pancakes. Holy nuts Batman. Not only did they taste exactly like they were supposed to, but the portion was enormous. Orange juice is awesome, the bacon is very good, sorry this is the best place in Bucktown/Wicker Park for brunch. Enough said. Boom.
