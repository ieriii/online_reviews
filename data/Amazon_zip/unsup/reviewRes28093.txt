Every dish we had was amazing and done perfectly. All of the appetizers were to die for, my personal favs. Were the buffalo chicken, the tuna, the steak tartar, the gnocchi, actually who am I kidding I loved them all. The lamb was a favorite at our table because 3 out of the five of us ended up ordering the lamb and devouring the whole thing. The wine selection is very interesting and they have some great bottles to compliment the meal. I love the laid back vide which is a great departure from Avenues. I will defiantly be frequenting this restaurant.
