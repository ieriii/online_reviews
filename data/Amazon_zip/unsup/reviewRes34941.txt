Hands down, this is my favorite sushi place in all of Chicago. I have had probably half of the selections on their spring menu, since I discovered this restaurant about 3 or 4 months ago. I like to order sushi on Friday nights and have it delivered, and since finding out about Sushi X, it has become my weekly place. Not only is the sushi really good, but the menu is cool to look at too. Very creative. I am also just now finding out that there used to be a Lakeview location. Not sure how I missed that when I was living over there, but oh well. The current location, at Chicago and Milwaukee Avenues, while not in the heart of Wicker Park, is still in a pretty convenient location (accessible via the Blue Line or the Milwaukee Bus). The only "complaint" I have about the restaurant itself, is that it is so SMALL. I mean, TINY. The dining area, the front counter, and the waiting area, are all in ONE TINY ROOM, slightly larger than my living room. However, what they lack in size, they make up for in interesting vibe and great house music. The interior looks like some cool loft, or maybe something like the interior of the old Biology Bar, for those that are old school. Anyway, like I mentioned above, this is my favorite sushi experience; cannot recommend it enough.
