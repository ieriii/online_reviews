Having heard legends about a hot dog served with foie gras, I went out of my way to stop at Hot Doug's on my way traveling from San Francisco to South Bend to watch my beloved Fighting Irish, and it was worth every minute of CTA discomfort. I ordered both The Dog (standard Chicago-style dog) and the Foie Gras/Duck Sauterne sausage because I'd been so long away from Chicago. BIG MISTAKE. The Foie Gras/Duck Sauterne is an extremely rich sausage, and it was very difficult to keep down after having already devoured a hot dog plus half an order of fries (regular, not duck fat. I'm not a complete idiot). The rich, juicy sausage and its foie gras mousse accompaniment melted into beautiful mess in my mouth that literally made me groan inappropriately with pleasure. Given a choice between sex and that meal, I think the meal would win 6/10 times. I also don't care how gay that sounds. Given the fat and salt content, I'm glad I ordered Coke instead of my usual water. Remember, oil and water don't mix! The place is a little off the public transport path, and it is CASH ONLY, so be prepared. Also, the line is long, so be prepared to spit out your order when you get to the cashier. Unless you need a braille menu or a translator, there's no reason you shouldn't be able to make up your mind by the time the friendly proprietors ask you, "Welcome to Hot Doug's, what would you like today?"  And yes, that guy taking your order is Doug himself.
