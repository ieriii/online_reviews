This is possibly my most ambiguous review ever. Nothing really excited me here, nor did anything turn me off. We had Giordano's. The next day we got some eating tips from a Chicago restaurant insider telling us that Uno's is better. Darn. Not that Giordano's was bad. The pizza was decent. I would've liked a bit more red sauce on my pizza, but otherwise tasty. The wait was long, but shorter than expected. I'll explain: We got there on a Saturday night at about 730. They said the wait was about 1 hour 15 minutes for the 2 of us. But in the end, we were seated at about the 35 minute mark. You order your while you wait for your seat. The pizza itself is said to take about 35 minutes to cook. So if they time things right, you have a hot pizza ready as you are seated. Interesting system. Doesn't really add or detract from the experience. Our service was mediocre too. Not bad. Generally, everything was ok. Nothing notable, for better or worse.
