This review is long overdue.I've been patronizing Mayan for over a year. We found it on yelp last year while looking for a Mexican restauraunt with an outdoor patio. The outdoor patio is small, but its outdoors! Also, from the outside, the location isn't fancy, nor do they have a big fancy sign outside with trendy letters, but don't be dissuaded!We were so pleasantly surprised by how amazing and authentic the food is. I love spicy food and the enchiladas supreme with the green sauce does the trick. I've tried just about everything and its wonderful, but that chicken dish rocks!So, now that I've talked food, lets get to the important stuff---MARGARITAS! I've had them everywhere---including Mexico and I can't even find the appropriate adjective to describe how delicious these are. They offer a wonderful variety of flavors and you can upgrade tequilas if you choose. Now what's the best part? Tuesday and Thursday---Margaritas are HALF PRICE!! Half Price for a FANTASTIC margarita? That really can't be beat...we are in a bad economy, people....use your money wisely...go to Mayan!The staff is friendly and accomodating...Its the one place in Chicago I consistently over-tip...they are great!!
