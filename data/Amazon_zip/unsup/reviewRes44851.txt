Started with the chop salad, which was fine. Then had the sausage, pepper, mushroom deep dish pizza. It was just so-so. I expected it to be more flavorful (it's VERY rare for me to say a restaurant serves food that isn't flavorful enough, usually it's the opposite problem). With so many other deep dish pizza options in Chicago, I'd definitely try another place first before coming here.
