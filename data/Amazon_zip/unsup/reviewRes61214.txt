This Garcia's location is closer to home, so we decided to give it a try. It quickly became part of the "regular rotation". We really enjoy the food and the drinks, as the margaritas are some of the strongest we've had.Typically get tacos (chorizo or al pastor) or tostadas. They have been great everytime. Also, in my opinion, the cadillac margaritas are worth it ... stronger and not as sweet! One knock is the salt on the margaritas glasses; it's a little too fine for my liking (seems like table salt).Otherwise, we enjoy the food, the low-key atmosphere and will continue going back regularly.
