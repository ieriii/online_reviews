When looking at the price of this hotel as well as the LOCATION it is AMAZING! The red line is right down the street and you can basically get to many different places in chicago from this hotel. It is definitely a plus. The staff is super friendly (except for the people on strike outside...but whatever haha!) I am not giving 5 stars based on the quality of the rooms that they have. They are very worn down and the hallways are extremely creepy. BUT you get what you pay for so it wasn't a big deal. My friends and I were staying here for only one night so we didn't mind it at all. I would NOT recommend staying there much longer just because it really isn't that nice of a place and when I woke the next morning I was ready to get out of there. If this place is in fact haunted we didn't have any issues with the ghosts that reside here haha. So I really wouldn't worry about it. Stay here if you need a cheap, one night stay...really not much longer...
