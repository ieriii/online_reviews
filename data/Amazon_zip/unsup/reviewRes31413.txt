Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm everything is so so good!! I've been back 7 or 8 times. Great cocktails, amazing food, service totally on point! Gotta get the dungeness crab appetizer! So delicious!  Only bad thing I can think of is the music selection in the bar area. So weird.. it just doesn't fit the scene and ambiance. When there is live entertainment, it's all good. It's the mix of Def Leopard, Whitney Houston, Huey Lewis, Cindy Lauper, 80s and 90s tunes you don't want to hear at a classy spot like Mastro's.
