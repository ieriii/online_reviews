Had a delicious dinner here with my boyfriend. We sat in the back room which faces out onto a lovely courtyard. The atmosphere was very romantic and the food was delicious. We each opted for an appetizer and entree. I started with the grilled calamari and shrimp which was very good. My boyfriend loved his burrata and prosciutio. I had the farro pasta with mushrooms and asparagus. Superb. My boyfriend had the pasta of the day - a delicious pasta with mushrooms and shaved truffles. Highly recommend for date night.
