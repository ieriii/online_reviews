1) couldn't get in the front door for all the people mistaking the front steps for their own home front porch 'hang out' 2) got chewed out for seating ourselves - when we went to the only door we could actually enter the establishment 3) placed an order for an appetizer in a specific size - did NOT get what I ordered, instead being served the smaller serving. Yes, I got charged for the smaller size, but that was not what I ordered. Nor was it explained why they made the decision as to why I didn't "need" the large - instead serving me the small. Further, I had to get my own utensils - none were on the table, and none were provided at the time my order was served. 4) No signage directing people as to getting into the eatery - nor were people discouraged from using the front step as a hang out spot 5)In leaving, you have to traipse THROUGH THE KITCHEN!!!.... walk through the tightly packed with tables dining area ... and climb over the people still hanging out on the front steps! Yes, what I ordered was tasty - even though it was vegan, albeit entirely too salty -- I don't blame the eatery -- most places serving food are heavy handed with the salt.
