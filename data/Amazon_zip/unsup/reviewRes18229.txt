Overpriced bar. I know, its a "gastropub". They're really trying here! You can tell! Attach a fancy name to it and double the price! Oh-la-la I would WILL give them the fact that their burgers are great and comparable to Kuma's. Don't bother ordering Truffle fries because you won't taste the difference and ours were horribly burnt. With plenty of places in the area with exceptional burgers, I'd pass on this joint.
