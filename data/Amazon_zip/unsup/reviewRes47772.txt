This place is king when it comes to the "all-you-can-eat" steak houses downtown. It's not for everyone: vegetarians and light eaters mostly. Anyway the harvest table is MUCH BETTER THAN THE SALAD BARS AT fogo de chao and brazzaz. It's just not even comparable. Here the "salad bar" consists of salads, soups, meats, cheeses, fresh veggies and pastas. Additionally the place has poultry, not just steak!!! Fish, chicken and steak in an all you can eat fashion? Can it get better? I doubt it. Just as a warning for those who would hate on a place for being trendy: it's pretty damn trendy and swanky. The up side is that the service is great. For icing on the cake they have really good drinks and a patio on the roof for the summer. Try a martini before eating your heart out.
