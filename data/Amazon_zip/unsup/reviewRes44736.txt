This was my first time in Chicago, so OF COURSE I had to try deep dish. I'd asked a bunch of Chicago-ans about their favorite places to eat earlier and had sparked an INTENSE debate about which pizza place was best, but this place seemed to have the most votes. I actually stumbled here on accident after touring Northwestern Law, but I'm glad I did! It was just me, so I ordered an individual sausage deep dish and added some spinach (about 7 or 8 bucks IIRC). It was INTENSE. Soooo delicious. I am a BIG fan of cheese and I loved that when they served it, it was all still melty and stretchy and stringy, and the spinach and sausage were plentiful enough that I didn't feel cheated. My favorite part, however, was the crust. It wasn't hard or anything--it was delicious, almost sort of flaky, soft on the inside and slightly crisp on the outside. At some points it reminded me of pot pie, in that it was a little more cakey than I'm used to (again, first time eating deep dish so I'm comparing to shitty pizza places).
