We went for dinner last Thursday night. Beautiful night, nice outdoor seating, but WAY too crowded. They pack far too many tables outside and you can't even move. My husband was sitting on the outside of our small round table and the hostess kept asking him to stand up and move while she seated people. This happened about 15 times during dinner... such a joke!! And on top of it, she was SO rude about it. We talked to the manager about it and he just said"sorry." No offer for a free dessert, nothing. The food was only ok, and some of the entrees were actually tasteless. The gnocci is actually the worst I have ever had!  We will NEVER go back. Such a shame... this place does not live up to all its hype.
