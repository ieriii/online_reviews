I love buffalo wings in general, but this place adds an asian spin on the sauces and, dang, the wings are GIGANTIC!!!! Who else can beat that?! I would love to see someone order the whole "bird" at Crisp! :O They also offer bimbimbop and some other sandwiches stuff, but WHY would you order those when their wings are sooooooo finger-lickingly good? :D
