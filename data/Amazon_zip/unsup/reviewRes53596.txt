I was part of a party of 4 for Friday, December 16. Two of the people in the group had birthdays that week, so we were there for their birthday dinner. We picked up some nice wine and found a parking spot right across the street, only to find out when we got there that they decided to close for the evening. No phone call, no one waiting at the door, just a hand-written sign on the front of the door.Now I know that stuff happens. And I know that this place is notorious for canceling reservations and being generally tough to get a reservation to begin with. However, not even bothering to call to let you know that your reservation has been canceled is inexcusable! I mean, the place is small, so how hard would it be to call the dozen or so parties you have booked for that night? A phone call in advance, while disappointing to receive, would at least have given us a chance to figure out an alternative with time to spare. Instead, we returned to our car and got on Open Table just to find a place that had an opening at 9 pm on a Friday night. And the sign on the door said they would make it up to us. How, exactly? We still haven't got a phone call asking if we'd like to reschedule. And considering how it took 12 times calling them to set the initial reservation, calling them now probably wouldn't get us anywhere.Based on the other reviews on here and word of mouth, I would love to delete this review and write one based on the food itself. However, since we weren't able to try the food, I will have to wait to do that. Until then, 1 star is too generous for a place that cancels your reservation and doesn't even bother to call you in advance.
