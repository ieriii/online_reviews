Well...a good breakfast place that is close to where we live, but nothing too memorable. You know when you get a 4-6 page menu that no one thing is going to be amazing. I had what was billed to be Chicago's Best Eggs Benedict which was good, but certainly there has to be better in this city. It was fairly bland. My wife had Eggs Benedict with Chorizo and had to search through the chorizo to find the eggs. Not a bad thing, but still nothing too memorable. The coffee was good, but it could have been from Dunkin' Donuts. All in all, good but not great.
