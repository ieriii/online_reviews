I am visiting from San Francisco and decided to have breakfast here. MISTAKE. I ordered an orange juice, two eggs over easy, potatoes, toast, and sausages. The orange juice was great but then things started to go down hill. My eggs came sunny side up. I'm traveling and in a good mood so what the hell I'm eating sunny side up eggs today. I did think to myself how a place called YOLK would not know how over easy yolks look but what the hell. The little red potatoes were not completely cooked and sorry fanboys but raw potatoes just doesn't do it for me. The sausage was big, fat, and bland. Finally the toast or in my case a slice of bread (that I don't believe was fresh) without any indication of being toasted. All this for only $13 plus tip! What a steal. Needless to say I barely ate my meal and I will not be going back so a small price to pay to diet that morning.
