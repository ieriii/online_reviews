Stopped by sober while on the first leg of a Nacho tour me and some friends planned out. Heard about the Chachos by word of mouth on Yelp. I wish someone had also mentioned that there are 3 La Pasadita's here.. not sure if it's all the same or three different restaurants? Luckily they'll tell you if your in the wrong place. Chachos! Take out or sit down and a lady will come round for your order. Three amigos we came for the Chachos; shared and three beverages. I tried non-alcoholic Sangria for the first time, not bad, since most people don't bother much or look around one could get away with bringing a flask & adding something to their sangria. Each table is given chips and fresh made salsa, it's got freshly diced salsa veggies and it's got a bit of a kick. Two sauces on the table in squeeze bottles although neither are hot or spicy, just levels of bland. We got chachos with steak. 2 out of 3 dug them and the other thought the meat was too tough and needed its own seasoning for more flavor. There was plenty of steak diced and spread all over, almost every chip had a few pieces on it. I wish there could have been more guacamole and sour cream spread over more of the area. And no jalapenos!? That with some cholula or alt hot sauce would've made it banging. I gotta remember to bring my own next time. Chachos are good. Next time I hope I can dine with some more explorers, the menu shows some juicy meaty items that I'd like to share and try. Those meaty platters run $20 - $30 a plate. Conveniences: Washrooms and Internet jukebox.
