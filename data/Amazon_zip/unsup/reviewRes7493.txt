Holy pulled pork, Batman! This place is legit, lemme tell you...and I should know, I'm a good ol' southern boy from North Carolina relocated to the big city of Chicago. I'm so glad my girlfriend found this place and brought me here for my birthday. It was the best present ever. Everything from the sweet tea to the slaw to the hush puppies (ask for the honey butter!) to the meats and sauces is out of this world. Here's a tip...indulge in multiple plates, meaning don't order a huge hunk of meat (ribs, sandwich, etc) as your meal - there's so much good stuff it's better to sample a lot of different things rather than over-indulge in just one meat. We ordered a lot of "sides," along with the mac'n'cheese and spicy bread-and-butter pickles (I don't even like b-n-b pickles, but these were delicious). Then the 3-meat sampler came...bbq chicken, pulled pork (my favorite) and kobe rib meat...and it even came with 3 difference sauces. Our server was so attentive and so kind - my girlfriend mentioned it was my birthday and we declined to order dessert (on purpose b/c we were already so full) but the server brought me a piece of carrot cake anyway, with a candle on top. It was no doubt the best meal I've had in Chicago thus far. Q it up at Chicago Q!
