I went to Uncommon Grounds after reading up on them and their green roof garden and local products. It was a mixed pot. The atmosphere was very warm and inviting and loved that they were allowing artists to present and sell their items there. We got there a little early for dinner so ordered drinks and waited for the dinner menu to begin. I ordered a hazelnut latte that was supposed to have chopped hazelnuts atop it with a hit of syrup. It was served to me in a bowl- it was very awkward to handle and huge! I am a barista at a great place in city and was very disappointed in the latte. I expected better. The espresso tasted overpulled, the amount of syrup was overpowering, it was luke warm at best and no hazelnuts on top. The beer we ordered was great though. For dinner I had a bowl of vegetarian chili-which was rich with flavor and had a nice subtle heat to it. I also ordered the fried potato ravioli for an appetizer. I had never heard of a potato slice as a ravioli wrapper but it was ingenious. I loved the pickled cauiliflower served with it! My bf and I shared a banana bread pudding for desert. Moist with a nice creme anglaise but the bread tasted as if it was dunked in butter before serving. A bit too rich in that sense but the banana chocolate composition was great. Overall good time. Maybe change the latte size to a normal 12 oz cup with a handle..no one needs 24+ ounces of a sweetened drink and if they do they can visit a 7-11 for a big gulp. Also, kind of overpriced
