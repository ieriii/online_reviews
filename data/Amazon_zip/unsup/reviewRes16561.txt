Best Indian food in the city. Hands down. This is the most authentically-flavored, lovingly-prepared Indian food in all of Chicago, imho. Reasonably priced for the quality (and quantity). Very good table service. Get the thali. So much excellent food and you will have enough leftovers for two more meals. But really - it's not about the quantity -- it's that these dishes are prepared with real care.
