This place is a fantastic BYOB. Inexpensive, tasty and the service is excellent as well. We went for a birthday party on a Friday night and did have to wait for a table for a little bit, but with BYOB's that is to be expected. While we waited the owner brought us water and three different appetizers for free. He was doing it for everyone who had to wait for a table. I mean that's just awesome. The food is delicious and they have a wide variety of meat options from beef to chicken to fish, not to mention a healthy selection of vegetarian options as well. Simply it is just simply awesome.
