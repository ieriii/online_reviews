Piece is the jam. Good east coast style pies. Also please note that this is not just New Haven style pizza, this is straight up BAR in New Haven but in Chicago. Too bad BAR has High on Fire play there and this place has cheesy reggae bands. I grew up about 25 minutes from the real place this copies off of, so I have a little pride in reading their menu. I hate most of the people in here usually and want to punch myself in the head, but you can't screw with the Sunday take out special. Growlers are the best. And now I live in the delivery zone which rules. Some of their brews are really good, some are just regular good beer which is still commendable. Mashed Potato pizza, White with kalamata & artichoke hearts, I could go on for days. Great beers, great pizza. Deep dish can go kill itself.
