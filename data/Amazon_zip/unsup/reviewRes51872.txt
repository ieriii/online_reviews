Yum! This was my first Chicago deep dish and it didnt disappoint! We ordered spinach mozzarella sticks and a small bacon cheeseburger pizza. So much food! The 2 of us barely put a dent in it. Being from TN, I think Chicago style pizza is more like a casserole. Also loved the atmosphere, graffiti on the walls...urban hip :)
