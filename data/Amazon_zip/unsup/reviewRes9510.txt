Le Colonial is very special for a two big reasons: First, the exotic atmosphere - The restaurant is beautifully and uniquely decorated and always strikes me with an "I've just left Chicago" type feeling. Think dark wood and white linens accented with big green plants, orchids, candlelight--very romantic. There are two levels. The upstairs is a little more romantic, and quieter. Downstairs is better for larger groups. Secondly, the amazing cocktails - The cocktails here are some of the best I've had in the city. My favorite is the Guava Daiquiri-wow! They are made from scratch and definitely strong enough to justify the $10+ price tag. The bar is found upstairs and is a quiet, private place to grab a quick but delicious drink before dinner - no matter where you have reservations. The food is good - great even. Interesting and exotic without including ingredients you've never heard of. I always order seafood and haven't been disappointed! The wine list has something for everyone and the staff has always been reliable for recommendations. The entrees prices are slightly higher than I'd expect for this type of food but I happily pay every time - just consider it an up charge for the gorgeous surroundings. Overall - a fabulous place for a date or an elegant group outing.
