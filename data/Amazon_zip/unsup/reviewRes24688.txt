If a French vampire opened a speakeasy, this is what it would look like...dark and sexy with a hint of the forbidden.  What should be forbidden is the hours of pleasure I derived from fun-doing their premium dinner. I've had swiss cheese fondue before, but their gruyere was delectable. It actually tasted like gourmet cheese whiz, and that's a good thing. Their lobster and beef tenderloin were memorable, due in part to our cooking skills, but also to the myriad of sauces that came with the entrees....8.....the new lucky number.  And the chocolate fondue...well...luck may be a lady, but so is chocolate and my heart melted in that fondue pot along with my gooey roasted marshmallows and strawberries. Good wine list, good company, laissez les bon temps rouler! p.s. Wait for the booth.
