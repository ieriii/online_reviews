My boyfriend and I did not have a good experience here at all. The service was slow and extremely unfriendly almost rude(like they did not want us there). I found the food to be typical American Italian and boring. My salad was totally overdressed and the rissoto was not cooked the way rissoto should be. My boyfriends pasta had way too much sauce and the pasta was totally overcooked. We will not be coming back. The staff should be ashamed!
