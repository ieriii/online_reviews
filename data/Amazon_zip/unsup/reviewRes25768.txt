Their aren't that many original pizza joints anymore, even in a pizza mecca like Chicago, but Pequod's is one. They take deep dish to the next level with their carmelized crust baked in the cast iron pizza pan. I've been to many of Chicago's pizza joints and most of them are great, but this one really stands out above the rest. BTW they got my 5 stars soley based on the flavor of the Pizza... it is that good. The service in the place is decent, but nothing special. Sort of as you would expect at a pizza place. However, the pizza never dissapoints. If you haven't been here you have to go. You have no right to call yourself a pizza connoisseur until you do!
