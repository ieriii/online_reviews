I liked this place but I was not crazy about it. I went with a few friends on a Tuesday afternoon...it was not busy but the weight for our food was still about 15-20 minutes. The pesto pasta was very very tasty, and very very bad for me! Chuck full O'cheese and pine nuts...you should try it! The Roast Beef Sandwich I had was just alright...there was really no taste to it....I would skip it. I was also a little disappointed with the dessert selections. Oh and be careful with the water glasses...the first one I picked was covered in lip gloss and the second one was dirty as well. The workers were friendly though!
