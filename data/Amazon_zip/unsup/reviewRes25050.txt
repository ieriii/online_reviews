I've been to Mercat twice now and enjoyed both times. The location is really nice - huge windows overlooking Michigan Avenue/the park - great place to celebrate a birthday or special occasion. The hosts/hostesses are incredibly friendly. As far as food goes, I've tried a lot of different dishes and have a few favorites - the rabbit ravioli, the duck, the chef's selection of cheeses, and the slow roasted pork. Everything is really, really good. They have a great wine list and some really cool drinks - I tried a vanilla pear-infused vodka martini that was delicious. Next time I want to try the chef's menu, which seems like a good idea if you're unsure of what to order/want a sample of many things.
