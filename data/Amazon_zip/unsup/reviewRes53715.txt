Today I came in and met Doug, who I presume to be an owner or at least a half-owner. I start my review by saying this because I think it's significant; your first impression of Crisp will be that it's a trendy type of place but is run by a very down-to-earth owner. He will ask you for your name and then for your order.I came in for the chicken wings, which were delicious. They're fried and covered in several sauces. Out of the sauces I had, the Seoul Sassy was tasty and on the milder side, while the Crisp BBQ was a lot spicier and bolder. The latter had much of the same spicy flavor you would find in kimchi (without the fermented taste, of course), but also had a sweet component like a BBQ sauce. I may have liked them a bit spicier, even, to balance out the sweet, but I think fans of BBQ wings will like these a lot. My fries were a little soggy by the time they got to my place, but that's just what happens to fried foods in transit. All in all, really great wings with inventive sauces. You can have a half or whole chicken done this way too.I think what Crisp has done well is pander to the crowd without losing its roots. The food is definitely Am-Asian, but the flavors which are put into their burritos and wings are those which are very reminiscnet of a typical Korean meal (at least from what I've had of that cuisine.) You can even get a bibimbap bowl (there called a 'buddha bowl') with their own twist.The combo of trendy modern with down-to-earth people and of traditional Korean flavors with familiar American cuisine is why this restaurant is such a success. The food is unique and different, yet still comforting. If you're in the area, this is a place to check out, especially if you're tired of eating pre-frozen wings in soul-less sports bars.
