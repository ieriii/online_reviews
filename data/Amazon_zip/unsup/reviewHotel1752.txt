I must say that I like the style of this boutique hotel! It is located right in the Loop and has a very different feel to it than other hotels in the area. In the lobby you'll see red velvet couches and a bunch of other really funky pieces. The rooms are adorable- the room I saw was pink/brown and was so cute! The ballroom is also very nice- they have the most gorgeous chandeliers in the ballroom and it would be such a pretty place for a wedding!
