What can I say about Mastro's in Chicago that I haven't said yet about the Mastro's I've been to on the West Coast.  Really, nothing. This place is still my favorite steakhouse, as their meat is top quality and they cook the steaks perfectly. Seasoned with a bit of salt and garnish on a burning hot plate. The scallops, oysters, and sides here are great. Get the lobster mashed if you want to splurge (amazing). Otherwise, get the bread, a steak, and some vegetables.  Steaks are about $45-50/pp, sides $10, appetizers $15-20. Without alcohol, be prepared to spend about $100/pp with tip and Chicago's ridiculous tax.
