Updating as I've had more experiences at Carnivale than just restaurant week...... The skirt steak is to die for - a must order and something I will come back for more than once. The "Pollo" chicken dish (Peruvian style chicken) was a bit disappointing (not the flavorful latin spices my boyfriend was looking for, and I agreed)- I'd find something else on the menu if I were you. If you are DYING for chicken, I'd advise you to try the other chicken dish on the menu ("Pollo Estilo Billy"). The Ropa Vieja appetizer is the perfect start to your meal - sweet plaintains topped with shredded braised beef..... out of this world good. Nice appetizer portion size as well - 4 little plantain & beef "stacks". The service has always been impeccable and you can't beat the $5 valet...... the elusive 5th star is missing because I still seem to be searching for the *great* cocktail at Carnivale. The coconut mojito is pretty blah, the Victoria's Secret tastes like the kool aid my brother and I made when we were young (i.e. we added 3x the recommended amount of sugar to the kool aid mix). I'm sure there is something on their extensive cocktail list that will wow me, but I just haven't managed to order it yet.
