Hopleaf is a breath of fresh air. It is what a bar should be. Everyone has mentioned the extensive beer selection, rightfully so. However, I enjoy going to Hopleaf because it is a purist bar. There are no TVs. If you haven't been to a bar without a TV recently, do it. Enjoy a conversation with your friends. Set the TIVO for sportscenter and go to Hopleaf for a great time.
