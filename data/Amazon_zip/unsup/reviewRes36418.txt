I heard about indie awhile ago but went back and forth with going because word on the street was that it was BYOB and then it wasn't and then it was...so I finally checked it out and it is indeed BYOB! Phew. For appetizers I went with the fresh spring roll and golden triangle (tofu tempura with sweet n' sour sauce). Both were awesome. The spring roll in particular was fresh and stuffed with different vegetables. Totally enjoyed it. The golden triangles were pretty wild. For my entree I went with the vegetable delight and to be honest? Not really all that. It was tofu, broccoli, carrots, mushrooms, and peas. The food wasn't bad but the sauce was awful. No flavor whatsoever! On top of that, there was a lump of white rice. I'm turning into a hater of white rice. Can't stand it! Towards the end of the night, it felt like we were being rushed. We had half a bottle of wine left and the servers (multiple) kept coming back to see if we put our money down. Constantly. Now, I used to be a server so I know how frustrating it can be, but the place wasn't closing anytime soon and we had plenty of wine left over. Anyway, no big deal I guess. Loved the atmosphere and music of the place. Chill and relaxed. Enjoyed it. Would I run back? No. Check it out? Why not, it's in the neighborhood.
