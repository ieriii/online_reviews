It's ok food. I had mole enchiladas and the mole was ok. My husband had a steak meal and that was just ok. I'm a fan of Rick Bayless and admire his ability to enhance Mexican cuisine, but I just went on a really busy night. I won't visit again as I would prefer to eat at Sol de Mexico...the food there taste like Rick himself cooked personally for you. I gave them 4 stars since they surprised us with a dessert platter in celebration of our anniversary. That was very unexpected and the dessert was delicious.
