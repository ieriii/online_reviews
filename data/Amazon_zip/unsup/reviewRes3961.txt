If you are expecting a traditional Michelin Star restaurant experience, then Schwa is definitely not your place. Schwa is the most bizarre restaurant experience I have ever had. I went into Schwa expecting a wild ride, and they did not disappoint! The staff at Schwa is extremely nice and accommodating. Chef Carlson is one heck of a cool guy! And what's not to like about his story (article in GQ). The dinning experience started great. The chefs were attentive and courses were coming out at a good pace. It was about half way through the meal however that things became a tad bizarre. The music got turned up. There were 20 minute lags between courses where guests were invited into the kitchen to throw knifes, drink shots with the chefs, and socialize. Two hours into the meal, it was apparent that the staff was completely smashed which probably accounted for the inconsistencies. But this is Schwa's persona, they don't care. They know this, the public knows this, and yet Schwa is one of the hardest places in Chicago to get a reservation. Kudos to Schwa! Bizarre and surprisingly fun experience and all, I didn't think on that particular night the food at Schwa rivaled that of other Michelin Star restaurants in Chicago. Out of the approximate 14 courses, some were excellent while others disappointed.  Despite all its praise, the quail egg ravioli was salty and didn't compete with Alinea's black truffle explosion like I had hoped. The chefs were intoxicated so maybe that had something to do with it, but I didn't feel that Schwa's food stood out as one of the better restaurants in Chicago. I am optimistic and will be back.
