Wonderful food; wonderful service. Sign on the building proclaims "World's Best Crab Cakes!" I don't know about the whole world but they are fabulous! Funny note: sign on the building also proclaims "Breakfast all day!" but it means with the exception of breakfast time. They don't open until 11:00 a.m. ;-)
