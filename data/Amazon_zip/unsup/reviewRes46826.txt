Decided to stop here for dinner last Saturday and we arrived just in time to be seated at the bar when a few people were leaving. There was a three course dinner special for 30.00 and it was a great deal! I started with a Ginger martini that was made with house infused organic vodka and ginger...this drink was amazing and was absolutely delicious. Started with mussels and fresh cut fries, I wanted to hug the chef for this because having two of my favorite things unconventionally put together was a great birthday treat! Bacon wrapped meatloaf...I really don't need to say anything except I woke up the next day and had the left over portion(yes it was big) for breakfast. I don't recall ever doing that in my life...I wanted to eat it when I got home and I was not even hungry, it was just that damn good. Oh and dessert...had no room but took a few bites of the carrot cake with a healthy scoop of vanilla ice cream on top. It was not your typical carrot cake, more of a cupcake with a delicious sugary coating on the outside. This was not my first trip here and won't be my last...delicious and great service at the bar.
