I was completely blown away by the whole experience at Nana's for lunch. Walking into this brand new place, with coffee bar, open kitchen and one whole wall of windows gives a fantastic first impression.  Service is very friendly - Holly, our waitress was on top of everything and knowledgeable. Since it only opened Monday, they still had only their breakfast menu, but what a menu! We started off with a fresh carrot juice for me and a carrot/orange juice for him. I wanted to eat light, and not sweet (no pancakes or waffles), so we both chose savory crepes, mine with melted cheese, his without. Topping this with a little hot sauce made it the best I've ever eaten! As a side dish, we split the vegetarian black beans, which were a perfect topping and complement to the crepes. I'm a bit of an espresso snob (read Intelligentsia, fresh ground every morning, made by me), so I wondered what they could do. I tested their barista with a single espresso. It came out excellent; a nice small draw with good head. First time I've had Metropolis beans, and will be sure to compare them against my usual in a taste test! Topping it off was meeting Omar, one of the family business' owners, who proudly told me he actually grew up in the building. They have event space and will ultimately do catering as well. I saw mom and his brother, and his extended "family". Clearly a great start to what I am sure will become a successful local business.
