Oh how brunch is really my favorite meal of the day and week-end!!! I am happy to wait 45 minutes for their succulent eggs! Be prepared to wait - I won't mislead anyone here but promise that the food is sooo worth it. I love their California Omlette and Hot Ricky Omlette. It is a great place to come with friends. Love that they give you flavored creams - hey it's a nice touch. This is one of my favorite breakfast places due to the amount of choices they offer.
