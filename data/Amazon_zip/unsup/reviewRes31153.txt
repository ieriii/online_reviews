I'm a steak snob. And to be honest, this is probably the worst steak I've had so far in Chicago- but I still give it 3 stars. I've had better at David Burke's and Gibson's, and honestly the best steak I've had here was at Keefer's. So you can see the scale I'm using for comparison. I went there last night which was a Monday. I tried to get a reservation, but they were booked so I called and got a table in the lounge area. I wasn't that pleased with that location as I wanted to do some work while I was eating but I took it. It was ok, there's a piano player who sings and the music can be quite loud at times. The ambiance is pretty typical of a true steakhouse- lack of light and packed full of people. I started with the lobster bisque which really surprised me, it was really good. I would have preferred it a bit thicker, but it was really nice. My steak was definitely the disappointment of the meal. I ordered the 12oz filet. It was big and it was cooked well but somehow it was just bland and lacking flavor. There really wasn't much of a sear on it and I prefer to taste a bit more of the grill and seasoning if you catch my drift. The lobster mash potatoes were ok. Apparently this is a signature dish there but it was a little too rich for me. I shared the berries plate (which is huge, definitely for 2-3 people to share) and it was fantastic. I'm not opposed to eating here again, but I would probably suggest another steakhouse first.
