Quite good! I like how inventive they are with their different crepe offerings. The one I had was filled with cinnamon, brown sugar, and gold and red raisins. Yum, yum, yum! I'd definitely eat here again and try something else. The atmosphere is intimate and the restaurant is quite beautiful. I'd recommend for a day or evening date.
