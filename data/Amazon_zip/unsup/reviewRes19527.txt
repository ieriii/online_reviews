Mmm hmm. I'm a Baylexican now. The fiancee & I rolled in here at about 2:30 p.m. and ate our faces off.  Oh yeah. Between the two of us, we ate a huge mass of chips and guac, a jamon torta (melts. in. your. mouth.) and a gunthrop chicken torta (the pickled white onions on it taste like lime - awesome!), and a churro dipped in chocolate.  My fiancee told me I was nuts for wanting to order the fresh-ground chocolate (hot beverage) on a 90 degree day, so I ordered the "agua del dia" - in this case, pineapple cucumber lime. The boy was right. I love chocolate and will definitely go back for some, but MAN was this stuff amazing. I went back for a second. I could have gone back for a third. It had me considering a juicer three sips in, seriously. Magic agua! Plus two Bayless sightings. Hi Rick! I'll be back when it's cool enough to drink the warm stuff like a good Baylexican.
