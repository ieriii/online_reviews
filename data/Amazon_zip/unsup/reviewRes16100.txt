Nowhere near the league of Bourbon and Branch. Don't be fooled by the ultra hip, incognito entrance and blue-gray, minimalist decor, the mixology is limited in scope unlike my favorite SF and NYC cocktail bars. These drinks were way too sweet!! And the bartender, a very young, but polite hipster, took forever to serve us. I still like the place, and the staff, but please, violet hour, offer some cocktails that are not sickly sweet!
