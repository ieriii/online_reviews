Celebrated my Birthday last night with my Family. The staff could not have been nicer. We started with the eggplant spread and saganaki. Beyond fantastic. The spread was served with pita bread. We all hummed when we tasted it. Also had the vegetable soup and village salad, both gave me the chills. Thoughts of soup, salad and the homemade bread during the winter months, this is the place. I had the short rib goulash, fantastic, family had sausage stuffed chicken thigh, amazing, Chicken schnitzel, more than one person could eat and so tasty,Paprikash, which was so tasty my husband almost ate too fast before all of us to taste. The staff make special chicken nuggets for my granddaughters with fresh fries. You could tell she just cut up a fresh potato just for them. Desert was apple strudel and crepes with apricot and strawberry. Special ice cream for my girls. We all agree this place will have our business in the future. Loved it!!!!!
