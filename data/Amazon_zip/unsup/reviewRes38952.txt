Big menu of Italian American standards served in a very old-school setting. Sound track could be from a Godfather movie, decor could be from Sopranos. Service was very friendly. Food-wise, the baked gnocchi was a real standout. Pizza was good, probably would have been better if I didn't order a garbage (combination) pie. Prices look a little high at first, but the portions are really large so it works out to be a good deal. All but one of our group took home enough food for a second meal.
