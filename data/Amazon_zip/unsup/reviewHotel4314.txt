The lobby deserves a 5, but the rooms have a Hilton feel to them. I loved hanging out in the lobby with a drink (and scoring the only wifi I could get). Service was really good tho once they forgot about my order and, to apologize, brought me a free glass of wine as well as a little snack, and the manager came out to apologize. I wasn't even upset, I just reminded them that they didn't bring my order.  My room was quiet and well-appointed with a large closet, but the lobby looms large in my memories.
