The food is very good. Not a ton of variety, but the burger sand sandwiches are all outstanding. They have the now obligatory large selection of microbrews - really, there are that many beer snobs out there? - and their staff seems to know their stuff. The seating in the booths along the wall is less than comfortable - they're too shallow front to back. The placement of the TVs is a bit awkward if you're sitting at the bar - a light often hangs in the way. They have great service and the food is fairly priced. The only downside to this place is the weekend crowd/noise level.  Like many places in the area, it seems to draw a lot of d-bags from one or two miles south on Lincoln on the weekends. And they cannot resist the urge to keep cranking the stereo until it is all but impossible to communicate in there. Too much hip, not enough chill on those days. But on the week days, it's a nice place to spend time.
