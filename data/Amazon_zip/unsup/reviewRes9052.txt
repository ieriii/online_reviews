Got a big group of coworkers to go there for lunch - I've been spouting off how great the lamb kabob is there so they had to try it out. I think there were 13 of us. 9 of them got the lamb kabob lunch special with dill rice. The waitress even joked that we were all getting the same order. Well, we ordered "correctly" -- every single person who got the lamb kabob plate not only raved about it but asked when we could go back and get some more.
