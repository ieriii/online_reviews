I went to Sunda while on a business trip. The concierge at my hotel had recommended it. The restaurant had a great trendy vibe and since I was alone I sat at the sushi bar and watched the guys make the sushi rolls which was interesting. My waiter was very helpful in giving recommendations of what to order and very knowledgeable about the dishes. I ordered the Bang bang salad (raw ribbons of shaved green papaya, carrots, zucchini, chayote and jicama, tossed in a citrus chili dressing with toasted peanuts and coriander) which was huge and really yummy!  I also ordered the Firecracker roll. The highlight of this roll was that it was served with side of what was essentially guacamole which made be laugh but it really worked well with the roll. I'm from Texas and I love guacamole so this was a winner. I guess that's part of the Asian Fusion.' I also ordered a green tea with a hint of wheat? It that was served loose leaf in a personal tea pot. It had a great unique taste.  Definitely worth a try. Prices are slightly on the higher side, but definitely reasonable and not over priced considering the quality of food that is being served.
