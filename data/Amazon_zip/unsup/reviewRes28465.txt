I just cant do 5 stars for Rick Bayless. I don't think I really get this cuisine. I did really enjoy my meal; I also LOVE the atmosphere. The cocktails were great, but sadly the food didn't blow me away. Don't get me wrong, everything was very good, but not 5 star worthy. We had: Empanadas Duck Taquitos Chicken Enchiladas with mole Steak If I lived in Chicago I might give it another try. Maybe there are some other things on the menu that I should experience. Especially since the top chef finale, I would recommend doing lunch versus dinner if you don't have a reservation. We were quoted an hour but it was more like 25 minutes (although we would have waited the hour...).
