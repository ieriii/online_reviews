Wasn't this place a hardware store a billion years ago? I hope it was because that's the source of my meh-ndetta (a grudge that doesn't inspire a good deal of hate/rage) against it. I need grandma carts and halogen bulbs within easy walking distance! When I don't have them, I get snitty. If this wasn't the site of my former hardware store from a billion years ago, nevermind. But grudges, real or imagined, are what kept me away from Wilde since it's opening. One chilly spring evening (gotta love Chicago weather), I finally broke down and checked it out. I'd already eaten. I was just looking for a place to warm up, have a drink and enjoy some conversation. Wilde satisfied with all three. As everyone's already stated, the warm wood and library decor are extremely calming. I'd even go so far as to call it 'welcoming.' In fall or winter, I can fully understand why the place is always packed. With it's expansive layout, it can accommodate the eager denizens of East Lakeview who flock to it with regularity. For my beverage, I had a glass of red wine. Eh. It was fine. It wasn't memorable but it wasn't swill. Our waitress seemed a bit annoyed by the fact that we didn't order food. I could understand if the place was slammed and we were taking up valuable table real estate. But, on this particular evening, it was empty and we were paying too much for drafts and pours. Enjoy the mark up and leave us be, please. Convo was good but that's a usual. Since I didn't have the food, I am reserving a star upgrade for when I have supped on some mac & cheese or somethin'. After years of a meh-ndetta, I can't say that I have missed out on life-changing experiences but I am none the more wounded for having had a drink here. If I do confirm that my meh-ndetta is valid, however, it's definitely back on.
