Wow, what a great place! My boyfriend and I had dinner here tonight and I couldn't wait to get home and write a review! This is how excited I was! Staff were very friendly and their prix fixe dinner was to die for. I had scallop to start (it really does melt in your mouth), fish for main dish and banana dessert to finish. I could not be any happier. My boyfriend had veal appetizer which was done so well that even a person who is not a fan (me) liked it very much.  Great atmosphere, friendly staff, and food that is well prepared and artistically displaced...I don't know what else you could ask for!
