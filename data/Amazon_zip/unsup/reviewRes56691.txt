My family has been dining at Trattoria Sapori for years and we always have a great meal. Start with the Crostini Di Avocado (chopped avocado with cheese and chopped tomato on Italian bread), a surprisingly good take on the familiar bruschetta. For the salad course, we really like the Insalata Stella with endive, provolone, pinenuts & fruit. I've had the Risotto ai Funghi and Gnocchi al Brivido in the past and loved both, but Cappellacci di Zucca (a pumpkin/squash stuffed ravioli) is my favorite dish here. We've always seen generous portions on all dishes. This is NOT traditional Italian food. I love that there are lots of vegetarian dishes (I don't eat meat), and plenty of veal, chicken, etc. for my dining companions to enjoy. The atmosphere is cozy, there is a small dining room with a couple of more private dining areas toward the back of the restaurant, and some outdoor tables in the summer. Parking can be a little tricky, the neighborhood recently became permit-only, but we've never had a problem finding a spot on Halsted nearby. Chef Anthony and staff are extremely hospitable, prices are reasonable, you won't be disappointed!
