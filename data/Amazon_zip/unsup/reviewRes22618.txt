Took my parents here for my Ma G.'s birthday. It was the perfect place for us, and the food was delicious. No reservations for any parties under 6 people, so be prepared to wait. On a Tuesday night around the Christmas holidays, we waited about 15 minutes after arriving around 8 PM. I liked the interior of this place. It was cute, despite the bizarre clear plastic chairs. Since it was Christmastime, tinsel adorned the walls. Despite a wild child toddler seated directly behind me who seemed fascinated by jumping up and down on her chair and coveting my hair, the vibe of this place is somehow relaxed at each table, despite the hustling, bustling waitstaff. To get started, we ordered spring rolls and crab rangoon. I thought the spring rolls were particularly delicious. I also ordered the hot and sour soup which I finished to the last drop and practically pried from a waiter's hands so I could do so. On the advice of some of these Yelp reviews, I ordered the Mapo Tofu when I was completely overwhelmed by the bajillion menu items. It was good, but I was so full that I can't totally say just how good it was. I would say that if you have out-of-town guests and are looking for a good Chinatown spot to take them, this restaurant is perfect. Remember to make reservations for parties over six!
