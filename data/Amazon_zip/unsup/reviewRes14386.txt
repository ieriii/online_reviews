BORING CRAFT BEER but the food selection had more than one option for people who don't eat meat. They have a neat logo and a partially good idea. It's too bad that the owner thinks that people are lame enough to spend money there just because they make beer in-house instead of GOOD beer in-house. Of course, for now the place seems to be packing out pretty well but I would be surprised if it's still doing so well once the new-ness wears off in a couple more years. Oh- the inside decor is kick-ass. The metal and wood look is different and really cool. I recommend going there for 2 reasons: 1) to see the decor & 2) so that you can see what happens when a beer brewer just doesn't even try.
