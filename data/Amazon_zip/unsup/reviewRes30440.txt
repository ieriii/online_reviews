I'm bumping this up a star - I went back and ordered better, and I think that's the key to the Chicago Diner. This time around I got the BBQ Cheezeburger, which was made of seitan deliciousness, with a kale salad side. Both were delicious, but what really sent me over the edge was the amazingly delicious vegan cookie dough milkshake. Yum! Made up for not-so-great cheesecake/cake by far!
