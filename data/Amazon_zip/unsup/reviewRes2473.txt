I really like this place...the only thing that sucks is that it's not closer to my house. Doug's usually there taking orders which I totally respect as well. I go by for some eats every three months and every time I am satisfied. Everything sounds so good and I'm always surprised by the different gourmet hot dogs I'll see there. I mean, as with all places, you get some hot dogs that are hit or miss and it's happened where I've gotten a couple misses. But, I usually get more hits - that might also be due to the fact that I usually drop $80 on hot dogs when I'm there.
