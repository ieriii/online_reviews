So much pork!! The portions are tricky some are filling but can have small portions. They suggested getting two plates per person so you can share. My friend and I got the bone marrow, the camambert cheese, and the milk braised pork shoulder. Even though we only had three plates, it was still pretty heavy and filling. Pretty big selection of wine, but a lot of it was foreign so kinda difficult to decide which to get (no explanation of the wines included in the menu either, only that they are red or white). Also some instructions on how to eat some of their dishes would've been nice too. I would probably skip the bone marrow next time, it was good, but too greasy and rich for me.
