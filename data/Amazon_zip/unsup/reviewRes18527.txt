I really like this place! Really enjoyed my first dinner there, came back just for the churros, and went back a third time for a full dinner. Quick note: I always try to go during off hours, specifically for an early dinner, to avoid the lines (it's a small spot and there are no reservations). I've had the Pepito and Cubana torta sandwiches, and enjoyed both -- really fresh ingredients and a lot of flavor. One of my friends had ordered the vermicelli and didn't like it, so I'd stick with the sandwiches. For dessert definitely get the churros with chocolate sauce, then a side of soft serve and dip away -- I'm not normally a fan of churros but these are amazing. Also had their chocolate cappuccino, which was a little too sweet for me. I'd stick to a torta (do half and half with a friend so you get a little variety) and the churros (don't skimp on the soft serve).
