Believe the hype! This place is THE Italian destination in the city of Chicago. No cutesy review this for this gem...this is serious business! On my first visit, I had the pleasure of having: - Fromaggi & Salumi Platter - The Capicolla is the winner! - Spagehetti & Black Pepper - Beautiful in its simplicity - Focaccia & Fresh Soft Cow Cheese - Heavenly, like eating a cloud of happiness. Nothing like it! - Ricotta & Honey Comb Jar - Fantastic - Chicken Liver Pate. - The best I've ever had! -Truffle Egg Toast, Fontina & Asparagus. - Still thinking about it.  The wait for a table in this joint is off of the hook so I spent the hour plus putting back a couple of delicious Peroni's, the beer of choice at Davanti. I must have checked my watch a thousand times and during a moment of weakness, I almost gave in to my nagging hunger. Thankfully, I persevered. Once the first bite of bliss hit my lips, the wait was all forgotten. This joyous, overwhelmingly pleasurable experience renewed my interest in the Italian dining scene.  I will strategically plan my next visit and until then I shall shower Davanti with praises of perfection!
