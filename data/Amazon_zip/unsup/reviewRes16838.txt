I've only had the buffet here. The best indian buffet I've had - EVER. I am Indian and I love indian food. The buffet here is so good - they have a range of things to try from - a very very large variety. The food is fresh, warm, and soooo tastey =). They bring fresh naan and chicken tandoori to your table too! The mango kulfi and gulab jamun (desserts) are mind blowing and I feel like I am back home eating my moms' food. Def worth your money! Downside- you will def need a nap after.
