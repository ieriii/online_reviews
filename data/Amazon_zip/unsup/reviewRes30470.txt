Chicago Diner, how do I love thee? Let me count the ways. 1. Charming space and atmosphere 2. Friendly service 3. Vegan Philly Cheesesteak sandwich 4. Vegan peanut butter chocolate milkshakes 5. Incredible vegan deserts! Chicago Diner is my favorite restaurant in Chi-town. I go at least once every time I visit my friends in this city. I think their lunch and dinner items are better than breakfast and their vegan Thanksgiving dinners are wonderful. I love you, Chicago Diner! I really love you!
