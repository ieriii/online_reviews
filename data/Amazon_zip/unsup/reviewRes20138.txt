Walked out $100 lighter...and nothing memorable. Salad was the only good item. Is there a contest to see how many ingredients you can pile on - I couldn't believe it when waiter rattled off the special fish dish. Place was nearly empty, Sunday night, 7p...and we're seated on top of others at close -in 2 tables....when there was plenty of room throughout. Pretty place, nice lights and glass...drinks and wine prices ridiculous....will not be back.
