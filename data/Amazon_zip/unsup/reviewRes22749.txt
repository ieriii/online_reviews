Finally got to try this place and I'm so glad I did. We decided to take it to go so we could eat while watching the nba finals (don't you just love the combo of good sports and good food?). The wait wasn't too bad, especially since we got the soy oatmeal shake while waiting so I was content sipping on that. Now I know why everyone loves it...it is so delicious!  One funny thing that happened while I was waiting was that a customer while leaving, looked me straight in the eye and said "ni hao!" which is hello in Chinese but as I am not Chinese, I thought "wtf??" Very very weird.  So anyways, we got back home and started munching away. The tico was pretty yummy. The rib eye was a tad bit overcooked but still good, especially when I made sure to dip it in the sauce that it came in. Loved the sauted veggies, especially the spicy peppers...I love food with a kick! And I finished my meal off with the sweet plantains. Yum! Keep in mind that the portions are huge! I don't always trust when people say "definitely enough for two meals!" because there have been times when I've been able to polish off whatever they were talking about in one sitting. However, yeah...no way I could finish off the tico with the four pieces of rib eye that they give. Btw, the person at the register also sincerely said "Thank you for your business!" when he gave us our food. Such a small thing but little gestures like that go a long way for me. :D
