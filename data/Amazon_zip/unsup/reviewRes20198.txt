I don't feel like I can give a totally valid review of The Gage because I was only there for their Restaurant Week menu... Which I thought would be like a taste of their regular menu... But, it wasn't; so, that was a disappointment.  The food we ordered however, was not a disappointment. We decided to go for a bit extra and ordered a "fondue" that was made with brie (and...??) and served with long pieces of toast. It was delicious, and this is more what I expected from The Gage... But, it was on their menu. The Restaurant Week menu included a black lentil soup and an "organic lettuces" salad. I really wanted the black lentil soup, but it came with lobster... and Joe wouldn't let me have it because I'm allergic (same story every time!).. But, we came to find out that it was only a scant bit of lobster anyway. But, I was very happy with the salad. Our main courses were also pretty delicious - the only gastro-y part of it though might have been the fried kale that came with my flat iron steak... Dessert was ok. The Gage is fairly expensive, so Joe and I probably won't go back until it's a special occasion, or if I end up there with some Overture Council people, but I'm sure it's good.
