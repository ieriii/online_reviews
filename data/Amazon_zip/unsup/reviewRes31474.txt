I came here just for the one thing that I saw on the menu...Toast and "jam". I'm from Chicago, but moved to sunny San Diego about 10 years ago. I came back for a friend's wedding and to celebrate with my hubby our anniversary. San Diego is a place to get some good food - from filipino, japanese, thai, vietnamese, and etc. They're all mom and pop shops - straight good home cooking kind of food. But there's no place for an asian fine dining restaurant - and IMO would never make it in SD cuz of all the places we have around here and we got all the american fine dining - steak house, surf and turf places. So I had to try this place! We walked in, pleasantly greeted, and were directly brought to our seats. I have to admit the the restaurant was busy and loud. I've never really been to a restaurant like it - it was a nice urban setting. I didn't mind the loudness, but it was really difficult to hear the waitress. Food - being filipina it was hard to resist the filipino food! We ordered of course the toast and jam! Its really hard for me to find shrimp toast in SD btw. The hubby got the oxtail pot stickers. He got the shaking beef and i got the crispy pata. I kinda wish we just got random appetizers, but we'll be back some day to try other things. We loved it all! Yea, back in SD I can get crispy pata for half the cost, but I couldn't help it! I loved the vinegar dipping sauce they had paired with it, yummy and you can't get garlic foie-gras gravy with it either back home! We did order a side order of rice - when you eat something like that it needs rice. Maybe with that dish, they can fore go the watercress salad and replace it with rice. Next time we're in Illinois, I'll make it a point to drive to the City and go to Sunda again!
