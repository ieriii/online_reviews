Date of Visit: 11/26/10 A wonderful place to take family and friends anytime of the year. A very comfortable restaurant no matter where you sit. There's a special little alcove in back that is a library - love that area the best, but its nice to sit next to the fireplace on cold nights, too. Typical pub food here, but the menu has a lot to choose from. You won't be disappointed in the quality or quantity. As tad pricey for my own taste ($2.95 for a very small bowl of coleslaw...really?), but still a nice place to eat, take a date, etc.
