Greek Islands was my first restaurant in Chicago - decent food, very, very friendly wait staff as the girls found out. Food was pretty good. Apparently does incredibly business with the lunchtime business crowd. It's a nice enough place. I'd go again if I were in the mood for Greek food in Chicago.
