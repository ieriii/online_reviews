We celebrated my friend's birthday here last week. Our waitress was darling, helpful and truthfully one of the best I've had recently. The food was great. I had the spinach salad, the spinach pine nuts, roasted peppers, sesame goat cheese and balsamic vinaigrette all played well together. I added some chicken for I think a few bucks more. The chicken at some places can be dry or tasteless and that was not the case here at all. I also really liked my side of rice and chickpeas. They allowed us to purchase wine from their little wineshop and enjoy that with our food since those choices were not on the menu. I love their bakery and the little gift shop. Great things at reasonable prices.
