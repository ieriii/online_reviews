This is a great sushi place, and BYOB. On top of the food being fantastic (great maki, for sure get the white dragon roll), the service is truly exceptional. The server took the beer we brought in to the back so it could "stay cold in the fridge." How great is that? I had a great experience here and would go back for sure.
