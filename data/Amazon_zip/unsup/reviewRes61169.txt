I had heard Garcia's had authentic Mexican food. Wrong! I had a steak ranchero and the sauce on that steak was not even close to the ranchero sauce I've had at other places. My husband's tacos were extremely greasy. I ordered a Margarita and felt like I got a shot of tequila instead. That was a waste of money because I ended up not drinking it. The place looks dirty and to get a refill on a drink it took quite a long time. I'm new in the neighborhood, and I like to check out new places and often give them a second chance, but I'm not going back to Garcia's so if anyone knows of a good AUTHENTIC Mexican restaurant in the neighborhood please let me know!
