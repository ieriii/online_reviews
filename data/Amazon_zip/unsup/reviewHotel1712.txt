Strengths: Hotel was trendy and clean. Staff was pleasant. Gym was nicely sized and equipped. Hosted happy hour was AWESOME. Weaknesses: The location is not that great. Yes, this is in the Loop, but in hindsight, as a tourist we should've stayed north of the river. The bathrooms are pretty tiny. Opportunities: More leniency with the hotel restaurant vouchers would be nice :) Threats: Being that I'm a first time visitor, I cannot compare with other local hotels. I would say that this Kimpton was much cleaner than the one I stayed in when I was in DC. Total: $89 per night
