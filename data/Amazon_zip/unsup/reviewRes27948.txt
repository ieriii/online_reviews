After the build-up before going to this place, I was incredibly disappointed. They did not serve the truffle popcorn I have heard so much about. They did serve rosemary gourges but then they took them away without asking and before they were all eaten. I felt like they rushed us through the meal with the wait staff hovering over us waiting to take away the plates...very annoying. When I am paying a high price...actually, even if I am not paying a high price, I would like to be able to sit, talk with my friends and enjoy the meal and not feel pressure to shove everything down my throat. I also ordered the pumpkin biscuit and it never came. I informed the waiter and he did give us the dessert for free. The waiter was also about as personable as a statue. I don't need to be buddies with the waiters but it just added to the whole uncomfortable, rushed experience.
