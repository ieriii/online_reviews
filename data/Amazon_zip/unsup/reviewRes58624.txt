So...My fiance wanted to take me out for desert. Although I'm a native of Chicago, I've never been to this place. He figured the ambiance would be fabulous and have an overall inviting atmosphere. SIKE! Let me tell you the story...We walked in and was quickly seated. The waitress came over and asked had we been there before, and if not would we like her to give a description of the meals etc. My fiance says sure.. So as she begins to tell us what they had to offer, he realized that we wanted to stick with what we originally went there for. He says I think we'll just go with the flaming chocolate fondue. Waitress says, Yes, I figured you all would say that. Eyebrows raised but I said nothing. Then we ordered drinks that we had to remind the waitress to get 10 mins. later. The couple sitting next to us commenced leaving and the waiter took all of the items on that table and placed them on ours, although we were still there EATING! Ugh the nerve. Then another group came in to eat and the waiter walking pass and tried not to bump into them and in doing so his butt swiped our table on the same side as our food! We then began to call making reservations for another place, (Devon Seafood) and asked for the check. She took sooo long to bring it, I had to get up and go looking for her.I will never go there or recommend this place to my friends unless they are of the European descent. When I told a coworker, who was European, he was not surprised and said that's just the type of establishment they are and the area you're in and apologized for what took place. All in all, as an African American person, if you want to be spoken to in a rude manner, ignored and generally disrespected, please go to this establishment!! Take your kids too, well, if you want to show them a glimpse of what our people during the 1960's endured. :-)
