Been twice in the last few weeks and I'm still a huge fan. I still haven't had the balls to order the cow's penis pho or get extra penis in my pho for $2 (these are both on the menu but not mandatory) but I love the Tank Special Pho that comes in the world's most extravagantly large bowl.  Definitely my favorite pho in all of Uptown, the neighborhood that readily ecclipses Starbucks level pho saturation.
