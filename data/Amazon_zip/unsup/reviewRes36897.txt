A first visit to Indie with friends was a huge success.  I doubt there is better Thai food at this price point in the city. In addition to the usual Pad Thai and Pad See Ew type dishes, Indie serves some more interesting plates, including the Indie Specialty Curry. One complaint: we told them in advance we were going to be sharing all the dishes, but they still brought them as individual servings, each with its own little scoop of rice. This can be solved next time by a more specific request for how it should be served, but it's the sort of thing you wish they would think of. Five of us ate all we wanted for about $60. You definitely want to reserve if you are going at the dinner hour. The ambiance is hip and the crowd fairly young, resulting in a somewhat conversation-challenged environment. But go for the food!
