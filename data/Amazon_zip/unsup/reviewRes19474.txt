I have a new motto - when in doubt, follow Reuben H. That's right - that man knows his brunches/lunches/dinner/food! Reuben organized a group to do the MS Walk (which was a smashing success, btw). He also made post-race brunch reservations for us at The Gage - which I mistakenly thought was simply going to be yet another boring Irish Pub/Bistro. Yawn.....ZZZZZzzz.....with boring food. Au contraire! Was I in for a treat! FIND! Because I was dining with the Yelping Queens of Mussels (aka Erin and Aurore), even though it was only 11 a.m. we ordered the mussels from the lunch menu - Mussels Vindaloo served with a long baguette toast. I am no conneisseur of mussels but I am here to tell you they were great and I will most definitely order them again and again. The Eggs Benedict with rashers (thin slices of fried bacon) was served with a tasty Spicy Hollandaise which was a little skimpy on the sauce - personally I would have liked more sauce - OINK - but was delicious. The dish also comes with a side of the brie potatoes - another must order. We also tried from the dinner menu an order of the Brussels Sprouts w/ Brie & Applewood Bacon - I would order these again! For those who are health nuts and/or need a colon cleansing, I would recommend the Steel Cut Irish Oatmeal Brle w/ Granola, Berries, Cream, Brown Sugar & Nuts. OH! And they brew a fine strong cup of Julius Meinl coffee - score! I want to thank The Gage for being so accommodating to our group of 20. There was no hassle or attitude - even though we were a tad late due to the walk - and our two 10-tops were awaiting our arrival with open arms. We had perfect service - fabulous food - great company - in a warm inviting atmosphere of "refined rusticity, steps away from Millennium Park." What more can you ask for?
