Had a great experience here! There was a great selection of noodles, rice and entrees! I feel like as most Thai places around here, it is either not full on Thai entree (the pan asian places that have sweet and sour chicken and pad thai...um ok..) or they just have your standard dishes. At Opart Thai I couldn't decide on what I wanted because there was so much to choose from. Instead of getting a standard noodle dish I decided to branch out and get a new dish. My roommate and I shared the peanut sauce lovers dish (or something like that) and this sauteed shrimp dish. Both dishes were pretty delicious, especially the peanut sauce one! The sauces were so tasty I wanted more rice to soak up the sauce! Opart Thai is also BYOB! The service is pretty good and the prices are VERY reasonable!
