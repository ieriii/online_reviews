I love me some hot dogs. Do you love hot dogs? Actually, I really don't care for hot dogs that much, but when you put fun things like blueberry Shiraz sauce on them and serve them with french fries fried in DUCK FAT, how could you NOT like them? This place holds strange hours, but I guess the owner can do that when people line up around the block in pouring rain just to come inside for some gourmet processed meat. This is a fun place to take visitors (ie parents, friends) for lunch on the weekends, but make sure they know that there WILL be a wait, and that seating is limited. Cash only!
