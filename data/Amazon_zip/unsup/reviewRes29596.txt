I have never had a bad experience here. Bring a bottle of wine or a pack of beer (there's a liquor store 2 storefronts down) and chow down on some of my favorites which include massman curry, lard nar, pad thai, spicy cashew chicken dish and the spring rolls. It's right off the Western ave Brown Line stop so it's very accessible. There are so many Thai restaurants in Chicago, but this one of the best.
