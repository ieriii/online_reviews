The Publican was EXTREMELY accomodating! Originally, I had booked a table for two, but slowly, our party grew to 8, then 9. Each time they had no problem making the change and accomodating us (mind you it was a Tuesday night that we were going!). So already I loved them. It was a birthday we were there for, so I had brought cupcakes, but not knowing if they'd be ok with us bringing our own dessert I had them all individually boxed. The hostess saw them and asked me if I'd like her to have our waiter bring them out later with a candle in one for the birthday boy. I thought this was extremely nice of them.  The meal was wonderful! I think my favorite would be the pork belly, but everything we ordered was phenomenal. Mussels, Porchetta (definitely some of the group's favorite), Duck breast, Turnips, and Beets stand out in my mind from last night's dinner.  Our waiter was great! He gave wonderful recommendations not only on food, but wine and beer. He chose a sauvignon blanc for me that was wonderful. I later asked him what it was because I liked it so much and he wrote it down for me. The staff brought out individually plated cupcakes after our meal with a candle lit in the birthday boy's cupcake. And they didn't charge us anything extra for bringing our own desserts and for the plates and forks they had to then clean because of the cupcakes. I was super impressed. To top off the night, we had 6 credit cards and the waiter had no issues running each with the amount we wanted to put on each. AMAZING AMAZING service. Great food and drink! You have to try this place!
