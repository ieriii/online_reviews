I have been here three times for dinner. I have always found the food to be perfectly prepared and very tasty. The reason why I can't give it four stars is due to the waiter we had when we sat on the patio. I would really like to describe him so management can train him better. However, I am not sure how to do so without seeming like a total beotch. The waiters we have had on the other two occasions were wonderful. Attentive, unobtrusive, knowledgeable and friendly. This guy we just had had an off-hand, almost insulting manner and did not know his menu at all. He didn't know the provenance of the cheese and had to read them off a paper (after sighing audibly when I asked what they were). He also didn't offer bread or a dessert menu. He was rude. He reached across my face-- literally right under my nose-- as I was taking a bite so that he could clear the table. He was slow and was so busy flirting with the men at the next table he really made it obvious whom he assumed would leave the better tip. Too bad for him. He was right about that tip in the end.
