This is my second time dining at Big Jones, and thoroughly enjoyed this time around. To start, the corn bread is ridiculous. Hot, fresh, and delicious! For our entree, the seared duck was mouth watering and very flavorful. Highly recommended! I am very impressed by the drink menu. The wine BTG offering featured an esoteric selection, which is always refreshing. I easily get bored with the same Cab, Chard, and Merlot lists. The best attraction, by far, is the Whiskey Club. Each time you eat at Big Jones, they let you sample a whiskey of the month. They even give you a booklet to keep tabs on everything you tried. Super cool, as Fall is my whiskey season! My only criticism is that the service was a little slow between courses, as we ended up having a 2 hour dinner. Otherwise, the food was delish! We'll be back soon!
