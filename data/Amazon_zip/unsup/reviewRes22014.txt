This place may look like the Macaroni Grill of Greek restaurants. But the food is the real deal!  My friend and I arrived before the rest of our party so we decided to wait things out at the bar. Bartender asks me what I'd like to drink. I say, "A white wine spritzer, please." He yells, "WHO?!?" Feeling confused and slightly frightened, I repeat, "white wine spritzer, please." He says, "Oh, that one," and walks off to make my drink. He returns and asks my friend what she'd like to drink, "Malibu and pineapple." "WHO?!?" At which point we both burst out laughing. Apparently it's this guy's schtick and it works, because I had to tip him extra for the laughs. The wait was pretty ridiculous, but luckily I was in great company so time flew. Being rather unfamiliar with Greek food, I was going to order the most recognizable thing on the menu: the Gyro. My sage friend, however, suggested I branch out. So I ordered the Garides. So happy I did! It was so awesome, I'm planning on recreating it at home. Other standouts from the evening: the Flaming Saganaki, great presentation and even better flavor. And the Mousaka, seriously good stuff.  Opa!
