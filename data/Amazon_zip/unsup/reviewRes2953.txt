Absolutely divine. I went here for my birthday with my family and was utterly amazed. They made us feel like royalty. This was our first fine dining experience and I had heard that upscale restaurants make newbies feel inferior, but that was not the case at all for Tru. We walked in and a group of waiters was all over us, pulling out our chairs, giving us chairs for our purses...when we went to the restroom, they would fold our table napkins and place them on the table again. Our menus were especially made for us and said Happy Birthday Liz. The food was delectable, the presentation was awe-inspiring. Everything looked beautiful and sometimes they would complete the meal in front of you. They would come out with several plates and bowls and add this and that to the main dish, it was truly a magnificent presentation. We had a three course meal, but we got several mini bite things in between that were equally delicious. I can safely say that we got our money's worth. After our meal, i received a little chocolate bar with a candle for my birthday. Then they rolled out the chocolate cart with about 20 delicacies. I had read reviews about this, but some reviews said it was complimentary some didn't. So I only chose one. Let me tell you, the dessert cart is COMPLIMENTARY so dig in! When you walk out they give you little lemon cakes, also complimentary. Seriously, don't be afraid of fine dining. TRU, at least, is not snobby in the least, even though it's obvious that you don't normally engage in fine dining. Plus, they definitely give you your money's worth both food wise and atmosphere wise. It was an amazing experience and I will be returning for my next special occasion.
