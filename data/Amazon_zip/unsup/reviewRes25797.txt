Fondue always makes for a great date night - or so we thought! We tried Gejas after hearing so much about it being the 'most romantic restaurant in the City'. Maybe it is on some nights, but not the night that we were there. Our experience was diminished by a loud, obnoxious group of maybe 10 women sitting at a table near ours. It was obvious that other couples were getting annoyed as well - they were talking so loudly as to make conversation with my date very difficult. I enjoy going out with a group of friends, and sometimes we do get loud, but certainly not at a place like this. If you know your group will be drunk and loud, get a private room or go to TGI Friday's or Dave & Busters - not Gejas. Another table complained to the manager, but nothing was done about them.  I will say that our waitress was absolutely wonderful - very knowledgeable and seemed to know exactly when we needed her . The bartender was very nice and the food was excellent. It was a bit expensive, but fondue always is - even if you do it at home. If you do go here, expect to leave smelling like grease - that's just the way it is. This place could have gotten 4-stars from me if my experience was a little better. I have no plans to go back - though I guess I could be talked into giving them a second chance sometime in the future.
