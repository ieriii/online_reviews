I absolutely love this place but I have 1 issue. They seem to be closed all the time. I woke up today craving a Dakota Soul Steak bowl and get to Crisp, see an OPEN sign in the window, but come to find it is closed.......I'll move on to the food which is wonderful. I mentioned above the Steak bowl and it is awesome. Crisp wings are also amazing. Big, tender, and a taste you can't beat. Try Crisp, you'll love it. But if you live a ways away I would call first. Enjoy!
