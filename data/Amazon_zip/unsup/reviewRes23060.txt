Fun for young and old. Car hops still bring your order. Great food. Why only 4 stars? I don't like their dogs, and I don't like the green pickled tomato. If you have certain expectations of a hot dog you may prefer the burgers. I always get the cheeseburgers and they rock. If you have kids and have never come here, you should be reported to the state.
