I was part of a large party, and someone else paid for my meal so I can't be too harsh. However,that being said it wasn't my favorite dining experience. The hostesses were snooty, the decor was very well put together but a little too cool for me. The place almost feels sterile. The harvest tables had a nice selection of cheeses and salads and that was my favorite part of the whole thing, although still maybe just a little too hip for me. The guys with meat on sticks were too aggressive. They all bombarded our table at once, interrupting conversations to present their various meats. They were nice guys, just maybe too much meat coming towards us in a 15 minute period. Maybe they were trying to rush us along? The drinks were nice but overpriced and the food was good but overpriced. Maybe to help pay off the cost of the decor and the rocks you place on the table to signify you wanted more meat? Kinda reminds me of the 'Run, Forrest, Run' / 'Stop, Forrest, Stop' signs at the Bubba Gump Shrimp company if you ask me... Overall I'd say if you LOVE meat, or are trying impress a client or something its a cool place. Otherwise, skip it.
