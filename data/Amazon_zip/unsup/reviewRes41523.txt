Marvelous! This is a great spot for all of the special occasion dinners, first dates and anniversary dinners.  The food was wonderful. Each of our 5 courses could have been the featured special at any other restaurant. Everything was remarkably well planned and presented. I could tell you about the specific menu items but they change all the time.  Bring a fine wine and a full wallet. You will not be disappointed.
