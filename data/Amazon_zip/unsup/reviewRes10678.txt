Another bday dinner on Saturday night....this time a group of 14.....I haven't been here in a while....but was mighty impressed with their pies! Food My bf and I came slightly late...so didn't get in on much of the appetizers.....I did get a bite of the goat cheese & marinara....which was tasty but I was really there for the 'za.....our group ordered 5 large pies....and.....Yum!!! I'm usually a thin crust kind of gal.....and I mean cracker thin.....these weren't.....but their crust was still pretty phenom.....crunchy and chewy at the same time....supported the toppings but didn't steal the show..... Here are the 3 I tried..... Sausage, Mushroom & Basil: This was my favorite.....juicy....saucy....and the basil just made the whole damn slice.....home run!! Pepperoni & Sausage: Nice....but slightly dry.....I've said it before and I'll say it again.....sauce is boss....and this def needed some more Garbage Pizza: This was my friends creation.....and I believe it had....meatballs, bacon, jalapenos and mushrooms.....maybe garlic....but really I don't remember....whatI do remember is that it was good....rich and hearty.....but def a man pizza....which was confirmed by all of the guys at our table going back for seconds and thirds. Beers: I'm not a big beer girl (sorry)....I usually let my bf pick out something he thinks I'll like....I had a leffe blonde....and tasted some of the Golden Arm.....which I liked but didn't feel the need to order one of my own. I will say that everyone else was raving about the brews.....so they must be doing something right.....and I loved the names.....Camel Toe.....Full Frontal Pale Ale.... Service They were actually really accommodating to our party....it was a busy Saturday night.....and our friends 30th Birthday.....we had no reservation.....and there were 14 of us.....(annoying I know)....but they were able to get us a table......yay! Our server was good....not super chatty or very engaging but got the job done. Ambiance Very loud.....I could barely hear the people I was sitting next too.....but it's a great place for a group if you want something that's boisterous and fun. They have live band Karaoke on Saturday nights at 11pm.....which is highly entertaining. Really strange crowd though.....odd mix.....I wouldn't even know how to describe it. Overall Loved the pizza....didn't love the crowd. I will def go back for the pies.....but probably steer clear of it on the weekends.....
