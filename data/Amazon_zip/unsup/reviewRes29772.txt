Went here for lunch for two co-workers birthdays. The place was pretty desolate so I'm unsure why it took 20 minutes to just be greeted by the server, and another 20 minutes to get any kind of beverage service (including water). We were all served at separate times (while sitting at the same table mind you). I won't be going back here.
