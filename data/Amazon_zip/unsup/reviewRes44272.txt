Intelligentsia taste for the S'bux price. Not cheap, people. Soy latte was good, and believe it or not, it's easily fucked up. The plain croissant was not too buttery and nice and moist...yummy. I didn't try the pastries, but they looked creatively decorated and good. This place like every joint on Division has an outside patio, but it also has a large room with comfy couches and tables to do your work or homework.
