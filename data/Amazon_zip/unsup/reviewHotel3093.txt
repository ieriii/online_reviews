I attended a corporate event here and had a good time. However, the prices should NOT just be about location. The W seems to be an old, rundown hotel they took and tried to gussy up. My friends' room had scuff marks on the walls, cheap wood (or press board?) paneling nailed to one wall, and it was TINY. The bathrooms have a window, which is not only weird, but provide NO sound barrier. Pretty awkward, depending on who you're staying with. The shower heads are low and her husband almost wasn't able to fit under them! The bamboo blinds were also filthy. When you enter the room, you are greeted with a basket of goodies. Wow! Now, this helps to explain the $300ish for a crap room rates... or maybe not. We soon realized that next to this basket of "goodies" was a price list. An individual can of Pringles? $5! You can also buy 3 or 4 condoms for $12 and a "Take me Away" CD for $13. Wow. sexy, huh? Not really. Oh- and if you want anything that isn't in your room (towels, food, etc.) it's a $3.50 DELIVERY CHARGE and a 20% service fee. Wow. The 33rd floor (I believe it's called the Altitude Room?) is pretty nice, but the bathrooms have no main door. Again... awkward. The stones in the sink were pretty cool though, I have to admit. I would never, EVER pay to stay here, but people seem to like it. I guess when you have money to throw into the air at mediocre service and rooms, it's worth it.
