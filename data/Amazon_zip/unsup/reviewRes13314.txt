Hmmm...Very interesting. Once again, I discovered this place on "Diners, Drive-ins and Dives". This is definitely not your typical diner. First things first...Make Reservations!! If you are making same day reservations, it must be three hours in advance. The atmosphere is mixed; you can wear jeans and t-shirt or suit and tie. I didn't like the fact that it was small and the tables were close together, but I guess it was worth it. They have two menus. They have the typical diner menu and a chalkboard menu full of seafood options. They have 16 different fish options. Prices are reasonable. Portions are pretty good. The service was very good. Our waitress was very helpful and prompt. Today I had a seared artic char topped with shrimp in a spicy sauce, with grilled asparagus and roasted potatoes. My boyfriend had the lobster fettuccine alfredo with spinach and Parmesan. We shared both dishes. The artic char was very good but just a little dry, although the flavor and quality was amazing. The pasta was very filling and full of juicy lobster. It came with four triangular shaped garlic bread slices. I would recommend getting an appetizer if you are just getting a fish entree. I would definitely go back so I can try other menu options! I have a feeling this diner will become a frequent spot for me.
