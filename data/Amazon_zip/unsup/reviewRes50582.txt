Free beignets as soon as you sit down? I think that might be my favorite way to start brunch. Big Jones has incredible service, and is nicer than I was expecting, with white tablecloths and very professional waitstaff. Their list of iced tea is remarkable. We tried two different ones, and I really liked how my "flavoring" came on the side, so I could make the tea as sweet as I wanted. This also allowed for multiple refills. The food is definitely comfort food with southern and mexican flavors. I had the migas and enjoyed it a lot, but my fiance's meal included a piece of thick-cut ham that had me drooling. Definitely a great place for brunch, or even a special occasion.
