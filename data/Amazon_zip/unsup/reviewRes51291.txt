I would be totally enthusiastic about Garcia's if it were the only Mexican restaurant within walking distance. However, it's one of a crowd, and between cheap taquerias and more upscale places, Garcia's doesn't stand out at all. It's also a big barn of a room on the inside. The menu is standard with nothing original that really stands out; food is acceptable but perhaps a little pricey for the quality. Big portions though. Every time I've gone we've ordered a pitcher of margaritas, and they are nice and strong.
