Went to The Publican for sunday brunch. I really liked the atmosphere the service was great. I was a little hung over when I went, so I started off with the bloody Mary to take the edge off. Then followed that with the pork belly dish to soak up some of the demons from the night before. The food was great hit the spot. Looking forward to trying their dinner menu.
