My husband and I checked this place out tonight for my birthday dinner. (I share the date- 12/12- with Frank Sinatra, a fact my Italian family has always been quite proud of.) We hadn't stopped in earlier because we're vegetarians and the menu didn't seem all that great for us. I was determined, however, that if I have to turn 27 this year a fish would be sacrificed in my honor. So after almost 10 years of cruelty-free eating, I ate a dead fish and it was awesome. I had the tilapia, to be exact, it was on the specials menu and recommended by our waiter. The bite of my husband's pasta I had was so-so to be honest, I prefer Bacchanalia for that. Just the sheer amount of food we served was amazing and then the canoli I finished with- dolce! I twas the best canoli I have ever eaten by far. I can't give better than three stars, though, because it's quite packed and busy in there and I almost got clothes-lined about 47 times by waiters and bus boys while I was trying to eat. We were also sitting next to the world's biggest blow hard, so listening to his full-of-crap conversation at such close range was kind of lame. Otherwise, I really enjoyed my food and I'll be back next time I get the urge to eat something dead.
