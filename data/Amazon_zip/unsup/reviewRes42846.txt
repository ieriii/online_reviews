This place is great...definitely not your run of the mill pizza joint. The options are not typical but are very good. Love the BBQ chicken pizza. Their Brazilian chicken with garlic rice and black beans is yummy too. Owner and staff are all very friendly. Took a little while to actually get our order but it was well worth the wait!
