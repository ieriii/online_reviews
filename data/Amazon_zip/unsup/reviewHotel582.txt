We had the pleasure of being a guest for the Opening Night event this week and I must say, I was blown away. This is true Ian Schrager style and cool charm without all the glitz and spangles and at a REASONABLE price point! Hotels seem to be reaching the breaking point with their prices for rooms these days.... The food was outstanding and the service was impeccable! EVERY employee, from the door man to the cleaning staff were most knowledgeable about the space, it's history as well as helpful and charming in their own way. Definitely a return spot for us and clients. I TOTALLY disagree with the post by the last person....js
