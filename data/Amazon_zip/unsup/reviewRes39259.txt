Just a few reminders before dining at San Soo Gab San ... -DO, Be sure and wear socks with your shoes (ladies no heels, because it's a little awkward getting barefooted beside strangers and practically walking on the table, haha) -DON'T wear anything that's dry clean only (because, you will walk out of here smelling like a charcoal fire pit) -DON'T plan to meet people out after dining here (because, the smell is all over you now, your hair, your clothes etc it will drive everyone else around you crazzy trying to figure out what that rancid smell is and where it's coming from) Ok, with all that out in the open, now I will continue with my review. We really had a great time and thoroughly enjoyed the food. We ordered several meats, but the chicken had the best flavor, it was phenomenal! However, we ordered it spicy and I wouldn't say there was much of a kick to it; but we didn't mind because the flavoring was delicious. We were so full when we left - it's truly a great value. It does get really smoky in there at times - I am not sure if our vent wasn't working or if they just have them running on extremely low power. It was slightly uncomfortable that the couple directly beside us did not order the BBQ. They kept fussing about the amount of smoke and at one point he got up to flag down a waitress to notify her of the smoke - she just looked at him and walked away. (I've dined at other Korean BBQ places in the past and hadn't experienced this problem with the smoke, so I am assuming it must have been our vent.) Too, the bus boys get pleasure out of seeing how much noise they can make while bussing the tables. I think they take the approach of throwing everything into the bucket as quickly and loudly as possible. Believe me they've mastered this technique. With all of this said, we went to satisfy our craving for Korean BBQ and that's what our tummies got - Pure Satisfaction!
