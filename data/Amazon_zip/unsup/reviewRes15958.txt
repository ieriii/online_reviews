I have never not enjoyed a meal here. A friend of mine and I wandered up there from our very comfortable Lakeview residence (it seemed so far away then, but it's just around the corner now)! I hadn't been in for a while, and when we moved to the neighborhood, it was like running into an old friend. They've got great food, great atmosphere. I've found a wine on their list that I adore (it's called Woop Woop, it's a Shiraz, go order it). Just go! You won't be disappointed.
