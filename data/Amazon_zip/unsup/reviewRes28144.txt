Nuevo Leon was the first restaurant I went to when I moved back recently from Washington, DC. My roommate and I had breakfast there, and I can honestly say that the only good tasting item I had there was the BBQ beef taco they gave us while waiting for our food. It hurts me to say it, but I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone--sorry, Nuevo Leon!
