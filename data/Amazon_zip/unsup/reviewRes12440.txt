As a native Chicagoan, growing up on deep dish pizza, I am always skeptical of thin-crust pizza, yet I decided to go to the Windy City Pizza Club meeting event. The nice thing about Pieces is that it allows their patrons to customize their own pizza and they have a large variety of pizza toppings and sauces to choose from; however I found the pizza at Piece to be just okay. The pizza was a flimsy and the white pizza was very oily. I recommend ordering the pizza well done. On a different note, the service was great; we had a very attentive server and we received our food very promptly. The leftovers reheated didn't taste as well as the evening we ordered it. I probably wouldn't go back, unless I was with a group of friends who wanted to go.
