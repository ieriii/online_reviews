If you eat in the Fine Dining area be prepared to be asked to remove your hat.. as I found out.. but beyond the casual dress requirement there is great seafood!!!!! (this is the only section I have ate at the other half of the place seems less formal and more bar oriented) I was blown away by the oysters! I ordered an oyster tray that allows you to try several different types of oysters... This was quite an experience since they all tasted extremely different! Everything was so good however and I would go back in a heart beat and often if it wasn't a bit pricey.
