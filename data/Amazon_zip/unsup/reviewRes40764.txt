This use to be a great place for authentic Vietnamese food at a reasonable price. Not any more. Ever since it has gotten more popular, the prices has gone up and the food has gone down hill. A bowl of pho is now $10. Really?!?!?! Salt and Pepper Shrimp made American Style?!?!? I use to frequent this place, but now I go down the street to Pho Lily for the REAL DEAL! And I don't have to share a table with strange people!
