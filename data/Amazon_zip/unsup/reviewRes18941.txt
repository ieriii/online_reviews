My buddy and I tried this place out on Friday night, and came in at just the right time. We nabbed two seats at the bar and maybe not 15-20 minutes later, this place was jumping with a 30-45 minute from what I heard.  This place has an amazing beer selection of rare brews that you can't find elsewhere in the city. They were featuring some Great Lakes beers on special while we were there. Overall, there were many great beers.  The reason we went her was for the burgers, because we've heard a lot of good things. They didn't disappoint. My buddy had the Fire Alarm Burger with a Veggie Burger and I had the Bad Apple Burger. Both were very good. I can see why the people were waiting to sit down and enjoy them. They had a great selection overall of specialty burgers.  Overall, a great place, and somewhere I'd probably go back to in the future.
