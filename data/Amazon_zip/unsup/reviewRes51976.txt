I'm still not getting the popularity of this place. I mean, I would wait in line for outstanding food but not from mediocre grub you can buy at any local supermarket. What are people paying for? I got to believe that it's tourists, first-time diners, radio contest winners or hospital patients willing to scarf down anything to avoid one more meal of turkey slices, mashed potatoes, dinner roll and chocolate pudding. They're supposedly famous for their stuffed pizza, (gag) but their thin crust is much better. I think pizza should be almost as good cold as it is out of the oven - the perfect Saturday morning breakfast. But here Gino's fails as well. I asked the waiter if the cheese sticks were made fresh. She said no and that went for the fried mushrooms as well. I would bet nothing else besides the pizza and ice are made from scratch. Well, to each his own. It's worth a try. But definitely not a place to go out of your way. By the way, I didn't pay for the meal and was a reluctant guest - so there.
