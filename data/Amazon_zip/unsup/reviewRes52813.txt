When we got there we were directed to their waiting lounge, which was a neat space behind the restaurant. It looks like a college apartment with nice candles lit and packed to the gills with a large party that was also waiting. We were quickly seated, they efficiently sat us and our waiter indicated the kitchen may need some time to catch up, which was fine since we needed time to look over the menu and get in to our BYOB goodies. I ordered the Ropa Vieja main course which was ok, but not worth the $16 I paid. It was bland and could have been cooked a bit more to make the meat more tender. I asked the waited about the flavor who indicated Cuban food usually isn't very spicy. I claim ignorance and hate to label an entire country's food based on this and a few other experiences, but I can't say I am all that crazy about Cuban food. I'll give it a try again, I am sure, but not much flavors there. Overall we enjoyed ourselves, the service was great, the BYOB is always welcome, and the atmosphere was lively. I'd go back if someone else wanted to, but again Cuban food isn't my thing, any other Latin American food I really enjoy.
