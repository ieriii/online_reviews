This is the best sushi I've had since i was in Los Angeles.The waitstaff is extremely helpful and made excellent recommendations. The sushi is impeccable and beautifully presented. Even the atmosphere is fun, with a diverse crowd of people ranging from business executives, to hipsters, to family parties.I highly recommend Coast. It is easily my favorite sushi restaurant in Chicago.
