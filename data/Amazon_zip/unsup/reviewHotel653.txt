Yes, the cookies at check-in are nice. The hotel is nice. I thought the room decor was actually better than the W Lakeshore which we had stayed at the week before. Clean. Employees were really friendly and helpful. It sucks that so many hotels make their guest pay for wifi, it's not very hospitable. It is available in the bar area though which is weirdly placed in the lobby. For a decent price I would stay here again and I guess that is all that matters.
