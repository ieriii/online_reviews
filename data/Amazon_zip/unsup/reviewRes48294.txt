Eaten here 4 times and it has always been good. On two occasions, it was outstanding. Servers are always friendly and have good recommendations, they do an excellent job with beer pairings. And, the beer pairings are one of the main reasons to go to Publican. The only place in the US that I have ever seen Bayerischer Bahnhof Gose, which is an incredible beer. One of the occasions I was there and they were out, the server recommended 1809 Berlinerweiss. Chicarrones are excellent. Love the oyster selections. Seasonal menu always has good choices.
