Yelp, you really steered me wrong on this one. We walked in the door and were greeted promptly, and seated immediately. The experience started off well as we were provided with fresh bread, which was actually very delicious, as soon as we sat down. Our waitress took our drink order quickly and returned quickly. But this is where the promptness ends. We waited about 10 minutes before our server returned and we then finally ordered. The table next to us that ordered after us also received their food before we did. And they had more people at their table. We waited at least 20 minutes for our dishes, which were good, but were your average Italian food. As soon as our plates were removed, we waited another 20 minutes for our server to return to ask if we would like dessert. we were hesitant again about the wait, but we decided that we really wanted that dessert. This time the wait was only 5 minutes before our dessert was brought out. Once again, another 10 minute wait for the check. I wish I could say that I loved this place as much as other Yelpers do, but sadly, it was the worst service I've ever experienced at a restaurant.
