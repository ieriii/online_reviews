I LOVE Meli's Cafe! I practically dream of coming home to Chicago for only two places: Giordano's (naturally) and ALWAYS Meli's Cafe. I'm not a big coffee drinker yet I love their coffee. The muffins of the day are usually great, especially the espresso one. Love the french toast, love the scramble specials. The wait time for a table becomes a distant memory once you sit down. You'll really enjoy and remember this place.
