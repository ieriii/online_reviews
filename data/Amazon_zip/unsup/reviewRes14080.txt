No, it doesn't live up to the 2+ years of anticipation. And it opened as a flurry of new brewpubs and upscale drinking establishments were invading the north side. But they make a tasty burger-- actually cooked medium well, as requested-- and their apps hit the spot. Service was good, all things considered. Reservations weren't being taken so, even on a Tuesday, it was crowded. Our large group split up, 5 of us crashing a booth intended for 4. The server didn't mind us crowding the aisle, she was friendly and efficient. Here's a surprise: the home brew's not so great. I had their wheat beer, which was fine but a AA league selection to Piece's MLB.
