If you want a hot dog dont go here. Their hot dogs suck and they are known for their sausage not hot dogs. The sausage is worth trying if you like different kinds of sausage, if your into good ol fashion Italian sausage this is not the place for you. The duck fat fries taste like salty fresh cut fries from any real good hot dog stand so their good but they taste the same as anywhere else. The line is insanely long, their hours suck, and they put unmelted cubes of cheese on your sausage. I know a lot of people love this place but Im sorry, its awful. Frank Campeglia (The Food Club)
