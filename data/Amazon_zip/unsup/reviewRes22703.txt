What can I say that the hundreds other haven't.  I loved my experience at Irazu. We got there early after work and the crowd was small. Brought a bottle of wine and Omar brought us out some chips and salsa and took our order for guacamole immediately. After guac we decided to go for the new empanada sampler appetizer. Super crispy and extra doughy. While I would pass on the chicken in the future, the sweet plantain and spinach and cheese empanadas were excellent. I have to point out that the Pico De Gallo served with the empanadas was AMAZING. It had a ton of cilantro and fresh cut tomatoes. I will definitely ask for this in the future for chip dipping. Our excellent server, Omar was working the whole room and as he took our order made it a point to let us know, customers preference rules at Irazu. I felt no guilt as I constructed THE WORLD'S MOST PERFECT BURRITO EVER! It was a large warm tortilla overfilled with Black beans, YELLOW rice, Cheese, Avocados, Sour Cream, CHORIZO, Spinach and Mushrooms. And yes the rumors are true, I could barely finish half it was soo huge. My friend loved her veggie burrito but my other friend did not like her fried pork dish. It was completely over-fried (Is this possible? Apparently so.). We all loved the side of sweet plantains.  At the end I was disappointed that I was too full for a "famous" oatmeal shake but Omar told me I could pop in anytime to grab one on the go. A few minutes later, a bread pudding was magically ordered and it was a block of thick rich cinnamon deliciousness. Done and done. The damage for 3 girls and a ridiculous amount of food was minimal and Irazu has a new cheerleader in me.  *Can't wait to come back in the summer to booze up the shakes on the patio. **I would like to point out although we got there nice and early, Irazu was nice enough to let us sit there for about 2 hours and truly enjoy our meal and conversation even though the line was out the door.
