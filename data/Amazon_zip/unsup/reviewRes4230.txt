Chicago classic. Simply put- great diverse live jazz, responsible priced drinks and in general low cover charge. They street parking is decent, meters- no valet. It is a great place to take a date, or go with a group of friends. It's a cool place. You will recognize interior from a few movies, "Theif" is one starring James Caan.
