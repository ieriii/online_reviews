I'm conflicted about what to write for Gilt Bar.  Friday 5P, Fall 2010: My mom and I wanted to meet for a drink near the Merchandise Mart and decided to check out Gilt Bar. It's about 5:30 and there are many open tables. We were told that they were booked for the night and had something available at 10P. Um, no thank you. Wed or Thurs 6P, Winter 2011: Met a friend for drinks and were seated. They have a cocktail with Pimms, sold! Had the Ham and Cheese fondue, delicious. Can't wait to come back! Yesterday: Made a reservation for 4 people on Open Table and ended up inviting another friend, making our party 5 people. When I called to make sure that they could accommodate, they couldn't guarantee. I told them that we wouldn't mind if we are a little tight at our table and asked if they put us at a table where we wouldn't intrude on our neighbors. Again, couldn't guarantee our (or anyone else's) comfort. The woman I spoke to had a bit of an attitude and wouldn't budge. The whole conversation was ridiculous and silly. I canceled our reservation and we went somewhere else.  I don't really believe in writing a restaurant review about an experience you had on the phone and I do hope to go back to Gilt Bar because the one time I was able to sit down I did like it a lot. I'm not going to say I'm never going back because our group last night was disappointed that we couldn't be accommodated at Gilt Bar. It would be nice if the people that answered the phones were a little bit kinder and did not cop an attitude. I called an equally popular and similar restaurant that competes with Gilt Bar and the woman that answered the phone there was very kind and was willing to work with a patron.  Long/short, I most likely lost my battle with Gilt Bar last night. Someone else probably took our table and they were full all night. I'm glad that they are successful, but don't be a bitch about it.
