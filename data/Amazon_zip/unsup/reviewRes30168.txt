Ok, let's get the downers out of the way: very loud (I.e. Had to lip read to 'hear' dining partner across the table), but then again, it was a Saturday night at 730pm. Miso soup came cold. That's it for the downside. Trendy, hip ambience. Groovy decor. Waitstaff and runners amazing. All apps and sushi were very good. Great drinks. Perhaps not "the greatest sushi I've ever had", but the whole experience was overall pleasant, and I would return....jet maybe not on a Saturday night!
