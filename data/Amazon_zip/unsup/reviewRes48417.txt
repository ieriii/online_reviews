Food was tasty, but our experience was ruined by cold, awkward, bad service. I happened to be dining with 2 chef friends, and we are all food and service educated. Our server was knowledgeable but condescending and seemed to want to tell us what to order rather than suggest.. However, he mistook nectarine jam on the charcuterie plate for ratatouille? Also, the side staff ~ bussers and food runners were rushed and abrupt.  I don't like or want new side plates for every shared course. They also wanted to pull plates off the table that weren't finished? Also, he addressed us as 'team' everytime he stopped by? Uh, that's just dumb. He explained it was a communal table thing. Which makes no sense. Decor is minimal and pleasant, but the din was terrible. Communal, open seating is fine, but noise reduction is a necessary component. Busy and active can add to ambience but no one likes sound bouncing all over the room. Love Avec another of their restaurants and would go back there in a heartbeat. Publican is a miss for me and I won't be returning. PROS: Pork rinds, white sausage plate, chef's oyster selection, pickle plate. Again, all the food was tasty but not mind-blowing. CONS: Bad, bad service, loud atmosphere
