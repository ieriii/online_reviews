Went to Calo Ristorante for the first time in a long time (since the remodel!) I enjoyed an excellent pomegranate martini and some wonderful gnocci con ricotta. I ate with a large party and everyone enjoyed the food and the ambiance. Laid back service but still efficient. The remodel did this one a load of good.
