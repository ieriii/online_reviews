Finally made it here after years of driving by saying I wanted to go. The food did not disappoint everything we had was delicious. Ropa vieja was such a great app, the skirt steak w chimichurri was great for my entree. I think the best entree on the table was the braised short ribs w creamy polenta. Definitely will be back whenever we have a special occasion and are looking for a Hispanic fusion meal. The decor and art is such a cool setting and really blew us away. Some of the large artwork is incredible. Just sorry I didn't make it here before now. Not much else to say that wasn't in the 800 other great reviews.
