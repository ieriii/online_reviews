First of all I had a wonderful meal here. However, if you are I love to go stuff my face on bone in filets at Gibson's type of person, this may not suit your needs. You need to be prepared that you are entering foodie zone and knowing that going into my meal I thoroughly enjoyed my experience here. The service is outstanding without being too stuffy or overbearing. My only disappointing factor was the oyster flight, which really didn't impress me much, but I'm pretty hot sauce and saltine crackers when it comes to that. The black bass with yakisoba noodles was awesome and portioned perfectly. The kentucky fried pheasant is deserving of the hype. Overall a wonderful place.
