Ive been here twice with my friend, I suggest early arrival or expect to wait! We literally got here 15min before they opened and there was a line down the block...luckily neither of us is picky and we always opt to sit at the bar, and fortunately have gotten seats immediately. I believe we tried all of their cazuelas, perfect for two people, almost like sampling a little bit of everything. I wish i could remember which of the dishes i enjoyed the most but the menu changes frequently, if not seasonally. Either way, its all good!! The drink menu changes frequently too so dont hesitate or second guess trying a drink because i may not be there the next time you come back to visit and you will have lost the opportunity to taste it!! I do remember a tamarindo margarita they served at one point, it was delicious and innovative. Definately a place i will be returning to. Oh and i just wanted to add, one of the tastiest micheladas and largest ones ive had!!
