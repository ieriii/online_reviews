Their pizza is average but their customer service is horrible! I ordered a medium super-veggie which was for $25.20 but a family member was allergic to mushrooms so we told them no mushrooms and they charged us $3.00 to subtract an ingredient! I talked to the manager and told him it doesn't even make economic sense to charge a customer money for removing an ingredient. Obviously he was incapable of doing anything and give us a lot of BS of having a busy kitchen and charging extra for customizing orders. I'm never going to any Giordano's again. I don't care for the $3.00 but it's the principle!
