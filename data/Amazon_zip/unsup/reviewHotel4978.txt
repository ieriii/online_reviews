We stayed here for four nights and enjoyed it. The room was complete, clean and well designed. It was small and on the back corner near the train - so the train makes a lot of noise about every 20 min. So our room wasn't a top of the line room, but we still liked it a lot. We had views and the flat screen TV in the room worked well. The location of the hotel is first rate and the they are trying to provide a complete service.
