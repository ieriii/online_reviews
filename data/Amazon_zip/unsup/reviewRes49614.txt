OK, so we all know that Bin 36 is a good place to go for a glass or flight of wine, but after several meals there (I'd say I've gone there once or twice a year for the last 5 years), I've come to the conclusion that the food is really good and gets overshadowed by the wine a bit. I've never had a bad meal there and most have been really good. Since the last time I was there, they've added a cheese bar with a really wide array of courmet cheeses and the ability to get flights of cheese as an appetizer. This past trip, 2 flights of wine, a flight of cheese, my steak and her swordfish came to almost exactly $100 after tax and before tip. So it's definitely reasonable, and I think it's just a unique restaurant experience. Service is friendly, unpretentious, and knowledgeable (well, I'm not exactly a sommelier, but I thought he knew what he was talking about). One of my favorites in Chicago.
