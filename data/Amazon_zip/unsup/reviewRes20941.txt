Pretentious, expensive, and not that good. Even my cocktail, the Gage Old Fashioned, was so unappetizing that I didn't finish it despite it $13 price tag. This is a place to get unusual proteins like antelope and elk. I chose a meatless dish, because it was the only thing that sounded fresh and light. It was neither. The plate included a large zucchini sliced the long way and grilled, acccompanied by a barley-chanterelle melange that included cherry tomatoes and tiny squashes with the flowers still on. The chanterelles and squashes and grilled cherry tomatoes were very tasty. The barley, well...have you ever been presented with a heap of richly-scented, dark-colored barley in the middle of summer? Paired with all those fresh vegetables, it didn't make sense, and it was way too heavy. My heirloom-tomato soup dissapointed, too. In fact, the best thing about it were the two bullets of fried cheese in the bottom of the dish. The coffee-stuffed doughnuts were weird and pretentious and lying in a sandpit of sugar and gritty "dried coffee." I hear the burgers are good, though.
