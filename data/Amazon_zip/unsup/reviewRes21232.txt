I'll add my two cents to the hundreds of reviews for XOCO. I heard it was mexican but to me, it seemed more like an upscale lunch spot with a deli vibe. The complexity to the ordering and seating process was a bit unnecessary, and I assume the large queue they create is to create buzz. The vegetarian options were lacking, and the prices were horrifying. I assumed I was going to get something of great quality with a price that high. I was sure wrong! What I got was a salty mess and had to eat it in a cramped rowdy place getting bumped into all the time. To make things worse, when I told the cashier that I was looking for veggie options she twisted her face up like I was making some kind of bizzarre request, making me feel terribly uncomfortable. I will not return to this overpriced hell hole.
