After we finished I didn't even care that I spent 70 minutes in line, it was after all a Saturday afternoon at 2pm. After hearing multiple recommendations I knew it would be good, but Xoco definitely surpassed any expectations I had. Bread on the tortas was toasted perfectly. Ahhhbsolutely wonderful :-) No question 5 stars The meal consisted of: Chips and Frontera Guac, Pepito torta, Suckling pig torta, Chocolate espresso, Churros and only for $20 a person. Wouldn't have changed a thing
