This place is only a couple of blocks from my project site, so we often go here for drinks at the bar. We just recently spent quite a bit on a holiday party that I was a tad underwhelmed by. The service was good and things were set up well, if we were 5. The tables and chairs belonged in a pre-school classroom. We had "tall boys" too, but those were just for standing. After 5 hours in heels I wanted to sit and enjoy my drink in peace. But I felt like a 5 year old sitting at the table while all of the grown-ups walked by.  Side note... they don't decorate except for some white tablecloths, a table votive and red napkins. It's all DIY, which was ok, but would have been nice if they did something for the holidays. Anyway... The food was only ok. The chips tasted like stale poo (not that I officially know what that tastes like), but everything else was decent. It's close and convenient, but it might tell you something that they were available for a holiday party 2 weeks before the event. 3 stars because the servers were really really nice and they allowed us to extend our party for 2 hours, which means that they're also pretty flexible. Overall things were pretty good - from a work holiday party perspective. I have no idea what the rooms look like, but hopefully they have furniture made for adults.
