This place is an upscale but basic hotel. If you want a comfortable room, clean bed, and good location for a decent price, this is your place. It's not a resort; while it's very nice the rooms are pretty small and simple and you won't want to hang out in the hotel. But if you are just looking for a good place to lay your head after traipsing around Chi-town, then go for it. Clean, comfortable bed, good amenities, free mediocre coffee in the morning, etc.
