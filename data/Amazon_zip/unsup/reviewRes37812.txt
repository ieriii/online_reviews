I have now enjoyed the best deep dish Chicago style pie anywhere. As a West coaster we must make due with the few choices available to us. Once in Chicago I had to do my best to eat all of the pizza I could, and I am glad Giordano's was on my pilgrimage. The crust was buttery and flaky, almost like a savory pastry, filled with awesome ingredients. The cheese was creamy in a way that made it perfect, and it didn't cool down into a clumpy mess. Best of all was a stellar tomato sauce, rich and tangy, I could almost get double sauce to enjoy it more. Giordano's best any West coast pie and certainly was tops of the Chicago offerings for me.
