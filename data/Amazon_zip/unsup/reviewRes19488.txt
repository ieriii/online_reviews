Not disappointed in the least. Also, there is no line at 4:30 on a weekday, so if you want to eat right away, have an early dinner. I had the Pepito, and the meat on this sandwich was so flavorful, and so tender. The whole sandwich was perfectly balanced--great cheese, lovely onions, and deliciously spicy pickled jalapenos--and the bread itself was crunchy and soft in all the right ways. We also got chips and salsa--the green salsa is KILLER, btw. A cup of it comes with some of the sandwiches, and it's great. I also had a side salad, and it was nice. A little too much oil and not enough acid, but good nonetheless. Plain, but nice. Sam got a drinking chocolate, which was small, but more than adequate for his chocolate needs. He said it was delicious. We're going back, it's only a question of when. Just SO good. Prices are higher, if you're against paying for quality and want cheap and bountiful. Don't go here expecting to get a 12 inch sub for $5. It's not that kind of place. But if you're into quality, this is the real deal. YUM!
