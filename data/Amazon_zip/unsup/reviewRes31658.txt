I have never eaten a vegan burger before and as a meat lover laughed at the idea. However, in a quest to eat healthier I went to Chicago Diner on a friends recommendation. The food was great and I realized I had been wrong all along about vegan food being bland. The atmosphere had a very calming feel to it and I would love to go back again. Thanks!
