The Artt of Pizza is as good as it gets for deep dish. I am formerly from Hazel Crest, and have since moved to Ohio...every time I come back to Chicago for a visit, I order 3 half cooked deep dish pies to bring back home with me...yeah, it's that good! They are extremely friendly, and are very careful to take the extra steps in wrapping up my pies for the long trek back to Ohio. I would rate Art of Pizza 10 stars, but they only give you 5!
