Gino's deep dish has been on my bucket list since I moved to Chicago. This review might be a little biased since I'm more of a fan of thin crust but still a huge pie lover. After an obnoxiously long wait at 3:00 in the afternoon, we were seated and ordered a medium mushroom pizza. Pizza, just ok. The sauce was seasoned really well, I could eat that alone on close to anything but the pizza dough was kind of dry and flakey tasting, I was not a fan. My mom, aunt and grandma all loved it but after having other deep dish in the city (Giordano's, Lou Malanti's) it didn't really rank with me. Sorry Gino's, still glad I got to finally try you!
