I am perfectly okay with waiting for an hour to order and eat a hot dog. I know, a HOT DOG! But I've waited longer for worse food. That said, make Hot Doug's a social event, take friends, take a book, take the thrill of people watching. It is absolutely worth the wait. The dogs themselves are tasty morsels of awesome that left me dreaming about their plump snappy goodness the minute I took the last bite. The selection of dog's is indeed incredible, from yr basic dog to gourmet sausages. Don't be afraid to get it with everything and skip the ketchup; after all, this is Chicago. And don't forget the fries. Man can not live on encased meats alone and heaven know's I've tried. I didn't expect the large order of fries to be, well, so large. But that's not a complaint, since I love fries and it's likely that I could eat all of mine and half of yours when I've finished what's on my plate. They were the tastiest bag of fries I've ever had, making it more than easy to polish the whole lot of them off. They're everything fries should be, including fresh and hot. I've eaten a lot of dogs (and burgers) in my life and there are a multitude of sins that can be forgiven if you're fries are up to par. To have both a good dog AND good fries at Hot Doug's is a transcendental experience.
