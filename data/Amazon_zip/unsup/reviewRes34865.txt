We did carry-out from here the other night on a recommendation from a friend and I must say we were pleasantly surprised. Like most people have said the location is definitely 'suspect' . And the ambiance doesn't do the place any justice either. The food itself is what sets it apart. We ordered 4 rolls and the coconut shrimp appitizer which were delicious. Great portions, excellent presentation, and an excellent price for what you get.
