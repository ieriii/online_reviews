I think I may be a bit biased because I spent of all the time I spent in South America trying similar (and the same) kinds of cuisines. Either way, cute place, lots of variety, and friendly servers. You'll notice I am a super big fan of great service. It makes up for a lot of other things that can go wrong in a night. Soo this spot is cozy with conversation, music piping in the background, and orders coming up and out. We ordered the Tostone Rellenos, Ropa Vieja, and the Pargo. My friend loved everything he ordered. I enjoyed the red sauce and shrimp of my Tostone Rellenos and the Pargo (huge fried red snapper) was pretty tasty, or at least the skin was seasoned well. The portions are huge! Our waiter was fantastic though. She made sure we had everything we needed and beyond. The BYOB makes it an added bonus. I definitely left full and would come back but would explore something on the lunch side of things. This is a bit pricey for dinner, but a good experience nonethless.
