My date and I dined at Shaw's on Thursday night. Our reservations were honored right away. The waiter was a little slow. The waiter did apologized. We order calamari which was great but it was the smallest size that I have ever had. My date ordered the crab cake which was excellent. I ordered the fried shrimp which was more than enough 8 very large prawns. Fries came with the shrimp but they were awful. They were over cooked and very hard to digest. This was my first time in the formal dining room. I usually eat in the oyster bar. For now on I will stick with the oyster bar. I will order the Lobster rolls wish are great (no fries).
