Sushi was pretty good - not the best I've had in chicago, but pretty good. The variety of rolls was good. Service was average. Ambiance is nice - a little dark and if you don't like too much noise, it might not be your place, but it was great for a Saturday evening in my opinion. I like the BYOB. If you're a big drinker, be prepared for the limit (1 bottle per couple or 1 6-pack). One suggestion would be if you are going and know you will have a 20-30 min wait for a table, you can pop open your poison while waiting. I would definitely recommend giving this place a shot.
