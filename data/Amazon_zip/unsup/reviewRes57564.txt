Consistently great. This place is run like a machine, with waiters all over the place and food delivered without a long wait. The place is huge, and it is always packed. Festive atmosphere, with Opa! yelled throughout. The saganaki is a must-have, and the basic Greek chicken (riganati) is excellent. Never been to the location in Lombard, but the Greektown location (Halsted and Adams) is outstanding. Great for a date, a business lunch, or a family dinner.
