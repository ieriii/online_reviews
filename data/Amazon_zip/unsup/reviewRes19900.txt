The Gage is a wonderful British inspired bar and eatery. The feel and overall vibe of this place manages to be warm & cozy in a slightly upscale and aesthetically pleasing environment. I love to come here and just curl up at the bar with a delicious drink and catch a soccer game, Their list of libations is extensive and creative and their menu stays true to its British roots. I highly recommend the potato soup and fish & chips.
