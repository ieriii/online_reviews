Food decent but the service is terrible. We were sat at table promptly but it was all down hill after that. We never got water. They took forever to take our order. They brought one of our main beef dishes and after waiting and waiting for our chicken dish 30 minutes had gone by. We asked about the other entrees and we were told they had run out of chicken and by the way sorry we didn't tell you sooner. We were given a menu to select something else but they never came back to take our revised order. We paid for the one entree and left never to return again. I don't know who their focus is but I know it is not their customer.
