BEST THINGS + Mexican-thick champurrado: this is more of a dessert... it's thick and flavorful... and I wish I could just swim in a VAT of it. MMM. + DRINKS, i.e. whatever the agua del dia is, get it (I had the mint/lime/melon and it was sublimeeee) + DESSERTS: I like how Rick Bayless puts a little punch into classic Mexican desserts (tres leches, but with chocolate chips and lemon verbena) or gets inspired by what's seasonally available (coconut rice pudding with lime, thai basil, and grilled peaches. South American cooking? No. But tasty dessert-making indeed.) EH, OVERRATED - I got the pork belly torta, which was nice because it had good ingredients (arugula, zucchini) but it was soooo underseasoned. It needed a good pinch of salt and something else. Also, I have a problem with paying $12 for a sandwich. I don't know. It just didn't have... oomph. Underwhelming for sure. - Price/value for food/quality/quantity in general. I got the torta and my sis got the seafood caldo but we wanted more, so we paid for kind of pricey chips and dip. - So maybe I came without doing my research, or I just don't know about outdoor dining, but I feel like somebody should have informed me that Xoco isn't a "sit-down" restaurant. I don't even know if I should have tipped 20% for a lady to (very attentively, I've give her that) manage a line for available seats and for the servers to tell me that I needed to get my own water refilled inside and I'd have to go back to the register to add something to my order. GAH confusion and unexpected inconvenience. I get more service at a Johnny Rockets? SOLID(ish) The seafood caldo. The freshwater fish taste was a little off-putting (just my preference) but there was more bang for your buck that the tortas, I think. Could have benefitted from like, a piece of crostini or something though.
