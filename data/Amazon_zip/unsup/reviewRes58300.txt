Let me start by saying its a nice place you can go get some beers and pizza. BUT this is not by any means Chicago or Deep Dish pizza, this is PAN pizza. Sorry guys Deep Dish pizza is not a bunch of dough, for all you who say this is Chicago's best deep dish you are sadly mistaken. For all you out of towners who thought you had deep dish in Chicago you were wrong and wronged by who ever told you that or took you there. I went there with a friend who told me I had to come and try this place as it was his favorite, it was a good pan pizza, but I was expecting deep dish.  deep dish can be found at giordanos, lous, ginos, ect... not saying those are my favorites but they are deep dish. In closing Do NOT go to pequods if you are looking for deep dish, but they do have pan pizza which is about 2 of dough with a little sauce and cheese.
