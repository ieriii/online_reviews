Throughout our adventures throughout the city of Chicago, XOCO is the only dining establishment that we felt deserved a second visit. To be honest, our first visit to the restaurant was on a Saturday and neither of us were even aware that Rick Bayless and his famous Frontera restaurant were in walking proximity to our hotel. Our group had simply wandered about downtown and noticed a line formed in front of a restaurant that stretched halfway down the block so we decided that it would probably be worth our while to follow the masses. On the first visit, we ordered the Gunthorp chicken torta, a chicken torta with black beans and avocado complemented with a light refreshing salsa. Fresh from the oven and savory to the taste buds, the torta raised our hopes about Chicago dining after our previous night of failure. In addition, if the hibiscus and lemongrass drink is available during your visit, it is definitely worth an order. A bit sweet, but the flavor is deep enough when complemented with lemongrass that it is simply a refreshing drink especially when stepping out of weather ranging above the nineties. As for the second visit, we ordered the ahogada torta, also from the wood burning oven, a tender pork torta presented in a spicy chile sauce. Even for regular diners of spicy foods, the ahogada is truly a meal with that heavy spice that warms the entirety of your body. While it is not a spiciness that will cause an awkward runny nose at the table, it may leave quite a few patrons clamoring for water between each bite of the dish. Truthfully, if you visit Chicago without visiting XOCO it would have been a waste of a trip.
