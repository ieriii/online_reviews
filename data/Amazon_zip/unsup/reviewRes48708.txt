The Publican is really good, but - for this meat lover - it was a bit like seeing a movie after all of your friends have told you how great it is. I really enjoyed it, but wasn't blown away because I was expecting it to be good. Don't get me wrong, it is. Pork rinds were a fun starter. As for entrees, get the chicken. No really. I never order chicken at a restaurant (unless it is fried and I am in a southern joint), but it is so freakin' good. Get it. It comes with sausage and fries and it could definitely feed two people. The waiter recommended the chicken and the sweet breads. Didn't try the sweet breads, but if they were on par with the chicken, I'm sure they are great. Casual atmosphere and communal seating. Great beer selection, too.
