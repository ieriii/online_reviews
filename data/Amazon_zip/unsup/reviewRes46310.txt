I'm in LOVE!!!! This is definitely a cousin to the Cheesecake factory. This restaurant is so decorative and in a great location. The menu is very extensive but its sure to have something that even the pickiest eater would love. Food, service and drinks are the BOMB!!!! Great place to have lunch or dinner after a nice stroll down michigan avenue.
