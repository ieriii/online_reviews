I have been to Nana's about five times. Three lunches and two dinners. I don'tunderstand the rave reviews about this place. While the food can at times be very good and creative, the pricing, hit & miss service and problems with the food----incomplete orders, unauthorized substituting of ingredients and inept preparation,have caused me to move on. There are way too many dining options in Chicagothan overpaying ay Nana's
