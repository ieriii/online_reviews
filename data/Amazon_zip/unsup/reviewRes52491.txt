Wow. Why would a couple of vegetarians hit up a Brazillian Steakhouse? Well, it was a birthday gift for my sister-in-law and she LOVES meat. In fact, I don't think she ate anything BUT meat the entire meal! I saw the spread at the salad bar (they have ev-ery-thing) and made the mistake of eating a HUGE salad before my husband told me to visit the hot foods bar! We were stuffed when we left. But everything is so good, it is hard to limit yourself. Pair that with amazing waitstaff and drinks, and you have a truely celebratory evening.
