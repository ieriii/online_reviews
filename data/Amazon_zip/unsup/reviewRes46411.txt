Usually this place is decent, but today there was a toothpick shard in my sandwich. When brought to the waiter's attention, he took the plate back to the kitchen...only to have a manager return to the table with it to basically try to justify the presence of said toothpick, shoving the plate under my nose as though I was a naughty puppy who needed to have his nose rubbed in his mess. I don't care what your justification is for having toothpicks lost in the food - it shouldn't happen. To add insult to injury, they still charged us for the meal. Goodbye, Grand Lux!
