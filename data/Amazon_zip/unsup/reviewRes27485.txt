Love this place! The food is fantastic! You don't find better food and service than here! The prices are great to! You can get a filling meal here for under $8. Plus it's BYOB which helps keep the cost down. They will bring you a bucket of ice to keep your beer cold.  I don't know anywhere else that I can go and eat a great meal that fills me up and drink beer and the bill is under $15 for 2 people. Love it!
