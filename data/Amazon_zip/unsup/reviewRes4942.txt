I love this place! I go here every time I am in Chicago and it is always perfect. They specialize in cheese, wine and swine - life is good!! They have these fresh roasted beets with creamy goat cheese and pistachios on it that make me dream of these beets all the time. I swear they are addictive. Then the fresh cured meats and cheese and little toasts - there is not one thing on the menu that I hate! I love it all!!!!
