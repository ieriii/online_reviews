I started out with the Blushing Geisha cocktail. It was pretty weak and bland. I ordered Toast and Jam according to the review here and it was alright. The toast was crispy, the jam was tasty and spicy but both of them together just did not work for me. I do not like the texture of the jam part. We had some sushi rolls. Firecracker was good. The rest was just okay. The worst part is the service. Our waiter seemed nice at first. We were there for a party of 12 and asked him to split the bill. He said he could do one bill for 4 people. When the bill came, we had problem with our bill because there was something we did not order on our bill. He seemed annoyed and tried to explain. He split the cost of the appetizer that he thought it would be for the table to our bill too. It was little so I did not argue but to be honest this is not our share and he did not even come around to ask what we wanted for the appetizer. We ordered our appetizer at the same time that we ordered our meal. Also, we were charged for the food that other people ordered on our bill too. He gave us free dessert on the house but still for the 20% tips charged to our bill. He could have done better.
