The portions are big, the service wonderful, and the food creative. If you like the various parts of pig...you must try this place. They have everything from pig shoulder to pig ear to pig tail. We had the pig tail, pig shoulder, bone marrow spread, and beets. The beets were delicious and a good change to all the meat. I would recommend doing a 1:1 ratio of veggie to meat dish as the meat dishes are heavy. We also saw someone order the turkey leg which was enormous for the pricetag!
