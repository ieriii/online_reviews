PASTA HEAVEN! I have been here a handful of times. Sometimes it is great and sometimes it is AMAZING. Great place for a date or for a group. BYOB which keeps the cost at bay. Haven't found a better place for handmade pasta and savory italian sauces. I've never had a bad experience. GO you won't regret it. To finish get the tiramisu.
