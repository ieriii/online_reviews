Came here on a date of sorts on recommendation from Chicago magazine, which listed The Gage as one of the best new restaurants in the city. It was certainly a fine establishment, and one you could easily dine in for $20 a person, or $60, depending on your mood.  The starters listed included some great standouts, such as the antelope tartar that we ordered which included a selection of mustards to pair with the raw game. The meat was delicious and bare, very good! We shared main courses of roasted chicken and whitefish with sliced truffles. The chicken was juicy and tender and very good. The whitefish was a real standout since whitefish is one of those things that comes in two varieties: bad/mediocre and friggin amazing. There is no middle ground. This fish was of the latter, cooked just right and faking into moist piece of delectable flesh punctuated by the savory earthiness of the healthy grating of rare black truffles. Service was good and swift. Water was refilled regularly and a request for a slice of lemon was quickly filled with an entire lemon, sliced into fifths. Our meal, with drinks, ran to about $55 a head, but I imagine that had we come and had something off of the sandwich menu, which would have been more than satisfying, we'd have come out for about half that.
