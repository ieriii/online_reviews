The hype for this place is completely unfounded. My husband and I have eaten here twice and walked out once. The food is mediocre and way overpriced, but the service is absolutely terrible. We have always felt a little uneasy and unwelcome here, but our most recent visit was particularly awful. The restaurant was empty so they sat us by the window (great). 2 minutes later they asked if we would move tables with no explanation (wtf?). We moved to a new table and put out a bottle of wine. The waitress gave us a disapproving look, which prompted us to ask if the restaurant was a byob (we knew it was since we'd brought bottles the previous 2 times). She didn't reply and turned and walked away. Baffling. We sat for maybe 5 minutes before she returned and said, "Do you know what you want yet?" I know waitresses don't always have the time or energy to fuss over each table, but this waitress was simply hostile. We said we did not feel welcome and we walked out. Perhaps this is an isolated case of a waitress having a bad day. But it's enough for us to never return and to encourage our friends to stay away. If the food were excellent and cheap then we'd probably overlook the service, but it isn't. Semiramis is a much better choice anyway. It is right down the street with superior food and consistently great service.
