I wish i didnt live in California just so i that i could go to the bongo room brunch every weekend. I think i ate until i almost threw up. Yea it was snowing and freezing and we had to wait outside for about 15 mins, but it was totally worth it. We ordered one of almost everything and passed it around. Im going to have to buy another plane ticket to visit my sister more often!
