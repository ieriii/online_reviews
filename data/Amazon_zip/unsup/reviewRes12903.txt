Apparently I need to visit this place for brunch, because the reviews are great. However, I went for dinner, and was not impressed at all witht he food. It didn't help that there was a loud obnoxious group sitting right next to us, but given the reviews, I expected very flavorful food. My entree, and that of my fiancee, was pretty bland and boring. The atmosphere is nice, but just did not compensate for the food taste.
