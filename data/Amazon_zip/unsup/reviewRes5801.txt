Ice cream and cakey cake! Yeah, that has nothing to do with my review. I just felt like singin'! This was a delivery order so keep that in mind. Girlfriend from out of town got a salad which was huge, and I ordered a bowl of the crab and shrimp bisque. That was a mistake. I should have ordered a vat of soup because it is not really polite to lick the container it came in. But I did. We both got steaks, mine well and her's medium well with a blue cheese crust. Both came perfectly cooked to order. I had the potatoes au gratin (oh la la, so good!) She got broccoli, which I thought was undercooked. Crunch crunch. It was a bit pricey with delivery and all, but being able to eat such a delicious meal, delivered to your door steaming hot: priceless.
