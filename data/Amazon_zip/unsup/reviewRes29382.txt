I love Pasta Bowl. Everything I've ever ordered here has been fresh and delicious. Even better, the food is so well-priced. Your meal will likely cost you around $10, unless you order an appetizer (in which case, I recommend the Bruschetta or the Tuffo Saporito). Their Mixed Greens salad is also incredible. The staff is so nice and accomodating to most substitutions. Oh, and I love their Tuesday 1/2 price wine night, too.
