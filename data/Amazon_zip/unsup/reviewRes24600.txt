Geja's advertises itself as a romantic restaurant, so it is not surprising that most of the tables were full of diners celebrating birthdays and anniversaries. It really doesn't matter but sometimes the camera flashes combined with all the mirrors on the walls gets a bit overwhelming. The cheese fondue is pretty good except that they use way too much cheddar. The cheddar overpowers the gruyere which is the more superior cheese. It's too bad that they don't just leave out the cheddar altogether. The meat fondue is not worth it at all. If I did it again (which I won't), I would skip the meat all together. The problem is that they don't use broth, they use oil. Who deep-fries their meat and fish? The cuts were good but it was a huge waste to deep-fry lobster. They give a nice variety of dipping sauces; however, the butter dipping sauce is a disappointment. The chocolate fondue was excellent. Also, the service and atmosphere were wonderful. It turns out to be a lot of food. If you are going there on a date, just keep in mind that you consuming copious amounts of cheese, oil, chocolate and even whip cream for your coffee.
