Simply put: Revolution is an institution. There is no way that one can spend time in Logan Square and NOT hear about it. The beer is absolutely delicious (I'm partial to the Eugene and Anti-Hero IPA), and when I lived in the area this was a weekly hangout. Great food, great personality, and a definite spot to take visitors. Whenever I have a friend or family member come into town, Revolution is on the list. One of the key reasons why I miss Logan Square; if you decide to pass, you're missing out. Also, their brunch is great! Nothing quite like a Beermosa (Bottom Up Wit and OJ) to kick off the day!
