Wow, everyone below is pretty much going to hate me. Davanti Enoteca, not impressed. Maybe it's my fault. So much hype had been given that my expectations were too high? The night started out ok, with a shared bottle of wine that was, as listed many times, priced fairly well. There was a good selection and cute presentation of the wine list. We ordered our bottle at the bar while we waited for our table.. the stranger part was when the hostess curtly told us our table was ready and didn't even offer to help us carry our glasses and wine to the table. Now the food. Truffle Toast... what a disappointment. I had heard such high acclaim only to be vastly disappointed. I was impressed when it came to the table, with such pretty presentation and fragrant smells of truffle, I was so excited! But the truffle was so deceptive, with wafts of truffle scent not making up for the utter lack of truffle flavor. The polenta was pretty amazing, but everything else was relatively forgettable. Maybe I'll give Davanti Enoteca another try, but it'll be with very low expectations.
