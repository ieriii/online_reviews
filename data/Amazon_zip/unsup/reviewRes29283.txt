Our group had reservations a month in advance and went there for brunch during Restaurant Week in Chicago.  I didn't know what to expect but let me tell you. I never knew that flavors like this existed in Mexican cuisine. It's really Mexican fusion and oh so delicious! Make reservations and go enjoy!
