Driving to Atlanta from Milwaukee I stopped here for a bite, and ever since I've been craving the goodness of a vegan reuben every night. Why are you so far away from Atlanta, where I live? To have you in my hometown, my life savings I would give. I've never tasted vegan food so tasty and surreal! They've mastered the flavor profiles and the way the food should feel. I'm contemplating my next road trip and Chicago is on my mind, just so I can swing by the Diner and have the best food I could ever find!
