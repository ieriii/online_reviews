I have zero interest in comparing Lockdown to Kuma's. I'm a devoted Kuma's diner, and will always be one. The other day, we went to Lockdown for burgers without the wait.  I thought the decor was meh, but we sat outside,so it didn't matter. The music was ok, pretty good actually. The beer menu is really great - lots of options! We started with the mussels - there was a decent quantity, and the sauce/juice was amazing. Very flavorful. I had the Possession of Shrooms with fries. The burger was great, perfectly cooked, with a nice amount of toppings. The bun was fresh and held up well. I LOVED the dipping sauce that came with the fries (I don't eat ketchup, so this was a rare treat for me!). My friend had the Fat Elvis, which looked amazing. The only downside was we had ordered another burger to go, which took waaaaaay too long to get. I feel maybe the order got lost in the shuffle? It just took too long. I will try it again, there are a few other burgers I'd like to try.
