One of the better W hotels out there... Been here for business (meeting people in town) as well as staying here just to get away from Naperville a few times... Always a great experience. Rooms are decent sized for downtown. Nice staff... Even the breakfast the next morning was delicious. Haven't experienced upstairs so I cannot comment on that... Had a collegue in town that liked it though.
