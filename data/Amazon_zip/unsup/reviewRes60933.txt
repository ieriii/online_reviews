I just don't get this place. I will say that the wine flights are great and I really enjoy the whole concept behind them, but the food is horrible.Miniscule cheese flight, dry skate and rubbery ravioli. The only thing we enjoyed was the flat bread pizza and who can really get that wrong?Overrated, over-priced, over it.
