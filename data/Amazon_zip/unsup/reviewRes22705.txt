Went here on Labor Day for a "last day of summer" hot dog and burger. We waited in line for a while, but the food was fantastic and the ambience was a lot of fun. I'm really happy that family-owned businesses that put out a quality product are still surviving. It's pretty far from downtown, but it's worth the drive.
