entering violet hour is like entering another time..another place... dark and soothing, no natural light - feels like you are hidden in a secret venue. the heavy light-blue drapes, the crown molding on the white walls, and the flickering candle-light are easy on the peepers. oh, the music was fantastic, tasteful, and adult. old-time country, taking me back to a time, well, a time where i never was. but could pretend to be... sipping a "honeysuckle" at the bar and watching the most amazing bartender (michael) shake, rattle, and roll around behind the bar was pure enjoyment. he'll call you "darlin'" and you'll love it. the potions he concocted that evening were like sweet nectar from the gods. the old-fashioned drinks, service, and music are well constructed, unique, and sexy. loved it!
