I love the Pasta Bowl and can't believe it took me 3 years before I found it. You rarely have to wait for a table and the staff is friendly. I dream about their cheese filled tortellini with alfredo sauce. They also bring you more bread without seeming like you are putting them out. Oh and the best part? It's cheap, cheap, cheap!
