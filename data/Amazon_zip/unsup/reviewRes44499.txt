These folks made my wedding cake and good Lord was it delicious. They let us choose a different flavor and filling for each tier and all of them were amazing. I absolutely recommend the almond cake with chocolate filling. It's phenomenal (if you like almond). I had a ton of people at my wedding asking me who made the cake.  They were also really easy to deal with and very nice folks. They let us choose the almond cake for no extra charge (normally it would be extra with the package we got). The cake itself looked great, too, so that was a plus. Overall, I highly recommend Peter and his team at Alliance.
