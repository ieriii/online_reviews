I LOVE this place. They have, hands down, the best guacamole I've had in the city. Their tacos are generously sized, and have these earthy tasting, semi hot peppers on them that are completely unique and add just the right touch. The homemade shakes are excellent, and the staff are down to earth and accommodating. BYOB too!  Yes, it does get highly crowded here, especially in the summer. Well, hey, what do you expect when you can offer quality food at reasonable prices in a non-pretentious atmosphere in the Bucktown neighborhood. Yeah...exactly, but even when it gets crowded, they do a good job of keeping on top of things as best as they can. Great place.
