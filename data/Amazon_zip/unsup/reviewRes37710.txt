Great selection of Belgain beers and a nice, little seating area in the back where you can get a bite of dinner. The beer is fantastic and if you find a better selection of beer or beer glasses, I would like to hear about it. The food in the back was good. We had a few appetizers and an order of the top notch Aioli and Frites. The sausages were very good and the beet salad was also good, but the feature was the garlic aioli with the skinny frites. Yes they are french fries (does anybody eat Freedom Fries anymore?), but they are darned good fries.
