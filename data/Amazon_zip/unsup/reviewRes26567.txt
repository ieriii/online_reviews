I have been to the restaurant several times and have always enjoyed the fresh food and attentive service. On Friday night, I picked up some food to go and was so impressed with the great job they did. On top of wrapping up the food really well, they provided some complimentary fruit which was great. I had the unbelievably good shrimp spring rolls and the grilled lemongrass beef salad. Yum.
