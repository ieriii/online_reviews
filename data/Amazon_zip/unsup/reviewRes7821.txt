Felt like steerage on The Titanic. I had no idea how huge and how crowded this place would be... Definitely NOT an intimate dining experience. The salad bar: fine, but I expected more 'ethnic' choices. The meat - it was fine too but nothing to freak out about.  My conclusion is that what gets people going here is the sheer quanitity of meats and available salad bar trips. What happened to the superb meat seasoning and luscious cuts? The wine selection? pretty darn boring. Average priced though. Total dinner ticket for two with wine was $185. Worth it? I think not.
