Meat Heaven.  I came here with a large group on the patio and it was just fantastic. There is plenty of seating, but also room to mingle. It's nicely shaded so you don't fry. The staff is efficient and friendly and ready to provide suggestions. Oh, and the food. We started with some great apps: fried pickles (what?! delicious!), onion rings and cheese fries. I missed out on the mussels but the creamy curry sauce smelled great. But the PULLED PORK SLIDERS. OMG. Hot and moist and saucy, probably the best pulled pork I've had in my life (there, I said it!) My friend raved about her turkey burger (with a huge list of toppings from which to choose) and I really liked my Bootleg (kimchi with fried egg and thick cut bacon). I had asked for the egg to be over medium and it arrived over hard, but that's fine. The burgers are enormous and flavorful. I was bummed, however, that I didn't get the Punk Bitch (prosciutto and gruyere) because that looked amazing. I know what I'm getting when I come back! Well done, Lockdown. I won't go so far as to say it's as great as Kuma's (I mean, really, what is?), but it's definitely a solid burger spot.
