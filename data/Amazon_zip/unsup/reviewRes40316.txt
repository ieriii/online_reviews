Oh god, am I reviewing the right one? There are 3 of these right next to each other. So confused. Tastes like tacos do at taco joints in San Diego. Delicious juicy grilled meats with some onions and cilantro sprinkled on top, wrapped in a warm corn tortilla, like it should be! Nice and simple. Service is super quick. As for cleanliness: it's a taco joint. What can I say? It doesn't look like I'm gonna get food poisoning, and that's good enough for me. Parking can be kinda' a bitch tho, not gonna lie. Especially since that lot next door is all gated up now. Waaack. Altho I'm pretty sure some shady shit goes down here. I took a friend here, who was visiting Chicago for the first time, and she forgot her wallet in the restaurant. We went back to see if they'd seen it. We had to talk to the boss's BOSS, who said they found the wallet. They took us to the building with the barred and boarded up windows between the restaurant and the fast food store. At the door, a big ass dude came out and said "wait here", and held his hand up like a bouncer. But yo, they came out with her wallet, so that was nice. And then immediately closed the door. The end. Delicious tacos.
