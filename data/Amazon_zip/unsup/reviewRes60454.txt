After the first bite of the warm potato/grilled octopus starter, my partner and I looked at each other and said, "We don't have to travel to Italy anymore." Seriously. Everything that chef Carlos Ysaguirre makes is as good as anything you'd eat in Italy. And for the same reasons -- he gets the best ingredients from the best local farmers, and then gets out of the way. The trofie al pesto was even better than what we had in Liguria (birthplace of the dish) a year ago -- restrained and elegant, rustic and hearty -- all at the same time. The food, the service, the ambience -- all are superb.
