the food was pretty good, but the stars are for the horrible service we received. We arrived here for our first dinner with Carnivale at 5:46 for a 6pm reservation on a Thursday. That's right. 14 minutes early. Chad, the "lovely" floor manager told us that he wouldn't seat us until 6pm because he didn't want to "slam the kitchen". A) The restaurant was less than 1/3 full upon our arrival and B) anyone who has spent any time in the restaurant business knows that if you seat all 6pm reservations at the same time, 6pm, guess what? you slam the kitchen. Regardless, my wife explained we were going to see a movie afterwards and asked very nicely if there was anyway we could sit early. Chad bristled, said something about "seeing what he could do" and then proceeded to ignore us until 5:57. At which point, he pointed annoyingly to the seater, then to us, and gave us the "brush off" sign. This was our first experience at Carnivale. the food was pretty good. Our waitress was nice, but if this is the way you try to attract new customers when your restaurant is next to empty, try again. A little customer service goes a long way and we won't be back.
