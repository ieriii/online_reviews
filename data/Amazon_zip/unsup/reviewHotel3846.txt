Checked in at night during a driving rainstorm. Staff member was providing umbrella assistance to guests arriving...except us. He stood inside the door and waited for us to get drenched on our way in then said "lobby is upstairs." Front desk receptionist was a jerk as well. The door to our balcony did not work and our TV was broken...staff sent someone up who did nothing to resolve either. Didn't think the rooms were that special aside from the problems. Overrated hotel, the club makes for a very busy/crowded environment on weekends, would not recommend.
