I haven't been here for a million years before heading in again this weekend. I should've expected that on the first nice day of the year, there was a 45-minute wait for a 2-person table. I didn't remember the bar area being that small. Everyone waiting for a table after coming out of the zoo was packed in like sardines; there was almost nowhere to go if your table got called!  The atmosphere is how I remember, with lots of pictures on the walls (old waitresses? female guests?), and classic rock buzzing around. When we were seated, the waitress came to grab our soda orders. She was relatively short when we only ordered soda instead of a shake or beer. We waited awhile to get our food order in, but our orders came out relatively quickly (given the amount of people in the restaurant). I'm sad to say that the watiress didn't come back at all until about 45 minutes after our food came. Once we got our check, though, we were able to get out quickly. I don't remember the salad bar being that expensive, but it did look yummy. I'd love to come back when I have more time to hang around, and not right at 5 on a Saturday!
