This place does breakfast really well - food is interesting, portions are big, prices are reasonable. Indeed for food, I give it 3 stars. What I really dislike about Milk & Honey is the war of all against all for a table. Granted, that hasn't stopped me from eating here rather frequently in the past. However, as a recent experience demonstrated vividly to me, when their lack of a seating system collides with the crowds of awful, awful people that throng this place at peak hours, it takes forever to get a table, and when you finally get one, the wait and the awfulness of the crowd have pretty much spoiled everything.
