All I have had here is the pizza (delivery--fast, pizza is always freshly hot!), but if it is anything like the rest of the food they serve, I have to imagine it's delicious!! The pizza, ohhh the pizza. Gloriously yummy!! My BF and I are new to the area. We tried this place on the 2nd day in the new place. OMG! A part of me wishes we never discovered it because in the 1 week we have been here we have already ordered the pizza twice. Its that good-- there goes any hopes of a diet. The pizza we have ordered is their thin crust. It may be one of the best chicago thin crusts I have had. The sauce is sooo good and the cheese is the perfect amount! Tasty!! Also, we were surprised to find out that w/each delivery you get a free (FREE) liter of pop. Yes this is not that amazing, but in this day and age who gives anything away for free? So if you haven't tried it, do!! But beware, you are always going to want it!!
