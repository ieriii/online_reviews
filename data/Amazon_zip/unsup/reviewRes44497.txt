It's really hard not to love a place that puts a Louis Vuitton purse cake in its window. Also really hard not to love a place that is so tiny, visually pleasing, and authentic.  However, the lounge area is lacking. Like some of the other people have said, I, too do not enjoy getting stared at as I gingerly open the door and look for a seat. My guess is that these people do not LIVE here, no? In fact they might have had to enter the lounge and look for a seat as well? So why the hushed stares as if I am violating some unspoken rule of decorum?  My only other complaint has nothing to do with Alliance; rather an anecdote of what you might encounter if you come here. There were not other seating options save for a couch that swallowed me. I took a spot a good three feet away from where another patron was camped out. About five minutes later, she TOOK OFF HER SHOES and put her feet up on the couch and began to do this strange stretching/meditating thing. All of which would be completely acceptable in another environment, but the smell of wet Ugg feet as I'm drinking my coffee, no thanks.
