Alliance has decent enough coffee & pastries, but the the best part is the seating area next door with free wi-fi. It's kind of weird because the counter and the seating area have two different entrances so you have to get your coffee and then leave the shop and walk outside to go into the seating area. The seating area has lots of room and plenty of people. On a Sunday over a holiday weekend there were a lot of people chatting and hanging out, so it's not a place to go for quiet reading. Also, don't sit near the door in the winter, the door opens and closes every 2 minutes and it's cold. The pastries at Artemio on Milwaukee are way cheaper, almost feels like a rip off to pay for them at Alliance. But they are a bit more upscale with interesting decoration.
