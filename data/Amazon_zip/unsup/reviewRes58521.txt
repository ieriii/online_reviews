Uh... I don't get it. Yeah, Frontera's food is good, but I didn't quite get why there is so much hype. The food is good, no doubt about it, but best restaurant in Chicago? Let's not get carried away.The most surprising aspect of our visit was the preparation of the margaritas. I know a restaurant of this size needs to streamline the process of preparing their most-requested drink, but after ordering a margarita at the bar, the bartender simply reached behind the bar and grabbed a mix, poured it into a glass with ice and handed it to me. Margarita in 10 seconds. Tequila + mix in a big ol' jug. At least add the tequila or do SOMETHING to make it authentic.Overall, not a bad experience, but not the best either. Go EARLY or make a reservation or you will wait, wait, wait... and it's a bit pricey. You'll have a good time, but if you think this is THE BEST place in all of the world, you haven't been to too many places.
