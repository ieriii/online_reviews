I'll say 3.5. There was nothing particularly exceptional about Shaw's nor was it bad by any means. We went directly into the Oyster Bar which has almost a vintage diner feel. It was full of touristy looking people which I try and avoid as much as possible. We ordered a dozen tasty oysters and then each had entrees. The wines by the glass are really limited, mine was ok, but wine list definitely could use improvement. I found the entrees were all mediocre fish too--tilapia, cod, lots of boring white fish. I got fish tacos which were good, but not very filling. I think this place is more of a tourist attraction.
