YAY! I FINALLY got to go to Coast this weekend after trying to for months. I can never seem to convince people to wait the 1 hour waits or 9:45pm seatings. What can I say? I roll with a hungry group.  Food was good. You can tell the fish is fresh. This is the place if you like Maki. There did not seem like there were many other options. We also got the Hamachi Carpaccio (not on the regular menu but is on the specials menu - the blackboard hanging over the sushi chefs) and it was very good.  You can read the other 195+ reviews on the good and the bad. What I found useful to know is: No corkage fee if you spend more than $15 a person (should be easy to do), they will take reservations but you need to provide a credit card, and as I learned from some regulars of this place - a twist off wine bottle and solo cups will get you through the 1hour wait (thanks to that group that shared a glass of your wine with me!)
