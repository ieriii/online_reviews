I'm from Dearborn, Michigan, a city known for its Middle-Eastern cuisine. And let me tell you, Sultan's Market is right on par with the best of the best. It was a late night, and I had a craving for some Hummus and Chicken Shawarma. I read about Sultan's Market and on here and wanted to give it a try. The whole time riding the Blue Line to Damen, my mouth was watering. When I entered the place, I'd say about 8:30pm. There was a good amount of people inside, and all seemed to be enjoying their food. I was greeted politely in the ordering line, and saw that the prices are EXTREMELY CHEAP :) So I was excited to embark on my order. I ordered a falafel sandwich, and a chicken shawarma platter for the next day. Needless the say, the falafel sandwich was incredible. It was stuffed with at least three falafels, hummus, and a cucumber sauce. And it was only three bucks. I ate the shawarma the next day and the tenderness of the meat was still excellent. I recommend Sultan's Market to anyone who enjoys Middle-Eastern cuisine. I love the place.
