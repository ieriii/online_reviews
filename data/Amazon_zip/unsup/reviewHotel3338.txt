Definitely a cool place to stay, good music in the lobby and very modern feel to the rooms. Stayed in a corner suite. However, went during very cold weekend in Chicago. The heater in the bathroom wasn't working. When we contacted management, they were not very helpful - they were willing to have us switch rooms, but would not offer a discount on the room, nor did they offer an upgrade for our inconvenience. Also, we had called to add on an additional night to our reservation prior to arriving. Well, they actually made another reservation for the last night, so when we came back to our room after a long day, our key did not work. The front desk had not bothered to tell us that we would have to get a new key because they didn't add another night to our existing reservation but made an additional reservation for the extra night (which also meant we had to pay 2 separate bills). Finally, they have a very cool check in/rock out program where you can pick a guitar from the catalog to play with in the room. However, after making a big deal about be getting to choose which guitar I could try, they brought the wrong guitar to my room. Overall, the view was great, location was good; but for the price, I felt like everything in the room should work (especially the heater), and management could definitely have been better.
