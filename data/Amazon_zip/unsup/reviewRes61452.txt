If you want a great service, this might not be the place for you. There is one cook and one waiter who also runs cash register, take phone orders and at times you'll have to wait almost hour and half to get food. Food on the other hand is just amazing. Let's start with Roghani Nan which is like regular nan but a hint of oil is used after it's baked to bring out a whole new flavor. Chapaties are also very large and made just right. Unlike usual North Indian/Pakistani food, they use less spices by default and you'll have to ask if you want something spicy. Meat is also cooked in different manner but that's how I have seen it cooked around Punjab area. My family loves it's deep fried whole chicken which is called Chargha but I enjoy their lentil (Dal) or chick peas with chicken (Murgh Cholay). To sum it up, unless you have a lot of extra time in your hands, call ahead. Ask, what's fresh and if there are any specials. Tell them if you would like to have your food their or it's a pickup and how long will it take you to get there and then enjoy.
