We came to understand how great this place was... At least thats what we thought! She disappeared after taking our order.when told how we were really doing she just shrugged. We had the grisket plate and the mussels. Both were disappointing. Our server could care less when we pointed out that the meat was a very dry. She further explained that it was just such a lean piece of meat. The grizzle, fat and discolored, twisted pieces of meat were at best yesterdays overcooked meal. Beer was great and choices were this places saving grace. Mussels were ok, just sort of cold and small. I would order the wine cooked variety if I ever would give this place a shot. Just saying...woops!
