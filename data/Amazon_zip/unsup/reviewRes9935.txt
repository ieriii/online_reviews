Love everything about Piece. One of the best, if not THE best pizza I have ever had. I also love their goat cheese and marinara appetizer, delish. I happen to be into craft beer as well so I love sampling their house brews. I believe the name of my favorite is Captain Crunch? I had a few of them so my memory is foggy ;) I have been there in all scenarios; a large group, date with the hubby and a day out with the kids. In all scenarios they were very accommodating.
