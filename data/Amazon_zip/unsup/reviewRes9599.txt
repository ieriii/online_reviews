Sprout is an overall excellent restaurant experience! The service was top notch, the wait staff was very knowledgeable about each dish and went out of their way to explain everything. They were also extremely helpful in pairing wine with our dinner. The food itself is very well prepared and fresh. The ambience is very cozy and intimate, good for date night or even a night out with friends. Highly recommend Sprout, you are taken care of from beginning till end.
