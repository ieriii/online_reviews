Get a drink here -- they do really have an amazing selection of wines. Another one of those places where you come to learn. Get a wine flight, take notes and leave. Definitely skip the food. Not to mention it feels like you're eating in a Crate and Barrel. 5 Stars for wine and drink, 2-3 stars for food.
