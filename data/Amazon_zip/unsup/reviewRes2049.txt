One of the top dog joints in Chicago, 'nuff said! This guy has such a large variety of dogs and sausages, not to mention a couple different ways to cook 'em, I haven't had a chance to indulge in everything on the menu. If you are a hot dog lover who needs a little spunk added to the addiction, check this place out. He even has rattle snake sausages, so I can assure you he will surely have something that tickles your fancy.
