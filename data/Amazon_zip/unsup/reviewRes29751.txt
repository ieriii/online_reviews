For some reason the area around 3rd coast reminds me of upper east side in NYC, especially on a quiet Saturday morning. Met friends here for brunch. Quirky little space. When asked for recs, the waitress immediately said: veggie hash. I went for the farmer's omelet instead, but two friends got the veggie hash and started raving about how yummy it is after their first bite, so I'll have to try that next time. The omelet was delicious too, with a bit of caramelization on the outside and lots of filling. I was stuffed! Added bonus: no wait on early Saturday morning. I'm a fan!
