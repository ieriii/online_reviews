This is by far my favorite Thai restaurant in the city. The crab rangoon is hands down the best I've ever had. The food is consistantly great, both delivery and dine-in. I've tried a variety of dishes, but am rather addicted to the curry. Service is great, I've never had to wait for a table and to top it off, the place is BYOB (and there's a liquor store right next door!)
