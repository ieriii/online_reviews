The decor of this hotel is very hip, very modern, and overall we enjoyed our weekend stay at this hotel. The rooms were small but comfortable; the bed was incredibly comfortable, one of the best hotel beds I've slept in. Kind of a fun place to stay if you are into music, there's always a possible sighting to be had, and there are a lot of cool rock types wandering around (you won't see your typical suburban golfer type staying here). We were seeing a concert at the United Center and did not have time for dinner, as we were delayed getting into the city; so we sat in the bar and had drinks and appetizers - my only complaint was that we did not eat or drink very much at all but our bar bill was over $100; however downtown hotels can be very pricey so it was fairly expected. You can get a great deal on this room on expedia if you wait till the last couple of days prior to your excursion, and you can use the money you save at the bar!
