This place is exactly what I expected for paying 39.99 a night. From empty pool full of garbage, broken air conditioner, overflowing toilet, shower with little to no water pressure, shower changes from boiling to ice cube. I look forward to staying again next time I'm in Chicago. The crew that hangs outside did a great job pointing towards the nearest White Castle and kindly offered us a wide variety of drugs for sale. Who says people from Chicago are rude?
