I had really high hopes knowing this place was a relative of possibly my favorite Chicago restaurant, The Purple Pig. I love it when I'm not disappointed! Everything here was wonderful. We tried 5 dishes between the two of us which was probably overkill but worth it for all the flavors we got to check out. The highlight for me was a salad that's not listed on their website but was on the menu -- arugula, roasted squash, hazelnuts, whipped goat cheese, and farro. Amazing. I did feel like I was having flashbacks to the wonderful service I always get at The PP. Bonus points to the restaurant for understanding that tapas should be brought out one or at most two at a time and eaten at a leisurely pace. It made for a wonderful experience. I've already made plans to bring my friends back here for a girls' night. Ooh, and I'm also planning to go back one Monday soon for their burger & beer special because Italian restaurant or not their burger sounds incredible!
