I received a call from the Hotel Allegro - with profuse apologies and obvious embarrassment . . . it took a while for them to reach me, but Mary, the manager who called, was persistent and very kind. I feel confident that they have addressed the problems and with that resolved I have no problem recommending this fine boutique hotel! I will stay there again.
