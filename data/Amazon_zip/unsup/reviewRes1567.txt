What a great place. If I lived in Chicago, I would go to Hot Doug's every week to try out everything on the menu! After reading about possible LONG lines, my friend and I arrived at Hot Doug's on Thursday around 11:15. The good thing was that we only had to wait for 10 min. to place our order and the obvious bad thing was that no duck fat fries were served on Thursday. Two dogs and fries, plus sodas for less than $15. The regular fries were okay, but both sausages (pork with garlic / chicken with rosemary) were heavenly. Wow... I may actually like Hot Doug's more than Rosamunde in SF. Hmmmm... Definitely going back when I return to Chicago, hopefully in May.
