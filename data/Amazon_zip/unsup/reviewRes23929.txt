My favorite Chinese restaurant outside of San Fran. I always look forward to their spicy cabbage while waiting for food to arrive. Try the mayonnaise shrimp [sounds wierd, but is amazing], empress chicken, tony's 3 chili chicken, ma po tofu and the hot and sour soup. Quality is always top notch, thanks Tony!
