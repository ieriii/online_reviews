Great menu, pleasant/cool environment. It was a bit loud up front in the bar area, but we were seated in the back and found the noise level to be a good level for conversation. Enjoyed my meal (amish chicken) very much. My brother & his fiance had brought in a sample wedding cake they had just picked up to taste & the pastry chef at the restaurant was kind enough to plate it for us with no extra charge. Very cool of them to do that for us! Excellent service.... I was pleased and will be back for sure.
