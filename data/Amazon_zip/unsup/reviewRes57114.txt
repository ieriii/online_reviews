Their beer at best is so-so, and seems to lack any depth or character.I ordered the vegetarian rueban, and was served another dish. My bartender insisted that she heard me order what was served. I was speechless.To sum up revolution....bad beer, bad service.For a complete opposite experience, Piece Brewery is only a few blocks south.
