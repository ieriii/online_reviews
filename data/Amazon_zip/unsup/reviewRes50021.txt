We went to Las Tablas to celebrate a birthday and had a pretty good time. The food was absolutely amazing (we had the empanadas sampler and the chicken/beef dinner), however the service was not very good. From the looks of it, we just happened to get a bad waiter as the rest of the restaurant seemed to be getting good service. A matter of fact, the other members of the wait staff were very accommodating to us when I had to ask them for help. Our waiter was slow to greet us, slow to refill our drinks, and did not explain to us their menu when asked. I would definitely go back and try them again, because the food was very good even if the service was not so good.
