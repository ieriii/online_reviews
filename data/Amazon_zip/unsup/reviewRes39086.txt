Up there with one of the best meals I've had in my life! What can I add after 800+ yelpers have left their mark? 1) Fried pig's head! Don't pass up on this! Might have been the tastiest bite all night! 2) Confirmation that reviews on the tartar, boar sloppy joe, pork shank, are all on point. 3) the hedgehogs in the skate wing dish, refer to hedgehog mushrooms. If you're an adventurous eater like yelpers tend to be, you might look a little sheepish and amuse the waitress inquiring about the prep process for spiny mammals. But start to finish, an incredible meal!
