The same great flavors and Rick Bayless' ability to refine traditional Mexican ingredients has flowed easily from Topolobampo and Frontera right into Xoco, the 50 seat, counter service restaurant around the corner dishing out Bayless' take on Mexican street food. From the roasted chicken coming out of the wood-burning oven, to the hand-ground chocolate for traditional hot chocolate, to the fresh made churros, the emphasis here is on great ingredients going into house-made dishes and drinks. I had the Torta Ahodaga: golden pork carnitas, black beans, tomato broth, spicy arbol chile sauce, and pickled onions, and it was beyond good. As at Topolo, each component of the dish stands on it's own while creating a perfect bite each time. The balance of smokey, spicy, sweet, and acidic was perfect. I wanted more, even though this was plenty. Then my wife decided we should come back each week and try something different from the menu listing over 10 sandwiches and a half dozen fresh soups. I am powerless. So now, of course you can see me in there once a week until I make my way through the menu. Maybe twice. Or so.
