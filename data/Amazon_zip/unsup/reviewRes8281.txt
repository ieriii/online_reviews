And I'm proud to be an American......(key dramatic music...) Ok, here's the deal, I like American pizza better than Italian pizza. So this place was slightly doomed for me. BUT, as far as Italian pizza goes, this was pretty darn good. Maybe even 4 star good. The crust is charred and chewy, and the toppings fresh and tasty. Especially the sausage, which isn't always my favorite topping. Theirs was soft and flavorful. The reason it couldn't quite make it to 4 stars overall was the experience. For being in the middle of nowhere next the highway or train tracks or something, it is PACKED. And boy do they know how to turn a table fast. On the plus side, you don't wait long, even when it's crowded. But it totally kills the experience. We made the mistake of ordering a bottle of wine - TOTALLY the wrong atmosphere, and we barely had time to finish it. Prices are pretty high considering the dining experience is pretty fast food. It just seemed off to me. So if you really like Italian pizza and want to give it a whirl, maybe try it out during the week??
