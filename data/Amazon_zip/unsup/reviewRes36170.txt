best peking duck ive ever had, so crisp and not fatty at all. we had the peking duck dinner and it was perfect for 4 people. we also ordered a veggie dish so that we wouldnt be all "ducked" out and it was great. the white buns are so addictive and you'll probably have to order more. we went early on a sunday night and it was a good idea, by the time we were leaving there was a huge line. call first and ask if they have peking duck and make reservations.
