Whenever I see, hear, or think about RJ Grunts, I say "ARR JAY GRUUUUUNTS" in a deep raspy constipated voice while making a painful face like I'm taking a large poo. Despite that downfall, this place is great. Super tasty bar food and nachos that will make your stomach scream for more! Really small bar area is not fit for many people but a good area to have a beer before you are seated. I'm definitely going back to this place! Love it, Silky
