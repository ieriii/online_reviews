This is one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. I like the decor and the service. The one problem I have is; every time I go, I forget what I liked last time because the menu is very overwhelming. The one other thing that can be improved is the size of the tables. If you are four people and want to share food, you cannot fit the table and have to be creative with where you put your glass vs. your plate vs. the food..But the food is great.
