Since I am from Los Angeles, when I visited Chicago, I asked a friend who had been to Chicago many times what he recommended to visit and eat. He told me, "you must go to Giordano's." I never had pizza in Chicago before (although I have had knock-off versions of it in So Cal, and let me tell you, it is NOTHING like the real thing). Anyway, I decided that I must try Giordano's while visiting Chicago. I ordered pepperoni pizza and it even though the wait was long, it was Well worth it and it actually exceeded my expectations. It was delicious and sooo cheesy, which I love. I may not have other pizza from Chicago to compare Giordano's pizza too, but I loved it! I think if I ever go back to Chicago, I might go Just for the pizza (although the city was great too)!
