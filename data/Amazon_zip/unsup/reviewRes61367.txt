My new favorite quban spot I love it. The food and service was beyong great. Not to mention sat with the owner for about 5 hours having mojitos gracias amigo. Its a great spot not just because of the food but BYOB and eat good,cant beat that. The music is good too, makes you feel like your on vacation except when you leave your still in logan square he he
