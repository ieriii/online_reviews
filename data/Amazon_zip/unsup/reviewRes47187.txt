This place is toe-2-toe with the other best burger joint in town, Kuma's Corner. The burgers are amazing and the sides, wether it's macaroni, salad, etc. really hits the spot. They have a really good beer selection too. On Tuesday's, the burgers are HALF OFF!!! You can't beat that! $5.50 for arguably the best burger in town?! Get out the way $5 foot long from Subway lol. The only drawback is the music. This place plays heavy metal rock and I do not get into that style of music sorry. They blast it too.
