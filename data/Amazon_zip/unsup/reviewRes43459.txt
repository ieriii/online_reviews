I really enjoy when I invest the time to come here. Thus far I have had the opportunity to try their huevos rancheros, peach pancakes, and their veggie sandwich. The food is always amazing! The staff is always so friendly. The vibe inside the restaurant always makes me feel as if I am apart of the Ukraine Village Community. I always wish my stomach was bigger so I could finish their huge portions
