Formerly Del Toro now the Violet Hour is a must go if you live in or near Chicago. If you like unbearably loud music and staff that treat you like shit go somewhere else because you won't find it at the Violet Hour. The outside looks like the back of a barn, but once your step through the curtains your in a whole new world. The inside is all Victorian styled from the chairs to the curtains to the wall. The staff is amazing especially the bouncer. I couldn't believe how courteous he was. The drinks are amazing and well priced. You're actually getting a drink made by a professional. Every time my drink was low my waitress was right there to ask if I would like another drink. How cool is that!!!! Take a date there and impress the hell out of her. You might get lucky when the night is over.
