I just arrived in Chicago and deep dish was one of my must do's. We got here on a Monday at nine and were seated relatively quickly even though it was a full house. We preordered a stuffed sausage pizza at the front and when it got to our table, it looked like a pizza casserole. The crust was 2-3 Inches high and there must have been 2 lbs of cheese on a small pizza. Coming from California where thin crust is predominant did not prepare me for the mass amounts of dough which made me feel as though I was going to give birth to a deep dish. However, I will say I can respect Chicago deep dish for what it is but it isn't for me. Definitely it is something that needs to be experienced if ur in town... just come hungry!
