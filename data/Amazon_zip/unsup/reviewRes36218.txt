I'm trying to remember why I didn't eat at Meli at least once a week when I worked right on the same block. I never actually went here for weekend brunch either. What's wrong with me. Fail. That aside, I did probably eat lunch here a dozen times, and also took friends here on a couple of occasions. I was always happy with my meal and always got complimented for the recommendation. I really doubt you can go wrong on their menu.
