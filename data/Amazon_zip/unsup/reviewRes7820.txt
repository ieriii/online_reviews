Food gets about 3 stars. 1 star deducted due to price/value. I was expecting the type of place where you go to the counter, order, and get your food to go eat where you desire (maybe a few booths). Instead this is a sit-down atmosphere where they get you a table and hand you a menu. It's nice inside, with a good amount of room. Even private or party rooms. But you have to pay for this luxury. A small-mid sized family outing can probably rack up a big bill, more than a typical restaurant in our case. My food was just okay. Mine stayed in the oven just a bit too long and you could taste it on the bottom of the crust. But I'm not even mad about that. I understand it comes with the territory with pizza like this. The unburned parts of the pizza were overwhelmed with the taste of basil. Some people might enjoy this, but I don't. I want to taste the rest of the pizza. Overall I don't think everything mixed well. I prefer simplicity, and less gourmet or garnishes
