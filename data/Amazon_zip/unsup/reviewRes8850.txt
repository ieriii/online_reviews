i would eat spacca napoli 5 nights a week if allowed. this is easily the best pizza on the planet. charred, light chewy crust perfection and the freshest ingredients ever. sausage (fresh mozzarella!) and proscuitto and arugula (provolone! paremesan!) are my favorites. i have found no need to venture out on other pizzas yet and i've ate like a hundred of them.  WARNING: this is not your average cheeeseandpepperonipizza. this is something special i live nearby and usually prefer to get takeout. they give you a glass of presecco while you wait and the pizza in cooked in under 3 minutes. faster_dinner_ever. no joke. so, so fresh and delicious best appetizer is an occasional special - breaded goat cheese with some amazing lentil concoction. heavenly DESSERT - tartufo. some sort of ice cream truffle with a fluffy/crunchy delicious center. jeez i need to eat in more often so i can order the tartufo...... and the staff is amazingly gracious and helpful.  class act
