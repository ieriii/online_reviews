This review comes to you, live, directly from my smelly, uncomfortable, and loud as hell, suite. I don't know where to start. The usual culprit of rude and obnoxious staff? The barging in of some staff members this morning while I was in the shower, to "update my TV," despite the privacy lock being on. (The prelude to this incident was yesterday, when the maid continually knocked on my door while the do not disturb hanger was on the knob, and again the privacy lock was on, to interrupt a much needed nap, to ask me if I wanted a bag of ice). How about the extremely loud atmosphere, which includes the loud waterfall in the lobby? The fact that you can't walk to the elevator without a bloody housekeeping cart in the way? My room had a lovely view of the parking garage, which isn't horrible, since it IS Chicago and is surrounded by structures, but I was told the hotel was fully booked, and no other room was open by the extremely helpful and competent clerk. Come to find out that the hotel was almost completely open and the night manager didn't know why the clerk earlier had told me they were booked. This hotel has just been an awful experience from the get go. I have stayed at Embassy Suites Lakefront once or twice, and it was okay, but this one is not impressive at all. I would avoid this one. Stay at a Marriott hotel instead! This is pretty much just a glorified Motel 6.
