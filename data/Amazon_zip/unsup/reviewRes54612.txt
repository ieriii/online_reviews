This is a hole in the wall place with cheap food and many mustachioed, skinny jean clad customers. Service is hit or miss, but almost always without a smile.They make a good falafel sandwich, almost every time. Not the best falafel in the world, but not bad at all. Definitely get hot sauce on your pita falafel sandwich. Yum. I wouldn't eat meat there again, after trying it once.Cash-only.
