Recommended to me by a friend. It brings back all the memories of growing up in the South.Tonight they had a flounder special that was sensational!!!...stuffed with crab, melt-in-your-mouth good.Wonderful staff! Can't wait to go back to try their brunch!!You have to try the red velvet martini...if you like chocolate!Don't miss this place!!!!
