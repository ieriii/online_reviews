As a meat-eater, the vegetarian restaurants that I have liked are the kinds where a dish is so appealing that, even if meat were an option, you would STILL order it. There's nothing like that here, because it's all that fake meat garbage.  I guess if you're a vegetarian who's still jonesing for the occasional pig and cow fix, it's nice to have a place where you can get a "bacon" "cheese" "burger." For an omnivore who actually wants decent vegetarian food, though, this is not the place.
