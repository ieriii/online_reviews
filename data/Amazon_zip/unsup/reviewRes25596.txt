First time here, wanted to do a small cafe lunch with my girlfriend and pretty much I thought this place was a mixed bag. At first the service was rocky. The temperature outside that day was 95 and we had to wait 5 minutes before we could ask for water and waited an additional 5 before it was served. Also during the meal, the staff closed the doors to the outside to put on the AC, which was fine, but the ensuing ruckus of moving tables, chairs and slamming of the doors persisted for 10 minutes which was annoying. Aside from the din in the background and the so-so service, the quality of the food was superb. I ordered the salmon fume and a half bowl of greek country salad and enjoy it. So in all, 3 stars is an apropos rating, too bad the service could not be any better.
