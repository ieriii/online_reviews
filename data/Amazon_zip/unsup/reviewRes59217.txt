They have good food - I always get the Fun Noodles (wide noodles) and make up my own dish- brown gravy (they have 3 different gravy's) with onions, peppers bean sprouts, and bbq pork. I get the small ($6.50) - I just put about 1/3 of it on a plate and can't even finish that! I also got the 2 eggrolls for $3.25 and ate one of them. My total was $10 and I have enough for three servings! If you like it spicy - get the crushed hot pepper in oil- don't know the name of it but use it sparingly.I went in to order and told them I would be back in 10mins. because I was parked in a tow zone in front. In less than 10 min they brought it out to me- Sweet!Must try the BBQ dishes one of these times.
