Came here for dinner to try one of the better seafood restaurants in Chicago.  Crab is one of their specialty and that's what we had. Alaskan King Crab Legs : the legs are filled with meat and better yet, the meat is fresh.... We also tried the jumbo crab cake and it was good enough as a meal.  For Starters, we tried the oysters and the clam chowder. Both were fresh and the soup was very good given that it had a lot of flavor to it. The potatoes were firm and it was delicious to enjoy! Overall, loved Chicago and will need to find an excuse to go and visit again soon!
