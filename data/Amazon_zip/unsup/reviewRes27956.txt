I think I might have blown out a few taste buds because our pan pizza was so good. Normally I am a lou malanati's girl but i think I might be swinging by this place more often. If you are a sausage lover you will definitely enjoy their spicy chunks, they lay the toppings down heavy. I love our server's reasoning for the whole pequods whale theme. According to them "the owner is a real scumbag and just wanted to put some pants on moby dick" Now that's Chicago for you!
