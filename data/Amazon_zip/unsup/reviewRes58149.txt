We are originally from Boston. I took my boyfriend here for our 2 year anniversary and it was in one word FABULOUS!Our waiter (I think his name was Fred?... sorry been a while) was awesome! The food was to die for and our waiter was very helpful in helping us pick out different Tapas to try.The portions are small but with Tapas you shouldn't expect to busting at the gut.When we told the waiter that it was our anniversary, he brought out a complimentary assortment of their desserts.My boyfriend tried Rabbit for the first time and it was one of the best things we have ever eaten. By the way the dishes are presented you can tell that someone has taken alot of time and care on presentation and on taste!The decor was gorgeous and the website pictures does not do this place any justice.I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone. It is a great place to go out with friends or to celebrate a special occasion. The tab was less then what I expected. It came out to be around $60 per person with two cocktails each.My boyfriend and I have been to many high end restaurants in Chicago and here in Boston, but this one takes the cake. I wonderful, awesome all around experience and we will definitely be going back when we visit Chicago!
