dont know what else to say about this location of Garcia's, as i am non spanish speaking person i have had a lil bit of a challenge order a couple times, but other than that... This place is the best! The Guac is great have to get it everytime i go here. The food is fresh. the atmosphere is casual and relaxing... great features in the restaurant. so basically, Great food, friendly staff and great margaritas ! Highly recommend this restaurant to any and all who truly love Mexican food.
