I thought NOTHING could top Crif Dogs                until NOW... Like Calumet, this place was also featured on Bourdain's 'No Reservations'. I have been dreaming of the foie dog since that episode, but to no avail on my first attempt. It was roughly 12pm on a Good Friday and the line wrapped around the block as we drove by. Not a chance in hell we were going to wait. Saturday rolls around and we think our chances are better since it's a rainy day. We are right to some extent. Only 1hr wait, roughly 30 people in front of us at 11am. As you enter, you have the standard menu, then Today's Specials to the left of that. Newest addition to the hotdog family, featured on the Celebrity Sausage chalkboard is the Jamie Jungers, a cherry pork sausage w/ pomegranate creme fraiche & snow white cheese, a Tiger Woods allusion. Doug, with his beaty eyes and black rimmed glasses in tow, mans the register and order counter. It's only then that you get the option of sitting, but many opt for take out. The walls are brimming with primary colors (red, blue, yellow). The back wall has silver glitter that reinforces their mantra, 'There are no finer words in the English language than, 'encased meats,' my friend. Well said, so well said that it's also imprinted on the back of their tees, which I then HAD to get. I'll let the hotdogs speak for themselves sans my usual comments, since this is one of those experiences that you HAVE to see/taste for yourself. Let's just say that the foie topping was generous and your eyes will roll to the back of your head, CRACKTACULAR!. Well worth the 9 bucks! The duck fat fries are similarly awesome, with skin on. After your visit, there will be no wonder why there are over 1000 reviews with a 4.5 avg yelp star rating. Customer demographic is college kids, with the occassional die hard junk food lover on line. You won't see Granny or Mr. Fancypants lining up. THE GOOD -Flavors were symphonic -Quality ingredients THE BAD -Long waits -No menus posted/handed out while waiting on line THE UGLY -Doug Ordered: -Cranberry shiraz wild boar sausage ($6.50) [w/ sweet curry mustard & grand canaria cheese] -Foie Gras & sauternes duck sausage ($9) [w/ truffle aioli, foie gras & fleur de sel] -Duck Fat Fries ($3.50) -Hot Doug's tee ($15) Total came out to $34 after everything Pics: http://www.meetup.com/fo
