It isn't very often that vegetarians review hot dog joints, but I was dragged to Hot Doug's by a coworker when we were in town for the day. The results were shocking. I actually loved this place. I got the Pete Shelley (the vegetarian dog), and it was awesome! I am not a fan of fake meat 95% of the time, but this really hit the spot. I would go back again and again if I lived in Chicago. Good work, Doug.  You're hot.
