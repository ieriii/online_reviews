One of the best places to get a thick or deep dish pizza in the city. The caramelized crust is worth trying this place, it's amazing. Can have a long wait on weekend nights since it's a fun spot to watch a game, unless you get there early I'd suggest takeout or delivery. I've had a few bad experiences with wait times on takeout, them telling you 35-40 minutes and it taking 1 hour 15 minutes before you leave there. Otherwise it'd be a 5 star review, the food is great.
