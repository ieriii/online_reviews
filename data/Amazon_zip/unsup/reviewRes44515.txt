Mmmmmm macarons. The boyfriend is usually not as eager to go to bakeries as I am. We stopped by here because I had heard the macarons were tasty. I ordered a few macarons and he got the almond croissant. The croissant was delicious...but the macarons were even better. I gave the boyfriend one bite of my vanilla macaron and he was begging for me. It was so good, that he insisted that we stop by there before our flight back to Seattle. We ended getting a box of the passion fruit and vanilla macarons to go and they're already gone now (we flew back last night). We plan to go to Chicago again and I'll be heading back to this place definitely. YUMMY!
