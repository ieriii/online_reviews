The Popcorn is unreal (i dont know if its truffle oil or evoo thats on it, with grated cheese). So good! I got the wagyu beef and they asked me if I would like sliced truffles on top, who is going to turn that down? The beef had such a consitent tender texture, it was almost too good! The truffle slices resting in my broth were crisp almost like a thin carrot slice. The desert was great! Never had a Smore's like that before! I hope I have more though! The atmosphere was great, the entire staff give off a slight hipster vibe, but with not the disheveled angry hipster, everyone there was super cool and friendly and informative (without sounding like they were making stuff up, I hate that at restaurants). Graham actually showed up with his family while we were there and took a picture with us). Thanks Graham!! Afterward they gave us a tour of the kitchen, which was immaculate and more organized than the most troubled OCD patients kitchen. Ill be back for drinks soon and dinner on V-day...
