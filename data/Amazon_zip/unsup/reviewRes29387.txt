Love Thai, but my experience was not so good. Rice was way undercooked and actually crunchy, texture of the duck was chewy to the point of being inedible (I know duck is "gamey" compared to chicken- I've eaten it before- this dish crossed the line). Waitress was unfriendly. And for about $20 a person for appetizer & entree only? There are far too many good Thai places around for me to go back to Opart. Sorry. The only things that earned this place a second star were the decent papaya salad and the nice ambience.
