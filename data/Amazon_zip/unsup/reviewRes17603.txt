Nice atmosphere--large, spacious, colorful. The best part of the meal was the ropa vieja appetizer. The drinks were also delicious. We all (there were four of us) ordered meat dishes--the best was the churrasco my husband ordered on a bed of black beans and sweet rice. There was a local dessert option offered--cheesecake made of local cheese and tiny strawberries that were packed with flavor. I really give props to this place for being so big and somewhat commercial and yet featuring locally grown goods. Way to go!
