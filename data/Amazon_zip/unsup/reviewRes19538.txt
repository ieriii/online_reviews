Stop by! You might see Rick Bayless. I did! When I wasn't staring at him, I was eating his amazing food.... - Chips + Guacamole - Jamon Torta: La Quercia Prosciutto Picante, Otter Creek Organic cheddar, black beans, avocado, chipotle mustard. Yes, a little cup of guacamole is a whopping $4, but it's some of the best guacamole you'll ever have. Promise. :) And, you can't beat adding spicy prosciutto to a Mexican sandwich...it really doesn't get any better.
