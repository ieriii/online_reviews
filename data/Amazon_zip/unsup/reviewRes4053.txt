Best meal of my life to date. Period. We came here while ago for my fiance's birthday, so I won't go into every course and how the quail egg ravioli changed my life, but believe me, go here! I had to call almost every day once the books opened for the month I wanted. I left a message the first time, but never got a call back, so I just kept plugging away at the phone until someone picked up and gave me my magic time on the date I wanted. Yay! The decor is minimal and you really do feel like you're part of the kitchen action. It's very small and BYOB. We brought a champagne and a white since we were nervous about overwhelming the food. For the two red meat courses, we were treated to a couple bonus glasses of red from a bottle they had in the kitchen. Woohoo! Service is super laid back, but attentive, and you can tell that the chefs (who serve you!) really care about the food and are proud of what they do. Every course was perfectly portioned and timed so that I was able to finish the meal without wanting to throw up and was delighted by everything put in front of me. Unlike some other experiences, each course complemented and built on the one before. Things just kept getting better and better. I can't wait to go back. Maybe I'll work up the nerve to start a slow clap for the chefs on my way out, which is what I REALLY wanted to do last time I was there.
