We had takeout from this place a little while back. It's super close to my apartment and we were craving some Italian food. I had the gnocchi and it wasn't the best that I've ever had but I do know that many of my friends rave about pasta bowl. The woman taking our order was kind of rude but I can understand that somewhat since they were really busy. Our order took about 45 minutes which is kind of long for takeout but whatever, it's close. For me, since I live with an Italian roommate, I'm used to quality Italian food and this was just average. Will I come back in a pinch? Absolutely, I get cravings every once in a while. I might try dining in and see if the experience is any different.
