I loved this place while I lived in Chicago (just down the street actually, on Bryn Mawr). It was possibly my favorite restaurant there. It is a great hole in the wall place that really isn't in a neighborhood full of restaurants, so it can be easy to miss. First of all. It is BYOB. This is what I miss so much about Chicago. The Dominick's down the block means that you can snag a bottle of sake or wine before you get there. Amazing Second, very reasonably priced food. When I walked in I expected to pay about $15-$20 for a single dish (decor, ambiance and the awesome dinnerware and menu designs), but a curry and a basic roll ended up to be about $15 per person. Lunch is even better, where you can get an appetizer, salad and an entree for about $7. I don't remember, but you might even get a soup as well? About the food: The crab rangoons here are OUT of the WORLD. The shell they are fried in is very delicate and light (doesn't overpower the rest of the flavors) and there is water chestnuts mixed into the filling, which gives the whole rangoon a very nice texture. The curries are very good, with good portions and lots of flavor, no watery sauce here! I like the sushi here, but the rice is a tad too sugary for my tastes (I prefer sushi rice on the savory-er side). Still very good though; the fish is fresh. Totally recommend it!
