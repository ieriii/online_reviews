Another great addition to the South Loop. Mercat offers Catalan tapas that are simply fantastic. The decor is very cool and fitting for this festive atmosphere. The music is a little loud, but still bearable. The spanish cheese selection is impressive as is the wide range of meats offered in addition to the small plates. Perhaps my favorite thing about this restaurant is the whole roasted suckling pig. I am definitely making a return trip for the experience (you need to give 48 hours notice).
