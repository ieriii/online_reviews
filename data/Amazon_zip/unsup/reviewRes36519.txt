I love the ambiance here, it's pretty decent for an asian restaurant. The food was inexpensive and the staff was rather friendly.  My friends and I order basically everything on the menu. It's typical thai food and sushi that taste all the same everywhere else. It reminded me of a place called Butterfly that I went to in the city. Their Thai Samosas were yummy! I would love to go back for more, and it's a great place to bring a date.  Oh yeah it's BYOB! :-)
