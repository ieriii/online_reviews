I went to Gino's on a tip that was given to us back in California by a native Chicago-ian. He was eating at an Italian restaurant I was working at at the time and I was planning a trip to Chicago so he told us to go here...so here's my review. I'm a minor pizza snob...I love pizza with all my heart... I am hard to please when it comes to pizza. We weren't told what to order, so we ordered simple. Deep dish, pepperoni and olive pizza...We thought why not order what we always order at our favorite Itaian pizza joint in California? You know, for comparison sake, right?  My result? Ummm not so good. No where near the deliciousness we are used to, BUT overall...Better than most pizzas.  It was WAY too salty...I hate it when cooks dump salt into things and expect it to make it taste better! I hate that more than anything! Salt is meant to be a hint! A HINT! The italian dressing was delicious! A little sweet...I loved that. My fiance wasnt a big fan of it though.  I loved the atmosphere. I loved the fact that we could write on anything we wanted. SO great. I actually loved everything about this place..but I was in Chicago...the BEST FREAKIN' PLACE IN THE WORLD!!! AND CHICAGO IS FOR LOVERS!!! Will I go back? Sure...why not...its Chicago! I'll just drink a bunch of water to counteract the salt Gino's East uses in their food then everything will be A-OK.
