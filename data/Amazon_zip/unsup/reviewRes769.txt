I love this place. Great gourmet sausages and a super friendly owner. The first person you see is the propitious owner Some sausages are better than others. The great array of normal sausages makes it affordable and still very delicious. The gourmet sausages are the fantastic.They change all the time. But from my experimenting with the special sausages, it has always been a rewarding experience. The regular sausages are equally as good and . I've had the andouille, polish and corn dog, all were exceptional. Don't believe the hype about the duck fat fries, they were not as good as the normal cheese fries. I ordered both with my girlfriend and we both finished the regular cheese fries and left the duck fat fries alone. It's a shame we really had high expectations for the duck fat fries. Three things that suck about this place: 1. The line on the weekend is ridiculous. Try to go during the week. 2. He closes incredibly early, 4pm and not open on Sundays. 3. It's cash only and the closest ATM's are blocks away.
