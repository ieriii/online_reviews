Best pie in Chi. I don't have a lengthy report on this one. Just that it is fantastic. I mean really, really, fantastic. Pan perfection and deep-dish deliciousness. Also, they made the upstairs huge so there's a lot of room in the place now. Try asking the owner why the whale has a thong on its head (middle aged guy with a grey ponytail). I asked and he wouldn't tell me, so if you can find out please let me know.
