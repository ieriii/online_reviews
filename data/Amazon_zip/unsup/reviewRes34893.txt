I will preface this by saying that I have never dined in here, so my review is solely regarding the takeout/delivery service. Service: I got takeout once, and I had to wait in the restaurant for about 15 minutes before it was ready. The restaurant was really small, and there wasn't a place for me to sit. I was annoyed. Tonight, however, we got delivery. The delivery was super quick and the delivery guy was really nice. I will probably get delivery from now on. Food: WOW. Excellent sushi for the price. The traditional rolls are average size, but the other rolls are very generous. I enjoyed the following: smoked salmon, spicy tuna, spider (probably my favorite--it has soft shell crab in it), caterpillar, and rainbow. My only complaint was that they did not give us enough wasabi...but I put a huge dollop of wasabi on every roll I eat, so that might not be a problem for most people.
