It's really wonderful to find a restaurant that not only has reasonably priced dishes, but also a warm friendly atmosphere. Any dish I have tried, and there are many to choose from, was served graciously and in a timely manner. The wait staff, although English not being their first language, tries to understand and answer any questions I ask. I especially enjoy the Simply It Beef dish, and all the clay pot entrees, salmon being my favorite. The ginger tea is a compliment to the meal.The owner Tuan ,usually gives fruit after the meal as his way to say thankyou. He is an extremely kind gentleman, who really cares about his restaurant and wants to make his customers feel that they are special. I usually eat here every couple of weeks, and have never had a bad experience. Argyle is closer, but I don't feel out of place here, or timid about asking questions about any entree. BYOB is also great if you like wine with your meal. They have great delivery service, and many folks stop by to pick up their food for home as well. If you are in the neighborhood, stop and try Simply It, I don't think you will be disappointed.
