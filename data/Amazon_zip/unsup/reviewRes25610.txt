I loooove Geja's. I've been here a few times and I must say that it's fantastic. Pricey, but worth every penny. You definitely leave full, which is important when you've spent a good amount of money. The atmosphere is great for a nice date, low lights, very intimate. The food is delicious and *fresh*. There is a great wine selection and they are pretty knowledgeable about making wine suggestions. Be sure to have a reservation...although you might still have to wait for a bit. Don't let this discourage you. I think that if you go out for dinner in Chicago, on the weekend, you're going to have to wait, even with reservations, almost everywhere. That's just how it is. [That being said, I do not have the patience of a saint and would probably walk out of some place that made me wait too much longer than they quoted me when I walked in.] I bought two groupons for Geja's that I have to use before November. I can't wait! Hopefully I'll catch a Flamenco night.
