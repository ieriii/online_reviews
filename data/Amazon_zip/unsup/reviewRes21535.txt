Heard about this place from a co-worker and came because she used the magic words: margaritas, strong, half-priced! Sorry to say, but my husband and I weren't too impressed. First, it was a Tuesday night and we were glad to see it wasn't packed. The waiter misinformed us that all margaritas were half priced, so just as we were about to order the a pitcher of the most expensive kind, he says "oh no, the special is just for the house margaritas". Fine. I order a pineapple ON THE ROCKS and my husband ordered a banana frozen. Of course, both come frozen. I tried to drink it down, but just couldn't, and called the waiter over for a do-over. I literally watched the bartender pour my drink in the blender, add some more pre made pineapple crap on top and then crank up the blender...nothing worse than a foamy, weak margarita. The hubbie thought his was "Meh". The people next us had normal looking margaritas and seemed to enjoy them, so I asked them what kind and my husband talked me into trying one (Lime). That was much better, I have to say. So I had another. He tried a Lime one as well, but frozen and liked that one better. By the time we left, I could tell tequila was in them and had a nice buzz. Lalos on Halsted & Maxwell is still our #1 Margarita spot, hands down. The chips and salsa left a lot to be desired. Overally, I'd give it 2.5 stars and come again only if I were in the area.
