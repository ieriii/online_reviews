I was impressed how quickly we were seated. It's in Roscoe Village so I thought it would be packed.  Like other cuban places, you order your food and they serve your table. Food was pretty darn good, although I the black beans weren't quite cuban enough for me. The white rice and chicken dish was very good. I like a Taste of Cuba a little better. It's in Lincolnwood, but I think it's worth the drive. You may also want to try Cafe 28 on Irving and Damen.
