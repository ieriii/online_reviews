I've been back twice since my first post and every visit has been just as good as the last.The food is fantastic, fresh tasting and the portions are sizeable.Raul is the bomb and he will not lead you astray - trust his recommendations! He'll hook you up with the best dishes they have to offer and I respect that he's not trying to sell you on the most expensive item on the menu. Everyone who works here is polite and friendly. They are always busy for dinner service but not once have I ever felt rushed to finish my meal. The servers don't hover or check in on you a million times. They let you enjoy your visit.If you haven't tried this place yet - make it happen! You will not be disappointed.
