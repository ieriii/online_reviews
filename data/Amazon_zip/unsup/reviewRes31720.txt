I just got home and had to write this review for Nana's instead of putting it off for a few days. To begin with, Nana's is like the Andersonville of Bridgeport. Its decor is modern, yet comfortable. My friend and I both had a grilled chicken breast sandwich with cheese and guacamole. The guac was freshly made and very tasty. We had mashed squash as our side. This was very good. Nana's also serves Metropolis coffee, which is another plus. They have raw, brown sugar and stevia on each table. How healthy!! Our waiter was very accomodating to me, as I have food allergies to nuts and eggs. It is great to know that Nana's serves organic and locally grown food in a trendy yet comfortable environment. These reasons compel me to give Nana's a 5-star rating.
