This place is cute, and unlike Manzo's it actually has customers. We went on a Thursday night, and it was crowded but not too crowded. The service was excellent, and the amount of food you get is extremely generous. The Sicilian chicken was great, but the pasta was just OK (my girlfriend ordered a carbonara sauce which turned out to be heavy cream). It's not super-fancy, but it's solid. We will be back.
