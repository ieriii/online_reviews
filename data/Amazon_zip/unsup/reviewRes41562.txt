Really great food and service all around. We enjoyed all of the 7 courses- especially the summer lobster and the Duck Duck Goose. Our server treated us like friends throughout the 3 hours we were there without coming off as obnoxious. We had to wait outside while the table before us took a while to leave, and Patric brought us a complimentary taste for our trouble. The quality of everything was excellent, the atmosphere was relaxed, and the three of us thoroughly enjoyed our meal. I'm taking off one star only because of their reservation policy- If you cancel less than 24 hours in advance, your card is charged $25 per person. That seems a little extreme.. but I would definitely go back. A+.
