I took my boyfriend here for his birthday! It was nice so we went to the rooftop for a drink first. I love the rooftop during the summer. Very chick and great for small or big groups! When we ate we had a great experience! The salad bar had good choices. I loved the cheeses and salads. I especially like the apple chutney and chick pea salad. I liked that you put your rock out when you wanted more meat. I am not a meat eater but the fish and chicken selection was good as well. The wait staff did a great job making sure we got the meat we wanted. My boyfriend was in meat heaven!
