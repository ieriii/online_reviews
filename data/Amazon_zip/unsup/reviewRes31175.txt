I have been going to Nana's for breakfast for some time now, pretty much since they opened. Nana's certainly does one-up many, many other breakfast/brunch restaurants in Chicago; in regards to Bongo/Yolk, there is no Comparison.  All the products served are made with organic food, and you can taste the quality. I am a fan of simplicity, I love the All-American Breakfast. Their home-made chicken sausage is really good. I have tried near everything, and its all been great, you will not leave disappointed. The sweet entrees are very creative and delicious. The service is usually good. Val is an incredible server. However, some of the recent hires were unfortunate choices. I went on a weekend day and the food runner was gross, chest hair pouring all over my food, and I knew the menu better than the waiter. I was kind of embarrassed, having talked up the restaurant so much and my company was presented with awful service. What I learned: avoid the weekends, Nana's is great but cannot handle volume. The quality that day was awful- skin in the chicken sausage, stale homefries, and soggy greens. Been back during the week since and its great, always on point. In short: probably one of the best choices for breakfast in the city.
