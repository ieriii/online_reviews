I really came to experience Superdawg! I couldn't wait to pull into the drive in and order some good dawgs! It is a little expensive for a hot dog and fries ($20 for two hot dogs and 2 shakes) but I did thing the hot dog was good. It had a good snap, which is what I usually go for in a boiled hot dog. It was fun to watch everyone park their cars in each spot. It does get very busy. I opted to go on a Sunday at 5pm. I didn't have a problem finding a spot for my car, but closer to 5:30 it was getting a little crowded. I wouldn't come here all the time, as I live in the city, but it is a fun place to go once and a while with friends.
