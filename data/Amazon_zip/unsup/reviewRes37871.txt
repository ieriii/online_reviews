crust is good, need alot more sauce and way way too much cheese. the price is ridiculous, i dont see why these chicagoens dont complain. you can barely finish one slice, so dont order too much its going to be a waste. i dont understand why its not piping hot, it takes too long on purpose i think, you start ordering the other stuff which is jot good.
