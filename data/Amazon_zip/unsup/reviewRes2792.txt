Ever heard of the pity pound cake (hereforth known as the PPC)?  Well, that is what we got when my friend and I tried to go and eat there tonight... My friend and I were dressed in business attire, just having left our clinic after a long day. We just wanted to enjoy some good food and drink and were prepared to pay for just that... Enter the hoity-toity host - I guess he took one look at us and decided that we were not worthy - and how did we know? Could it be the look of disdain when we walked in? The way he talked over the other (nice) hostess who would have let us eat but he said no? The way that he even prevented her from letting us eat in the lounge ("I'll have to check with the kitchen!" - as a note, they DO serve the lounge, unless, I guess, if they think you are unworthy.) And this is where the PPC comes into play - at this point, I was actually still willing to consider giving this establishment a try... but then he was like, wait, here, you can have this - along with our card so that you can TRY to make a reservation. It was a mini pound cake with their business card attached to it. I could have spent hundreds of dollars there (and even more in the future). But apparently, he has some better ideas of who he wants to let in his door. That's too bad, some other establisment will just get to enjoy the $$$$ that I would have spent at this restaurant. Oh, and the PPC wasn't even that good (it made my friend choke).
