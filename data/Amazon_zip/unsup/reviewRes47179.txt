Best. Burgers. Ever. I was a little hesitant to venture into the unknown territory of the Ukrainian Village (west of downtown) in Chicago, but holy crap am I happy a good friend convinced me it was a good idea. Lockdown Bar & Grill looks intimidating from the street; kind of has a metal bar feel but sports are playing on the TV and no one looks scary - win! Our server was so nice (and a cutie), I totally forgot her name, but I love a girl who is knowledgeable about import beers and which tastes good with which menu items. Beers, awesome. I love the local Daisy Cutter Pale Ale. I'll take three please. Now to the good stuff: BURGERS! Lockdown has an awesome selection of very different types of burgers all served with sides like mac and cheese, fries, etc. The mac and cheese is http://bomb.com by the way. I didn't know which burger to get because they all sounded so amazing so I did what I do best, I got the sampler (called The Flight Risk) which features three different burgers each week in slider form: Punk Bitch, Border Patrol, & Electric Chair are the ones I was lucky to try. UNREAL! From the first bite, I found myself in a heaven abyss and did not come back down to earth until I pretty much licked my plate clean. Top it off with one or two more local brews. Plop on the couch. Life will be good once you have tried out this diamond in the rough. TRUST.
