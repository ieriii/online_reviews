Went to Chicago to do some work with short notice. Xoco was consistently recommended by all our foodie friends & colleagues, and being suckers for mexican food we went here right away. Although suffering from a serious jetlag and a rough day it was a fantastic experience. No surprise it was busy on a friday night - but even waiting to be seated is a pleasure over here (thanks to the selection of great beers and friendly service). Never had a Caldo before - but Xoco's will stay on my list of great soups for a long time.
