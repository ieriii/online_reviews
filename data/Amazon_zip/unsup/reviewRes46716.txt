Come here for the all-you-can-eat salad bar, which is fresh, varied and delicious. Stay for the onion rings, served stacked on a stick like a ring-toss game -- my dining companion and I agreed that they were the best onion rings we've had in years. Finish it off with one of their delicious ice cream sundaes, we got one with a chocolate chip cookie that was still warm. On top of it, the place is inexpensive, the service was great, and their hand-drawn menu is charming. Just try it.
