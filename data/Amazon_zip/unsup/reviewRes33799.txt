Oh man is Mia Francesca good! Came here last night with some friends to thaw out after strolling around Zoo Lights for an hour, and it was the perfect ending to an otherwise freezing day. We started with the bruschetta, and the mozzarella was amazingly fresh and piled high. I got the linguini and shrimp in a tomato sauce, and it was truly spectacular. The other dishes at the table were also getting rave reviews, and the pasta dish portions were quite large. Prices for entrees started at $12.95 and went up to about $16 for pasta and $20-$25 for meat and fish dishes. The only disappointments were the atmosphere and the fact that they didn't have cannoli on their dessert menu. Such a charming little space that was well decorated for the holidays, and they definitely had Orgy's version of "How Does It Feel" blasting on the sound system, and quite loudly at that. The music didn't get much better as the evening progressed. An no cannoli? What's that about? The pistachio cream puffs did hit the spot, though. Overall, though, one of my new fav Italian dining areas in the city.
