I had heard great things about Opart from many people, so I decided to give it a try when I happened to be at the Western Brown Line stop. I ordered Crab Rangoons for an appetizer, and they were amazing! Creamy and crabby, but not too much of either... peanut buttery in texture... perfect in my opinion. The Tom Kha Kai soup that I ordered looked bland- like milk with green onions in it- but that was FAR from the truth. The soup was flavorful and spicy, and came in a heated bowl so it wouldn't get cold. The Pad Thai also looked bland- and it was. I know that Pad Thai isn't "true" Thai food, but I usually like it so I order it. This Pad Thai was by no means bad, it just could have maybe been spicier or had more sauce and been fine. Service was great-timely, friendly, and accommodating (the waiter didn't look at me weird when I said I was allergic to cilantro!) I think they could win a contest for Lincoln Square's smallest bathroom.
