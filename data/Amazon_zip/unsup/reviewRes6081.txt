Yeah, so what if I'm writing this review while eating my leftover Wildfire steak??? (slice) If you are familiar with the Lettuce Entertain You restaurant group, you've probably heard of Wildfire. If not, Wildfire is one of the many great restaurants of the group. I've been here about 3 or 4 times and have yet to be displeased with the food.  My most recent visit was last night (a Friday) at 9 pm. And, seriously, folks were packed like sardines up in dis biyatch. Reservation is a must. I started with the shrimp and crab bisque, which I give a 8/10. The consistency could have been a bit thicker, but the soup quickly disappeared, regardless. The main event of the evening was the surf and turf...and I fa sho caught a killer wave and hung 10, dudes. Totally narly lobster tail and flavorful steak (as I chomp on another bite of my leftovers). My side was mashed potatoes, which was a great compliment. The waiter was an older, shorter gentleman (roughly 50) with white hair (including a nasty shag in the back). I was a bit surprised a place like Wildfire would have a waiter of his skill on staff. No disrespect to him, but he just seemed more of a Applebees waiter than Wildfire. On his follow-up visits to the table, he did this drive-by with the line "you guys have everything you need, right?" Uhh...thats extremely assumptive, and if you werent at the next table by the time I could answer, maybe you would know the answer to your question. (And if he called me "buddy" one more time, I was going to get my WWE on and drop an elbow on his face. LOL). He meant well and all, but really could use some polishing. Nonetheless, I highly recommend this place for a nice one on one or group outing.  Good talk.
