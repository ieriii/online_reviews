Expensive and the food is hit or miss as of late. When the vegan philly portion got smaller I stopped coming, when the nacho plate became a side salad I was livid. The nacho plate, if you missed out, was a fat kid's wet dream or a meal for two. The potatoes and seitan can be charred or come poorly reheated. However, you can NEVER go wrong ordering the vegan reuben and a chocolate peanut butter shake. Hands down best veg reub I have ever had, my meat eater friends even love it. The regular cakes are kinda dry but the cheesecakes, esp the raw ones, are killer. I try not to indulge in "raw" eating because that shit is for hippies, but for raw cheesecake I would wear a toga and chant hairy krishna all day long. The seasoned staff is sharp and know how to run the place.
