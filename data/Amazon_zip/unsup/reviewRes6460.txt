I hadn't been to this location for Wildfire in years, we finally returned for an early dinner on a Sunday night. The only odd thing about our visit is that they wouldn't seat us until our reservation time even though they clearly had space to seat us both in the main dining room and one of the side rooms where they eventually seated us. Maybe because we had teenage kids with us? Or maybe they didn't have enough wait staff? Whatever the reason, I would have preferred to be sitting down instead of milling about the entryway. Otherwise the service was fine. This is a good place to go with any size group, they have separate rooms for large parties and do a very nice family style menu, you can also get it if your party is 6 or more and you can all agree on the same items from the menu, you select 2 appetizers, 2 entrees, 2 salads and 2 desserts and share. I almost always get the same thing, the horseradish crusted filet mignon ($29.95) is always good and so is the french onion soup. And unlike other steak places in Chicago, the steak does not come totally ala carte, all steaks come with a choice of potatoes or vegetables, I like the au gratin potatoes that you can get with dinner. This time I tried the filet medalions ($28.95) that come with a variety of toppings, I tried parmesean and bearnaise and they were good but I think I'm sticking with the horseradish topping next time. They bring by a dessert tray with a wide variety of decadent looking desserts, they are usually big enough to share, the chocolate chip cookie topped with ice cream and whipped cream is delicious. One thing I really like about Wildfire is that the price tag is affordable and they don't have portion sizes that are enough to feed a family of four. Steak is something that I don't really like taking home for leftovers and if you are traveling, you'll waste it anyway.
