1 oclock on a thursday, no line outside, small line inside. Probably waited in line for 15 min? Not bad. Gave me time to scope the menu. I was torn between the pepita and jamon, so i went with whatever came out of my mouth: jamon w/a fried egg. The desserts looked deeelish. Went with the churros and choco hazelnut cookie. Me and Desiree G wanted to get out desserts first so we could eat them while we waited for our food, but the girl at the counter asked if she could hold onto the desserts until after we ate, and so we gave in. We waited about another 10-15 min for our food as we were seated. Ended up sharing a table, which was fine. When we got the food, it looked scrumptious. My jamon was good, had an almost tangy like taste due to a mustard used. The ham was some sort of prosciutto which was good. Buttt, i kind of wish i went with the pepito. But i was happy overall. The guy sitting at our table ordered the Ahogada and it looked sooo good. I must get that next time. Desiree ordered the special of the day which i cant remember what it was called, but it had mole and braised pork. It was good, but i agree with her and say it needed more meat and flavors, and less crunchy breadness. Onto the dessert: Choco-flan holy hell amazingness. Mexican Chocolate hazelnut cookie great texture and flavors Churros, ummm so good, need i say more? Although i enjoyed my sandwich from frontera fresco more, i would come back for more, and moree dessert.
