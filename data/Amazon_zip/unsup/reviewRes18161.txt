Second or third time for my daughter and me and the food never disappoints. I always ask for mild degree of hotness. Wed. special of pork belly sandwich is delicious. Peanuts with hot pepper and roasted garlic and guacamole for starters; so good. Rick and his staff are geniuses. Vegetarian soup is fabulous. Churros with the best tasting dipping chocolate . . .YUM.
