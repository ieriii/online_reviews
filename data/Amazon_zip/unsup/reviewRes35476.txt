So I was out in Chicago for a consulting gig, and a friend of mine said, "Hey, you should head over to my place, there's this seafood place that has the best seafood you'll ever have." I don't know if it's the best seafood that I've ever had, but it was pretty darn good. We always ate in the bar, and they have a full compliment of oysters and alcohol (very important for a night on the town in Cheeecagggoooo) to start your meal, the oysters flown in from around the country. They also start you off with some warm bread. Getting the meal in the bar was more my speed -- a little too formal in the dining room -- but it was a comfortable experience: just loud enough to let you know where you are at, but not too loud where you couldn't have a conversation. The meals were great. Fresh vegetables, fresh fish, great drinks.
