Bridgeport could not ask for anything better than Nana's....... I finally get a cafe i can chill at 2 blocks away from home... its about time Bridgeport is upgrading for the better with great diners like this place....The price is a bit pricey but i still give it 5 stars, because people have to realize the food is ORGANIC.... You will spend tons even if you shop at ORGANIC WHOLE FOODS.....
