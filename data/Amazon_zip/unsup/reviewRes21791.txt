For the last 2 years, Mayan Palace has been my mexican food and delicious margarita go-to neighborhood restaurant. 3 months ago, this place would have gotten 5 stars. The last couple times I've gone, it's been sub-par. Maybe I had just gotten used to outstanding service, being recognized by waitstaff, STRONG and delicious margaritas, solid food, et cetera... Two times ago, our apps came out AFTER the entree, our pitcher was refilled without asking us (OK, fine...but we want to mix up the flavors! Why not ask if we want another pitcher, if we want a different flavor, instead of just bringing the same? LAME.) You can't mix 'rita flavors anymore, either. And the drinks have gotten progressively weaker as the months go on. Also, they started lysol-ing the floor while we were still eating. Not cool, Mayan Palace--not cool. We tried again and it was more bad service, bad food (cold, tasteless, not Mayan Palace-ey at all), waterey drinks.... I'd rather go up the road to Tarascas for spicy tequila shrimp, steak tacos, great burritos, and margaritas that will consistently knock me on my ass.
