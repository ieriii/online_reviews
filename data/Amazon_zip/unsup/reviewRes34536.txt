I'm always a big fan of brunches, especially the ones that can last you all day! They have wonderful and generous portions.  I always fancy crepes, and they've got a great peach cobbler crepe. Pecan waffle with banana is also fabulous. My only thumbs down here is it gets really noisy... when we went in groups, we ended up always shouting at each other.  I would recommend a visit before 10 am on weekends, else the wait can be very long (upto 30-45 mins towards lunch time).
