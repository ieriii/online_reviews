Brunch is a hot commodity in Chicago, it seems, so the fella and I called ahead to inquire about the wait at Big Jones last weekend. The hostess popped us on the list via phone, which was unexpected but super nice of her, and we were seated within a few minutes of our arrival into this cute bistro. Good thing, because there isn't much room to wait inside. It's close quarters and loud in the front area, so we were glad to be stuck in the small back area. Our server endeared himself to me when he was greeting us and accidentally threw a ramekin full of sugar cubes at me (I caught it, like a champ). Normally, throwing food at a customer wouldn't score points, but this guy was so charming and on top of everything else that it didn't really matter. The beignets were a-mazing as only hot, fried, powdered-sugar-dusted dough balls can be. My boyfriend ordered biscuits too, and they came with honey butter and raspberry jam that were both excellent. I wish they had biscuits and gravy on the menu here. I really do. We ended up splitting the Eggs New Orleans and the Corn Cakes. The Corn Cakes are savory and come with black beans, salsa verde, avocado, sour cream, green onions and your choice of eggs (I went with poached). They were good, but there was room for improvement, albeit slight. Chorizo would be awesome and a maybe slight crispness to the pancakes for texture. I liked the Eggs New Orleans a little better. This is their version of an eggs bennie, made with popovers, blue crab cakes, poached eggs and barnaise. The popover and the crab cakes were both tasty (not stingy on the crab) and the poached eggs on both dishes were absolutely perfect. Add a little hot sauce and you're in business. Also of note: -They use Intelligentsia coffee here. I just had a delicious regular cup of coffee and it was refilled liberally. -Savory waffle with duck confit. Why didn't I order this? The Yelps will never know. I have to go back and eat it.
