We got there (a party of 3) on a Saturday morning at 10:30 and a few people were waiting outside already, but surprisingly we were seated within 5 minutes!  Food: Their fresh-squeezed grape juice was great! About $4 for a large that will be gone in a few big gulps. The Spicy Flamenco omelette (better than the El Torero scrambler at Yolk) was one of the best omelettes I've ever had! I LOVED it! Also tried a little bit of the French Toast Flight and something else...and those dishes were great too! All the food seems great here. Service: For being so busy, the service was great. Our server was nice, efficient, and friendly. I am DEFINITELY going back here! I love it!
