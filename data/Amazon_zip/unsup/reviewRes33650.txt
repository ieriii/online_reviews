Sometimes you just want something a little nicer. That's why I go to Mia Francesca's. You don't have to dress up and be fancy, but MF is always a nice local Italian restaurant to get a great meal. The menu is also very nice and they change up their dishes so if you've eaten there a lot, you can try a lot of different things. Call ahead for reservations because they fill up quickly. I have eaten both in the main dining room and upstairs. Both are very nice. I recommend it to my friends all the time.
