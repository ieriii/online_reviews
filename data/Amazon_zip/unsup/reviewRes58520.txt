Considering our expectations, this restaurant was dissappointing. There is a waiting line (probably because the restaurant doesn't take reservations and the venue is quite small), but that was doable.The waiter was very personable but the service was slow since he had a lot of tables to wait on. We started the evening with margaritas, which were good, small and pricey ($9.00 each). We ordered the grand seafood appetizer which had some pretty tasty components as well as middle of the road components.The entrees were bad. We ordered the Carne Assada which is their signature entree and had to send it back because it was so tough. The others ordered other entrees which were good, but fell short of our expectations. No one took doggie bags home.This is a cute restaurant if you are in town and you want to claim that you were at Rick Bayless's restaurant. However don't go to this restaurant with high expectations for the food or you will leave with a lot less cash and dissappointment.
