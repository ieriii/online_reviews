When a friend said we were canceling our pizza and I have to say I wasnt happy, but when I was told we were going to Wild Fire, I was more than thrilled. I love the feel of this place. If you havnt been there, its a tiny bit old school where it reminds me of a super club. I love the food, my fav is the salmon with the spinach, and garlic potatoes, oh and the chopped salad as an appetizer. Having gone to Key West for many family vacations, I have to say they have a great key lime pie. And you know, every time I am there, literally, the place is packed!! And we were there on a Tuesday night!! I highly suggest reservations a few weeks in advance!! Oh and they have a new red and white wine flight thats awesome!!!!
