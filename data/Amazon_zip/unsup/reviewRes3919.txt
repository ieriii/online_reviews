They have great wings and unique sauces. didn't like the korean bbq. The set up is cramped as most places in the City and when its busy, it is super hard to find somewhere to sit. Its a-ok for wings, wouldn't go out of my way for them, but when I am in the area, I would prompt to go to crisp for wings.
