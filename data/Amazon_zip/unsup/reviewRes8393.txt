Note: If you are looking for Chicago style pizza then skip Spacca Napoli. As we walked into the restaurant the smell of garlic was incredible. Our group consisted of 4 and our baby stroller. The place is not very big, but the nice gentleman who seated us was able to accommodate our need to leave our sleeping baby in the stroller. We ordered the Prosciutto e Bufala. This was a great appetizer and accommodated all 4 of us. We decided to eat family style and shared the Salsiccia and Bufalina for our entrees . I read some of the reviews that complain about the sogginess; I did not have a problem with this. I might depends on the pizza though. Since they use fresh mozzarella, fresh tomatoes and olive oil the cooking melts these ingredients and creates a wonderful mixture. The sausage on the Salsiccia was mild and unlike most sausage did not give me heartburn. I actually enjoyed the crust. For dessert we had the Tiramisu and cantaloupe sorbet. The sorbet was light and the Tiramisu was the best I ever had.
