This may not be the most authentic vietnamese restaurant out there, but it's still good. The owner, Tuan, was very courteous and helpful.. the place looked neat... servers were kind.. food were delicious.. i would definitely come back again... It's something new... not your traditional vietnamese cuisine, but shouldn't be hated upon. dishes are always altered in some way.. may taste good.. may taste awful.. but nevertheless, worth the try! you'll never know if you like something or not until you've taste it.be audacious and try this restaurant. ps. for that one message below.. i believe by izzy.. you're so vulgar..
