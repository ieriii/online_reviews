Stopped in for Sunday lunch and was impressed with the view of Michigan Ave and the park, funky decor and attentive service (at first). We were the second or third table in the entire restaurant and enjoyed some outstanding mushroom soup, cheese flight and quite good--although a tad overcooked--bay scallops. As lunch went on the restaurant filled up and our service slowed to a crawl. It was difficult to flag someone down just to refill our water glasses and ask for the check. Prices for lunch were reasonable, but looking at the dinner menu I'd venture to say it's overpriced. The chairs are not comfortable enough, our table had scuff marks all over it and nobody offered to take our coats. Bottom line: the food makes the grade but the service is below average.
