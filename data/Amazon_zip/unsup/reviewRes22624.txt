There is nothing bad I can say about this place. My dining companions and I just loved every thing that was brought to our table.  Our service was good, prompt greeting and seating. I should have known that I was in for something good when a nice little plate of 'yumminess' arrived to wet our palettes - Spicy cabbage, wow was it good and spicy. We ordered a few things, vegetable fried rice, garlic chicken, Tony's three chili chicken and peppered beef. All were just delicious. in fact the veggie fried rice was the best I've ever had. I remember this restaurant from the Taste of Chicago - Dry Chili Chicken which in fact set my entire body on fire. A good fire I might add, that shit is delicious. This will definitely become one of my favorite places in Chinatown...
