Back for another fantastic authentic Persian meal just a week later, on a Sunday. Ordered the same thing (naaah, we're not boring people at all). Well, we did order Mast-o-Khiar (yogurt with cucumber) this time - delicious with our Barg and Chengeh. In seventh heaven with the zulbia, bomieh and tea. This time we added a takeout order of Gheimeh Bademjan (lamb, eggplant and yellow split pea stew topped with string fries) for the next day. It was SO delicious, right on the money. Hubby-verified authentic Persian. The eggplant came skinned and whole in this dish (some places serve it chopped up). Tons of fragrant rice, a good serving of the stew, along with pita bread and sabzi. My Chengeh leftovers heated up very well and sooo tasty. There's a separate takeout shop next door past the the parking lot, so you can just get your mouthwatering food to go too. Everything was so well packaged, you really can't go wrong here. But I highly recommend a restaurant visit. While nothing will beat Hubby's grandma's home cooking, this is a very excellent substitute. Travel tip: when you're in the SF Bay Area looking for Persian food - we highly recommend Alborz in SF for upscale, and Rose Market in Mountainview for the cheapest tastiest takeout lunches.
