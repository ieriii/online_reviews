I love this hotel. The area is great! Cross the street is the best breakfast place. It feels very 'private'.  Small lobby with the essentials. The decor is very contemporary and stylish. The bathroom...gorgeous. Rooms are not huge but very comfortable. Downstairs there's a cool little spot for drinks. Plus you're within walking distance of some great little bars and restaurants. Fun shopping as well.I definitely would stay there again.
