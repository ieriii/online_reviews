I heart Schwa. I heart Michael Carlson. Oh, yes.  Awesome birthday celebration last night. And, after one full year of visiting every 4ish months...I have to say I never had the same dish twice, save the quail egg ravioli, and was absolutely thrilled with the fun, nerdy way these kids play with food. Frogs legs and strawberries...yep, that worked. Tallegio cheese is nummy. Rattlesnake tastes like dirt...and I like that. Fish ribs fried in tempura are super tasty...I didn't know you could do a rack of fish ribs. Lamb brains rank as one of my favorite foods. Tequila gelee is fun to lick off the plate, as is brown sugar vinegar. Slurp. And, my boss wants to eat his way out of a bathtub filled with quail egg ravioli and truffles. N.E.R.D. tunes were rocking. Sweet. I dig it.  Michael Carlson, you rock. Gaetano, thanks, sweet thang. Cheers, rd
