In looking for a place that was centrally located, then this is your place!! Initially, I was looking for a place to have a belated bday party al fresco. From a website, this seemed to be a good place for it. However, after calling to inquire about their outdoor seating, it would not work for my group as the area is far too small. However, the coordinator suggested a private room downstairs that would accommodate my 20 people. In the event of bad weather, too much noise (from my group), distractions on the street and space this worked out better. The room fit all of my guests perfectly. When people arrived, they were directed downstairs where their coats were taken and they could begin enjoying their afternoon beverage. After about 30 min of drinking and all of my guests arrived and settled down, we were seated for lunch. From everyone's reaction, the food was delicious. The menu contained a lot options. It was just your typical Irish fare which is one of the reasons why I chose this place along with location. The staff were amazing. Location you cannot beat. Food was delicious. Most importantly, my company made it a day that will never be forgotten.  I would recommend this place for groups, for sure. I will have to go back on a non special occasion to get what the restaurant is like upstairs (main floor).
