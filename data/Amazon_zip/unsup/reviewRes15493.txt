Try this place once and really no reason to go back. It's probably named violet hour cuz you can get the whole experience is 60 minutes. Not much to do inside. No standing room. Big secluded seating so forget socializing outside your crew and people watching. Drinks were amazing but how many "mixologist specially crafted drinks" can you have until you just want a shot or a beer or a vodka tonic.
