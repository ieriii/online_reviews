Irazu is awesome. Never tried costa rican food before and decided to try this place out as we live nearby. It was busy but we got seated fairly quickly and ordered and got our food pretty quick too. It was really good, the rice and shrimp were delightful. Not too pricey either, and our waitress was very nice.
