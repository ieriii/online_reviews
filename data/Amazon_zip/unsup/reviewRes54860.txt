Love this place, beer list is incredible. They even have my favorite beer on tap Little Sumpin Sumpin which was best beer at beerfest in Madison Wisconsin last year. Love mussels also.Only drawbacks are getting a table since its always packed, and also no tvs (I know, I know some people hate tvs but I am into sports).
