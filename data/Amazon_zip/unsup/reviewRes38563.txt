ahhhhhhh life away from 22 year old obnoxious frat boys. i need to head north more often. i love their huge beer list but next time when i plan to stay for dinner, i'll make it a weekday or just arrive earlier. a three hour wait on a friday night was not ideal but we were committed. this is another place i had no excuse for not trying earlier. granted, we were a bit tipsy after the wait and a few pumpkin ales - but we still appreciated the spread. the spinach and leak tart and dessert (of course) are the most memorable. in case you haven't heard me say this before, there's NOTHING wrong with salted carmel gelato...
