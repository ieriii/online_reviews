I love you Indie. you are there when i want a quick cheap lunch. you are the perfect place to take out of towners when we are by my house. you have the best atmosphere of any byob ive been to. i have good crazy tuna hand roll and curry. i wish you would offer BROWN RICE. i know certain carb concious people would pay more for it. ive considered bringing my own brown rice. how cool would that be. i like the technish music too. i could see a live DJ in this place as well as maybee later hours on friday and saturday. (edit) they now have brown rice but charge an extra $2 for it which is a bit much.
