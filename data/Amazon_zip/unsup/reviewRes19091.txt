I typically don't like to go to high end, trendy, Mexican joints but this place got high reviews and there's Rick Bayless. I ordered the beef tongue sandwich (mainly because it's not a typical Mexican dish) and it was delicious! I believe it was a special that day. Closed it out with ice cream and churros. While churros aren't that expensive and I'm not sure how much better they can make it to justify the cost. It was pretty expensive for just 3 churros and ice cream, but it was good. I'd recommend it, but just a heads up, it'll cost you. Either way, I still recommend this place. 1 star deducted just for the prices. A little high for Mexican food, but don't get me wrong, it's good here!
