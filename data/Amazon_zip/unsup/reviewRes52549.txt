Getting ahead of myself, but I'm totally with Esther Y on the grilled pineapples! Granted, you need to strategize on how to best get your value here before you settle for fruit.  Brazzaz still does send out coupons every couple months to (maybe) downtown highrises. It is essentially a buy 1 get 1 free good for Sun-Thur, but limits you to only 1 per table. Brazzaz does tend to be a bit on the pricey side, but that said, it's still worth it. The website has all the meats and offerings, but I definitely thought the beef ribs, giant prawns, pork tenderloin were the highlights here. Also, you can never go wrong with bacon-wrapped anything, although I found the chicken to be better than the filet mignon. Wasn't a huge fan of anything lamb, found it to be a bit gamey at Brazzaz.  I also found the salad bar was quite extensive, and included goodies such as balls of cheese, grilled mushrooms, and smoked salmon, although I tried to keep my time here to a minimum. Brazzaz is a classy joint, if you feel like going all-out and enjoying a meat-fest, it's definitely not a bad way to go, just be prepared for the bill.
