He said "YES!" I took him to Jared. Psych! He agreed to going to Sun Wah. But you can still buy me a gift. It's a nice tradition of dining at a Chinese restaurant for Peking duck on Christmas that's been shown everywhere from A Christmas Story to unofficial yelp gatherings. The ambiance is very cafeteria, VFW banquet hall, or church meeting room. Unromantical, crowded, and banal. The service is very abrupt and cut and dry. With the Peking duck service you get: Teapot. Duck carved tableside with little buns and veggies and a fantastic sauce. The sauce was very good and the crispier duck skin was aces. Duck soup and duck fried rice. The soup was a bit bland but we liked the broth and veggies. Ice cream I didn't eat any but my guest didn't like it and that's saying something since he likes ice cream so much he built a shrine to it in his freezer. I was pleased they served us family style even though dining on Christmas alone would indicate we are from broken homes. I was not pleased by the $5 corkage fee and when I asked for extra veggies and he nodded then brought back a mountain without saying that would be $4.50. $4.50 for sliced carrots?! Um if you mentioned it when I asked I'd have skipped it. That corkage fee is (besides illegal, but openly accepted) a scounch high. The duck itself. If you haven't had it imagine all the dark meat of turkey but fattier. The leftovers had a huge puddle of oil in the bottom of the container after sitting. I don't know why. My friend kept feeling sorry for the duck. They are very peaceful animals, just glide around in water, then fly around. They're also good at walking in lines as a group and creating V formation flying. It's a good place to spend Chrismakkuh but don't expect a holiday miracle with the ambiance and food.
