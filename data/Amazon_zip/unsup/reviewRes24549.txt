Visited with friends after we realized a simmering craving for fondue. It is romantic, cozy, interesting, everything our brother and sister yelpers say. Started with valet parking ($10) but there is a TON of meter parking along Clark if it is not too cold to walk. Met our friends in the bar where they had already started on a glass of bubbly and a sangria. Before we could even order our drinks, the hostess came to seat us (which was good, actually, because the bar is not terribly large). Snuggled into a booth, the incredibly entertaining busman lit the cheese fondue flame WITH HIS FINGER. Cool, but kids, don't try this at home. We had another round of sangria and ordered an inexpensive red from Argentina suggested by the waitress. It was tasty and an excellent suggestion. Cheese fondue starter was good, especially on what was a very cold night. For the main course, we had beef and lobster with all sorts of veggies. Sauces were very good, especially the spicier ones. Service was prompt without interrupting either our meal or conversation. It was all super enjoyable. Suggestion, then? This is a great place for romance, but it ALSO a great place for couples on a double date. Intimate and cozy so conversation is easy, cooking your own in fondue provides its own entertainment, and roasting marshmallows for a quick Gejas S'more is a great finale. So was the coffee and Frangelico.  Advice? Don't wear a freshly-laundered suit or sweater - the oil you will be cooking in creates a certain aroma that will follow you home...
