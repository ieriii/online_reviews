In the afternoon the place is calm. Just went last night and the place has a vibrant and fun environment. The food was great, had a chicken dinner and guayaba shells for dessert. Great service, expect to wait to be seated and served food if the the place is full. However they do have a waiting lounge and it's never a long wait. B. Y. O. B!
