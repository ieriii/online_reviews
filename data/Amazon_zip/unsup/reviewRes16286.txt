I had lunch there yesterday. We had the fixed price menu as part of restaurant week. It was superb. The black bean soup was delicious, a wee kick to it and a hint of a smokey flavor. For the main I had the seafood.  Perfect. Now the desert was over the top in the next world fantastic.  Don't know what it was called but it had a little pudding/cake with ice cream and caramel sauce. Great presentation on all three items. They also served a very generous portion of guacamole with chips for a few cents extra! (less than a dollar)  I will definitely go back. Service was very pleasant.
