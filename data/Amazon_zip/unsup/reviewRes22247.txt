This place. Oh, man. Best Chinese I've ever had. My stepdaughter is going to college in Chicago and we went here last weekend while we were visiting her. I cannot wait to go again. I am sure we'll be back every time we visit her. I had a cow maw soup that was one of the freaking hottest things I have ever eaten. I love hot food but I'm a whitey, so i was sweating. The broth was un. Believable. So,so delicious. The maw itself, I gotta admit, wasn't my thing, but I think that's just because I had hit my cultural limit. I don't fault the soup. My husband had the Three Cups Chicken, tender and fantastic. My stepdaughter had the orang chicken, a standard, so probably not too interesting for the chefs to prepare, but it was really good. I gotta believe this is the best Sichuan in Chicago.
