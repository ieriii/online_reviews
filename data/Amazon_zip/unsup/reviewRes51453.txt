I feel terrible giving Garcia's just 3 stars even though it was highly recommended by a friend who frequents the place all the time. We were quoted a wait time of 30 minutes but was seated in less then 5. The dinner started off great....quick service of water, salsa and warms chips (which lack salt). The wait staff was very attentive. We thought that we were in for a good time. We ordered a pitcher of margaritas and the Guacamole appetizer. The Guacamole came out very quickly. After tasting the guacamole, I realized that it wasn't homemade. It tasted like the Dean's (fake) guacamole dip that you can buy at the grocery store. Wholly Quacamole tasted better then this crap. It was sent back.  Within a couple of minutes our burritos came out. Even though I know that it doesn't take much to make a burrito....I was very surprised that it came out within minutes of us ordering them. The burrito was huge and the steak was really good but the burrito was barely warm. I was highly disappointed especially since I paid extra for avocado and cheese. The cheese wasn't melted and I found maybe the equivalent of one slice of avocado at the bottom of the burrito. It wasn't even distributed through out.  The saving grace for Garcia's were the margaritas and the waitstaff. Believe it or not, it took longer for them to make the margaritas then it did for them to bring out the guacamole and our burritos. Go figure! The margaritas were delicious and they actually had a punch to them. My friend and I couldn't even finish the entire pitcher due to the fact that we wouldn't be able to drive home.  If I do go back to Garcia's, I will definitely try something that they actually have to cook like the fajitas or steak.
