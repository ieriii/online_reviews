Friend and I had dinner tonight; food was good. Service was attentive. However, they overcharged me by 25% or $6. It's my fault for not paying attention to the receipt b/c I was engaged in a conversation with my friend. So, before you pay, CHECK THE RECEIPT and MAKE SURE THEY AREN'T OVERCHARGING YOU.
