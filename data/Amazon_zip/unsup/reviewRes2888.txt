Tru was all about the experience. The service, absolutely amazing. I was blown away by the perfect timing of things. Still convinced our server had somehow tapped into my thoughts, as nothing was overlooked.  I'm usually VERY picky about what I eat, but there were combinations I would have never thought of plating together that amazed my palette. Let's just say I'm truly happy I opened myself up. The food was pure art and handled that way. A bit dainty sometimes, but I appreciated the craft that each dish obviously entailed. If you're looking for a HUNGRY MAN meal, look else where. Yes, the cost of this experience borders on the insane, but for something special. sitting across from the right person, it is so worth it. A place to adorn that perfect dress, sit back and enjoy the whole experience.
