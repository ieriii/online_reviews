Gird your taste buds and get ready for something really... different. With things on the menu like sea cucumber (and no, it's not a vegetable) or Jellyfish food is an adventure once again! I had a great time at this restaurant, going with a group of friends and ordering all separate dishes, putting them in the center of the table and enjoyed the myriad of different foods. The chilly fish was delish, the vegetable soup was a little salty (but good), the duck's tongue was... I've never had duck's tongue before so I'll say it was an experience, and for the less adventurous, the Mongolian beef and garlic chicken was really good too (weak in the knees). the service is OK, but the presentation is out of this world... or at least out of this country. I would suggest that you get there early or reserve a seat because they get packed! If you are driving, there is only street parking so be careful where you park.
