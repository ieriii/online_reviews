This place is like a Cheesecake Factory but not as good and more pricey. The service was not that great. We went on a Saturday and waited about 30 minutes, which was fine. But when we actually sat down, we had to wait another 10-15 minutes for our server to actually show up to get our drinks and another 10 minutes to come back to take our order. If you get a seat by the window, you'll get a view of Michigan Ave, which is pretty nice. But overall, fhe food was alright and the servings are huge. But that's all there is to it.
