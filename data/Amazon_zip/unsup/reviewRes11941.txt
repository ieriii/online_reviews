Ok, so I know it sounds cliche...but I LOVE pizza. No...you don't understand...I really LOVE it (but only if it's made well). After a Sundate with my lovies at Piece this weekend, I rediscovered my pizza passion! This place is sooooo awesome. Before going, I thought Piece was going to be some random bar in Wicker Park with just average pizza. Oh man..I was totally off! Piece Pizza serves some of the best pies I've ever had. I'm not really into the deep dish crap that most Chicagoans seem to love. Nor am I into the paper thin cracker shit that is becoming so trendy these days. Piece has the formula down right--thin but not too thin crust, savory tomato sauce, and fresh ingredients. We got a large red pizza for the six of us which was plentttty! The slices are huge and filling and prices are super cheap. I would suggest skipping on appetizers and going straight for the pizza (and beer if that's your thang--i hear they brew their own). The casual and upbeat atmosphere definitely enhanced the pizza experience for me. It's such a great place to come with a group of friends--we ate, we drank, we laughed--oh what fun we had! I will definitely be back again and again and again...perhaps for my next bday celebration!
