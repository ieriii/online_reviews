Dear Meli, I am sorry I dissed you for so long. Every time I drive by there is a line out the door and I never realized the wait was so worth it, not to mention that everyone has to wait outside because there is not waiting area. I was really looking forward to breakfast the other day and you really made it worth the trip over. I loved the banana pecan pancakes with Carmel sauce, in fact, I ate the whole thing. I also really loved the berry smoothie, it was such a tasty treat. My husband was with me and he is still talking about the crab cake eggs Benedict, how do you make everything so yummy? I can't wait to see you again! I already know what I am going to order :)
