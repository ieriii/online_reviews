Ordered carryout. Was told it would be ready in 20 minutes. It took more like 40. Got home and the food was plentiful but disgusting. Everything was just wrong... lettuce- spoiled, veal- kind of gray, minestrone soup- contained nothing but mush, mostaccioli meat sauce- was it from a can?, bread sour. You couldn't pay me to eat here again. My garbage disposal ate better than I did tonight. What a waste.
