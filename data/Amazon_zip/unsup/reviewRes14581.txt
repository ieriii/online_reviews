May have been a little busy for a Wend night but the server seemed to be a bit overwhelmed. Did see an old friend that I hadn't seen in 15 years that was cool. food was okay was very disappointed in the pasta I thought it would be authentic Italian tasted more like Ragu. There was plenty of parking and the atmosphere and Clientele were pretty nice and laid back.
