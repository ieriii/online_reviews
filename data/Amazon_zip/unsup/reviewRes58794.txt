It was ok. I went with another friend. Prices were very reasonable. The decor was also very nice.We ordered the papaya salad, pad prik king and one other dish.The papaya salad was supposedly made with fresh papaya but the only thing papaya in it was the sauce which they made really spicy and I have a high tolerance for spicy.the pad prik king was good in my opinion but there was nothing Thai about it.We also ordered this other seafood dish and it was very bland. Shrimp with vegetables is what I would call it. I would consider it more like a chop suey than Thai food. Perhaps, we just ordered the wrong dishes but I would consider it mediocre and more like a 2 star but I gave them an extra star because the curries next to us smelled decent.
