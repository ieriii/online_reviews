L&E was highly recommended to me by several coworkers, so I had high expectations when my boyfriend and I stopped there for dinner on a Wednesday night after work. Perhaps it was a little over-hyped, because I found the place just didn't live up to the talk. We felt lucky to be seated soon after we arrived; the place was pretty packed for a week night. By the time we left, it was standing room only. I personally hate having no personal room to eat and drink, and with the crowd and close-set tables, the atmosphere just didn't feel comfortable. Neither did the ratio of price to portion. Ok, I get it--fine ingredients, unusual pairings, blah blah blah. When I order venison I would like more than 3 bites on the plate. And maybe a little more of the sides, please. The food was pretty tasty (the bf had a delicious sloppy joe and incredible fries) but I expected a little more for my money. At least, in Logan Square. The dessert saved the day. The lemon trifle was perfect. Drinks were good, too. This place probably deserves a 3.5.
