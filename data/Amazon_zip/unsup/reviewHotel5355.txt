Came to Farmers Market on your property and was so grateful to be there.While I realize you are Boutique Hotel I can not help but thank you for holding an amazing event on your property. I have been in the South Loop for 35 years and have been hoping and praying that one day there would be a farmers market in the South Loop. People were so happy to be around fresh foods, good friends and great music. Thanks for all your effort to bring such a wonderful experience to the South Loop. It was very very generous of you to organize and facilitate it. Can't wait till next week to come by again!
