I've been wanting to come here forever, and I finally got the chance for a friend's birthday. This place was easy to find - it was right off the Red Line. I got here 10 minutes before 9pm and there wasn't any lines outside at all! When I walked in, I noticed that there were a lot of people young and old hanging around and chatting. It was really nice and cozy. It's dark inside, but the lighting is good and sets the tone for the evening. The interior design of this place is absolutely incredible! It was so great to be in the company of others and to enjoy the music. The minute the band started playing, there were couples up and dancing. Wish I had my dancing shoes on! The only bad thing about this place would be how pricey their drinks are, but the atmosphere is stellar and I definitely would love to come back.
