Mia Francesca is a favorite of my Fiance's and now it's a favorite of mine.  Wow had I been "slumming it" at Italian restaurants until coming here. The food, the atmosphere,... the food!!!  There was an alfredo type cream sauce on my dish that was soo good, I wanted to lick the bowl. Anyway, From appetizers... to salad ... to entree... to wine... to dessert... Mia Francesca is top-notch in my opinion!
