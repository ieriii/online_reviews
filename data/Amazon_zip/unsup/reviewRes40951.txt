We had Bonsoiree cater our wedding and it was unbelievable. Chef Luke made the most amazing food, notably the braised short ribs and the grilled escolar still had everyone talking days later. The organizer, Anthony Navarro went so far above and beyond any catering responsibilities he might have had. He was not only the catering coordinator, but he made sure I wanted for nothing, emceed the entire evening, and made sure my mom had fun as opposed to worrying about the details. He was amazing and I would like to buy him a car. Sadly I can't afford that, but I will pass on his card to anyone who might ever need a caterer in Chicago. You will not be disappointed.
