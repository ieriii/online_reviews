the food is good but minus a star for the service. i've been coming here once in while since high school and nothing has changed. now my bf lives literally a block from here but i have NEVER gone here with him and it is NOT on our list of places to go.  I come here with some friends from school and two of them are korean so they take care of the ordering and communicating with the waitress (i literally don't need to say a word to them) - it's like VIP when we're with them. the waitresses are pleasant, the panchan and water get refilled quickly and they even left a large bowl of one of them for us. i'm used to subpar service. take chinatown for example - fine they dont roll out the red carpet for their customers but they do their job and just kinda leave you alone. here, they either hate their job or they hate all their customers. if you enjoy being scorned while you eat. by all means come here!
