The sushi here is really fresh and delicious! Can't remember exactly which ones I had but I really enjoyed the one with mango but everything was really good! The beef asparagus appetizer was quite tasty as well.  The place is really small so carry out or delivery is probably ideal. Although I am just a couple blocks out of their delivery area...I have tried to negotiate with them on the phone saying that I will order lots of sushi and give a really good tip if they would just deliver to me! But oh well, what can you do? :P
