I love Violet Hour. It's such a great concept and it's such a great place to hang out with friends or to take someone on a date. The lines can be long, but my advice is try to get here early. We started drinking early so we ended up ordering pretty much all of their food items. None of the little plates were all that interesting, except for the country fried pork sandwich. Order lots and lots of the country fried pork sandwich and you'll be good to go.  I can't even remember all the drinks we tried but every single one was so unique and so tasty. I can't wait to return!
