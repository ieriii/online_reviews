Gilt Bar is fantastic. Had dinner here on Friday night, great crowd and energy. Food & drink here are amazing. Bone marrow and steak tartare are the best Ive ever had. Rabbit pasta with marinated artichoke was incredible, never had an artichoke taste so good, ricotta gnocchi was excellent as well. Mussels were delicious and came a huge loaf of bread to dip in the broth - went great with the La Chouffe Houblon that was on draft as well. Meatballs were soooo good, went really well with the creamy polenta and brown butter. Fries are the best in Chicago. Finished with an assortment of candies, ice cream and a chocolate almond cake for dessert, excellent way to end the meal. The drink selection is great as well - good mix of craft beers, eclectic and affordable wines and cocktails. Service was smooth and timely, our server was really. For being in River North was very unpretentious as well, not to mention really well priced. I will definitely be back often
