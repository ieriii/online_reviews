Prior to moving to Texas 3 years ago, I lived in Chicago area for 39 years. I visit Chicago at least once a year and my first stop is the Wilson ave. exit and a trip to Sano's. There may be better pizzas in Chicago but Sano's is consistant, very well priced and it's always nice to talk to Frank. How many places do you know where the owner is the only one to do the cooking? There is no better pizza in the Elston Ave/ Lawrence Ave. area. Highly Recomended!
