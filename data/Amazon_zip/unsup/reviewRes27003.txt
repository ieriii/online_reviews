Sooo...I would give 4 stars for food and 2 stars for the waitress. The fois gras lollipops covered in watermelon rock pops were out of this world. i savored each and every bite. Heaven. They were $5 each. Then we got to the main menu...the waitress kept trying to pressure us to get a sampling menu, which is at least ~$75 each. Some of us wanted it, some of us didnt. However, since the entire table is required to get it, we decided to pass on it. I don't think she was happy. Since we weren't getting a sampler, she said we should get at least 1 hot dish, 1 cold dish and an entree. Thats a lot of food for me...so I shared...Some of us took her recommendations. I got the charred octopus for my "cold plate" which was light and flavorful. Someone got the deconstructed ceasar salad that looked cool, but did not taste good. Com'on a ceasar salad is a ceasar salad no matter how you present it. I got the fois gras as my "hot" plate. It was great. I think i might have eat a bit too much fois gras, but it was some of the best I've had. Then I got the skate confit, it sounds super interesting, but I didn't like it. I ended up trading it for something else, but I don't remember for what.... Then we all shared the chocolate framboise, which was yummy, but not too special. In the end, we were all feeling good with a good meal. The waitress brings us our receipts with our credit cards...and said we "can share pens since you shared everything else." WHat! Excuse me. I didn't think much of it, but my friends definitely think she was make a snide remark. And if she was, excuse you...you get 2 stars for your rudeness.
