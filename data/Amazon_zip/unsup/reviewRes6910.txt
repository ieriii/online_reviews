I thought this place was cramped, loud, and overpriced. I could barely hear my husband sitting across the table from me for a few reasons: 1. They pack you in like sardines. I couldn't move my chair back, or I'd hit someone. When I stood up to leave the table, I had to squeeze by the table next to me. There is only one small aisle through the restaurant and if anyone is walking in it, you have to wait for them to go by in order to move. Made me a little claustrophobic. 2. Loud music. Is it so loud to drown out all the conversations of those around you? Doesn't work, you can still hear the guy seated a foot away from you talk about his house closing. 3. I think everyone was talking super loudly to compensate for the noise. It only made the problem worse. The food was not so good as to justify the price. A pasta dish with nothing special for $21? Not worth it. I had the pumpkin ravioli and they were good, but way too sweet for a dinner course. I could only eat 2 of the 5 they gave me and I took the rest home. Overall, I don't think I'll come back. There are a ton of better Italian restaurants in the city where I'd rather spend my money.
