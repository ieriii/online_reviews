Went to Bad Apple yesterday & got the "Hangover".  The burger was incredible. It was cooked well, on a nice pretzel bun with all the right fixins. The sevice was good too.  However, the fries were so bad, that I won't return. They were soggy & flavorless, even though I opted for the truffle seasoning. They make their own "ketchup" and it's terrible. It's more like marinara, and it's the only ketchup they offer. So, if you go, BYOK. I'm telling you it's nasty. It really took away from the entire meal. I get it...they want to make it in-house. It's a cool idea. But, if you're going to do that, make it BETTER than what we're used to. Don't ruin it for everyone. It was such a let down, I won't return or send anyone there.
