The decor and art along the back walls is nice, it sort of reminds you of a country farm but very bright and imaginative, but the food, that is another story. crab cakes were mushy and small portion. It's a big restaurant and maybe they just cant keep up with the quality of the food, because myself and 2 of the 3 diners I was with were disappointed in the food including the blackened chicken and hopping jack. I think I'll try Wishbone for brunch but never again for dinner.
