this place is fab. any oysters, fish, pork get it all. interesting combos. Expensive but worth the money all the way.  One of my fav. brunch spots! reg coffee as good as the french press. nice little salad greens. I had some amazing bacon and red wine poached eggs on my last visit. Impressive staff: I heart the beer Manager, I needed a specific glass for a beer shoot I was working on. he borrowed me two! now thats great customer service Also on open table which I love
