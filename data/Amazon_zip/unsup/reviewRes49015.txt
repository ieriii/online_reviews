This is a tough review to write because the food and beer are so fantastic. We went to the beer pairing dinner on 8/23 with New Holland. food and beers were excellent. However, the service was not. Our server started off well but it fell apart quickly from there our second and third courses had the food and beer pairings mixed up as well as having both courses and beers arrive within a minute of each other. The wait then increased between courses and then we waited over 20 minutes just to get our check.  We were also disappointed that no a single person from New Holland came by to say hi or tell us one piece of info about the beers and how they were selected and paired with the food. That was truly disappointing as our experience with pairing dinners with beer that there is a much greater level of interaction. The hostess listened to our concern but we have not heard back from them. For a $300+ dinner for 4, I may be picky but I expect a little better. I hope they can overcome this major downside because the food and beers are truly spectacular. We may be back but will make sure that the service has improved.
