I came here a while ago for a quick meal before a concert at Charter One. I remember liking the burger I had, but not being blown away by it. Recently my boyfriend and I went here for a meal during bourbon week. The cocktails we had were really good. Our waiter was extremely nice and helpful. He gave great recommendations and seemed to be really knowledgeable. We definitely had a nice time, but none of the food was that spectacular. It was all just OK.
