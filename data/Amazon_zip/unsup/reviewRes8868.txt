A great take on Neapolitan pizza. Keep in mind that the Neapolitan style is different from your average American pizza (deep dish, NY style, etc.). It's cooked at extremely high temperatures, usually for only a couple minutes. The dough contains no sugar and no or little oil, both of which are used in most American pizzas. It's up to the chef to bring out the sweetness, color, and texture of the dough ingredients (fine italian caputo 00 flour, water, salt, yeast, maybe a little olive oil) through the fermentation and baking process. Neapolitan pizzas are sort of the "grandfather" of modern pizza. The somewhat limp center of the pizza is not uncommon for this style and does not at all detract from the eating experience in my opinion. The price is very reasonable and the atmosphere is great. It's definitely worth a trip!
