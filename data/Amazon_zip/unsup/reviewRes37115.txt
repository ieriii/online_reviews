Windy city indulgence. When I moved back to Chicago after 7 years the distance to Fox and Obel was a factor. I remember going there for great beef, sea salt and fresh fish. Alas, as some have noted it has changed. There fish case used to be Amazing. Multiple kinds of fresh tuna, etc. It now looks somewhat anemic. But I still go there once a week because their beef and bread is fantastic. The fruit and veggies are still top notch and the price seems to have gotten a little more competative. The pastry area is great and the food finds are always fun. Loses a star because I remember how fantastic they used to be.
