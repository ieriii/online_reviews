great little boutique hotel just off the Miracle Mile in Chicago. it's convenient to all manner of downtown public transport options and there are tons of eateries in the area (though not enough small, independent places for my liking...was kinda hard to find a fun+quirky breakfast, but i'd suggest Brett's Kitchen or the Ohio House diner). Hotel Felix *just* opened so the restaurant isn't even up and running and they're ironing out some kinks, but they make up for it with great and personal customer service. some examples: - i noted on our reservation that it was our anniversary and they had a bottle of wine and a hand-written note waiting in our room - when a surprise rainstorm hit on our last day, the front desk scared up an umbrella for us to borrow for the whole day - even though our stay was short, all the doormen remembered us and greeted us warmly and personally each time we returned. ...add to all this that the hotel is extremely eco-friendly (it has silver LEED certification) and affordable and you have a winner.
