Upon my pending trip to Chicago, I wanted to try as many Chicago Stuffed Pizza places in SD to compare to Giordanos as possible b/c I really wanted a side-by-side comparison while it was fresh in my head. Cut to the first day of our adventures and for lunch we stopped by here and got the sausage stuffed pizza. The biggest difference I noticed was the cheese. It is a little more pungent and tastier than anywhere else that tries to replicate the gem of a pizza they have here. I've gone near and far and no pizza for me tops Giordanos. I don't know what it is, but I love the fullness, meatyness, cheesyness, doughyness of a stuffed pizza. And I was so proud when my friend (Ashley D.) converted. As stupid and blasphemous as someone can be for not being a fan of pizza, she came around and realized that she actually likes Giordanos. The pizza here is almost like a pizza casserole and each bite you get every layer of sauce, cheese, dough. I waver back and forth, but personally I like to have a little bit (just a little) of veggies on the pizza with some meat. You get the best of both worlds. I've been to Geno's. I've been to Lou's and yet nothing compares to me like Giordano's. It's so perfect. And I know so many of you will argue, but I love this and will take it over NY style. In conclusion, there are 2 foods that I can eat the rest of my life Fries (with any types of meat or toppings on top or just plain old french fries) and Pizza and Giordanos definitely falls in that category.
