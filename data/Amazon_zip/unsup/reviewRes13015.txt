I went here last night with some friends from work. I had been here previously and had a great experience so I was eager to come back for a second trip, especially for the jalepeno honey porkchops! We shared the coconut shrimp and tamale appetizer. The coconut shrimp - WOW, I wish that was a whole entree. It was spicy and sweet, and it comes with a little mound of rice mixed with sweet and spicy coco nutty goodness. It wasn't too over the top coconutty, but was just sweet enough to be super yummy. The tamales also had a pretty good kick to it, and it is different from your run of the mill tamales, they are definitely not in the husk, instead it comes with four triangles with some sour cream and tomatoes on the top. Still tasty but did not make quite the impression as the coconut shrimp. Then for entrees, we shared the comol platter (the fajitas basically) and requested the chicken and steak combo. I loved the black bean sauce that came on the side, and it came with a lot of grilled veggies but I feel like it didn't have as much flavor to the dish as the other food did. And of course we had to order the honey jalepeno porkchops! Ok if you order this dish, be aware that it is huge! It comes with two large porkchops..and wait for it, here comes the best part, on top of sweet potatoes. My dream come true :) I had a great second experience, the service is great, they have a great wine/drink list and their entrees are yummy, huge, and very reasonable for how much they give you!
