We clearly took this place off guard. I was expecting to have a group of about eight to ten of us maximum here on a Monday night. Considering the day of the week, the size of our group and the sheer size of this place, I thought we would be OK. I was the first one of the party there and they only had one of the three floors open along with the patio. Then the masses of Yelpers overtook the place by storm. We ended up with a group of two dozen Yelpers. We ended up stretching from the patio all the way into the inside of the building. I have to give our waiter extra kudos for handling the masses of us flawlessly! He provided separate checks on request and was quick on the draw with the drinks and the food. As I mentioned earlier, this place is three floors and it is huge. My only complaint was that the Music was deafening in the tiny little bathroom. What was the deal with that minuscule little restroom anyway? I ordered something simple to eat. Mac-N-Cheese with bacon. This stuff knocked me off my feet. It was a heart attack in a bowl but it was really amazing. Everything that I saw coming out of the kitchen looked delicious. Who wants to join me on the return visit?
