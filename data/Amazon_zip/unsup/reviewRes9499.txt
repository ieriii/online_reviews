Come here on a Thursday night, pretty empty and we were seated right away. I don't remember much about the food besides the grill cheese crisp and the Venison(cold), but I quite like the ambience- intimate, candles, easy to have a conversation, waiters are attentive but not intrusive. It's actually a great date night place.
