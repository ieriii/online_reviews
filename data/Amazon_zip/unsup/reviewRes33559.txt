Dennis (fake character): What should we do tonight? Mac (me): I'm so hungry, I wish there was a way to get food for free Dee (my hot date): I have some gift cards to Mia Francesca Mac: Alright let's go! Dennis: I'm in! Dee: Ohhhh about that Dennis ... there's only enough for two Dennis: You're just jealous of my body Dee: Uhhh no ... I'm not. Let's go Mac "The Gang Goes Italian" * Random shots of Philadelphia * (Mac and Dee approach the hostess) Mac: Table for 2 please Hostess: You're not wearing any pants Mac: Actually, they're skin colored pants (I wasn't wearing skin colored pants) Hostess: Right ... (Mac and Dee get seated) (Waiter approaches) (It's Charlie) (It really is) (The waiter actually looks 100% like Charlie) (His name is Felix) (But he does! I told him twice about it) (Then I asked my date if I could take out my phone) (I don't normally pull phones out on dates, but I had to show him Charlie) (I showed him http://imgur.com/Tyyqs.j ) (He agreed with the similarity) (At that point I also decided to write a review as Always Sunny) (We will now return to your regularly scheduled programming) Charlie: So guys, what are you having? Mac: Charlie? Is that you? Charlie: No, I'm Felix your waiter Mac: No, that is you! What's in this moonshine? Charlie: I haven't even brought you your drinks yet Mac: Awkward............ Note 1: I really wish I could have been Dennis but then I'd be going on a date with my sister and that's illegal in IL and 32 other states Note 2: The food at the North Korean restaurant across the street was better ... compared to other Italian in the city, nothing really stood out as great. We shared the chicken and some fish and it was just plain. Charl..err Felix was nice enough to separate it for us so most of the stars are from his good service. Wine list looked long but a little pricey.
