HANGOVER CURE #523 Cafe 28 has breakfast burritos that are as big as your freakin' head. (Disclaimer: Don't hold me to this; I really have no idea how big your head is...in any case, it's big.) Fluffy eggs, smoky chorizo, melted cheese...after a few bites you will feel revitalized as your body starts to forgive you for the damage you inflicted the night before. On top of the great food, Cafe 28 has a lot of tables and I didn't have to wait for a table, a big pet peeve on the weekends. I haven't tried the other things on the menu yet, but my neighbor's chilaquiles looked incredible. I'll definitely be back.
