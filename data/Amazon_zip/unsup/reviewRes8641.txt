Ok, not sure why I haven't reviewed Spacca Napoli yet since I have been there 4 times already! Every time I go there, I have fresh, tasty pizza! I have realized this time, though, that I like the red sauces better than the white ones. (This time I got a white one with buffalo mozzarella, basil and arugula.) One thing that does kind of bother me is that some things on the menu are only in Italian--and that is cool that they are authentic like that, but then I have to ask a lot of questions as to what things are. I like the space there... it is nice and homey and not stuffy at all! And, it is really great that you can make reservations, too, although that may only be for the weekdays.
