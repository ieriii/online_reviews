I returned to Noon o Kabab after a long time as I became a Masouleh fan (and I still am!). The hostess as always were nice to me and my group. I was surprised to see that much crowd at 8 pm Sunday so I thought they should have been doing some great job and yes I was right! The food was great and this is a real Persian food restaurant unlike Reza who is becoming more and more non-Persian! Anyway, I should say I still like Masouleh more because of its cozy environment and home-cooked taste but if you are looking for a fancier Persian restaurant and you also like "Barg Kabab" Noon o Kabab is the one! Try the new Caspian Eggplants too! By the way, apparently they stopped accepting http://restaurant.com gift certificates, so do not count on it! :-)
