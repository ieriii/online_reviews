The Chicago Diner... definitely not the best vegan food I have ever had, but with a dietary restriction that has few sanctuaries in the land of meat and potatoes, we'll all take what we can get. My biggest "beefs" (pardon the animal-unfriendly expression) with the Diner are the price and the spotty quality of the food. I usually get the Philly Cheezesteak with the mashed taters or mac n' cheez on the side, and it always does the trick. The desserts are pretty good, but more expensive that I thought was fair. As a bonus, they have a handsome feller that delivers their baked goods.
