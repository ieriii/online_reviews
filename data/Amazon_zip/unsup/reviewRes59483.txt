I just love there stuffed pizza. It is filled with a lot of cheese and sauce. You do not have even ask for extra sauce they do an exquisite job on it. I rate 5***** ! I think that they are way better then Giordano's and there employees are friendlier. This is definitely the Best place for a deep dish pizza. Which is known as the stuffed pizza. Love it!
