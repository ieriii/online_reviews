These guys are taking the Groupon and making up their own rules.  They will except it by reservation only, want an advanced (at least 24-hour) reservation notice, and only taking 20 a day. I found this out yesterday after a long drive there. I've been to the restaurant without reservation which is why I didn't think to make one. When I arrived, I saw a sign posted that states their "Groupon Reservation" policy but not the limit. I called the restaurant outside it's doors to make a reservation and they (I say they because you can hear someone telling the person on the phone what to say) stated "we cannot make reservations". ???? Mind you, at this point I did not tell them I had a Groupon and the place was empty. From that point they proceeded to tell me their policy on the Groupon and said Groupon has their rules and we have ours.  I'm trying to find the small print on this deal that suggests this restaurant can do this. -So disappointed
