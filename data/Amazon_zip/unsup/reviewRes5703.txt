I had read great things about The Purple Pig and decided to check it out one night. I was a little hesitant because nothing on the menu stood out to me. I ordered based on what I read on Yelp reviews and they did not disappoint. My girlfriend and I ordered the pork shoulder, the fried pig ear, and the bone marrow. Each plate was unique and delicious! The plates are small and meant to be shared, so be prepared to order multiple items. The food here is amazing and reasonably priced. They also have a large selection of wines from all over the world. I can't wait to come back and try their other dishes.
