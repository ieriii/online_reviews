I love the food here, as it's always cooked perfectly. It's getting in and being served the food that's the problem. Granted, my last visit was on Cinco de Mayo. I made a reservation, and still had to wait an additional 40 minutes for the table. I get it, the place was packed, but this is not the first time this has happened. Also, it took almost as long to get a drink at the bar. Speaking of drinks... we ordered mojito's while waiting for the table. They were spectacular! I had been craving one ever since I knew we were coming here, and it didn't disappoint, in fact it was on par with the one's I'd had at the Delano in South Beach, some of the best anywhere. Then, after we were seated, I ordered a second one. It arrived and tasted... horrible. No sugar to be found, and almost all soda. I did what I never do, I sent it back. I know, they're busy, but I'm not drinking a $9 drink that tastes like crap. I explained what was wrong, and he whisked it away. He came back, and I swear it was the same drink. By now I was pissed and just drank it anyway. I should have gotten something else, but I didn't, I sucked it down in disgust. No one else ordered a second after my experience. Will I come again? Probably, but it won't be on my recommendation.
