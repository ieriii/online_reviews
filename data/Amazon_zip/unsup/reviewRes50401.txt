get your @ss out the kitchen! serious food prep issues. 50/fifty what happened?! i brought some friends from out of town in yesterday and it was one of the top 5 worst dining experiences in my life. I ordered the veggie skillet and when it came out I asked for hot sauce. I'm not too choosy when it comes to hot sauce but what they brought out looked like pee, with a little blood in it, captured in a nasty little bottle. gross. so gross I took pictures. then came the bacon in my food. how many meat eaters order the vegetable skillet? maybe you should take more care to make sure meat doesn't end up in this one accidentally. the worst part? a bite full of sand. disgusting. dirt and sand. in my mouth. are you even washing the vegetables or just ripping them out of the ground and putting them on my plate? i had to fight off puking. When I got home I then wondered all day when the food poisoning was going to hit.
