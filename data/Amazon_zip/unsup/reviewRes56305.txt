Catering here is simply awesome! My friends and I had a birthday party serving about 50 people. Where else to turn to but simply it? I called in and ordered the man who took my order couldn't be anymore helpful and funny. He also asked if it was my first time ordering and I replied yes. To that he included an extra half pan of dumplings to which I was grateful. So the food came on time, fresh, hot and ready to serve. The beef was just tender and juicy. So flavorful and when I went to try the chicken fried rice. Just out of this world! I also ordered avocado wontons, shrimp springrolls, lemongrass chicken (full pan), tilipia and a second pan of beef and asparagus. In fact, it was so good I was contemplating hiding some of the food so that my friends couldn't get anymore for themselves. It's just that good. It's priced just right and tastes like I should've paid more for this food.Much better than anything I could find on argyle, I was looking to see if any of those restaurants there would cater but could not find any. I'm glad I ordered with simply it. 5+ stars for amazingness
