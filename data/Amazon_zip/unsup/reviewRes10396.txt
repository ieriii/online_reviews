I've been here quite a few times, but have never written a review before. So here it goes.. I love this place! The first time I went here was back in February. Anyways, the spinach and cheese dip as well as the goat cheese tomato dip are wonderful appetizers. For pizza, I've only ever ordered sausage, spinach and tomato with red sauce, although it is delicious. You know what they say about things that aren't broken.. They also have a wonderful selection of beer. I've also never need a long wait time, although I usually go in the middle of the afternoon.
