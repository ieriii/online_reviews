Our dinner here was over the top! They have a great selection of breads in the bread basket including pretzel bread! Hooray! We started with custom towers of cold seafood ($?) including crab, shrimp (huge!) & lobster. It is a grand display, served with dry ice so your table is foggy. :-) For dinner I had the bone-in filet ($44) that he waiter recommended and it was one of the best, if not the best steak I've had. We also shared side dishes of lobster mashed potatoes, scalloped potatoes & asparagus. For dessert we had almost one of each, including the famed butter cake ($13)! Yes, it is really good! The dessert portions are enough to share, as well as the side dishes. We also had wine, just their cheaper Shiraz for $8 a glass and I was surprised how big the pour was. There are a lot of other reviews, so I don't have a lot to add except that I really enjoyed myself at this upscale steak house. Do make sure to stash some bills in your wallet to tip the restroom attendant. As I write this, I am wishing that I had that big plate of butter cake right here in front of me. Mmm....
