I really enjoyed the service & the food however, it needs a sprucing & the staff needs to look a little "fresher". It is not pleasant to have your food served when staff doesn't look "clean". There's no nice way to say that ..grunge, hipster, boho looks don't have to look grimy. It over shadowed the food & service. However, I will give it anutha try.
