As of this time, there are over 400 reviews and this place is a 4. Perhaps people reviewing it don't like Indian food because there's no reason it's not a five. Tikka Masala, Rogan Josh, Vindaloo, are all terrific. I generally order lamb and it's consistently tender without the fatty, and gristly bits. Naan is delicious and they bring out the tikka sauce with it, so you can decide if you want tikka or having the sauce try a different flavor.
