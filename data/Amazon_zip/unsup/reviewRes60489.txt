Nice find in the neighborhood. Fresh pasta with some fun choices. Try the wild boar ragu with a quartino of one of their exceptionally well-chosen Italian varietals. They offer smaller portions of most pastas which is a nice option when you're just popping in from a walk around Andersonville for a quick bite.
