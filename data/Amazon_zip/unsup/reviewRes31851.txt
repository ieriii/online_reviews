Okay, so if you know me, you're going to say "What, David R. eats Ethiopian food? Isn't he too dainty for that dirty-hands business?" And I admit that I have a hard time getting over the hands issue. But when the food is this good, it's worth it. Sort of. I've been to other Ethiopian restaurants and prefer Demera. The food is great and they make things easy for you, with helpful service and a glossary in the menu. Seriously, a glossary. That helps, because as much as I enjoy this food, I don't know what the hell any of it is called. So don't ask me. Well, I do know a couple of basic terms like injera and sambussa, but as far as the individual dishes, I am lost. Today I learned a new word, messob, but that still isn't the name of a specific dish. Plus I'm bound to get confused because "messob" sounds so similar to "meekrob" which makes me think of that classic South Park episode in which Cartman tells Kyle that he is full of meekrob (in addition to having sand in his vagina). Anyway, the yellow lentils and spinach are awesome. I've tried all the vegetarian dishes and they are all great. For some reason the meat dishes are no good. Somehow the vegetarian dishes are all in the A range and the meat dishes are in the C range. The sauces are tasty but the beef is dry and the lamb is fatty and chewy. And you just might crunch down on a big piece of bone. The chicken drumstick dishes are okay though. So just order vegetarian. This stuff is delicious and filling, and we could all stand to eat less meat--unless you are in some kind of iron-deficient anemic emergency situation. But then again, lentils and injera are high in iron, so...you're out of excuses. Order the vegetarian messob and a few sambussas. Oh, and the giant Ethopian-style tiramisu for dessert. There's no iron in that, but you're out of the woods after eating the lentils.
