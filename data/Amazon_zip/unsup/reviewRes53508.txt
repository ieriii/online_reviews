I don't know what to say, other than, certain things are to be expected at higher end places - like higher standards in behavior from staff as well as the customer. Sometimes a server can seem a little uptight - but that's infact part of their job - to do their best. The food is impeccable. The staff is a genie in a bottle wanting to grant your every wish - even put your purse on it's own purse stool beside you. And for those that don't get that - don't go to TRU.  A little pretentious - without a doubt, but that is the culinary style. And to be expected - like going to a Mexican restaurant, and expecting Mexican accents and possible diarrhea afterward.
