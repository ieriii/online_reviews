We have been fans of Indie from almost the beginning. My partner eats sushi and I do Thai. We dine here weekly, and always with pleasure. We have watched as Indie has expanded the space, the menu, and the program: jazz night and wine tastings. We have loved them through out their growth. These are two involved owners who are very much concerned in bringing the diner the best experience, so please feel free to tell them of any deficiencies or compliments. They have tried to anticipate the tastes and concerns of the contemporary diner at an affordable price.
