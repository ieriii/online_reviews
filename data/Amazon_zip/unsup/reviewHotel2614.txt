Boutique Wanna-be - Horrible Air Conditioning - Not family friendly Small room. Barn-like bathroom door impossible for my 11 year old to open. NOT FAMILY FRIENDLY. No ice on the floor. No vending machines. Not even a closet! Cheap Patio like table. Most irritating was the lack of adequate air conditioning. Outside temps were in the low 90's but inside, the low 80's. We moved rooms and found it equally uncomfortable. Management and the service dude told us to keep the metal access door to the a/c closet open to help them along. Didn't work, and the excess noise was ridiculous. Really? A few times I went across the street to the Sheraton 4 Points lobby to cool down (and get a Coke) so don't tell me Hotel's in Chicago can't handle the heat. Uncomfortable and unacceptable.
