My brother's rehearsal dinner was recently at Hopleaf. While I was a bit concerned it would be really loud, the upstairs private room was surprisingly quiet, and secluded from the masses waiting for mussels. Our bartender could not have been nicer to our group. I don't recall his name, but he was really fast with the drinks and took time to explain the different beers to those unsure of their choices. The food was amazing, as usual. We had a huge buffet of mussels, frites and aioli, the famous ham sandwiches, brisket sandwiches, mac and cheese, salad, and for the veggies, sandwiches made of cashew butter and fig jam (which were popular even with the carnivores in the crowd). There was so much food left at the end of the night, so the staff boxed up the leftovers into goody bags perfect for nursing a wedding morning hangover. I was a big fan of Hopleaf before, but this is a great spot to hold a private event. Thanks!
