Ok, I'm a big italian food fan. Most places in Chicago go for more of the American version... enormous servings, cheese galore and sauce, sauce, sauce. I was surprised and happy to find this place. A thoughtful and deeeeeelicious approach to country italian. We almost passed out from the number of dishes we had to try. Our friend, Jackie, turned us on to the place (THANKS!!!!). The pate was so fluffy and light it had a mousse-like quality. The polenta was to die for AND the grilled octopus completely blew me away. GO TO THIS PLACE if you want great food and a fun, casual atmosphere.
