the food is very good. But unless you order a lot of food, be prepared to leave hungry. I had the corn bisque (which was fantastic). Very creamy, with slices of coquito, lobster and a vanilla marshmellow. The Halibut with bacon and almonds was great too. My biggest gripe with this place is the portion size. for a $36 Halibut, you should get more that 6 bites and a dab of potatoes.
