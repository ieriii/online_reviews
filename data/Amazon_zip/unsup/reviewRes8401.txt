I finally made it here!! But it was just ok. I hate waiting for a table when we make reservations. Granted it was super busy, but c'mon, seat us within 10 min of our reservation time! Before coming here, we planned accordingly with our outfits (loose pants - check), hunger (after gym workout - check), and mental state (i love red meat, i love red meat - check). I ate everything I could, but honestly, there was only 2-3 things were actually good and everything else was kinda blah. The meat didn't seam to be seasoned and they were just grilled on the skewer. The good meat of course were the tender ones like filet mignon and the filet mignon wrapped in bacon. The chicken wasn't bad, but everything else was either really dry, and I eat medium rare, or tasteless. The worst I think were the ribs, OMG incredibly dry and tasteless. I rather go to a place that really has great steaks and pay $50 for a great meal instead. Now lets get to the salad bar. LOVE. This isn't a regular salad bar with your buckets of vegetables so you can come up with your own salad mix. This is a salad bar of pasta salad, potato salad, mozzarella cheese, prosciutto, grilled asparagus, roasted peppers, smoked salmon, etc.. DELICIOUS. I ate more salad bar than meat. This is one of those restaurants I'm going to file under 'go for the experience, don't go back'.
