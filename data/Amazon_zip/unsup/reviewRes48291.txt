We went there for NYE and it was fun, yes, but it was not anything that blew my mind. I know that the experience of visiting for NYE with a group is very different than going with friends for a normal meal and I get that, but I guess it just didn't live up to the hype for me. Was it a good meal? Yes, but it wasn't so amazing that I wouldn't bat an eye to throw down lots of cash to do it often. Was the service good? Yeah, it was fine. Was the decor cool? Yeah, it was but so are so many other places in Chicago. I know we'll go back here again at some point and my impression may be completely different, but for now it's fine but not on the top of my list. Sowwy!!
