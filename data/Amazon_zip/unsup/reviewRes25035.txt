I've never actually been to the restaurant but I order from here all the time. Their service is fantastic, friendly, and prompt. Their chicken soup is FANTASTIC. There a huge chunks of great quality chicken and lots of veggies.Their guacamole is also fantastic. I don't know how they do it, but even in the winter in Chicago the quality of their produce is great. The prices are also great.
