The Good: 1) Nice atmosphere 2) Lots of TV's 3) Pretty good beer selection 4) Food is slightly above average. 5) Service is Good The Bad: 1) It's basically a bar for fomer frat boys that's been transplanted to Wicker Park/Ukranian Village. So expect a fair share of Trixies and Chads (Trix-he's).  2) The food is good, not great. Most bars now have at least OK food. The Fifty/50 doesn't rise much above average. 3) The bathroom is in the basement. Doesn't seem like a big deal unless you're sitting in the loft. A bit lazy? Yes, but for a place that size, they could use another one.
