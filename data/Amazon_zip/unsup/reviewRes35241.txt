On a lark, we decided to have brunch in the city so we ended up at Shaws about 1:00, hungry but suspicious of a "buffet" - being a Midwesterner I have learned to avoid the 7 kinds of jello and 19 mayonnaise salads that comprise buffets. I also generally dislike buffets because no one is at the table talking, everyone is getting more food. Shaws Brunch won me over completely. The service is divine and the food was fresh, tasteful and in petite sized portions. My first favorite were the Crab & Cantaloupe cocktail which was flavorful with the sweetest cantaloupe you could ever want. I thought that was the best there until I had the eggs Benedict which made every other Eggs Benedict I have ever had taste like an Egg McMuffin. Thinking nothing could top these two sublime creations until I entered the dessert room and selected the cutest creme brulee I had ever seen whose taste surpassed its presentation. How do they keep the sugary top crunchy? We demurred on the Bloody Mary and Mimosa bar and asked for Poinsettias instead and it was their pleasure to provide this off the menu delight. Perfect coffee completed the meal that I continues on in my mind. Perfect Sunday...well...if the Bears had won.
