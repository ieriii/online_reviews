If you crave thin crust pizza from Rome, then this place will provide you with a quick fix. That's about it. We got there about 45 minutes before closing on a weekday night and were seated inside, in the room just west of the entrance. The place was spacious, but they sat us in the corner, next to two other couples. After the couples finished their dinner and left, the staff started breaking down the outside patio seating and bringing it inside. The door was kept ajar, so the cool restaurant air left the room. The place got warm and the ceiling fan didn't help. I felt like I was being rushed. How can you eat and drink when staff members are moving tables and stacking chairs right in front of you?  We ate our pizza and gulped down our wine. The dessert menu came. We decided to pass. In summary, if you want a place to relax and spread out, this is not the place. If there are open tables, the staff will not spread you out -- it will seat you next to other people. Why would I want to feel cramped?
