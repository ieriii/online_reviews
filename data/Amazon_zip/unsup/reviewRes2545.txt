I went to Hot Doug's about 6-7 years ago when it was in the old Roscoe Village location and haven't gone back since the wait times just skyrocketed since then. My girlfriend and I decided to take a Friday off and eat lunch there. We got there at 10:45 AM thinking there wouldn't be much of a line. 45 minutes later, we finally got through the doors and I was impatiently waiting to eat. After spending $22, we got two drinks, duck fat fries, and 4 hot dogs. Of those 4, I got the Rattlesnake which had a roasted yellow pepper mayonnaise and a creamy Morbier cheese. It was the best hot dog I will ever have. I almost teared up when I finished eating it. The other 3 we enjoyed were good (Bratwurst, Thuringer, and Chicago-style), but the Rattlesnake was just ridiculous. I also did enjoy the atmosphere, it wasn't too crowded once you got inside and there was a bunch of 'crazy crap on the walls' that made the atmosphere fun and playful. After going for the first time in a long time, I'm making it a point to go more often.
