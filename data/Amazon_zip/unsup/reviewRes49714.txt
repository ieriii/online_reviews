Visited in a group of 14. We made reservations 2 weeks ahead of time and were seated promptly. Service was slow. We were seated at 8:30, but our entree orders were not taken until 9:36, and we had to flag a waiter to get those orders in. Food was excellent. we started with arepa rellena, which was wonderful. I had one of the combo platters for 2, and it was MORE than enough food for 2 people, and only $38, which was reasonable. Skirt steak was delicious. I also had a mojito, which was very good, and I tried someone else's Colombian drink with strawberries which was great. Main issue was service. No one was rude, but it was VERY slow. Also, if you go in a group, be aware if you pay with more than 3 credit cards, everyone's card has a $5 charge added. Gratuity was included with our big group. Recommend, but probably not in a large group.
