I hate to do this, but it truly is worth only one star. The place is not clean to start. The service is too busy gossiping and playing with each other than serving the patrons. We then got our food, it was okay but not worth the rest of the experience. The owner then came out to ask if everything was OK and we explain our experience with the wait staff and he gave us more attitude then the waiter himself. If you don't want the truth DON'T ASK!
