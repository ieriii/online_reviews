I took my parents and grandparents here when they came in town. The grandparents grew up in Romania, so they were charmed with the atmosphere and the service. I never have really understood what is considered to be "Romanian" cuisine, but whatever it is, this place does it well. The beef short ribs goulash was outstanding, and I was even impressed with the Romanian wines, especially for the price. Check it out.
