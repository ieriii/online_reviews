My fiance and I stumbled into this place one evening looking for a good Italian place. The ambiance was nice and the food was really good. Fresh bread with oil and cheese before the meal and the drinks were great. Pricing was a bit on the high side. However we filled out a card after our dinner and were sent a personailzed post card with a letter and a $15 for the next time. Good place!
