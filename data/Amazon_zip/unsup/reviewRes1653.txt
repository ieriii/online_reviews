Its Chicago's hot dog cult hit, that you should experience at least once if you haven't been yet. Be aware that this is an event, as much as it is a restaurant, so the line is similar to a roller coaster park. Try to make it on Fri or Sat for the duck fat fries. They're worth it. Also, skies the limit on potential dog offerings. Too many to describe, so just go and discover.
