It seems the lovely Brett D. and I are on a quest to hit every falafel stand between here and Memphis. I can't believe how much food we got for a low price! Well, enough for two meals because an order of "three falafels" turned into three falafel sandwiches! I loved that they already added the red spicy sauce to a pita that was high and strong and kept the tender falafel from spilling out. It was a taste delight! The chicken schwarma with rice had a nice undercurrent of warm spices to it, and was filling in its own right. Grab yourself a Ting! carbonated grapefruit drink to wash it all down and you'll be a happy camper. Sultan's has a nice patio area but I wouldn't mind coming back to sit in one of the intimately lit booths, decorated with Middle Eastern touches. And now just to spice things up, since there are 400+ reviews here, I'll tell you a true story. Back in my younger days I was told I looked like Disney's Aladdin quite often. When I was working a ticket window I had a young theater-minded man sing "A Whole New World" to me, quite theatrically. About a week later while utilizing a urinal, a homeless guy a few urinals away seemed to be taking too much of an interest in me. But rather than things getting creepy, they just got weird when he said "You can't beat the Carpet!" I may no longer look like Aladdin (thank God) but I can still heartily recommend spending A Thousand and One Nights at Sultan's Market!
