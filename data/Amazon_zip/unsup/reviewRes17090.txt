So I had their famous lunch buffet and it was delicious. I use the word delicious a lot but I really mean it this time.  There's so much to choose from and everything is really fresh and colorful. The wait staff is great and the ambiance is perfect for lunch. Craving Indian food is a new phenomenon for me and India House satisfied me to the max. Everything I ate was wonderful! I want to go back.
