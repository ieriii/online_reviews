This place is tremendous. Highback chairs around little tables lit only by candles. None of the drinks on the menu are recognizeable, but they're all great anyway. I ordered a Ramos Gin fizz on the recommendation of a friend. http://en.wikipedia.org/ The drink takes 5 minutes to make, and is worth a try. This place makes some of the best mixed drinks I've ever had. I've been there on a Thursday and a Saturday around 6pm, and haven't had to wait that long.
