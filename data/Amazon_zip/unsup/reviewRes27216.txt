We went here to try out some deep dish for the first time since moving to Chicago. It doesn't look like much from the outside, but this place is two stories with plenty of room for everyone. For starters, the Pequod Salad is delicious with plenty of fresh veggies and cheese slices cut into the shape of fish. I don't know why they're cut into the shape of fish, but it was cute. The salad is plenty big for two people to share. The deep dish, or pan, pizza was amazing! We split a small one between the two of us, and we were both stuffed when we left. It's a build your own cheese pizza, and we added sausage and spinach to it. The best part about the pizza was the crust. It was the perfect crust. Add in the friendly, quick staff and you have an excellent pizza place!
