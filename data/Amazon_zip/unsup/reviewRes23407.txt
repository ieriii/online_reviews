We went in a large party, over 20 people and we had over 12 dishes so we had quite a sample of the menu. Unfortunately, our food was uniformly mediocre, at best. The small steamed dumplings (xiao long bao) were probably the worst that I've ever had. Xiao long bao, when they are good, are little translucent pouches containing a shot of hot broth and a delicate meatball ... a bite of heaven. The ones here are more like cardboard filled with dry ground mystery meat ... a bite of something else, for sure!  I would suggest taking them off the menu or just using the frozen ones you can get in any Asian market. The smoked duck was good, as was the whole steamed fish. Cold pork with chili sauce had a nice kick. Seafood tofu soup was crazy bad - thickened water with chunks of thickening agent that were larger than the pieces of shrimp. And tofu? Where? Laughable, to call this "seafood" soup.
