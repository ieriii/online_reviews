Uncommon Ground has been a wonderful addition to the neighborhood. We go here quite a bit with the kids since we live right around the corner and every time we are greeted with a warm welcome and accommodating staff. The menu varies seasonally, ingredients are sourced locally (whenever possible) from sustainable farms. I also like how green this place is, it inspires me to try just a little bit more. In the summer they have a farmer's market on Fridays in the parking lot. There is always an eclectic mix of people, mixed in with young families and somehow it always works. For Breakfast/Brunch, I'm a huge fan of their Breakfast melt (although it sometimes comes out cold) or their beef hash. Their spiked coffee drinks are delicious and varied based on season. For Lunch, try the grown up grilled cheese and feel like a kid again or Helen's Grilled Chicken Sandwich. For Dinner, whatever pork dish they are running is usually to die for and I am also a huge fan of their trout dish. The hubby will usually go for meatloaf when it's on the menu. Can't say we've actually made it to dessert as we're usually taking something to go. Dinner portions do not disappoint. Nice wine list and craft beer selection. I've tried a few martinis made with their Rain Vodka which knocked me off my rocker!Bottom line, if you're looking for a great place to eat in Edgewater Uncommon Ground is a great bet. If you go early (like we do with the kids) your wait is usually short and comfortable in the bar area. You will always feel welcomed no matter who you show up with and eat a pretty fat meal!
