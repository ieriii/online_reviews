Again, a great pizza place with an extensive menu. If you're only in Chicago for one night, get the deep dish and you won't regret it. I know it sounds weird to have sauce on the top of your pizza, but it's easily the best item on their menu. I've gotten both take-out and eaten at this location, and the service is great, the portions are generous, and it was easily the best food I ate in Chicago (I ate there twice in five days).
