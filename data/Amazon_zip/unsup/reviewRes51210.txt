Mmm. I've lived in Chicago on and off for nearly seven years and never had breakfast at Wishbone until I went twice last week. It was well worth the wait! Reading some of the other comments on here, it looks like people had mixed reviews about their food. All I can say is the restaurant should focus on promoting its breakfast because it's delicious. The first time I went, I had the banana pancakes and some home fries, which were a perfect combo. The pancakes are plate-sized and were maybe a 7.5 on my 1-10 flapjack scale (patent pending). My buddy loved the biscuits and gravy, as well as the crunchy French toast. In fact, he couldn't stop talking about the damn French toast, so I had to order it the next day when we went back. Wow! What they do is dip the stuff in a sea of magical batter made with a lot of love and some Corn Flakes, which make all the difference in the world. It was amazing! In fact, I can't get it out of my head and have even thought about trying to make my own batch at home, which I know would rank high up there in my lifetime disaster department, much like the time I tried to make a homemade chocolate cake or spent $50 preparing for a date with a girl who ended up blowing me off. Oops, take my advice, Ponch: Don't spend money on a date until it actually happens. Now where was I? Oh, just give Wishbone a shot. I don't know about lunch and dinner, but their breakfast is the apex of early-morning dining.
