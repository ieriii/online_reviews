I went with my girlfriend a couple of weeks ago and had a really nice time. We had a chance to sit on the front patio, the entire place looks like a lot of fun so we would have been happy anywhere. They BYOB was complimented with pitches of sangria mix, $12 I think. Our waiter was extremely helpful with our decisions on our dishes. He was a lot of fun despite the fact that it was fairly busy in his section. The food was amazing, fried pork chops and a slow cooked pork dish. We had the crouquetes as an appetizer also and they were great. The price is spot on for a higher class BYOB spot and the location is ideal for anyone on the blue line or Western/Armitage bus.
