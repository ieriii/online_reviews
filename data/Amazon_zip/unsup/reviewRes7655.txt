Just had a great 'first time' at Sapori. The restaurant was really nice and really crowded. The four of us got there about 30 minutes prior to our reservation but the host Recardo was able to find us a table right away. We started with the Cozze Scoppiate in the red sauce, it was very good, even my wife who doesn't eat mussels loved it. The sauce was perfect for dunking bread. Then we split a couple salads, the Insalata Stella and the Cesare. My mom kept commenting on how fresh all the ingredients were in the Stella and the Caesar was one of the best I've had. The dressing was nice and light, not heavy like some Caesars, the parmesan had a great flavor too. My dad and I both had the Zuppa di Pesce. It was huge, and had a ton of fish. The homemade linguini was excellent. Well worth the very modest $30, we've paid a lot more for a lot less at other restaurants. The girls split the Vitello Paesana and left nothing on the plate. The Executive Chef Anthony came out and introduced himself and we talked for a bit. He was very nice and shared a few stories with us. We then ordered a couple desserts, Tiramisu and Bread Pudding. We were so full by that time that we could barely eat anymore but we got about half of it down. Also, very good. We'll definitely be back there.
