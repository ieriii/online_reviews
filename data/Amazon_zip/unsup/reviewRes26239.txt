One of the better tapas places in the city, though pricey. Drinks are tasty and interesting (had something involving avocados that actually worked, impressive stuff), food is great--nice mix of classic tapas and things i had never seen before, and the second floor dining area is outstanding--worth stopping in for a drink just to see that.
