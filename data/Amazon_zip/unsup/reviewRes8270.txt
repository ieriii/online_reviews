Finally! After almost a year combing Chicago for a truly authentic Neapolitan pizza, I've found it. I was dubious my first time; the long trek out to Montrose, the announced wait time of thirty minutes. But the owner and head chef, Jonathan, makes those thirty minutes slip right by providing a mouth-watering slice of pizza, a nibble of parmagiano, or perhaps a glass of prosecco. Once seated, the service is always extremely friendly with wait-staff usually trained how to pronounce the various italian dishes and ingredients. (That said, I wouldn't expect much in the way of conversational Italian.) The wine is fairly priced, the pizzas a bit on the expensive side but oh so worth it. Jonathan has nailed it; the dough is exquisite--just a delicate hint of saltiness, thin and flash-baked to produce galaxies of miniature charred bubbles along the edges. Ingredients are always very fresh. I highly recommend the buffalina, with its uncanny and consistent ability to let three simple ingredients--cherry tomatoes, basil & buffalo mozzarella--shine. One bite is just the tomato, the next perhaps just a bit of the salty mozzarella with a hint of basil... The diavola is also scrumptiously spicy and particularly enjoyable on a warm summer evening spent on Spacca Napoli's patio. Spacca Napoli's desserts are fairly solid, albeit overpriced; I'll occasionally get the panna cotta drizzled in a balsalmic reduction with a few slices of balsalmic-soaked pear. The bottom line:: -Consistently friendly service. -Brilliant Neapolitan pizza--best I've had in the city -A bit pricy but worth it from time to time.
