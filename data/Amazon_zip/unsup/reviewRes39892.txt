After a 2 hour wait on a Saturday night, I was prepared to give L&E a "1 star" on Yelp. Then, I tasted the food. But let's rewind: 1. The host and hostess were nice, polite and extraordinarily patient with the huge crowd and even more huge wait list. 2. Their bar is appropriately staffed and even at capacity, we never waited to refill our beers. 3. The bartenders were also all really really friendly and clearly take pride in their work (cocktail list is impressive) 4. We ordered a pretzel w/ rarebit at the bar to tide us over and when a pretzel tastes that good, we should have known what we were in store for with dinner. DINNER: We started with the goat cheese gnuddi and the bone marrow: We'd only ever had bone marrow at the Purple Pig and L&E's is a little bit more dressed up than PP's: be sure to mix the relish well w/ the marrow. Both dishes were wonderful. Main Event: We shared the PORK BELLY and OMG: hands down best dish we may have ever eaten: SO DELICIOUS!!!!  Dessert: Split the custard, it was ok -- the quince was a little over-whelming to the dish. *** Even though I'm giving L&E 5 stars based on food and service, I have to warn people that the crowd and wait were so annoying that we almost left before we were seated. There is no sense of urgency among the wait staff to turn tables at a faster rate so we suggest having a snack before arriving at the restaurant. ***
