Yep, still great...maybe getting better? :) I absolutely love introducing this place to people, but last night I was able to introduce Chicago Diner to two of my vegan friends. I myself am not a vegan, but having a dairy allergy, I keep going back to get my "cheeze" fix, and dessert fix. Them loving this place just confirms how great it really is. You MUST try any of their milk shakes, but my favorite is the cookie dough peanut butter shake, or their pumpkin chocolate cheesecake. I drive 22.6 miles just to have a rooibos tea, and dessert. I don't know if I mentioned the service here, but the staff is hip and wonderful.
