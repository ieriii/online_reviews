I have only had amazing meals at Big Jones. I have enjoyed both brunch and dinner there, with dinner being a total stand-out. The menu changes frequently and the starters are always outstanding. Most importantly, I feel Big Jones hires excellent wait staff. The service is always beyond professional and attentive. Very informed of their offerings.
