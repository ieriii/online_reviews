More like 3.5 stars. Stayed here for a bachelorette weekend. Rooms? SMALL. This ain't a Vegas suite! All boutique hotels have small rooms so we were expecting the room so to be small but these were PINT SIZE. The double rooms have two FULL SIZE BEDS, not queens . If you plan on having more than five in a room, a double room will not accommodate a cot without creating a fire hazard, so you'll have to go with a jr. suite. The people at the front desk realized our situation and were nice enough to upgrade our room to a jr. suite at no extra charge. Sink had a crack in it and there are just signs of wear and tear everywhere in this hotel overall that could use a little TLC. Nevertheless, our stay was comfortable and you really can't beat the location. It is right off Michigan Avenue and walking distance to almost anything and everything you want to see downtown. The bellhops downstairs were very friendly. Storing our luggage after check-out and arranging for a van cab to the airport were no problem. Wouldn't mind staying here again for the location alone, but it would be nice if they did a little refurbishing.
