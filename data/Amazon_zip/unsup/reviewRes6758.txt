We like this place alot, always good service and its Tapas style which means you can try everything you want! Any formaggi and salumi will do, foccaccia di Recco is so plain but SO good (definitely want to have at least 2 people because it is large), Grilled Romaine Insalata was exceptional. We tried a pizza on one trip, the Pizza con Salsiccia e Rapini which is Italian mild sausage, broccoli rabe, garlic, chili oil, fresh mozzarella, tomato. This was tasty, but the broccoli rabe kind of overtakes the dish (even the sausage), we would probably get it again just without or with easy broccoli. A must is the Bistecca alla Griglia which is oven roasted strip steak with a arugula salad topped with evoo and sea salt, both times we have had this dish it was fantastic. If you like rich desserts, try the deconstructed cannoli, it could be very good to some but it was a little too rich for me. You can go all out here and have a bill for 2 for about $80. Both times we came here we only had a drink or too and our bill was around $50, which is a pretty good deal for the amount/quality of food you get
