Came here on the weekend to meet some new people. I find myself impressed with the neighborhood in general and enjoyed Milk and Honey very much. It was very busy around 11am, but the line moved very quickly. The menu contains 20 or so dishes and I tried the Orange Brioche French Toast with Toasted Almonds and Pure Maple Syrup. The portions are well sized; larger than normal, but not so much as to leave you feeling gorged. Prices were very low considering the size and quality of the dishes. I'd recommend it to anyone looking to try out a new brunch location
