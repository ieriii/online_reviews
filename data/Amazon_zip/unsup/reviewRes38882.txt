Overall, dinner was great. Here is why I took off two stars: 1. The fries weren't good. If you are going to be a gastropub -- especially one that advertises bougie fries -- they ought to be good. Their fries were disappointing. 2. Portion size was verged on ridiculous, at least on bar snacks. The buffalo sweetbreads were amazing... All 2 bites of them. I would have gladly paid more to get more. They were advertised as snacks, but it came out looking more like an amuse bouche. 2a. Similarly, they advertise all these fancy elements on their menu, such as "absinthe foam" in their mussels. The server even mentioned this as a highlight to the dish. But there were so many elements to these small plates that none of them were highlighted. I had two whiffs of absinthe foam before it was gone. 3. They don't do anything for birthdays. All I got was a candle, which was placed at such an angle in my dessert that it dripped hot wax onto my pants.
