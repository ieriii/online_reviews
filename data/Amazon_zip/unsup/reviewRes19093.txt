I had just landed in Chicago at 4 pm from Los Angeles on a 9:30 am flight and was famished. Checked Yelp and some websites (that compiles Food Network show recommendations) and found this place. I got in line for food to dine in and didn't realize you had to first check in with the hostess before getting in line to order. Weird. After debating with myself for several minutes, I decided on the Cubana from the "Tortas on the Griddle" section: smoked Maple Creek pork loin and bacon, avocado, artisan Jack cheese, and chipotle mustard. The avocado and chipotle mustard sold me. They take your order and then seat you in their dining area to the right, where they bring you your food. I was surprised that my torta looked more like a panini than a torta, but it was pretty good. Filling, but leaving you enough room for dessert.
