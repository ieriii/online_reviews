So I like mashed potatoes.... I love pizza.... what's the best thing that could happen?  PUT THE TWO TOGETHER! Actually, when I went to piece for lunch I was skeptical, it either sounded like it would be delicious or too rich. Luckily it would turn out to be the first, the mashed potato and bacon pizza we concocted, was not overloaded with potato or bacon, it had harmony, the butter, garlic flavors mixed well with the pizza crust.  I would not pass this place up. The staff was very polite and the wait was minimal, not more than 15 minutes. Nom!
