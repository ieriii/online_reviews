So. To clarify, I don't think that they only "hire for the hair," J.B. All I'm saying is that I'm sure it helps them get hired. My experience at Yolk has been mostly positive. The wait staff is young and cute, the restaurant is expansive and airy and you'll get decent eggs. Once, I had a sandwich there, but wasn't all that impressed. So unimpressed that I don't even remember what it was that I had. I'll stick to their breakfast. pros: Nice location, good view from the windows Friendly, cute service Nice clean look to the place cons: Tends to get really loud, especially if you are not sitting in a booth Long wait for weekend brunch Don't take reservations unless its a large group, then won't seat until everyone is there.
