Tonight was the first time I had been to Las Tablas since they moved accross the street and got rid of the BYOB that helped to make them so fabulous! When we inquired about the corkage fee, the hostess was extremely rude and more than happy to inform us that they no longer were a BYOB restaurant. When we informed her that there was still a BYOB sign in their window advertising the BYOB special Monday-Thursday, she merely sneered at us. In addition, there must have been some sort of kitchen fire since the smoke was quite thick in the restaurant, so am not sore what was going on in the kitchen! This sadly is not the same lovely Las Tablas that once existed across the street. Don't waste your time or money. Go elsewhere!
