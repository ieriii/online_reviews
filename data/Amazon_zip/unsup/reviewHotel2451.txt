A very nice Hilton property and a good location for large groups. Generous amounts of elevators to get large groups back to their rooms between convention sessions. Overall, I am never a fan of hotel room service and there was nothing exceptional here that would change my mind. Take a cab to restaurant locations nearby 5-10 minutes, or order in. Hey, the rooms are clean. Beds are good. TV's are large, and the AC works. Cool stuff.
