As soon as I walked in and was greeted by the soft, seductive lighting and the intimate tables for two I started hearing "bow-chica-wow-wow". Not sure if that was in my head or background music playing - either way, the effect is the same. This place is romantic, nay, sensual. Oh, and the food ain't half bad either. Since it was my birthday dinner, the BF left me with the difficult task of which fondue to go with. I'm a sucker for scallops so I opted for the deluxe seafood platter. An hour an a half later, my belly was chock full of cheese, scallops, lobster, shrimp, and chocolate. Verdict? Delicious. Romantic. Great place for special occassions. My only criticism? Any of the aphrodisiac-y ambiance goes to waste because you're too full to take advantage of it!! I guess you can't have it all. Sigh.
