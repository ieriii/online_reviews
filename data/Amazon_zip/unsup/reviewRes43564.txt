My favorite pizza in Chicago... OK, Lou Malnati's is right up there as well. I usually go for the pan pizza - great ratio of crust to cheese to sauce. Definitely my favorite sauce of any pizza around. I've been going here for 15 years and it's always excellent. Tell them Dan sent you and they'll look at you funny.
