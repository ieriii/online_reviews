At long last, I finally found myself in Chicago in a hotel that was walking distance to Frontera. I've been eyeing this restaurant for a couple years, so was thrilled to finally get the chance to try Chef Bayless' flagship. Unfortunately, I thought I could do so easily after 8 PM on a Tuesday night. Not so. My partner in dining crime and I were told the wait for 2 would be upwards of 45 minutes, so we circled the bar like hawks until we could get a seat to eat there--which was about a 15 minute wait instead. The atmosphere at the bar is great, so we definitely did not feel short-changed. This being my first trip to Frontera, I wanted to order small plates so I could get a sampling of the style. I started with the scallop ceviche, which was nearly perfect. The shaved jicama rounds were a nice textural contrast to the silky scallops. And though pineapple is one of my least-favorite flavors, the sweetness of the juice was a nice contrast to the acid and spice from the lightly toasted Serrano chiles. I just would have preferred the juice of a different sweet fruit, like peach (but that's a personal palate preference, not a knock on the dish). I knocked off a star on my rating because of the wait in between my scallops and second dish, the chicken mole enchiladas. The pace of the meal and quality of service started fine, but we had to wait 30 minutes between our starters and second course, which is just outrageous. Ultimately, the wait proved to be worth it for the three little chicken enchiladas with incredibly complex mole. I have to admit: I'm not the biggest mole fan, but knew I had to order something with mole here. Mole to me tends to be a little vinegary, but Frontera's was anything but. I actually found it to be primarily sweet and smoky, which I really loved. Frontera proved to be everything I'd hoped it would be, and I can't wait to return to Chicago so I can enjoy continuing to make my way through the menu.
