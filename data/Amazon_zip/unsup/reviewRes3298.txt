I have found the holy grail of Fried Chicken! Goodbye Colonel Sanders. Goodbye Popeye the sailer man. Goodbye Church.... HELLO Crisp!!! All the previous reviews are right, the dude behind the counter is super nice. Since it was my first time, he suggested the BBQ and Sassy. I said I wanted plain and Sassy. So he let me tried a taste of the BBQ sauce. He said that I should get the BBQ and Sassy and if I don't like it, bring it back and he'll give me a whole Plain for my trouble. Can't argue with that logic.  Both the BBQ and Sassy are delicious, tasty, and addicting! I've not tasted such flavors and crispiness in fried chicken before. Ever! It's like my eyes have been opened to the truth in Fried Chicken. Hallelujah!!! The side of Kimchi is yummy too! Sour, crispy, spicy fermented cabbage!!! That mixed in with fried chicken just works for me. Love it!! Everyone, buy stock in chicken farms bc I will be back to Crisp for more chicken!!
