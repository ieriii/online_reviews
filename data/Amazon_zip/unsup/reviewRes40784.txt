After looking forward to celebrating my husbands birthday at Bonsoiree I was pretty let down. For a restaurant of it's price ($95/person - underground menu), the tables were too close and the service was sub-par. The tables at Next may be just as close but I didn't find it as irritating there. We were seated next to a rather loud fellow and I couldn't concentrate on anything but his conversation. The service was not at the level it should have been for a restaurant at this price, and was VERY SLOW!!!! In fact the tables next to us received 3 courses in the time we received 1? And that fact was VERY noticeable given the fact we were all seated so closely. I probably would have be fine with service/ambiance if the food was great, but it was just ok. We came on a Saturday night for the September underground menu. There was really only 1 dish that I thought was great, and my husband liked only 2 of his dishes. Not to mention the menu was exactly as they had published except the fish course was supposed to be stripped bass and scallop; and we received salmon instead of the bass?  I don't particularly like salmon but don't mind it at nice restaurants with certain types of salmon and when it's prepared well. At Bonsoiree my salmon was FISHY tasting and sort of gross. This was a BIG let down for me. I would much prefer going to Schwa, Everest, MK, Next, Longman & Eagle, etc.
