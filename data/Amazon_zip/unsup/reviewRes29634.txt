And my first New Years yelp starts out with a positive 5 star rating to....*drum roll*...CHICAGO DINER! *crowd roars* I love to visit on early Saturday mornings, the staff is very upbeat and the food is always delicious! A nice and cozy vegetarian joint it is, with the cool diner effect that makes you appreciate their music playlist even more. It feels great to dine at a place where there are other things to order besides a black bean burger (although I tried it here once and it was scrumptious). Keep up the great work!
