If my experience at Lao was typical, I can see why some people come away dissatisfied. The loud and stupid party to my right ordered a mess truck of Americanized dishes after repeatedly disclaiming any desire to try anything "gross" or "too Chinese." Then they brayed for a long while about whether cock fighting was less reprehensible than dog fighting. If these people typify the behavioral and ordering patterns of Lao's clientele, it's no wonder that there's not universal satisfaction with the place. Sole with sour pickled cabbage. It comes in a huge bowl, and can serve two. It smells slightly of wood varnish. But it's piquant, satisfying and growingly addictive. To accompany this, you can have eggplant with fried ground pork. But never mind the pig ear: one should never go to a Chinese restaurant and expect to eat actual "Chinese" food, right? Go to Lao if your inclination is to avoid Americanized food. You probably won't avoid the maddening crowds, but you'll still do well if you order well.
