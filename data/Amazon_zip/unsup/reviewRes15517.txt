Just came here for the first time after hearing so much about it. Had 2 cocktails, which were both great and very strong. I really don't think you could go wrong with any of them. The food was very good- gnocci, cheese, little sandwiches, and fries. Great little snacks. The ambience is great, very classy. I like the privacy at all the booths. Will definitely be back if I'm in the area!
