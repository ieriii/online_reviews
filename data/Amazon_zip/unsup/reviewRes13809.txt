Never had to wait because the place hadn't opened. But it was WORTH it! Great vibe, love that you can see the brew masters working. Very cool tap handles and good service. Brunch menu was awesome. From egg concoctions to home state MI cherry pancakes. I had the Buratta Omlete, which blew my mind. It was open face with spinach and almonds on top. Flavor city. I'm back soon to try the brews and dinner menu.
