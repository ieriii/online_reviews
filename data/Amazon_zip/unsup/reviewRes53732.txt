Oh my god, all this time and I haven't reviewed Hot Doug's! I guess everyone else has said all that's been said, I will just say that, most of the time, when you are going out to eat, you are getting your pocket picked. Not here. He keeps the prices reasonable, and if I weren't such a pig, I'd have a hard time spending ten bucks here, for the best lunch in town.I usually wind up with more than I need, because I always want to try a special dog, and I have to get a Chicago dog too. I do think Doug sometimes screws up some of the balance on a few of the special sausages, particularly, I don't think the flavored mustards work very well, usually. Being from South Louisiana, I tend to take two approaches to mustard: use it straight, or use it to flavor something, such as remoulade. I think when you try to flavor mustard with something like basil, it doesn't work so well. Better to use mustard on the sausage and add some fresh basil on top, I think. Just me.My Southern eccentricities aside, I have never left here disappointed. And, he's got great andouille. If you're ever there when he's got the gator sausage, get it.
