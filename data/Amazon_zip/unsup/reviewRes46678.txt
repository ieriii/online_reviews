Yes, yes, the salad bar is good. But if you're looking for goooooood, go for the milkshakes. Per our server, the ice cream is made specially for RJ Grunts. My fiance ordered two types mixed together and ... I'll admit it ... I probably had more than he wanted to share with me. It was awesome! Peanut butter and chocolate. Ridiculously good. Nothing like a burger and a milkshake for a nice healthy meal. Other than that, standard fare - chicken sandwhiches, wraps, tuna melt is also very good. Be prepared to wait a bit on weekend nights, it's a fairly small restaurant.
