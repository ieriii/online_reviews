The tortas are really very tasty. The bread is crusty and wonderful. The churros are a mechanism for delivering the delectable chocolate sauce.   The service was friendly -- though there is something odd about getting a table number before ordering that I was unsure about. It seems that most of the seats face walls, which is unfortunate. The food came out quickly.  Overall, a great place for a relatively quick bite.
