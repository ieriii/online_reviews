It's not that we don't have tasty pig parts in the San Francisco area, because we do, but we don't have a spot that celebrates the pig in quite such an orgiastic fashion. The ham sampler was fantastic & everything else was very very good. Tip: the country ribs are delicious, but they are not what you think of as ribs... it's more like a grilled pork chop.
