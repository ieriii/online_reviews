We stayed here last weekend. Loved it. Great rooms for groups. When you enter the room there is living room area with a couch, chair, and table with two or three more chairs. Across from the bathroom was a kitchenette with sink, microwave, coffee maker, and mini fridge. Bedroom was a good size with two beds, sink, and mirror. The alarm clock comes with a plug to hook up your ipod. The beds are really comfortable, I slept like a rock. Our room was on the 12th floor and the view was amazing. It is also worth mentioning the elevators are made of glass so the view from them is pretty good too. We did not have any of the made to order breakfast so I can't comment, but the other stuff was well put out and no lines. We do the managers reception (did see long lines) either. The lobby was crazy Sunday morning, mostly because people were checking out, long waits for the busy elevators. Pj Clarks is just off the lobby, great for drinks and late night eats. There is also a pretty cool bowling alley and sports bar, and an AMC movie theater right next door.
