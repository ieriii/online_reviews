Wonderful local brewery with fantastic brews. The food is pretty good but the beer is what will keep me coming back for more! I told the waitress what my "hop" preferences were and she led me to Mr. Crowley's I believe it was called. Fantastic tasting beer! I had the chicken wings which were in my opinion a little on the dry side. I did fall in love with the hot sauce they come with and the blue cheese potato salad. Can't wait to come back and enjoy another glass and explore the menu a bit more.
