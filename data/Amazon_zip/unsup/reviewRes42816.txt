My 1st instinct was to rate 4 stars, but for the price it gets the super 5 star rating! Woo!  It's by far the best you can get for the price. The pizza is delectable, they use all types of exotic ingredients. The mash potatoes make me cream my pants. Also, the staff is super friendly.  Down side, there is not much dining room. This is definitely a good place for take-out, but you can order from their website!
