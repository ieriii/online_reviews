If you haven't ever eaten at Pequod's, you are really missing out on what I consider the best deep dish in Chicago. I've gotten their pizza delivered as well, and it is definitely better in person. This is always on my recommendations list for out of towners looking for suggested places to eat. My buddy got me into getting a sausage and giardiniera pizza and it is surprisingly really tasty. Their sausage is among the best I've ever tasted on a pizza and the carmelized crust is good enough to convert any of you non-crust-eaters out there. I would say that their pizzas taste better if you don't over do it on the ingredients, so don't go overboard on your toppings. Best go hungry because two pieces will really fill you up. This place can get pretty packed at times, but they've got friendly service and kick ass pizza. Go get some!
