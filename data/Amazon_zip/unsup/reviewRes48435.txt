Service was good, particularly in bar. At table, upsell seemed a liitle obvious, though friendly enough. Also, replacing of plates while we ate was a little awkward. Food itself...it was good, lots of interesting choices, some seemed a bit pricey for the serving, but this wasn't true across the board. We also fell for the upsell a bit, ordering more than we needed based on waitress recommendations. Also, VERY loud, can barely hear people in your party. In short, feels a little like you are paying for the trendiness as much as anything.
