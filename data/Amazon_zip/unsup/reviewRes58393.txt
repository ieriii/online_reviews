While looking for a nice brunch Sunday brunch spot, we decided to visit Sprout. No place on their web page did it state that children under 10 were not welcome. My kids, 5 and 9, are very accustomed to eating in nice restaurants. My husband and I will not be visiting this establishment again--by ourselves OR when the kids come of age.
