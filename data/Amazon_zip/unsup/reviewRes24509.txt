I really liked the food and the decor but I have to agree with the people who complained about coming in for the restaurant week special menu and were pushed to order from the regular menu. The server emphasized how small the portions were. Well, my friend and I DID order from the restaurant week menu, and there was plenty of food for 2 women. In fact we didn't finish the last couple of dishes. With the 2 of us, and the way the deal works, we had everything on the special menu. So it's a very good deal that they are trying to steer you away from. So why be part of Restaurant Week if you don't want people to actually take advantage of it? RW gives people a chance to try a new place, and if they like it, they'll be back. So they might lose money in the short run, but will gain new customers in the long run. I don't know if this practice is coming from the servers or management, but they should really rethink it. So I would like to come back with my husband to try some the regular menu because I liked the food, but, no pun intended, it left a bad taste in my mouth.
