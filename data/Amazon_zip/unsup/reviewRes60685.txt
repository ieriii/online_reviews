Until last week, I absolutely LOVED Grand Luxe Cafe... It was the go-to place for a date, for dessert after shopping with the girls, for an employee's birthday, etc. The decor was extravagant, the menu was expansive, and the prices were reasonable. For all these reasons is why I thought it would be the perfect place to bring my visiting supervisors from New York. However, I've never been so wrong in my life. Knowing that we would have a slightly larger group (8 people) I made a reservation. When we arrived a few minutes late we were informed that our table was given away (understandably so although, we were spoken to incredibly rudely) and that we would have to wait to even find out how long the wait for another table would be (though there wasn't a single person waiting in the lobby with us). After being told that it would be another 45 minutes until a table opened we agreed that we would wait. After only 20 minutes were told that the table was ready and that it would be given away again if the entire party wasn't present in the next 5 minutes. As this was still 25 minutes before the table was supposed to be ready, we had a couple of girls enjoying the fresh air and a couple of girls in the bathroom to kill time. To make matters worse, 5 of the 8 girls ordered salads and they were so tasteless that we didn't finish them nor take them home. I've always boasted about how wonderful Grand Luxe Cafe is but after my last experience, I'm not sure I'll be back...
