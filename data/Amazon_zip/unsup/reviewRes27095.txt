It'd be easier to just take a photo of the menu rather than list all the food I like here, b/c honestly, everything tastes good. It's a fancy schmancy south american joint that makes delicious food that looks pretty (which I'm sure most places south of the border wouldn't bother taking the time to do). The flavor combos here are JUST SO, and the yum factor is in everything from the smoky chocolatey mole, to the tanginess of the al pastor tacos to the lovely creaminess of the guacamole to the refreshing tartness of the jamaica lime drink. It's spendy and worth it.
