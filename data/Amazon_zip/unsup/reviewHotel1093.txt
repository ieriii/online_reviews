Just spent a few days here at a work conference. I have traveled A LOT for work and have spent plenty of nights in some pretty bad places and some pretty good ones. Although as far as you know I am making that up. I am not. I disgress. Stayed two nights here this past week and was very impressed with everything about the hotel. Not only is the staff very friendly but they addressed any issues that came up with my stay immediately. Since I am sure you are curious the two issues were (1) my keys didn't work one night when I came back to the room (they ran two new keys up to my floor while I waited) and (2) I needed something out of my car which I had valet parked. They also brought it up to my room within 10-15 minutes of my request. Very impressed. Rooms were clean, modern and very spacious. Excellent views of the city (from the 23rd floor). The hotel has a nice spa in the lower level of the hotel. In addition the hotel is connected to Chicgao's "pedway" which is an underground tunnel system connecting man of the buildings to one another. Thus, I was able to get Starbucks in the morning without having to go outside. The only downside to this hotel was the conference rooms. As I mentioned I was here for a work conference. The rooms were cold as hell. Hmmm...not such a great analogy come to think of it. Needless to say many people were wearing jackets etc during the conference to stay warm. It was ridiculous especially since it is April and wasn't warm outside. The only other caution I have for you dear reader is that valet parking is $51/night which even for Chicago seems steep. I would recommend not parking here if you can find an overnight ramp cheaper.
