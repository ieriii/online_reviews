My boyfriend took me here for one night on my 29th birthday, and we coincidentally got a room on the 29th floor!! We had a BEAUTIFUL river-view, and just loved our time there... it was more like an apartment than a hotel room, and we enjoyed our time there immensely. Just a hop, skip and a jump away from Morton's Steakhouse, where we had my birthday dinner. Would definitely stay here again!
