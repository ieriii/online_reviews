I don't get out to the bars much anymore, as the little one is a mere 4 1/2 months old. But it was my birthday, and I knew I would like a serious cocktail, and I knew I wanted to go to The Violet Hour.  Mr. A and I are the type that like to actually taste our liquor when we choose a drink, thus we enjoy the more old-fashioned libations, such as a manhattan made with rye, or a gimlet made with gin, or, well, an old fashioned, perhaps? We slid into line just before the weekend rush, about 9 on a Friday. The doorman was gracious, and even noticed that the other party of two that was taken past the curtain at the same time as we were had sneaked ahead of us, and still sat us first. Very thoughtful. Sat at the bar, which is really the only place to drink in my opinion. Ordered a Woolworth's Manhattan and an Old Fashioned. Sort of agonized about not ordering the Pim's Cup, because come on... how many bartenders even know what Pim's is?  But I digress. They were delightful cocktails. The hand shaped ice in the Old Fashioned, which I thought was gimmicky before seeing it, was actually pretty fun. Since I'm not out to get blitzed, this was the perfect thing: an amazing cocktail to sip at a beautiful bar, while trying to look as sophisticated as possible. Then we told our bartender that we had a vintage bottle of Peychaud's Bitters, and he got a sort of geeky light in his eye, and said we should bring it by to show it to the bartenders. Kindred spirit? Well, anyway, I understand his enthusiasm. My only complaint is that they don't serve their Moscow Mule in a copper mug. But if this much energy went into preparing and enjoying drinks all the time, I think we'd be a much more civil society.
