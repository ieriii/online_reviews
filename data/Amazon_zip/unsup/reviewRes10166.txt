Five stars? Oh, yes I did. First -- service. We had some poser Italian Stallion waiter who was fab. Attentive to our every need without ever once seeming to hover. Great bussing, water filling, hostessing, all that. People were great. Second -- apps. Had the fried calamari in the paper artichoke. Wow, this is a very generous portion. For the six dining dames, it would have been enough but we were silly and had two other apps: the chickpea frites -- good but not great -- and the grilled veggies plate, which was also fab. Oh, asparagus, I don't care how thy make my pee smell like electrocuted rabbit, you are just so good. Third -- main course. I had the ricotta filled gnocchi. Ok: full disclosure....I usually don't order gnocchi because the few times I've had it, I wasn't sure if my stomach would ever retreat back to its normal size. But I had it here and I can't stop having sexual dreams about it! Sooooooo. Gooooooood. Come back to me, gnocchi, come back. I sampled the seafood squid spaghetti from Dame Ro....it was my second dinner choice. It was decent but not robust. with flavor. Third -dessert.....I don't know what we had (too much wine, perhaps) but there was something that looked like a stack of pancakes with a creme layering in between. OK, as Dame Veronica would say, "f*** me running please".....I don't even care much for desserts but this shit was off the hook. All in all, I can't think of a reason why I won't rush back.
