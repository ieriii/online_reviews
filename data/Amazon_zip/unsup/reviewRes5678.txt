The place is loud and cramped. Not what you want for a romantic dinner. Expensive wine and beer. I love wine but didn't recognize any on the wine list. The same with the food. Being a first timer here, you would have expected a little help from the staff. They seemed too busy to be bothered. The food we did order was good, but not worth the trouble.
