I've been here multiple times through out the past two years, if you're looking for an authentic Italian cuisine and feel this is as close to perfection as you'll get without shelling out a ton of cash! The decor is simple yet elegant filled with many true blooded Italians as well as local Chicagoans. I highly recommend the 4 cheese pizza, the pizza margherita, cannolis, and the gelato. The servers are kind, the food is cooked right behind you, and the greeters are usually family owners and in the Summer they say goodbye by handing out free cannolis!
