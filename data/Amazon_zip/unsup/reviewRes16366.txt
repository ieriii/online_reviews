Service=5 stars Atmosphere=5 stars Food was excellent and service was even better. The complimentary naan and dipping sauce were both superb! The creamy tomato dipping sauce was mouth-wateringly perfect! I ordered the Shrimp Madras, which were prepared in a coconut flavored sauce. Most people would describe the sauce as "medium spicy" and it was a great sauce for dipping your naan. A great location and a pleasurable dining experience.
