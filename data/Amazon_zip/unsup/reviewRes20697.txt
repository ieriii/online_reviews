The Gage is a special place. I feel like I'm transported to a different era when I walk inside. The ambience is upscale but accessible. The seating is comfortable but not stuffy. The cocktails are reason enough to visit the Gage. It's hard for me to walk by without popping in for a martini or manhattan. The food is truly exquisite. I've dined at the Gage several times and have never been disappointed. My favorites are the fried chicken livers, the mushroom sandwich, and pretty much all of their appetizers. It can get pricey so I usually only go on special occasions. For lunch, the prices drop considerably.
