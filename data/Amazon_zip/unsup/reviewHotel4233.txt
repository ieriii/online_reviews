I wasn't that pleased with this place. I stayed here last night. I had stayed here a couple of years ago and would not of again if I had a choice, but I wanted to try priceline, so I entered 4star + for $175 and this is what I got, which really sucks because the online regular rate is like $190. That's how I ended up here. It's a total convention hotel. The service is average to below average. The place is packed and I think its not well maintained at all. The hotel room if you look closely is kind of gross. So what that they have a flat screen and a decent view. I'd prefer clean sheets and not being afraid to walk without shoes on the carpet. I mean this would be a perfectly acceptable 2 or 3 star hotel, but four stars??. I'm in a westin right now which is a middle of the road to bottom level four star hotel and it is wayyy better than this place. The only positive I will say is that I ordered a breakfast sandwich here this morning and it was expertly prepared. Don't stay here. I wouldn't pay $100 a night for this place. Oh yeah, one last thing $7 for 15 minutes of internet in the biz. center??? Crazy!!! You would think a hotel that puts itself out there to the business traveler would have a more forgiving policy.
