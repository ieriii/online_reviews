I honestly dont see what the big deal is bout this place. I didnt really like the burger that i had. My gf had the superdawg & she loved it but it was just ok to me. The fries were overdone & almost burned, which made them taste gross to me. I like the whole ambiance of the place but the food isn't worth it to me. There are other hotdog places that I've enjoyed better than this place.
