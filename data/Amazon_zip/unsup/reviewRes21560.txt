The spicy Ahodaga torta hurts so good (and well worth the long lunch wait)! Pepito is delicious but the spicy sauce of the Ahodaga is amazing! The kiddos enjoyed the Xoco salad and the guac was incredible! The bean-to-cup freshly ground cacao was very rich and scrumptious! So, so sad about coming home from vacation because I am craving more Xoco!
