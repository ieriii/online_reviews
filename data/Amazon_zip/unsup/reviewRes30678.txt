I've been for breakfast and dinner, and I would love to go back until I've had every single thing on the menu. When you taste the food, you can tell that every ingredient that went on your plate was fresh. I've had the opportunity to try the chilequiles in poblano cream sauce (sooo good!), stuffed french toast (sweet w/o being too sweet), and truffled mac n cheese (I want to swim in this stuff) during a breakfast visit. Next time, I want to try the nanadict and the poblano cheese grits, but I'd be happy having these dishes again too. (side note: the small mac n cheese is $4 and is plenty big to share with one or two other ppl as a side). For dinner, I had the oyster and shrimp po' boy (mmm), and shared the apple parmesan fondue appetizer and a pitcher full of sangria. The app was a great way to start dinner (it could have a slightly bigger portion of fondue though... or they need to serve less cauliflower with it). The sangria was strong and not too sweet... and had me buzzing for the rest of the night. I'm pretty sure everyone else enjoyed their dinner too, because there was not a shred of food left on our table at the end of the night! Nana herself seems to be the hostess, and she'll come check on your table to make sure everything is better than great. I'm surprised that this place isn't bustling at the seams on a Friday night... but if you're in Bridgeport looking for a great meal... look no further.
