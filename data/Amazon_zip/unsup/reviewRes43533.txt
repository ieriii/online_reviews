This place has a good vibe when you come in, there's something about it that I like. I ordered the almond croissant with a cup of the apple cider. The boyfriend got the pumpkin coconut bread and an orange juice. I thought the almond croissant was just ok. The flavors were good, but it wasn't flaky enough or something for me. I'm not sure what it was, but it didn't hit the spot. I also found it a bit dry for me. The apple cider was fabulous though and really warmed me up from the cold. The boyfriend seemed to enjoy his pumpkin coconut bread. I'm not a huge fan of either pumpkin or coconut, but thought it was pretty tasty. The OJ was standard. This place was overall just ok. Nothing super fancy, and not bad at all. Definitely a good place to pop in for a quick hiatus from the cold and wind.
