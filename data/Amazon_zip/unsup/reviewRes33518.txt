YUMMMMM. Minus a star just because of the crazy wait (40 minutes for Saturday brunch at 10 a.m.), but all-in-all superb. This place is pretty huge, as far as restaurants in Chicago go. And though the wait was long, it was accurately estimated and we were well served once we got in there, so it was fine. Food-wise: OMG. I had lemon poppyseed french toast which was worth every calorie (and I'm sure there were many) -- we also had corned beef hash (great) and a french toast combo platter that was also yummy all around (particularly the sausage links. I normally prefer patties to links any day, but these may have converted me). Food: great. Wait: sucked. Price: fine. My boyfriend thought it was a pretty good value, but I'd just call it reasonable. Would DEFINITELY go back, especially on a nice day, because I'm sure I'll have to walk around outside while I wait for a table again. Actually, upon rereading this, I feel I didn't properly emphasize how ridiculously good the lemon poppyseed french toast was. Let me do so now: IT WAS RIDICULOUSLY GOOD. Go there, wait patiently for a table, order it, and enjoyyyyyy.
