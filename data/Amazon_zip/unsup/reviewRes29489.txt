We were looking for a new thai restaurant to order from and decided to give this a shot. We ordered a few things. They took about an hour and it was pricey for thai food. There are places on par for less time and less money. I had shrimp tempura, shumai, panang curry, sticky rice and thai custard. Shrimp tempura with broccoli, sweet potatoes and green beans was delicious with the sauce. Especially sweet potatoes- what a treat! The shumai is REALLY shrimpy. I mean, duh, they are shrimp dumplings but I couldn't believe how overwhelming the taste was! I ordered the panang curry with tofu, and it was super tasty. I get a craving for curry every two months, and this might be the big winner. I disappointed myself by ordering the sticky rice. And when they say sticky, they mean STICKY. It was near impossible to eat! I liked the thai custard but my roommate flipped for it and said it was really really good! So ordering is convenient and they are friendly. It is pricier and did take more time, so you may want to try a place that is closer/cheaper.
