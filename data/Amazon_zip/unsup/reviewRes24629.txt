What a meal! Disclaimer -- I was here June 2010. We had an awesome server who definitely looked out for us. One of our pitchers of margaritas (which was half full) was inadvertently taken away and he comped us a new pitcher. We got the tasting menu and every dish was tasty, well seasoned, and delicious. It was by no means cheap, but the quality of the food, the ambiance lived up to my expectations of an Iron Chef.
