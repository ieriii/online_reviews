This is truly the only dining experience I've ever had that I would give one star, or less if I could. And I'm not being overly dramatic that my food was overcooked or the service was poor...  Simply stated, they served me a Cobb salad with uncooked pieces turkey meat. Yes, completely UNCOOKED. I thought the meat looked exceptionally pink, but I was at a business lunch and didn't want to be "that person" who complains about their food. So I assumed I was sorely misinformed on what cooked meat looks like (hey, I don't cook very often) and tried to cut it, but the texture was so "chewy" it would not cut with my flatware. So I got a 2nd opinion from a co-worker who told me there was definitely a problem, and I should send it back. The waiter seemed irritated but took it anyway. He came back a few minutes later and explained they were sorry but it appeared they gave me meat from the wrong bucket. Yes, bucket! I trust they have a cooked and uncooked bucket of turkey meat in the kitchen. They made me a new salad, and I of course could not eat it I was so horrified. Yuck! I never threw a fuss at the restaurant because I wasn't in an appropriate context to to say how I really felt (though hindsight I should have) ..but now you all can hear it firsthand. So I'd be wary to order anything other than wine (which I'll admit they do have a good selection) at what I now refer to as Bucket 36.
