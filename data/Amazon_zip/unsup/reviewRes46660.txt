The food was tasty and appropriately priced given the location. The service was poor. We had to ask what the special beer and entrees were. When questioned about the beer special, she was unaware of the type of beer and the cost. We then had to ask another server for dessert menus which we then ordered with her. it was an overall bad experience and i don't think i will return.
