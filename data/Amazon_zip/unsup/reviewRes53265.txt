Nice walk from Millenium Station (Shoreline train) gets you in the mood for waiting if you get here when it's busy (and when isn't it??!!). Had a short (25 minute) wait til we ordered, another 10 minutes til our food was served, and another 20 minutes til the dessert came. Busy! Crowded and you will probably share a table with a motor -mouth who is boring her companions into a coma with her loud stories of lost loves - but don't let that stop you or scare you off - whatever you get, it will be delicious - we had the chorizo and queso sandwich and the special goat with avocado sandwich - absolutely delicious and the dips were fantastic. Tres leches cake was definitely a WOW factor. Wanted to go back the next day for breakfast but had other places to try! Staff was friendly, helpful and definitely hustling their butts off to get the line through the door - heard that it was a 45 minute wait at 12:45!!! So get there early!
