Hands down fantastic! Each beer tasted wonderful. There is a beer for everyone's taste. The food was gourmet. From the awesome chicken & bacon pizza, to the mussels to the burger. Everything was prepared perfectly. I even received a true medium rare burger. It was super busy on opening night, but the staff maintained their cool and hustled as quick as they could. The atmosphere was casual and fun. The space is huge. I can't wait to go back on a less crowded night and really check the place out.
