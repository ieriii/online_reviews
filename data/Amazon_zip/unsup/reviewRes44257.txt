Wakamono has to be one of my favorite Sushi places here in Lakeview. I have to recommend the Peter Parker roll to anyone. I know its not a traditional sushi roll but the flavors that explode in your mouth are just amazing. They have very polite staff and fast service. Unless they are busy on Friday and Saturday nights. Then you have to wait. Overall, I'll give them a 5 stars. Not sure my friend will recommend them after his waitress spilled soy sauce all over him and never said anything after. But, that's not my issue and my visit!
