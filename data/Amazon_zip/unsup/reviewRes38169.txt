Hopleaf is incredible. I had never been and after asking around I was very excited to make my first trip all the way up there. I was not disappointed. First of all, the beer selection was fantastic, some of the best beers are Belgian and they have them all. The food was also great. The mussels were amazing (we tried the beer and wine, and surprisingly liked the ones cooked in beer better) and the brisket was very good too. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five, was the service. It was just a bit slow but they were packed as well. Overall, a great experience.
