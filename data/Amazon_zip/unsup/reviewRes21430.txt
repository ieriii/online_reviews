Well I finally made it out to the glory that is Superdawg, my Chicago hot dog Trinity is complete                       Hot Dougs                          /\                         /  \                        /    \                       /_____\             Superdawg       Wieners Circle I know that others may disagree but oh well. Now that the 22nd century graphics have been finalized by my graphics department and displayed here is the actual review. This place knows its niche and it plays up that angle to a tee. That being said, and its relative cheesyness stated, I must confess love it for all of it . This place is a a great piece of nostalgia  all around , from the flexing hot dog couple to the drive in stalls to the walk up window. The dogs themselves are great, they snap like a classic steamed dog should. The toppings are freshand the fries are actually very good. The presentation itself especially the packaging is perfect. This place may be a little cheesy to some but give it a chance and soak it up. I think you will appreciate what they are giving out to people wanting a little nostalgia along with a great meal.
