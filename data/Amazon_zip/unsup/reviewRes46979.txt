I did finally go here for dinner and I did have to just dock the place one star because of the food. Don't get me wrong, they had decent food... I actually liked my meal, which was a fish special. However, my dining companions (overall) said their meals were just a little above mediocre stating that some of the dishes were either too bland or too salty. Mine was tasty, but not anything that blew me away. However, really, I have to say that it was such a nice dining experience that I would go back there again! The atmosphere is what is the main winner there. It is cozy and intimate... really, a great place for a date or for a small gathering of friends. The staff there were very friendly and the drinks are inventive and pretty, darn good. It is definitely a bonus that there is also live music. The first time I went I was in the music room... would definitely recommend that if you want to get into the music and really focus on the show. If you want to catch up with friends, gab and laugh, I would opt for the dining room. You can still hear the music as a nice background but still be able to have conversations.
