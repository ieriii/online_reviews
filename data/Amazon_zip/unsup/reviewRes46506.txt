If you're looking for classic American food (i.e. burgers, grilled cheese, club sandwiches) done well, RJ Grunts is a good place to go. It's very no frills, but the execution is spot on and the ingredients are of good quality. I have eaten here twice (once in the restaurant and another for takeout) and enjoyed the experience both times. The salad bar is especially delicious. It's a little bit on the pricey side. (I wish they would just up their entree prices a little and include it at no additional cost.) However, it does offer a great range of stuff including a fantastic cream cheese frosting that's laced with chocolate chips and sinful for spreading on fruit. I think the one downside is that this place can be a bit of a zoo on nights and weekends. Normally I don't mind a wait, but it becomes a problem if you are going to pick up takeout. It is handled so you have to pick it up at the bar rather than at a hostess stand. This meant I had to wade through a crowd of people and then deal with the fact that there was only one bartender trying to deal with a crowd of people. This meant that I had to wait about 10 minutes to get my food. This wouldn't have been such a big deal, except that it was sitting out and clearly getting cold. I don't mind waiting a little bit but it seems like they could stand to have a better takeout system. All in all though the food is very good quality and perfect for when you're craving classic American fare.
