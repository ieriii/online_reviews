Went back again with a large group of 30 in the party area. This time, the pizzas were super yummy! I don't know what it is about this place: does it depend on what you order??? I know that some of the pizzas I had at this party were similar to the ones I had at the last party but they were tastier this time.  What amazed me was the amount of heat generated in this restaurant. We walked in and the room looked like it had a fog coming through. When we got our pizzas, the area immediately increased in room temp by like 5 degrees. It was unbearable for alot of the boys...even I got hot and I was wearing a sun dress. On a 95 degree and humid day, you should blast the a/c!!!
