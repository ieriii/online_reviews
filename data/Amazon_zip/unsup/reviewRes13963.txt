This place is closer to me than my favorite Costa Rican joint...and I am completely in love with 90 Miles' patio....which is the main reason I was debating between 3 or 4 stars. After my co-worker talked about this place multiple times, I finally went. I ordered a lunch special for $8.95 and got an Americano. Cup of fish soup as well and with tip, I spent about $19. The food is ok...my soup was alright but lacked a bit of flavor. My pork lunch special was pretty good...came with a salad, rice, and my meat. Well, the meat was a bit greasy...the rice + beans were a little greasier than I liked it. The yucca fries were pretty good as well. I'll come back and give it a whirl again for the patio. Seriously...it's that patio....the food was worth about 3 stars. Yeah, I know...boring review...but I just found the food....kind of dull as well. =/
