I used to be a fan of the sushi at Wakamono until my experience tonight. I went to Wakamono tonight for dinner with a group of 5. The experience started out on a bad note as the host was rude when we told him our party was of 5 instead of 6, as one of our friends couldn't make it because she was sick. The sushi is decent however the service was NOT. We noticed as we were eating/finishing up that the host and other employees kept looking over at our table to check on our progress with rude looks as if they were annoyed that we were still there. Then as we were getting together money for our bill, the host came over and asked us how our night was going before impolitely saying that he needed our table. I have NEVER been rushed like that or asked to leave a restaurant within 15 minutes of finishing a meal. That was the perfect way to leave a bad taste in the mouths of your diners. and to completely turn off frequent customers. I like the sushi at Wakamono, but good sushi in Chicago is not hard to find. I will be finding it elsewhere from now on.
