Yum, yum and more YUM! I arrived at Grand Lux on a wednesday night, in the middle of dinnertime, with a party of 4 and no reservations. we were seated within 15 minutes, at a nice booth with a view of the city. our server was attentive and informative, letting the Lux virgins (myself included) know how the fresh-baked desserts work and answering all of our questions happily. we started with some appetizers - chicken lettuce wraps, calamari/shrimp/veggie tempura, and the soup of the night - and drinks - I went for the watermelon martini (very tasty, and a nice presentation). after eating most of the tempura myself and a few bites of soup, I was already completely satisfied - the portions are huge! luckily, I ordered a small salad for my meal, and was able to finish most of it without feeling heavy or overly stuffed. I also tried the thai chicken pizza and a beef dish that I didn't catch the name of, both of which were delicious. for dessert, which is baked when you order it with your meal, and delivered to your table hot, we had the new orleans style beignets - fried dough puffs filled with sweet cream and covered in powdered sugar. they're served with three dipping sauces - chocolate, raspberry and more sweet cream, and are seriously amazing. I ate way more than I should have, and still had to take about half the order home with me! for a meal so big and so delicious, the prices were suprisingly low. I couldn't see myself eating here on a weekly basis (the beignets alone would gain me 20 lbs!), but I will definately come here when I'm looking for a treat!
