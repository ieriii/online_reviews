DO NOT EAT BREAKFAST OR LUNCH AT YOLK. I live in the bldg. next to this place, and I have tried it on a few occasions for brunch and very disappointed and 1 time before today for lunch. This place is very consistent.....at being terrible. I consider my taste buds very in tune w/ good food and good value. I order the buffalo chicken wrap w/ blue cheese, fries and a Pepsi. The wrap seemed old and stale, they use soggy iceberg lettuce, the chicken did not taste very fresh and hot, the diced tomatoes were like the ones you'd get at Taco Bell, the blue cheese tasted old and didn't even really taste like blue cheese, and the fries were not hot and a bit stale. The wrap pretty much fell apart when I picked it up. Terrible presentation. Yolk should be paying me $13.04 to eat this crap. Yolk is totally overpriced and totally not worth the wait or the rushed, unfriendly servers and staff. Please, Chicagoians and tourists, do yourself a favor - eat somewhere else in the SouthLoop, or go over to Wishbone in the West Loop on Washington and Morgan.
