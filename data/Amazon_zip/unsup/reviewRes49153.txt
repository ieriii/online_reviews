Charlie - I think what happened here is not unique to the bakery. Judging from other stories I've heard over the years, what happened was probably this: It was a slow night, the employees were anxious to go home, so they cashed out early. Serving another customer meant re-opening the cash box and working beyond closing time. I was guilty of doing this myself - once. The boss heard about it and politely but firmly explained that retail is a "customer service" business and the customer must be served if his/her body is on the premises any time before the official closing time. The four stars here are for the pastries and home-made caramel candies, which I find to be almost uniformly excellent. Too bad the Hot Cross Buns, sold before Easter, were either dry and hard, or already sold-out.
