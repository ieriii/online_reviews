We came here early on a Wednesday night and were seated right away. They brought us to our table even though we were missing one person from our party. Beer was easy to order. I enjoy Allagash White = Bottom Up Wit = delish!!! We ordered the bacon fat popcorn. The popcorn may not sound good, but it is really, really good. There is bacon on popcorn, can't go wrong with that combo. The hard part was deciding on what to order for dinner. The menu isn't large, but so many items appealed to me. Finally decided on the mussels with the blue cheese, shallots and granny smith apples. Very good!! That isn't right, Wonderful, might be a better word to describe the mussels. Service was friendly. Noise level was fine. I will definitely be back.
