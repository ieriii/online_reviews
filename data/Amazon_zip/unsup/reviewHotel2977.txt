The Sheraton Chicago is a great hotel. It's in a great location on the Chicago River blocks away from Navy Pier, Michigan Ave, CTA stations, Grant Park, and much more. You walk in and are greeted to an impressive, expansive lobby. Heading upstairs, we arrived in a clean, updated hotel room. There was a HD LCD TV! On top of that, there was a great view down the Chicago River towards the new Trump Tower. The only complaint I had was the plumbing, which is the reason this is a 4 star review and not a 5 star review. Upon using the bathroom, the sink wouldn't drain and the toilet was acting strange. But once we got the staff up there, everything went smoothly from there on. Back to the lobby. We were told upon check in about the Microsoft Surface tables in the lobby. There are two of them. We were told that the Sheraton Chicago was one of five hotels to have them in the country. I can tell you, they're pretty much awesome, and I don't even like Microsoft. The interface is a little clunky, but it's pretty cool to listen to their catalog of music and discover a little bit about what to do in the city of Chicago on a touchscreen computer built into a coffee table! Be warned though, it wasn't until just before we left that I got to try one out. They're extremely popular. Moving on, there are five restaurants/bars in the hotel, including Shula's Steakhouse and the Java Bar, which serves Starbucks. Shula's has an excellent buffet. For $20, you can have an awesome selection of food, ranging from smoked salmon to bagels to deconstructed parfaits to pastries to pancakes to omelets and everything in between. The steakhouse has a great atmosphere too, although I never had lunch or dinner there. Also, the staff is very friendly and helpful and took care of everything we needed. Overall, if you're looking for a great hotel to stay at in Chicago at a moderate price, the Sheraton is what you're looking for.
