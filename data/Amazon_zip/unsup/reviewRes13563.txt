Fantastic food, service & booze... What else could ya want? Seriously tho, Roy was our server & he was da bomb! Very informative, accommodating & courteous ;o) Wish i got this kinda service at every restaurant in the city :o/  Called the restaurant earlier in the day too & ended up catching the owner, told him I was a vegan & he tried to bring me back to the other side... JK, he was extremely nice & said they had some options for me and if there was any questions or concerns to speak up & his staff would be sure to help a veggie sista out!
