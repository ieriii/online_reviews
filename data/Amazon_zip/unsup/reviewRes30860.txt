LIKES - Adobo braised pork belly was the softest I've ever eaten. - Glamorous AND approachable. Our server made us feel comfortable, even though we weren't VIP or dressed to the 9's. - Portions for Loompya and Pancit Canton were big enough to share between 2-3 people.  DISLIKES - Loompya and Pancit Canton were really bland. Obviously they intended to introduce Filipino food in a less intimidating way. - so loud I couldn't hear my friend who was sitting NEXT to me - our glasses of water were empty for a good amount of time towards the end of the meal and we had to signal a busboy. This is the perfect place for a blind date. This place is so lively you'll only have the "awkward" in "awkward silence."
