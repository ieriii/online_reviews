I agree with many of the yelpers from 3 to five star posting in August 2012. Service was great. Did the reserve wine pairing. Great pairing. I regret I'm a lightweight drinker so I barely made it to the end. I was heaving near the prisitine women's second floor private washroom coveted bowl wishing I didn't finish all my pours trying to keep up with the husband. Sparkling water was a no no. It made my belly full. I missed out enjoying the only true savory meat dish. It would have been an awesome highlight for me. It was a delight for a chef to come out and "plate" our dessert. Would go back again.
