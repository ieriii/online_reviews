Wow. I sort of see Chinese food as seasonal, in that I tend to order it for delivery in the dead of winter. However, my opinion has changed. On arrival, we grabbed a take out menu to see our options. My friend was dead set on eating chicken and in the menu everything looked delicious. So I point out the XO sauce and recommend to try something new. Sold. We're seated immediately. Waiter was very knowledgeable and willing to explain any of the dishes or sauces. I asked about the XO sauce and more details about the offers in the menu. . After commenting on all the seafood options, he asks if we like oysters. I happen to love oysters and tied with his enthusiasm, I was sold on the garlic oyster appetizer. Happily so, because it was the largest oyster I've ever had, direct from Seattle. Everything was tasty and not overly spicy and the portions are huge. It's not so often you see such enthusiasm and pride in the food being served. I will never again see Chinese food as seasonal.
