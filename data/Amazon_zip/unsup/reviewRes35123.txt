Very traditional Chicago seafood place; specializes in diverse traditional seafood offerings. Not cutting-edge, but excellent in classic presentation and offerings. This place is very expensive, and the portion sizes are medium, not large. Order "sides" meaning veggies, because your entre doesn't include them (check with your waiter for details). The sides are unbelievably expensive for what they are, but their quality as well as the overall food quality is superior. You can't have a bad experience in terms of quality or service here. But if your other experiences peaked at Red Lobster, you'll find this a different world. Enjoy it. Bring money. Have a good time.
