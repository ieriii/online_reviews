First of all my servers name was Amy and she was five stars all the way! I complained a bit about the service in my original review so I wanted to make it clear I loved it this time around. Gilt Bar has some of my favorite foods on the menu. My first time going there I stuck to those foods, and while they were all excellent, I wasn't really impressed. After my second visit I think that has more to do with the fact that I eat foie gras, bone marrow, and pork belly all the time, and less to do with the quality itself. I visited tonight and ventured out a bit from my comfort zone. I had a rabbit fettuccine: best pasta dish of my life! For the side I had the corn bread special. It was jalapeno cornbread sitting in a buttery, syrupy deliciousness. Dessert was incredible, but I had no business ordering it. So the whiskey sour? Top three cocktails I've had in Chicago list! Add to that that they have the best mezcal cocktail I've ever had. Which leads me to curio. Don't know what curio is? Find out, and let's start a secret society!
