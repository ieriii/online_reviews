If you don't stay here, do walk in and see the lobby. Stay for lunch or just a glass of wine. It is one of those amazing grand old hotel lobbies. Plus the food is good and the service great. Second, if you want a hotel with a great gym, this place gets $10 more from you but it is a great big gym with tons of stuff. Plus the space is cool- they covered a section of roof amongst the towers, so it has a dramatic feel. And great gear and a lot of it, In addition to hitting you up for the gym, they also get $9.95/day for the Internet- and it is a wire. I had to work so plugged in laptop and played Netflix on the iPad at my desk, versus the usual sprawl on the bed in front of tv (and their tv's are old). Room-service service good, food OK. Comfy bed. Pretty deep tub that is bath worthy if you have such an inclination. Quiet.  The rooms aren't luxe but are nice. It is a great location. Orange line drops right across the street if you fly and train in from Midway.
