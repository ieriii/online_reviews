We stopped in last night after the restaurant we drove to Boystown for was closed. I hadn't been to the Chicago Diner in a good long time, but it was nice to be back. Unfortunately, they were out of a good 8 or so menu items by 7 p.m. I REALLY wanted the soul bowl (out), but ended up with the California Reuben, which was a perfectly delicious substitute. What a great reuben imitation. Just delicious. I also loved the sweet potato fries. My husband got the regular reuben, which was good, but I think I actually liked mine better. We were too full for yummy vegan dessert, but I got a chocolate chip cookie to go. Love those cookies!
