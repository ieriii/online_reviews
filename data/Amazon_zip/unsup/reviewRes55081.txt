My absolute favorite restaurant in Chicago. We've been coming here since this place opened up. We celebrated the New Year in '99 with friends, and I still remember it.At about $75 for two people (not including alcohol), it's a pretty decent price for a good night out. My husband usually orders the filet sampler, which I still to the filet, cooked rare. We usually have the mashed potatoes as a side, and try to save room for dessert. I'm partial to their key lime pie.If you don't have a reservation, you can still eat at one of the bar tables, without a wait.I recommend this to friends looking for a place to celebrate an anniversary.
