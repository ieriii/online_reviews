I went here with my sister a little while ago, and it was really good.My sister got the lentil soup and hummus, and I got a lamb shewarma. She really enjoyed both items, and we had enough hummus to take home. The only complaint I have about the shewarma is that it was very, very messy.  I didn't really mind cuz it was hella good! ;D
