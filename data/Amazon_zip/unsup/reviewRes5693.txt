Great food and service! My uncle and friend from out of town were visiting and I wanted to take them to a unique place that embodies chicago. We were not disappointed! We had pork rillete, bone marrow, turkey leg, artichoke and finglerling salad, pig's ears, and bread pudding. Everything was incredibly good, especially the turkey leg and pig's ears! My family loved it, as did I. It was friday night and they were able to seat us after about 20 minutes, even though they quoted us 30-40min! Even though my family was obviously not from the city and the place was busy, the server and bartender was very helpful, friendly, and attentative! I really enjoyed the communal seating and it made the experience even more fun. It's the type of place where you want to order everything on the menu! My kind of place!
