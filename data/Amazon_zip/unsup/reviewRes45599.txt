Went in here for a late lunch. Waitstaff was visible, but they were more interested in talking amongst themselves instead of waiting on me. Lunch was unremarkable. $23 for a plate of fish n chips and a guiness. $6 beer and $15 plate makes that about $4 each for the 3 measly overbattered cod filets and about 20 cents each for the 12 stale fries that came with it. I guess the prices are how they pay for all the pretty flowers out front, but I will never return.
