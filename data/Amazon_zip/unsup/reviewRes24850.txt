Okay, I cannot judge their great looking pastries, but Artopolis serves some seriously bad food. We tried the Inferno and Olympian pizzas. It was pretty obvious that they were not freshly made, because the crust tasted a bit stale.   Besides, they were seriously lacking in flavor.  My friend had strongly suggested that we try their almond cookies, which honestly I did not think were that great. At least their pastries make for some great food photos. Perhaps I will give their desserts a try next time, but I am definitely avoiding dinner.
