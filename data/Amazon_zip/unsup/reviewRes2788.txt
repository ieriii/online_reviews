The food here is good, and the acrobatic display of service is interesting, however I am left uninspired by the stiffness of said servers.  I also think the mood could be improved, as well as a few other things. It's almost like eating at a museum, and the times I have been there, I've been worried about my servers having a nervous breakdown behind their painted smiles. Tip toe service, I'd call it. I am just so uncomfortable when no one is having fun. But if you want to be treated like royalty, this is the place to do it. Meh.
