Went to the Kinzie Chophouse with 3 other friends after the theatre. Loved the decor of the resturaunt and the staff was most professional. Wine selection was delish. We all order the special which was filet medallions with peppercorn sauce and herb crusted shrimp with red pepper risotto. The shrimp was delicious except it didn't have a herb crust on it. 3 of us did not recieve our meat cooked correctly and it had no flavor. The risotto was to die for. Considering this is a steak house I was very disappointed that the steak did not impress me at all.
