All in all, a very interesting concept reflects the history of what was once French Indochina, even if if the perspective is rather class based and somewhat myopic. Nevertheless, the food is excellent, the dcour interesting, and the service outstanding. Food: This place has some really interesting items on the menu, and for that they get credit. I've been here a few times and anything with beef is exceptional - it's not a steakhouse, but they cook beef well here. The sauces are rich and alive with complex and complimenting sweet and savory flavors. The one bad experience I had here was ordering the duck with the tamarind sauce (there was more to it but I don't remember). The duck was too gamey and dry; in a word, it was overcooked. It's a shame because I love duck. You might have better luck with that dish; I tried it only once, and it might have been an off night. It's a shame I don't eat seafood, b/c most of the really interesting dishes had fish or seafood - not surprising since it's, in essence a Vietnamese place. Ambiance: Very cool. I love the faux antique, irregular looking chopsticks. I mean, I usually don't ramble on about the dcour (I save that for the food), and I won't here. Suffice it to say that the place has taste, which I do appreciate. Service: Excellent and what you would expect at a place like this. Great place all in all. I deduct a star because of my unfortunate duck experience and, in general, I have a hard time giving expensive places 5 stars. Don't get me wrong, it can happen (i.e. Alinea), however, it's easy to have a great meal when you're paying $40+ per person. As unfair as it sounds, the expensive places need to show me something intangible. Moreover, it would be interesting to see a little more "French" in the Vietnamese-French fusion.
