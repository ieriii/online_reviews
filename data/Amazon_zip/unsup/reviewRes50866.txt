A group of 7 of us went to brunch here the other day. Wishbone has a large menu with a wide variety of options. The other diners at my table got the pumpkin pancake w cinnamon glaze, bagel and fresh fruit, the red eggs, the broccoli omlette, buscuits and gravy, and I had the corn cakes with sweet red pepper sauce and 2 eggs. My friends that got the biscuits and gravy were not overly impressed with the gravy that was kind of gluey with not much flavor. Everyone else, on the other hand seemed very happy with their orders. My corn cakes were awesome. They were filled with scallions and maybe some chopped onion. The sauce was really good too, even though the menu didn't specify that it was creamy, oh well. I didn't even need to get the 2 additional eggs I ordered. I ended up taking half of it home and ate it later that day. I will definitely go back again!
