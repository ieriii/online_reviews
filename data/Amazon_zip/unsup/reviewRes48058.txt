Late night and hungry, the wife and I decided to make our way into the city and grab a meal with some family. Long have I awaited an opportunity to try The Publican, and since it was going to be a 9:00 PM dinner on a weeknight, this was a perfect chance. Made reservations with no issues, and was happily seated immediately to an overwhelmingly delicious sounding menu where everything deserved consideration. From what I understood, The Publican is known for three things - oysters, beer, and pork. We focused our menu around these: Chef's selection of oysters - 12 oysters (4 types, 3 of each) along with all the appropriate sauces. Oysters were fresh and good, but it would have been nice to have some more direction from the staff as to what each type was and possibly a guide to whether it was supposed to be more sweet vs. briny. Overall, good choice to open with. Bouchot Mussels - LOTS of mussels for the larger size, excellent broth to slurp with the mussels, with just plain shells, or to sop up with the crusty fresh bread they serve up. Another great choice. Little Gem Salad - The gems you ask? Why pig ears of course! Much respect, as I"ve never figured out quite how to make pig ears this crisp. Even for those who are squeamish at the idea having the ears of an animal, this is worth trying. Crisp and bacony, flavorful and delicious. Possibly the best way to introduce a new part of the animal. Ham chop - Smoked with hay, this was the most tender ham I've ever had. Seriously, I've never had ham this tender. At $40, it's a bit pricey, but very memorable. Verdict: The Publican offers up phenomenal food, but know that you'll definitely be paying a price as well. Dinner for four with one beer a person came out to $45 a person, but definitely some of the finer food that Chicago has to offer. Worth coming to!
