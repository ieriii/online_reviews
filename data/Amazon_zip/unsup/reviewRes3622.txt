I absolutely love Crisp! It was one of my favorite go to spots in Lakeview. The wings are fabulous! I love all of the sauces and the price is great! I usually order my food from here to go or delivery so I have never really dined in to enjoy the atmosphere. Whenever I have gone in to pick up my food the staff was always very friendly and helpful. Now that I live a little further north I definitely miss going to Crisp!
