Ambiance: I really had no idea what to expect but a dear friend suggested the place to have our ladies' night dinner and so I was open to anything. I was a little hard to find since the lace has one letter but the inside was beautiful! It was cozy and has a nice warm and welcoming decor. Everyone seemed to be in smart casual but I don't think they have a dress code. I also like the fact that they have room upstairs for private dinners and a lounge feeling outside the dining room. The Good: everything! I love that they offered baked chips! They were yummy! And they kept coming! They offer big serving so the dishes can definitely be shared. I like that they try to be innovative by introducing their own sauces - there's a sweet with a kick, their own version, and a vinegar based BBQ. The service was pretty good and friendly and they seem to know their stuff. The bad: I wished they offered their "competition" version of ribs in a smaller platter for individual serving or appetizer portion.  I had the louisiana style ribs and it was a little dry and not as tender as I was expecting. Other than that, I think it's kind of on the upscale joint so it's a bit pricey. The Bottom line: It's a new BBQ place to try to those who LOVE bbq. It has a nice edge, drinks, some yummy ribs, as long as you're willing to stretch out your wallet.
