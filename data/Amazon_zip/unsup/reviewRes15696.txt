My wife and I visited Calo the day before New Years Eve. We were pleasantly surprised at the decor of the restaurant and friendly service. Ray was our server and he was very attentive and made wonderful recommendations. I had for lunch the braised beef ravioli which was wonderful. It came with a salad and the bread was warm and fresh. My wife had the ziti and she enjoyed the pasta very much. We would definitely make a trip back. Parking can be a bit of a trick, especially when it is raining. I did not give the 5 star rating because I would like to go back and try other items before I upgrade or downgrade the rating.  I want to try the pizza and ribs.
