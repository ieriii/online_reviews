Irazu, Irazu, Irazu! I am always impressed when I see successful ethnic-centric spots like this execute so beautifully. With a small, quaint and very comfortable dinning room, you may find yourself waiting for a table, on any given night, not just the weekends. Wait. Don't forget to pick up a six pack or bottle of wine and have one on yourself (BYO) while you wait.The patio is a great addition in the warm months, i think it might even double the seating. Service is solid, friendly and comes from the heart (family owned, I think), food exceptional and experience enjoyable. A must hit for a visitor or local!
