Maybe this type of place just isn't my scene? But I wasn't a huge fan :( Went here on a Tuesday evening around 7 and was able to find a table in the front part of the bar for 8 people - if we had come just 15 minutes later we would have been S.O.L. This place got PACKED!  The beer is good, plus they have lots of cool glasses for each beer. but, if you sit in the front part of the bar, there's no service - meaning you go up to the bar and order your drinks/food yourself. Which isn't so bad because the bartenders are pretty good about getting to you even though they are super busy. However, call me lazy? I like somebody coming to me and asking me what I want.  The food - we only tried the mussels (which everybody liked), which comes with fries (SUPER salty). We also ordered onion rings, which are more like fried onion strands - also SUPER salty. Yikes. My blood pressure can't handle that much salt. Not a huge fan of the food, sorry.
