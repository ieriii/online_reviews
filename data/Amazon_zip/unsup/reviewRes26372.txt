Mercat, how did you do it? I went for a simple summer lunch, happy just to sit outside and sip some sangria, and instead had one of the best meals ever! From the surprise of the cheese plate (apple slices and dulce de leche really contrast with the creaminess of the cheese), the divine baramundi with tiny but luscious smoked pine nuts and celery root puree to the housemade sausage (I don't even usually like sausage, but these were sublime) - so delicious! The herb-infused sangria belongs on the same celestial plane as the food - superb and then some.
