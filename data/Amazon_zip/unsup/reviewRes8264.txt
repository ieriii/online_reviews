i wish there were 10 stars for the rating system for this restaurant! this place is heaven for meat lovers and a nightmare for vegatarians. here is my break down for each star: 1. service was amazing! our table was repeatedely replenished with clean dishes, new drinks, and side dishes.  2. the filet mignon was to DIE FOR! each skewer of meat has different cuts of meat (rare, med, well done, etc) and the selection was endless. if your coaster is on the green side, the servers will offer you meat continuously! 3. salad bar was also fresh and delicious. try the pesto dressing....dont overload on the salad bar since there is much meat to eat! 4. price point for this place is affordable for what you get. in any ordinary place, you will pay over 30 bucks for a tiny flet mignon that might not be cooked to your liking. here, you get chicken, ribs, pork, lamb all on top of the filet mignon. 5. last star....have i mentioned that i loved the filet mignon yet?
