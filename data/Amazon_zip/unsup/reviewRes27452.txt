Eat here when you're having a bad day!! Topolo Margarita is my solution to all problems in life. The tequila with hints of orange and the house lemonade in a glass with salted rim will make your day. If you are gutsy try Trago Bravo, it comes with a tomato based chaser (yum!) and a Serrano chile. The simple chips and spicy salsa will instantly transport you to Mexico. And I must point out that they customize plenty of entrees for us vegetarians and unlike those so called high-end places, the portion size of the entrees is pretty large. The crispy churros are sugary, warm, comforting and the prefect way to end the meal! I didn't watch the season of top chef masters when Mr Bayless was on but, I'm now a fan :)
