We decided to try this eatery after seeing it on "Check Please". We went for breakfast but these crepes could be eaten at any time of the day. It was exceptionally good, and very fresh. Everything about the meal was surprisingly distinctive and delicious. From the Turkish style coffee and mint tea to the lamb stew with mint or basil garnish. The crepe isn't as thin as a french style but just as delicious. We each had a style that I would consider a dinner style crepe with meat and vegetables so we are eager to return for a true breakfast style filled with fruit and or ice cream. The atmosphere of the restaurant is rounded out with Algerian and Turkish style nick knacks on the walls and background music that makes you feel as though you truly are not in "Swedish" Anderson ville. The service at 8am was very attentive and friendly since we were the first ones there.
