A friend of mine and her family stayed here while they were attending a wedding a couple blocks away. They asked me to meet them to watch their little boy. They were promised a pool. I found it odd that this particular one had a pool but it was promised. There is no pool. OK, small oversight. As I got settled in, I ordered room service for myself and their child. After being put on hold for 5 minutes, I asked for a chicken sandwich (seriously, this was the cheapest thing on the menu and it was $14) and a peanut butter sandwich for the little guy. I specified 3 times to not put jelly on this sandwich.  I also ordered a glass of milk and a diet pepsi. The bill total was $44. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?? I know that hotels way overcharge for room service but you can get some decent food...this was crap. The sandwich was way over seasoned and mushy and the fries were stuck together and, again, way over seasoned. The peanut butter sandwich came WITH JELLY on hard bread. It did not get eaten. Now on to the pros... great rooms, great lobby, hip and very cool interior, comfy pillows, Bliss products, huge bathroom and cool decor in the rooms. Oh and HUGE tv. Overall, if you're in town on business, this place is super convenient... if you're in town on pleasure, stay at the W on Lake Shore Drive. It's larger and much better. Oh, and no matter what, leave the hotel and check out some of Chicago's excellent restaurants. Don't eat here under ANY circumstances.
