If only I could write a review just based on the appetizers and desserts. Five stars without a doubt - the calamari was some of the biggest and freshest squid I've ever had, and whatever magic batter they used to cook it in was working. Crab cakes were wonderful, french onion soup was delicious. The deserts were insane - I stuck with the Bananas Foster, while the rest of my table went with the pies - both pecan and chocolate. We devoured as much as we could, then passed the half empty dishes to my dad with his never ending stomach, who finished them off. Unfortunately, in between the awesome food at the start and the end of the meal, was the main course, which lacked for all of us. I did the scallops, which were tasty, but just too salty and heavy with the thick mushroom and bacon sauce that overwhelmed the dish. Other so-so reviews from the rest of the table on the pretzel crusted walleye, the ono and the pork chop. We're still planning on going back and mixing up our main entree selections in search of a more perfect meal from start to finish. Reservations are highly recommended - it's a small space, and there's really nowhere to wait when there's not a table ready. BYOB.
