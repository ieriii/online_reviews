I like this play and do frequent often, but even if I disappear for a few months, when I come back, the staff remembers me. The service and food are great. The Wings are the best around. As for people saying it's a be and be seen place, I guess you can say to each your own, you make it what you want it to be. If you want to have a fun night, then make it happen. I do not recall this place being overall crowded. Never had to or have to wait long for a beverage or a menu if I want to order food. They usually have more than a few waitresses. and depending on day and crowd up to 5 or 6 bartenders on three floors. I do wish they had more TVs on the first floor, but the space is limited, I would say it would be nice to have a large screen between the upstairs coed bathroom and the stairs going to the 2nd floor. If they had more, I would go here more for football season, more UFC fight nights and would of spent more time in there for the Hawks playoff run.  Overall I like this place and will frequent even if I move out of the area.
