I'll keep this short and sweet. I've had the pleasure of coming here well over a dozen times. The drinks are epic. I don't like thinking of myself as a trained animal, but if someone says "Violet Hour Old Fashioned" I begin salivating. Although small, the food portions accompany alcohol well and are always delicious. The decor inside feels classy and cool and any out of towners are an auto visit to Violet Hour.
