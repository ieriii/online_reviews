I stopped in after an event in Grant Park. It was a cold & rainy spring morning, so I expected a lighter brunch crowd but the place was packed inside with people waiting for tables. We had a party of 3 and ended up waiting maybe 1/2 hour for a table, so not a terrible wait. Although I don't think I would go back on a nice day between 9-12, I have a feeling the line would have been out the door and around the block. The food was good, but it was also your standard brunch fair, nothing to make it stand out from a dozen other brunch spots in the city. The portion sizes were big though which I like, so plenty for sharing or leftovers. The service was a little slow, and given that it was packed and people were waiting, I was a bit surprised by that. I figured it would be very fast so they could move people through quickly to free up tables. If I'm in the neighborhood again, I would definitely stop in. But I can't say I'll go out of my way to have brunch here. There are other spots much closer to home with the same or better quality of food where I won't fear I'll have to wait an hour or two just to get seated!
