When I lived in Chicago for 4 months back in college, my friend and I would go to the Evanston Giordano's every single Monday for 1/2 priced pizzas. We'd order a medium pizza each, eat one slice, then spread the rest of the slices over the rest of week as leftovers. Cold Giordano's pizza is probably the most amazing thing in the world. I'm surprized I didn't gain 200 pounds that summer. Came back to Chicago for a business trip recently and of course had to get some stuffed pizza. Amazing, cheesy, delicious crust, wow. Miss this place so much.
