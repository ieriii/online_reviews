Came here for dinner with a friend. I was impressed with ambiance and the filled seats on a weekday evening. I was craving seafood, so I got the shrimp and oyster sandwich. It was ok. It was bigger than I thought it would be, but overall not to much going on. The service is alright, but the food took forever. Lets just say we spent two hours at Nana's for burger and a sandwich. Dang. The prices are up there, and not much to choose from the menu of $15-$25 range. Hey but inside looks great!
