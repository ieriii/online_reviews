Like other reviews have mentioned, the roof top patio is very nice and the drinks are delicious. Thats were my compliments end however. I arrived at ~5:30 on a weekday with a friend. By the time our other friends arrived at ~6:15, there was a line outside and no one else was allowed up to the patio, despite the fact that there were plenty of open seats and it only appeared to be about half full. A manager told us there was only a 96 person limit, which had already been reached? Our friends never did make it up, they gave up after half an hour in 90 degree heat. Maybe I'll go back in a few months if the initial interest quiets down. But I find that a place that makes you wait in a line for a half empty patio for a early evening drink is more than a bit pretentious.
