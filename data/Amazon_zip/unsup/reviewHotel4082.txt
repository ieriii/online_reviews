Hotel is nice, great location, contemporary rooms. I have a couple complaints; The staff sucks something awful: Check in was a nightmare, I requested a smoking room with a king bed. I ended up with a non-smoking room with a double bed. I called the front desk with a question regarding the NYE party I was attending and got major attitude from an irritated front desk clerk. Expected more from a hotel on the mag mile.
