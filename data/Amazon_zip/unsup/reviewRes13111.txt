I went with a group of 6 and we had a good time! There fish selection is pretty big and their menu had great variety. Service was excellent and it is BYOB which is a plus. They do have their own wine and beer list as well.  As for the fish, we each pretty much ordered something different so we could try a variety of fish. I went to dinner already knowing that I wanted the Catfish, but decided to go off of the waiter's recommendation and ordered the Sturgeon. It wasn't to my liking. Tried a bite of the Catfish and it was the best dish! Should have stuck with my gut feeling. Oh well next time! Price is a little on the higher side, but it was a good meal. I may go back for the all you can eat crab legs during the weeknight...
