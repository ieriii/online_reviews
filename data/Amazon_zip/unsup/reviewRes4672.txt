I travel a lot (A LOT) and have been blessed with the opportunity to try a lot of good restaurants all over the world. I can honestly say this is the best restaurant I have ever experienced. The menu is indecipherable - but it doesn't matter because everything is spectacular! In my last 8 days in Chicago I ate here 4 times! For a foodie who normally never goes to the same restaurant twice - that is a testament to how good everything is. I ordered something different every time, and was never disappointed, or even indifferent. It is all excellent. Just close your eyes and point. Between my wife and I we tried at least 12 different menu items, and each was as good as the last. Particularly awesome are the artichoke antipasto, the pork neck spread, the whipped feta spread, the milk braised park and the turkey leg. Special mention must go out to the mixed berry pastry. It was so good we tried to order another (again - not something we would ever normally do) but they were sold out! We returned the next day hoping to have it for brunch - but alas they were still out. One can only hope that it comes back again someday soon... Apparently they have a new pastry chef, and this was her first desert. I still dream about it.
