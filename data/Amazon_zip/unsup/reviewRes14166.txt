I really enjoy stopping in at Glenn's when I have the chance. The food is always super fresh and it's one of the more reliable spots to grab seafood in the area. Some of my favorite picks are the crab cakes and Reuben sandwich... and the potato pancake is creamy, yet crunchy, and melts in your mouth! The menu is pretty extensive and I still have tons of stuff to try out. The prices seem reasonable enough to me, given the portions and freshness of their food. I have always had really friendly service and would recommend this place to anyone!
