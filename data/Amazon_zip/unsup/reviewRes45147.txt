I had a bad experience here - we had a reservation for a large group, but they kept us waiting for about 30 minutes past the reservation time after pushing it back. The waiting area is the bar, but the bar has maybe 4-5 seats and the rest of us were basically standing in a small space between the kitchen and bathroom. Not great, but we were excited about the food. Unfortunately, it was disappointing. Everything on the menu looked great, but we ended up paying a lot for very bland food. We were also ignored by the waiter for long stretches of time. There seem to be a lot of good reviews on here so maybe it was just a bad night, but I had no intention of going back after my experience.
