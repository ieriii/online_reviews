Quite simply, the most impressive space I've ever seen feature such mediocre food. The meats are smoked, though not thoroughly. The sides are about two strokes of effort short of being tasty. The soft drinks are shy on syrup. For real. We spent $150 on "bar-be-que" and had watery drinks. The service was are-you-ready?-No?-See you-in-20-minutes. The space, however, is out of this world.
