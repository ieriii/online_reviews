Easily one of my favorite places for brunch on the weekends. Tasty food with a cajun touch. The menu has many seafood options, unique omelets, and many delicious sides to choose from. My favorites are the wishbone omelet, shrimp and cheese grits, cornflake battered french toast, and the crabcakes. I've gone here a few times for dinner and it's been a positive experience, but the real pull (at least for me) is their breakfast. It gets quite crowded on weekend mornings, so go in expecting a wait.
