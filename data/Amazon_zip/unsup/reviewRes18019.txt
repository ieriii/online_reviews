Love the Bad Apple. I've been here a handful of times and have never been disappointed. All the burgers are delicious. I've had the Big Texan and the Slow Burn. I'm always torn on which burger to order. It's also nice that you can add a seasoning to the side of fries. Garlic was a nice option. The beer list is also out of this world. So many options. There are approx 20 or so draft selections. And an entire menu of bottle beers. This place is in the mix for best burgers in Chitown!
