I can't say enough good things about this place. Three of us came in on a Thursday night, and there was a wait but it was worth it. We started off with a cheese plate and the waitress was very excellent at helping pick 5 great cheeses. We also ordered: Roasted bone marrow-- amazing with the herbs Deviled egg with arugla- the arugla was fresh and spicy and the fried egg was a great complement to the coolness Sardines with lemon Vinaigrette Wagyu Sirloin Tip with Bone Marrow Vinaigrette-- seared on the outside, rare on the inside, great! The wine list has lots of affordable options and getting two bottles really was pretty affordable.
