Went on a Sat. early evening. Made a reservation for 12 and had to add one at the last min. no problem for Garcia's.  Our waitress did great with our food and drinks. Didn't have to wait long for either. I had the carne asada dinner, DELISH! My steak actually wasn't over cooked. I had a margarita and 5 sips in I could feel it! So these drinks are not watered down. I love going here and will be back!
