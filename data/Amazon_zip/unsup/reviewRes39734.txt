Yes, the service is not the best here but they make the best Korean food in Chicago and they are open really late. i love their Kalbi marinate and they give you the most panchan( it is easy to get full while waiting for your main course. Bi Bim Bop Dolsot is good if you don't feel like cooking. Their seafood pancake is very large and I only order this with a group of at least 4. I have tried all their soups and they are all really good, and I like that it is spicy but not so spicy that you can't enjoy it. I think I also like it since it is a little cheaper compare to the other one around the area.
