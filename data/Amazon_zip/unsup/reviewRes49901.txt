las tablas used to = kitschy colombian decor, large botero prints, 1 hr minimum wait on a friday or saturday, getting drunk on the wine we brought for dinner before we even sit, uncomfortable benches, waiting butts and crotches inches from your head while you eat, disappearing waiters, empanada cook didnt show up so there's no empanadas.................... the food: incredible. the food is still great but, las tablas, you've lost your heart and soul to confirm, we went on a friday night and had no wait. ...... none.
