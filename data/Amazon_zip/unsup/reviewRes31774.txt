Chicago Diner has the best faux meat sandwiches I have ever had. And I used to live in New York, so good vegan food wasn't hard to find. The Dagwood is where it's at, and just recently tried the BBQ Seitan and it was amazing. The portions are gigantic and worth the $9 for the sandwich and big side of fries. I love sweet potato fries. I've tried a few of their entrees (Enchiladas!) and was very satisfied. The staff has always been polite and accommodating as well. They believe in what they do, which is respectable. And they have delicious vegan baked goods. If you are looking for vegan food, vegetarian food, or just willing to have an open mind (and mouth?) then Chicago Diner will never let you down.
