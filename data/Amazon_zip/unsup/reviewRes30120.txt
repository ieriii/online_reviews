Rarely would I give a 5 star rating to a neighborhood bar and I find myself at a loss for words to defend such a rating. Perhaps it was the circumstances of my introduction - my friend had recently endured the loss of his father and I was getting him out of the house for a few hours in the late evening. We ran into the owner on our walk over, who stopped and hugged my friend (both he and his father were regulars). Entering, I was very happy with the fundamentals of the place - the layout, the not-too-bright lighting, the interesting-without-being-distracting background music. The beer special that night was a brew I've never tried (and I've tried many, many). The owner had called ahead - dinner was on her. The waiter took our order and, by and by, ended up telling my friend the story of the loss of his father. Again, my apologies for not having the right adjectives to laud this little spot, but I recommend it for anyone in the area. The place and people are both outstanding.
