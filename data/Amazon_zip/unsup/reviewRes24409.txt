Wow. Went here on date night with a Groupon they were offering. We managed to each get a 4 course meal (split entree and dessert) for less than $60 (even without the groupon)! Romantic atmosphere with close, cozy seating, incredible fondue, and wonderful, attentive but not pushy, service. Would love to go there again.
