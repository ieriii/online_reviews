Grunts was a Chicago staple for me and my family in the '80s, so this review is tempered with nostalgia. I've only been there two or three times in the last 10 years, but it still brings back memories, even if they have eliminated a few favorites from the menu (remember Indian fry bread sandwiches?). My girlfriend and I went last Sunday before a trip to the zoo. Parking is usually a nightmare (when the place was threatening to close the first time, part of the reason was they felt the lack of parking was hurting business), and we expected a wait, but we found a spot right away and were seated within two minutes. The place hadn't changed, right down to the trippy concert poster int he men's room. The menu was a little different, however -- I used to always come here for a burger, but my vegetarian girlfriend and my own increasing moral qualms about eating flesh prompted me to get the veggie burger, which I don't think they had last time. I got it made like a Grunt Burger, with fried onions and bleu cheese -- a good combo. Sadly, they no longer serve the Gourmet Burger, which featured a mushroom wine reduction sauce that I loved. The girlfriend got a portabello sandwich, which oddly tasted like a Whopper (a good thing). I like the homemade chips, but the portion of cole slaw is ludicrously small.  Chocolate malt for dessert, of course -- one easily feeds two. Oh, and we each had the temperature soup. Can't beat it for .52! Overall, it's probably nothing too special if you aren't going there to bask in childhood memories, but the food is good enough and the prices are decent -- our meal, soup, and malt came to less than $25.
