Delicious. I was here last week for my anniversary dinner, and it was perfect! I got there early, as I'm known to do, and ordered a glass of champagne at the bar. The bartender was speedy and very friendly. He took care of me as soon as I sat down. I like that they have TVs in the bar, so when I am waiting by myself (which I frequently am), I have something to watch. As soon as my boyfriend arrived we were seated. The decor is very romantic. Dark wood, low (but not obnoxiously low) lighting. They gave us black napkins, which was great so I didn't get white fuzz on my black pants. The prix-fixe menu is great. We both had Caesar Salad's to start. Delicious. Then I had the petit-fillet with jumbo shrimp and mashed potatoes and my boyfriend had crab cakes and green beans. Everything was fantastic. It comes covered in butter, which adds to the taste, but it is definitely not low-fat. You can order the steak with no butter on it if you want - but I think it's worth the calories for the added touch.  I don't believe in ordering anything over medium at nice steakhouses, but order your steak one notch above what you would normally get here. My boyfrend gave me a heads up, and my medium steak came out perfectly medium-rare. I'm happy he gave me that tip, the steak was delicious. The desert was nothing to write home about, but by that point we were both stuffed anyways. There was so much food my boyfriend had to take one of his crabcakes home as well as most of our sides. For $40/person plus wine it was a great meal for a great price. We will definitely be going back again.
