Wow! One of the finest culinary experiences I have ever had. My girlfriend and I were visiting a friend in Chicago when we were turned on to this place by rave reviews from our friend. The actual dining experience surpassed our already high expectations.  The food, the drink, and the service were each phenomenal and worth of high praise!  A few suggestions from the menu include: The whipped ricotta vasi with honey, the corn walnut salad, the Cacio e Pepe, the Italian Pago, and my personal favorite, the Polenta Board. This was a few months back, so I'm not sure if these items are still on the meno, but I hope for your sake they are :) Much Love to Lilly, the manager, who took great care of us and made us feel so special. Our server, Andrew, was also phenomenal. We ordered his recommendations, which were obviously impeccably chosen, Go and Enjoy!
