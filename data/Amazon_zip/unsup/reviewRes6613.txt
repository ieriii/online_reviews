My cousin has been recommending this to me for a long time, but I still ended up here by accident when Smoque was closed on a day I was hankering for BBQ. But what a happy accident! Chicago Q has a nice outdoor seating area, though a small one, with some comfy couch-like places to park it. Our server was uniquely good, one of those incredibly attentive, courteous, and knowledgeable waiters that makes you feel lucky to be seated in their section. He provided recommendations that worked out very well for us! Between the two of us, we tried the pulled pork, BBQ chicken, and the St Louis ribs. We got a variety of sauces to accompany everything (well, everybody gets that, it's not like we ordered a sauce buffet). Cornbread and fries and braised greens rounded off the meal. This place is pricey but the meat quality is excellent. Have a bottle of red wine and savor every bite. The sauces are fun to experiment with! Would love to come here next time I was in the Gold Coast. I believe the ribs and the pork were our favorite parts, though it's been a while now. But order with confidence, as everything as quite good, and trust the knowledgeable servers to lead you in the right direction if you're not sure.
