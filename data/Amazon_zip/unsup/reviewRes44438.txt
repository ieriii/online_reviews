Good location and good vibe. Sushi was delicious. Luckily, the dragon was the special roll of the day and that turned out to be my favorite. Go with the unfiltered cold sake as well. Weird fact: music in the bathroom is way too loud. Like do your thing and get out of there as fast as possible loud.
