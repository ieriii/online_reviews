Yes, 5 stars.  Let's start with the negative. It's crowded. It's hard to get a table. I've never eaten at a table here. I go solo and I snag a seat at the bar, there's usually one seat at the bar and on one occasion they made one for me. I'll start with the cocktails, because that's how I start when I'm there, with a cocktail. My first time there, the bartender was called Derek Alexander. He is a craftsman and I think he quickly understood my appreciation of craftsmen. We briefly tested each other's acumen, his as a mixer, mine as a drinker and the results were honest and honest-to-goodness cocktails. I would trust Mr. Derek Alexander to make me a cocktail anytime.  On another night, however, I tried to order some of the cocktails I had enjoyed that first visit and in Derek Alexander's absence, the barstaff was a little less sure of itself. A bit of a dissapointment. Next, for the food. A complete thumbs up. Everything I have eaten there is outstanding. Rillettes, Veal Breast, Fried Clam Bellies, the Soft Pretzel with Welsh Rarebit. Home runs, all of them. The kitchen is serious about food, real food and not scented pillows and trickery.  The Bristol and Publican have nothing on Longman and Eagle.  And Lula, my dear, beloved Lula, these guys are going to give you a bit of a run for your money. I will be forever torn between the two and I'm sorry to say favoring Longman and Eagle. I only wish a table was a little easier to get.
