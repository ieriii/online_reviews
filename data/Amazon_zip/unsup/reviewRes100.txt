I absolutely love Alinea. Alot of people argue about it not being worth the price, but I definitely think it is. I have been here twice, and the 2nd time I was a bit nervous that it would not be as exciting, but my qualms were set aside on the first bite. It truly is like anything you have ever tasted... over, and over, and over again. I did find the wine flights to be a little overwhelming towards the end, so I suggest ordering a bottle of wine. The staff is attentive and friendly, and are clearly proud to be working here. It is a theme park experience of the mouth, an event like any other, and that's what you need to realize before you dive in. Its not just dinner, its an experience. My father (who has cooked for my family for over 3 decades) put it well when I asked him what he thought. "Eating here is devastating, because I realize I'll never get to eat like this again unless I come back." Truly remarkable and unforgetable. Worth the hype.
