Loud, busy, crowded, weave-your-way-around, music-pumping, dim, trendy, wooden, hip-folks, and then make your way out to the back room to have a drink while you wait for a table. Overall, the wait not too bad for a night downtown. And then the food. Starting off with a selection of European beers on tap or something else off the extensive wine and spirits list. Small plates are meant to be shared, and so if you're an eater, you may end up with a lot of plates, but variety is the spice of life, so let's get it goin'. Roasted beets and goat cheese. Rich, great textures. Fantastic goat cheese makes the dish, with the beets giving the sweet undertones. Shaved brussels sprouts with pecorino and parmesean are tart and salty and crisp. Prosciutto bread balls came out steaming hot, less full of prosciutto than I would think, but the tomato sauce is very nice. Braised pork shoulder was tender and flavorful. A couple of winners, though. Pig ear and crispy kale, peppers, and a fried egg. Fantastic. It's like eating fancy snack food. But oh so tasty. And the turkey leg. A whole big turkey drumstick. Something is just exciting about having a whole leg in front of you. And it's good. Oh is it good. It's a fun spot.
