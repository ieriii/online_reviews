Cute! Cute! Cute! This is such a cute, stylin' boutique, chic hotel. The workers here were very polite to me and always opened the door for me when entering in and out of the building. My room was just a tad bit small, but no need to complain because my huge, King size bed made up for it. It was so comfortable. I also enjoyed the free hot chocolate that they would serve in the mornings and evenings at the lobby. Seeing the marshmallows and chocolate bits melt into my hot chocolate made me giddy. Hehe. :) Another great plus, is the LOCATION. Right on Magnificent Mile where all the good shopping and good food take place. :) I think the only complaint I have are the tiny and slow elevators that don't even have sensors. They only stay open for a few seconds, then afterwards, it'll just smoosh you as you're getting in. Although, I WAS in the elevator with Michael Phelps. So that was cool. I swear, that was him. I would definitely stay here again when I'm in Chicago.
