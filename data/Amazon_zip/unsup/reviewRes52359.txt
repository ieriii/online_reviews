Pizza, pizza, pizza... Went here for lunch and my mom and I ordered a small (four slices) with flat sausage and pepperoni. We sat at the bar so we didn't have to wait but the wait for a table still wasn't bad. Our pizza came approximately 45 minutes later and was amazing! The sausage was the best part. The pizza was saucy and cheesy. For our first time trying a deep dish pizza I really liked it. The *only* thing I didn't like was the crust, it was good just not the best I've ever tried.
