this place is a chicago landmark. it's really the only one of it's kind, completely family owned & operated. the food is very reasonable, has a mom's touch, is different from anything you can get most places and is mostly always bustling. the wait is short, as it operates like a well-oiled machine.  i think they have the best horchata in chicago. you can really taste the cinnamon & see large flecks of vanilla beans. it has a rich consistancy that makes you think you are drinking a vanilla shake. i've had many of the blended beverages and you can't go wrong in choosing all of them. i have a thing for mangos so i'm partial to the mango shake-they will make it without milk and you really don't need it. the plantains are to die for, the plate special (forget the name but it has a little of everything) gives you a taste of guatamala & is big enough to share, the sauces on the table are unique and full of heat & flavor, they have the finest vegetarian burrito i know of hands down. they use sauteed mushrooms and it works. you can eat your way through the menu and still win.  the place is pretty small, but that only makes it better. it's cozy and there's a quaint outdoor patio in their parking lot. the parking is usually easy, their hours are limited so don't expect a late night burrito or taco. they are done by 9pm. a good time to go is right after they open (11am) or late afternoon to avoid the rushes. if i had a list of 5 top "under $10" list, this would be close to the top of it.
