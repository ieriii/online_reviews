Seems like this place used to be one of the popular go to Korean places, but nowadays gets mixed reviews. We just happened to try this place the other day (the original plan got thrown out when we saw no one in the restaurant as we stepped inside). So there is a clear advantage about this place. Side dishes! There are more than 10 side dishes and they ended up not having enough space to put all the side dishes on our table. Also they actually use traditionally looking charcoal for bbqing (real Korean style). Honestly speaking the meat didn't taste as much as I expected from a real charcoal, the overall meat quality was decent. So, I think this place is a definite bargain for what you pay, and would recommend it.
