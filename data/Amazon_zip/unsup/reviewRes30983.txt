For all the hype, i thought it was just ok for the price that was paid. Here is a play by play of the dishes. 1) Devil's pot... high quality softshell crab, perfectly fried but not seasoned... i think they provide soy sauce for use, but traditionally, its more salt and pepper... I asked for salt and pepper to season. 2) Shrimp Toast and Jam. - eh, it was regular shrimp toast, 10 dollars more than a chinese take out place, served with leftover tuna bits they turned to jam.. too oily, not that great 3) Various Cocktails.- great cocktails 4) Miso Soups- way too salty... must have over reduced in the pot 5) Crispy Pata.. Pig shank fried... its a first time dish, wouldnt order it again 6) Sea Bass, perfectly cooked but the seasoning and sides were ok. Fish was of good quality 7) Some cupcake dessert. go to Sprinkles or something , not worth it
