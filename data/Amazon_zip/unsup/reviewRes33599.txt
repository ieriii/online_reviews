I give this place four stars because although the food is great, this place is small and can get so crowded to the point that you have to shout at people in your own group. It's also quite common for everyone--including the wait staff and customers--to consistently bump into your table or chairs. Not exactly what i want to happen when I'm sipping wine or trying to eat dinner. Anyway. I came here with my boyfriend and his co-worker who also brought his wife. Yes, it was crowded because we decided to go on a Saturday night, but hey...we were seated right away (we had made reservations, which I suggest highly), so no big deal. Our waitress came back three separate times to take our drink, appetizer, and then dinner orders. I felt that was a waste of time considering I was starving, but we were warned the kitchen was crazy, so ordering in intervals seemed to make sense, I don't know. We had bruschetta as an appetizer that came with arugula and I think goat cheese, which was amazing. very good and light, and just enough for all four of us. Our entrees were also good, rave reviews all around. The swordfish is recommended, and I had linguini tossed in a basil pesto sauce with scallops and shrimp. Delicious. Everything from the pasta to the fish was cooked wonderfully. They serve big portions here, so if you are a light eater like I am, be prepared to take your food home. It won't go to waste, I promise you. We did not have desert, as we were full and tired of hearing everyone else's conversation except ours. However, we eyed some sorbet at another table, and we were quite intrigued by it, so perhaps I shall save that for another visit. all in all, good food, tiny space. The wait staff is nice and quick, and I don't care what anyone else might say, I loved the food. yes, i did.
