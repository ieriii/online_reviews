Have you ever been told to wait "behind the black curtains"? Violet Hour is pretentious but I guess that's part of the appeal somehow. And fortunately, you can forgo the black curtain area and await your violet hour elsewhere - they'll call your cell. Besides the aforementioned pretension, expect an amazing selection of cleverly named signature drinks made up of a crazy slew of ingredients I couldn't attempt to define or pronounce. This place is heavy on the ambiance and also on the bitters. The soft glowy blue atmosphere and indie music make for a classy yet trendy vibe. Definitely worth checking out!
