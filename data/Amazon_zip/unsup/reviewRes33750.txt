I used to come here years ago and watched this place slip. The last time I got food from here the falafel was so so. Not sure if they do it anymore, but on sundays you used to be able to get cous-cous which I used to love. At one time I would have given sultan's a strong 4 or a weak 5, but now I feel they are a low 3 or high 2. I would head up to about 4600N Kedzie on if you want a better meal.
