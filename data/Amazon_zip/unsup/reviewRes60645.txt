Absoultely an amazing place this is one of our favorite spots to eat in the city. Food is great and priced reasonablly for the location. Service is great and friendly as well. My first time here I thought it was a little touristy but now I know why the majority of my colleagues recommend it to us. If you go you have to try the Avacado Chipolte Cheeseburger but make sure your save room for Desert
