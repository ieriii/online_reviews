I can't comment on the typical service, but I attended an alumni event here and had a fantastic time.  The atmosphere is relaxed and quiet. It's a good place to go with some friends and have a conversation over some quality wine. The staff were very attentive and incredibly knowledgable. Despite the fact that they were generally young, they knew a lot about the wines they were serving and were very good at directing me toward one that I would enjoy. I can't speak on prices since my event included free tastings all night. I will say that if you are looking for a place to host an event this would be a wise choice. Everyone seemed to enjoy themselves and the experience left me without a negative thing to say.  This may be a fairly typical wine bar, but if you are in the area it is worth checking out.
