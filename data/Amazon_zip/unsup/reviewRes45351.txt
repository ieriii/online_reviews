My parent's love to come here when they are visiting and I can see why. It is the kind of place that is just nice enough but not fancy, and has just attainable and reliable enough food for unadventurous parents. The Rosemary Chicken is awesome. And although it can be $15-$20 an entree, it is enough for at least two meals so I'd say that's fairly priced.
