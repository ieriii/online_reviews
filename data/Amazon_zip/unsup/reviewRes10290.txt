I wrote this already for a Google Review, but I wanted to get it on Yelp, as well. My fiance and I ate at Piccolo Sogno on 12/30/09 and it was a fantastic treat! I had an appetizer of ribbon pasta with mussels, grape tomatoes and basil in a creamy garlic wine sauce and, as an entree, whole seabass that was baked in a salt-crust - SO GOOD! He had a wide noodle pasta with wild-boar ragu. It was really good, but you must realize that boar is a bit gamey. All of their pasta is made in-house, and wines are Italian. The service was great - very attentive waiter who helped us pair wines with our meal. Great place.
