In terms of food at Opart Thai, my review is only for the Pad Thai and Crab Rangoon which I feel to be the best in Chicago. I have been to Opart Thai several times and continue to order the same thing. The Crab Rangoon are large and very crispy and for an appetizer it's a large portion for just one person. Also, that Pad Thai has the best taste out of any pad thai I have tried in Chicago . . . by far. Not to mention the atmosphere is charming, it's easily accessible via Brown Line and it's BYOB. If there is better Pad Thai in the city aside from Opart Thai I have yet to find it.
