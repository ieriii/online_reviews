A couple of weeks ago I was sitting at Gilt Bar on a Tuesday after work, celebrating my sister's birthday with a few cocktails (one of my favorite dark and stormies in the city) before her dinner reservations, and I recall telling her that I would go to Gilt Bar two or three times a week if I ever decided to throw it all to the wind and indulge in my favorite things all the time, instead of merely once a week. So, time for an update to my review. I can easily say that the atmosphere at Gilt Bar is unlike any other in the city. There's something pretty unique about it, and it's more than just the decor and the lighting and the bar. It's a perfect place for so many different occasions. The fact that I've gotten sudden and random cravings for its mouth-watering pastas and tasty frites and strong and layered libations at the most inexplicable times (once while sitting at the bar at Graham Elliot at about 11 p.m.) is proof of my eternal love for/obsession with Gilt. Gilt is not to be passed up or by or over. It's a must-go in Chicago; somewhere I love bringing out-of-town guests and local friends. It's so hard to resist going in every time I pass it on my walk home! Oh, and P.S.: The ice cream here is something else. Seriously. The ice cream.
