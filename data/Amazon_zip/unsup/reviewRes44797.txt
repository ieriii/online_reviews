Giordano's is fine pizza, but only merits three stars because there are so many better options in Chicago. This is the place you go if you love cheese on your pizza. Get a deep dish, and you'll get enough cheese to clog your arteries for weeks. (This is a good thing.) But if you love this style of deep dish, I think Edwardo's does it better. The ingredients there are better. Giordano's just tastes a little... bland. And personally, I'd go for Lou Malnati's or Pizzeria Due before selecting Giordano's. But Giordano's has locations all over the city, particularly in the Loop area, so it does get points for convenience. Because this location is so near Grant Park, I've ordered takeout and walked a pie over for the Outdoor Movie Festival. But seriously, if you're in Chicago for a visit, there are better places to go for your pizza fix.
