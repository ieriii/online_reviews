Southern breakfast done proper! Normally stay away from biscuits and gravy, because so few places get it right - Wishbone is one of the very few. The less common fare hasn't disappointed. Shrimp and grits is suprisingly one of my favorites (I'm not the most adventurous with breakfast). And all the basics are done just right - fluffy pancakes, eggs over easy with perfectly runny yolks, cheesy, creamy hollandaise. The lines are long on weekends, but don't be deterred. We're usually seated within 10 minutes.
