I don't think me and Caro Mio could ever break up. I mean, it would have to be pretty bad, as in a betrayal of incredible magnitude, changing from a focus on Italian to hog dogs, for example. Luckily, I have enormous faith in our relationship. The taste of the everything, from appetizers to entrees, is so good, I don't think there are many other dinners I have savored more than this place (excepting Dustin's culinary genius, of course!). Indeed, I am no chef, but I can taste fresh ingredients and this place uses 'em every time, in everything.  The service has always been more than satisfactory. I mean, who can complain about a place that is BYOB and will put the beer you aren't drinking in the cooler to chill until you are ready for more? I haven't tried all of the desserts, but the ones I have sampled are incredible. Coffee and dessert is a favorite treat of mine, but the coffee here isn't going to bring you back, it'll be everything else.  Oh, I love you Caro Mio.
