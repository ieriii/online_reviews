I'm sorry but I can't support Icosium anymore. I frequently ordered crepes to go for dinner and they have changed their price structure so that the crepes are smaller (i.e. not enough for a full meal) and yet the price is the same.  When they previously shrunk the size of the crepes they lowered the price. So we'd order two crepes per person. I was unpleasantly surprised when we ordered crepes and were charged around $50+ dollars for dinner for takeout. Won't be going here again unfortunately. They are tasty but not worth the price point.
