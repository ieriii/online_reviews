I wouldn't go back here. I tried their menu for restaurant week. It was just alright. I thought everything i tried was just blah-- the appetizer, entree, and dessert. The only thing I liked here was the decor. Actually I loved the decor. It's one of those places I'd walk past always and think it was so pretty in there, i want to try it sometime. The food was quite disappointing especially since I'd heard such good things about this place. Also, it smelled like fish sauce the moment you walked in-- gross! For what they offer (food wise)-- it's too pretentious to waste your money on. Everything is good about this place, except for the food, sadly.
