Hands down the best duck I've ever had and I've had it in Beijing. The family who owns this place are actually Cantonese and they have some improvements on this old classic and secrets for the best crispy skin. It wasn't greasy, well just the right amount. The bao were light and fluffy, not dense like some you find. Every vegetable dish was perfectly seasoned. And while she was carving the duck, the daughter of the owners told us all about how they make it, which is very elaborate. And there were 12 of us who split three ducks and there were leftovers, it was only $20 a person including drinks and bumping up the tip from the standard 15% to 20%. I will never need to drive to Chinatown for duck again.
