From what I have heard, this restaurant is legendary. After visiting, I understand why. In addition to a wonderful menu and an endearing quirkiness, the service here is 5-star. I stopped in with my girlfriend one evening and our waitress was genuinely friendly, explaining the history of the place and the little things that make the place special. Our food was great. After finding out that it was our first time visiting, the manager brought us a free dessert and chatted with us for a while. This was such a great experience that I'm almost afraid to go back and have a lesser one! But I will definitely go back. Soon.
