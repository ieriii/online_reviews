I love this place. We went for Valentine's so I feel the added ambiance was well worth the $$$.  I was hyped up thinking this thing was Brazzaz on steroids, but it's way different. The emphasis is more on that grazing tables. The sauces rock and as the waiter told us, "it's damn fun mixing and matching the flavors." Sadly, I threw out my "avoid the carbs, load up on the meat" advice and had a ton of lobster bisque.  Small plates are good since you spend time getting up to walk back to the grazing tables. It worked off (barely) all the gourmet cheeses I sampled. Damn good! The "gaucho" meats came.  Don't come here for the red meat since you'd be a bit disappointed. I did love the seafood and game meats since I still had the mindset of Brazzaz in my head. It was a great surprise.  Overall, great stuff. It won't be a place to go frequently, but perfect for special occasions.
