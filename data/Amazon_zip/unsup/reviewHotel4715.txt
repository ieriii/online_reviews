I will never stay at this hotel again. Definitely NOT worth the money. I guess the location was nice, but then again, when you're in downtown Chicago...almost anywhere is good location. Lighting was poor, walls were thin, and there was no fridge in the room, only a warm bottle of 'eco-friendly' water for $2.50. I am not a claustrophobic person, but after being in this tiny closet of a room for a short while I HAD to get out. My boyfriend and I stayed at Swissotel on NEW YEAR'S EVE and paid the same price as we did for this room...only it was a much nicer and more spacious room.
