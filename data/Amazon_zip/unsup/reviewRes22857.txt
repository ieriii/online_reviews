i was absolutely STARVING when i walked in the doors. altho there was a wait, we ran into colleagues and managed to join their table. luckily, they had already ordered food so we helped devour that while placing a few new orders. i've tried: - spinach with garlic: a chinese staple, good as always and not too oily - potstickers: just okay, a bit too thick-skinned for my taste - szechuan chicken: decent - lamb and sour pickle soup: not sour enough!!! :( - dan dan mien: YUM, totally hit the spot. i slurped those bad boys down in a couple minutes. - salt + pepper chicken: decent the only food item i was disappointed with was the soup. it was okay, but not as sour as i'm used to. other than that, chinese food totally hit the spot that night and filled me up.
