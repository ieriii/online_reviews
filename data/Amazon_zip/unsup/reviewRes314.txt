Simply put: the service and food were so amazing at Alinea I didn't minding dropping $500 on the extended menu with wine pairing. I've never said that before (and I will probably never say it again).  Alinea is definitely a "culinary experience" and not just eating out.  They even made some special new dishes just for my wife because she was a vegetarian. All in all, if you can afford it, you should make it a point to visit Alinea. I would say that you can probably just do the shorter menu and still have a great experience but like I said already, I have no regrets about going all the way!
