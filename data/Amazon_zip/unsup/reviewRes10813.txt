I went here with a friend a couple of months ago and Piece just seems like one of "those" places. Everyone was too hipster for their own good and our waiter was a Jerk. We ordered beers, the ones they "brew" themselves and are way over priced. Mine was good but my friends had an after taste that reminded me of the gorilla house at the zoo. He didn't pick it up at first but once I pointed it out, it was all over for him.  While we were ordering our waiter, that jerk, coaxed us into a large. If you have ever been here you know the large pizzas are ridiculous. When our two-top of a pizza finally showed, it wasn't all that great, not bad, but not great. We each took a medium sized pizza box full of leftovers home and I hate leftovers.
