Mayan Palace is the only former college hot spot I still frequent. The margaritas are excellent and the half off special on Tuesdays and Thursdays is an amazing deal. The seafood tacos are light and lovely and the black beans are (pork free) delicious. This place is a really good reason to make it out to Lincoln Park.
