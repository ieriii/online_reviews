I've never been to Italy, so I don't know how authentic this place is. However, it was exciting when I couldn't understand most of the menu because of the Italian words. We ordered the Bufalina pizza (mozzarella made with buffalo milk), a beer, and a Diet Coke. The Diet Coke came in a cute little glass bottle, something I'd never seen at a restaurant. The wood-fired pizza was a little over-done and had a few burnt spots, but had an excellent balance of cheese and sauce (definitely not cheesy like the pizzas I'm used to). I highly recommend checking out this restaurant!
