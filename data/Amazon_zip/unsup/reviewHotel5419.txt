What a wonderful place!! I plan on going back when ever possiable. All the room are really nice and spacious, you are denfinatly not going to a Holiday Inn. The front desk staff were so friendly and accomidating. Every time we asked for somthing they had the answer and a map to go along with it. Great place, I highly recomend it!
