I think the multitude of Yelp reviews here with convince you that The Bad Apple is just Bad Ass.  Trendy, perfectly dimmed, non-pop music, uniquely decorated, and good location? CHECK! Staff are friendly here and the beer list is moderately extensive and very fairly priced. My date mentioned his beer was priced at a more "happy hour" range. Score! Ok, let's get down to brass tacks. We all know what you come here for: the burgers. If I don't convince you, check out their online menu. There is an extensive selection of really interesting combinations here (Restoration ale sauce, brisket hash, double chocolate stout braised oxtail, fig and bacon relish, etc.) and the always amazing pretzel buns. My Red Dragon came with a very large chunk of hamburger (1/3 lb?) cooked to order, with sweet and spicy roasted red pepper sauce and an egg on top.  The fries were homemade, but tasted a little overdone. You can opt for a selection of seasonings for 75 cents extra. We tried the truffle oil seasoning, but thought it was a little weak tasting for the extra money. (I've recently had truffle oil-seasoned fries elsewhere and they were much stronger tasting and delicious, so yes, I had a comparison). Our waitress was great though, and brought out some truffle oil for us to dip in.  And, for reference, burgers are mostly $8 and $10 here with fries included. Worth it!
