Went here for lunch on a Monday and this place was dead--we were the only table in there until about 10 min before we left, one other person came in. The only reason I can think of is that the location doesn't really lend itself to the lunch crowd b/c the service was quick and friendly, sushi pieces fresh, tasty and generous, and a wide variety of rolls. I'd definitely go back. It was a little expensive, but considering the quality not out of the norm.
