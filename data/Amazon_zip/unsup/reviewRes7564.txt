Service is excellent... They give lot of attention on the service they provide.... if you want a specific type of meat, just ask and they will bring it for you.... as for the taste of the foods, it's hit or miss... there are food items that are overcooked and not pleasing, and there are food items that are perfectly cooked and melts in your mouth. Stay away from the salad bar... you are there to eat meat, not rabbit foods... especially since you are paying lot of money, get your money's worth... if you need to go to the salad bar, get the salsa, as it blends well with the meat. My favorite meats are: Bacon wrapped Beef, Garlic Beef, Top & Bottom Sirloin... stay away from pork and chicken, not worth it. Try to go for lunch, as it'll be cheaper... dinner on the weekends are $50 per person, plus tip :)
