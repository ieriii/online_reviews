"Anyone who lives within their means suffers from a lack of imagination" -Oscar Wilde. I can only love and respect naming a pub after one of the greatest playwrights of all time. Great pub. I simply love the decor, menu and fireplace. After a night of heavy drinking with my fellow yelpers in my haste I forgot my cc at Wilde. I picked it up the following day and the bartender said; "Oh yeah, your group from Saturday night has been in all day looking for their cc, phones, keys, etc." Great, I guess you can't take us anywhere nice. Great staff. And I wouldn't dream of holding Wilde responsible for a patron breaking my wrist outside. Here is an eyewitness report of the incident: "To be honest, he really wasn't a midget....just really, really short. We were outside. Then, shorty comes outside and yells, "Where are all the queers!" He somehow clipped you, and you went down. I don't even know if he even touched you all that hard. I just turned around and saw you fall down" This awful incident resulted in a distal radius compound fracture. - AKA - Broken wrist I still like it here.
