I would recommend trying this place out.  The atmosphere and the food were on point. My only negative comment is that the place was a little loud. It was somewhat difficult to have a conversation.  As for the food, I was impressed. The appetizers (mussels and the sweet & sour onion with prusciutto) were excellent and very unique. I really enjoyed the soft texture of the pearl-like onion against the firm prusciutto. For my entree, I tried the crispy cornish hen with little broccoli florets. All I can say is that the chicken was cooked to perfection and seasoned well with a delicious crispy outside. I will definitely visit this establishment again. If you are looking for an Italian restaurant with a lot of character, give this place a try.
