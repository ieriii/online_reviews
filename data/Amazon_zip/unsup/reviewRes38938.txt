We enjoyed our cocktails and the food, but wasn't wowed by the place, which we thought we'd be given it has a Michelin star. The mussels with chirizo were the best part of the meal, followed by the churro dessert. Our entrees were OK. Surprisingly busy on the summer Thursday night we went (8/2) and seemed like a longer wait than we were told. Outdoor seating was ample, which worked out for us as it wasn't a sweltering day (finally!). Wouldn't rush back, but was a good experience.
