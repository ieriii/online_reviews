My friend took me here a while ago because he met the owner's daughter and wanted to try it out. Although the romance was wasted on us, (roaming musicians) the impression was made. The food is fabulous - no better Italian food in the City for the money. I was completely shocked that a place with red leather and scary 60's decor could deliver this kind of food! Now that the smoking ban is on, the place hasimproved greatly from the smog lifting! I have taken many people here as a "hidden secret" and no one has ever had a bad experience. Order any of the veal entrees - they are sad, true, but delicious!
