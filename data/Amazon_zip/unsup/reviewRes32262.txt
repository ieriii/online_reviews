I was a sushi virgin until I went to Sunda. I am definitely not a virgin anymore. We had a fantastic server, Melissa, who made our dining experience even more pleasant. I absolutely love the shrimp/avocado sticky rice roll, and the lemongrass beef lollipops. Great spot for a special occasion or to entertain out-of-town guests.
