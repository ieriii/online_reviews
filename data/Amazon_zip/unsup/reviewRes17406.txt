My wife and I like to go here from time to time with friends or just on our own. It 's always a reliable choice when you are in the mood for Indian food. The service is very professional. The food is solid but it's not the best I've ever had...but again, it's reliable and something we like from time to time. I like the decor and it's in a lively part of the city. Check it out if you haven't...if you like Indian, you will have a good time.
