Wow. Well, we had an incredible night tonight. Given the weather outside this Sunday (ICE COLD), it took a lot to get us out. But a birthday for a friend deemed it necessary, so we did. And I am glad! Had dinner across the street at Francesca Fornos and then came here for cocktails. It rocked.We went in at about 7 pm, and even though it was freezing outside on a Sunday, the place was filling up...lively atmosphere, but seemed well-controlled by the kind woman at the door and the rest of the staff inside. We had no problem getting a seat, and spent a brief spell at the bar with a very cool guy (Kyle I think) who helped us with drinks to start while we waited for the rest of our party to arrive. The woman who sat us ended up being our server, Laura, and she was exceptional -- we were a bit intimidated by the menu at first, but she took plenty of time and care to help us with our choices, make suggestions for each of us, and answer any questions we had. Kept us happy for the (several!) hours we hung out, refilling water, bringing our food (try the Elvis -- yum!), and simultaneously manning many tables as the place filled up. I had three of the most amazing drinks I've ever had. Lady Grey was first and my favorite -- don't be scared by the egg white -- it's so good! Conclusion: I need to try the whole menu. I will be back and will be bringing new friends to show this place off to!!
