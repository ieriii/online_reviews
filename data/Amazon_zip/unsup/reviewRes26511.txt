We have only ordered delivery from here so can't speak to the restaurant itself. In short, Simply It has replaced all other Asian restaurants as our go-to for delivery. I actually crave the eggplant tofu dish. Other favorites include the chicken curry, vegetables and noodles, & chicken dumplings. You always get fresh fruit with your order and brown rice by request. Great quality and everything is perfectly cooked with just enough spice, every time.
