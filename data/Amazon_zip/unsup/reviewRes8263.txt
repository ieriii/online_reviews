This place is still fantastic! Went again this past Saturday night at 9PM and walked right in and got seated immediately. They've expanded the restaurant since the last time I've been here (a much needed expansion).  ~The Grigliata di Verdure (grilled veggies) are amazing! I love the peppers! ~The Diavola Pizza isn't as spicy as I was hoping it would be... But, you could set my mouth on fire and I wouldn't be satisfied so I'm not a good person to judge spice. ~The Tartufo is a chocolate lovers DREAM. Try it. You won't regret it.
