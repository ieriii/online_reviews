I went here for dinner one night a couple of years back, with a group of friends. The atmosphere was very laid back casual. We ate dinner on the back patio and were able to lounge around and enjoy the meal as the restaurant was not too crowded. Pretty good food. I would recommend going here if you want a casual laid back dinner/evening out.
