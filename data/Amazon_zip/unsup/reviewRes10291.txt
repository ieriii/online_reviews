They KNOW beer and pizza! Let me begin by saying that if u haven't been to a village in India, take a look at their roof... Its really cool! I tried a strong beer (dysfunctionale - 6.5%) and a pale ale (top heavy - 4%). The former had tones of orange and the latter was the perfect choice for the "Red" pizza I chose. They have 3 choices of pizza to which you can choose an endless list of toppings. The Red, comes with a rich and flavorful tomato sauce and mozzarella; the White which doesn't have a sauce but has sauteed garlic and mozzarella and the Plain which has no cheese but tomato sauce n few other things I can't remember. The pizza itself, as more than 1000 others have already expressed is perfectly done thin crust and the tomato sauce with the cheesy goodness is something I enjoyed very much and looking forward to try their other options soon.
