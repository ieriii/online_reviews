Korean marinated Chicken. Well, not exactly but it is sooo good. Their table set ups is a bit weird. I don't like to be gawked at by strangers walking by when I'm enjoying one of my naughty, guilty pleasures nor do I like to sit next to a random stranger on a long cafetaria-esque dining table. Sorry, after high-school, it's just too weird. The flavors are great and the bird is fried to a crisp (hence the name?). Speaking of their bird, it was really big. Good, solid potions are great. You know feeling like you're getting your money's worth but I had a hard time shaking that feeling like what in the world did they feed these birds? Anywho, This place is great to try.... if you're not on a diet.
