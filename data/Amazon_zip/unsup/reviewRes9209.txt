I'm going to ignore the fact that the service last night was sub par because Le Colonial is probably one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. Definitely in my top 5.  What I love the most is the decor... its very tropical, but sexy and chic. The overall ambiance is dark but comfortable; tons of palms trees and votives everywhere. So gorgeous, so romantic. Its like a little hideaway in the Gold Coast. Also outstanding is the food, French-Vietnamese, but heavier on the Vietnamese in my opinion (don't worry, you can order by number if you can't pronounce items on the menu). I recommend the scallop salad with garlic noodles - holy goodness! I also enjoy the cocktails, particularly the Mango Margarita, complete with fresh mango, served up in a martini glass. (I had one too many last night...yikes.) Le Colonial is a perfect place for any occasion - date night, dinner with your family, lunch al fresco (weather permitting), or cocktails in the lounge upstairs.
