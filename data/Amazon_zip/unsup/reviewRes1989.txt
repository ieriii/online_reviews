Everyone has pretty much covered it all... Why in the world did it take me so long to go here? I had heard about it for awhile, but never seemed to find myself in the area at the right time. But my god it was worth it! Waited a good 45 mins when I was there and we were only about 3/4 of the way down the building. So yeah, fast is a relative term. I suspect that people forget how long it was after they've eaten. Duck fat fries are amazing. Dogs/Sausages are worth the hype. I had a chicago dog (Just to gauge it.) and an Irish sausage with spicy jack cheese cubes and a special mustard. I bet I didn't even come close to getting the best one on the menu either. I just was so torn on what to get. I'm gonna have to get back again soon and start checking all the others off the list.
