I've been wanting to try this place for SO LONG...finally tried it 2 weeks ago and have been back twice since. The staff is friendly and helpful, the food is amazing and very reasonably priced. My first time here I had the Gyro with Mac n Cheeze side...I was floored. They do magical things with seitan at The Chicago Diner. The next time I went, I sampled my friend's "steak"....again, Magical Seitan, and as a lifelong meat eater, I was blown away. I'm so happy to live so close, I'll definately be back....frequently!
