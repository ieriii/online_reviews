I've been here numerous times in the last few years but only now left a review.  What can I say that everyone else hasn't?? Everything about this place screams "delicious food!" The decor and setup to the restaurant immediately let you know you are in for a relaxing time. I had the Inferno pizza and a Jamon Fume sandwich which were both excellent. In a world of butter soaked pizza crusts(ie- Lou's, etc), it's nice to have a pizza crust that is a bit plain and not soaked in grease. Deserts are tasty way to give into your sweettooth at the end of a meal.
