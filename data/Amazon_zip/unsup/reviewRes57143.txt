I went here last Friday 12/12/08 and really enjoyed the food. I ordered the Ropa Vieja appetizer which was the perfect balance between sweet and savory: sweet plantains, braised beef, spicy mayo, queso fresco. Everyone at the table tried this and loved it. For my entree I ordered the Churrasco -Nicaraguan style wood-grilled beef tenderloin which was also delicious. What I loved the most: The flavors were unique and delicious!What I liked the least: The noise--this restaurant is loud.
