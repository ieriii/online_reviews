Yum yum yum, that's what I've got to say. My husband and I finally got around to visiting Davanti Enoteca and must say we were very impressed. The decor was warm and inviting, yet quite casual feeling. We started off with drinks. Infused vodka - cantaloupe, got to say did not taste the vodka at all, it was quite delicious. Not sure how strong it truly was but a nice start. New fashioned - it was ok, definitely much stronger in taste and warmth in my belly. Now to the food: Creamy polenta w/ ragu (veal & proscuitto meatballs) - amazingly creamy and fluffy polenta. The ragu went well with the polenta and did not overwhelm at all. Due to this dish, I have learned that apparently actually does like polenta, when done right... toast w/ egg, fontina, truffle & asparagus - this was a nice dish, which my husband loved! I wasn't so impressed, it was good but not stellar as the other reviewers had raved. paste+sea urchin+ crab - absolute highlight of the dishes in my opinion. The seafood was super fresh, I could taste the distinctness of the crab yet the sea urchin creamy sea flavor permeated every single pasta strand. The chives on top was a nice contrast which helped cut some of the richness of the dish. Definitely hit my seafood spot davanti burger - my hubby's absolute fave, with the bacon jam & roasted garlic aioli. We had ordered the burger medium rare, and it was prepared perfectly. I noticed that from the reviews I read there wasn't much if any mention of dessert, which we had also ordered (vanilla gelato, chocolate hazelnut mousse) were good but not as impressive as the main meal. All of the above + a bottle of wine ran to ~110...but we definitely indulged since we wanted to try everything, and it's been a fairly crazy week...so lets just say our beverages made up half the bill....well worth it though. Definitely going back for more!
