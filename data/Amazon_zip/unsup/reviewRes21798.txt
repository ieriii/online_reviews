everyone loves xoco, we wanted to love xoco ,, but sadly it was not meant to be. our complaints don't have anything to do with waiting -- we were seated in less than 10min. it was the soups.. we ordered the seafood with red chile broth and the chicken pozole. both came out hot and steamy promising many tasty feelings in our future. but one taste of the pozole and our dreams were dashed. the broth was watery, the dried oregano sprinkled on top was overpowering, the lack of flavor depressing.. we still had high hopes for the seafood broth but after 3 bites, one including half cooked potato chunks, we noticed it too was bland. the giants shrimps were yum,, but the broth just did not deliver. we also tried the special torta - goat meat, avocado, pasillo salsa. the goat was so tender, the avocado fresh but thats where the flavors ended.. leaving as again thinking ,, really? did we just come on the worst day ever?? all this went down as we sat in the highway between kitchen A and kitchen B.. the staff was carrying cargo loads of food, containers, and huge pans filled with boiling water (aaaah traumatic burns anyone!!) in the narrow space next to our table. huuuup. things that didn't suck for us : the guac (yum, even with the hella salty chips),, the churros -- hot and fresh, crispy and rolled in sugar. and of course a guest appearance from rick himself :)
