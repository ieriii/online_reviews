My husband & I went there last friday night (day after Thanksgiving) with another couple for their anniversary. I only (yeah, only, ha ha) had the salad bar, everyone else went for the meat. Our server, Anna, was great! The wine list was expansive & we loved watching the wine 'angel'. The salad bar had more than enough for a large meal, everything I had was very good. They even had a few hot items, like fish in coconut sauce, yum. The meat was coming at our table from all sides when the cards were green - everyone said most meats were great, but a couple of items were not that good (the sausage). My husband said if we went back he would skip the meat, it was just too much food, when the salad bar was plenty.
