Food was very good... wine was, too. I had a seafood pasta dish and the seafood was plentiful. Only complaint would be the service. Our waiter was new (I think) and we had two different managers scurrying around our section trying to help him. We had one manager take our wine and app order then come back and take our meal order before we even spoke to our waiter. Then, after our meal, a different manager took our check... I don't think the waiter knew what we ate or drank or when we left. He was overwhelmed and shouldn't have been working a busy Saturday night shift. The place and food were nice enough to give it another shot.
