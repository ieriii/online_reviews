I stayed at the W lakefront location. We arrived at about 5 p.m. and the lobby was just picking up. I must say the lobby is beautiful; flowers everywhere, lounge area with low sofas, a bar and resturant. I stayed in a "Marvelous suite" (room 2818) that had a great view of Navy Pier and the beach. It was a little foggy that night but as the fog lifted the view became even more spectacular. I brought my own booze and had some friends overl. There was a screaming baby across the hall for about 2 hours. I was worried some whore of a mother dumped her kid in the room and went to the bar. I called security but I dont know what happend after that.  My guest and I were having a blast and we turned the volume on the XM radio high.  At 12:40 security came to my room and said "anyone not assigned to the room must evacuate!" It was a little loud so my guest left :( Everything that night went pretty smooth, but when I called for my free breakfast in the morning I was rudely asked "Why would it be free?" from the hotel staff. I reserved the room with a 3points+ program that gives me triple room points and breakfast in the morning. I told him to check the reservation and he put me on hold. 5 minutes later he picks up and says he's only going to comp. 2 EGGS AND A OMLETE! "Thanks, I'll go to McDonalds" was my response. I mean come on, don't you think breakfast should include juice and toast?! Well at check out I brought this up and the lovely front desk agent and she credited $50 and apologized for the breakfast fiasco. So on Monday I review my charges and there is OBSCENE amounts charged to my account. I called the accounting dept. and the accountant was extemely apologetic and helpful. That was all cleared up after about 2 days and now, to restore my faith in the W they offered a free room. The hotel is beautiful, just watch your account activity after you leave. If you have any problems I am confident the administrative staff will help you out.
