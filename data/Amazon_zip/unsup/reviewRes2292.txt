I went to Hot Doug's with my good friend Windy City Roller Nina Millimeter on my wedding weekend, and I had the Mole Chicken Dog with Mexican Cheese on it. It was spicy, savory, salty, and totally delicious -- and, to use my Aunt Caren's word, "Tongue-asmic!"  Seriously, it was the best tasting thing I've had besides my wedding cake the whole time I've been in Chicago, and it managed to wipe away ALL the stress of the wedding planning AND staying with the in-laws for 2 weeks. Doug is a culinary rock star, and his cased meats make my heart sing!!!
