I went here yesterday since my one of my girls works in the area. Thumbs up on the decor inside and out! I went in and the atmosphere was very comfortable, lots of families and even some hipsters. I had the Flautas with picadillo (ground beef) with Ranchera sauce on top. Me I love all things sweet so I enjoyed the sweet Ranchera sauce. The Flautas was nice and crispy but the rice served with it was meh. The price was right though! Overall great place for after work. And its apparently BYOB?! I'll be back...
