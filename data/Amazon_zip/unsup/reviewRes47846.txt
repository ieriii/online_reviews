I went here for the second time in two months last night. I absolutely love this place. If you like meat and love food, this is the place for you. The Harvest table has great choices for appetizers while the meats & seafood that come out are to die for. I went to Brazzaz about a month ago and it did not compare. I will be back once again when my wallet can afford it!
