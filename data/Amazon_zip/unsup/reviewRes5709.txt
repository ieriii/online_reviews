Came here on a Thursday night and the wait was about 1 hr. Being in town for only a few days, we had to wait it out. A storm was hitting and the patio roof did have some water drips, but that did not distract from the food. The order: bone marrow, pork shoulder, pigs ear, sweetbread, pork fat almonds. My favorites were the sweetbread and pork shoulder. The sweetbread had good flavor with just the right amount of crunch to balance the soft sweetbread. The pork shoulder was classic fall off the bone tender. Surprisingly, the almonds also had really good pork flavor. I have to say, even though the place was super busy, the waitstaff was very attentive, answered all questions, and gave suggestions. Even when packed, this place is a very comfortable environment to enjoy good food and chat. Overall, all the dishes were good (though not spectacular) and I will return when in town again. -1 star because I thought I would be wowed by the food, but maybe my expectations were too high.
