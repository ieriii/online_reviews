Ok, in Miami, we don't have much of a selection of Greek food and the closest thing to eating anything authentic is attending the Greek Orthodox church's festival. Since the Greek festival was this weekend and I am new in town, we decided to go. Out of a whim, my husband picked this restaurant for us to eat so we can sit down with our son. Great choice! They have on their menu a couple of grouped items so that you can try a little bit of everything. It includes appetizers, salad, entrees, dessert and coffee ($20 pp). The food was great. The service was attentive even to my son. I had a great time. I'm loving Chicago more and more by the minute!
