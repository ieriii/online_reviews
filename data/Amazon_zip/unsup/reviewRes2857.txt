Took my girlfriend there because she had always wanted to go. The service was very on point. I almost felt like they bugged the table because every time we mentioned something to each other that we wanted someone would come along and give it to us. You go to the bathroom and when you come back they are waiting to tuck you back into the table when you sit down. The service is just completely different from most every other fine dinning restaurant I've been to. We both had the Prix Fixe menu that was not the most expensive but the one in the middle of the three. The food was very unique, very good. For the dessert they let one of us get the Prix Fixe dessert and one of us get the cheese but I don't think they like doing that.  Anyway, definitely something to try and your girlfriend will have something to brag about at work for a couple weeks. Just know that you will spend about $400 or more and that is conservative
