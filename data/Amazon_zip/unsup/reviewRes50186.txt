Love the fried green tomatoes, fried okra/pickles with green goddess dipping sauce, best crawfish etoufee ever (the red tomato not icky brown sauce version) & amazing black walnut chocolate tart with salted caramel and smoked buttermilk ice cream. Oh, how could I omit the warm cornbread muffins with honey butter???
