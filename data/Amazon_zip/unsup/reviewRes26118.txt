Killer food. I'd never had vietnamese food before I stumbled across this gem. Everything is always super fresh. The mango coconut beef served in a coconut shell is delicious and very well presented. The Simply It! Beef just melts in your mouth. King Crab pasta is awesome. I could go on and on. Basically I've tried at least 12 different items on their menu and I would order every single one of them again. Everything is very reasonably priced, with the Lunch specials being an absolute steal. Try their Vietnamese sandwiches (i had the beef, so tender and flavorful) and you will not be disappointed. The owner, who is there every day and answers the phone every time I order delivery or take out is the nicest man you will ever meet. He's always very friendly and makes you feel like you're a guest in his home. If you haven't yet, go to Simply It! You will absolutely love it!
