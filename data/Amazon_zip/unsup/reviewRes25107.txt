Cute and comfortable cafe, perfect for amazing desserts after already stuffing oneself at The Parthenon. We'll vouch for the lemon curd tart and chocolate eclair - both perfect in flavor, texture, consistency, and appearance. None of that weighty fake filling. And even the water is served in little goblets for a little touch of class. Server was sweet and did not rush us, even though we lingered afterward. However, she could not divide the check - odd, but don't know if this was for lack of mathematics talent or computer capability. The restrooms are in the back, a little hidden; the women's restroom was clean except there was quite a bit of water on the floor.  There is a large, open middle area and smaller lower and upper levels, all with cafe-style seating. Besides desserts they serve sandwiches, soup, teas, and such - and have a bakery with beautiful treats - plus they offer boutique-type items for sale. Everything is, well, like eye candy. I'm going back to pick up a gift book on Greektown (which I did not buy on purpose during this visit in order to have a valid reason to return so soon!).
