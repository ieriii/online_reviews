This place is as cute as a button--just like its name. Good coffee served in a nice large ceramic cup. I love it when a place uses real dishes instead of disposable ones. Great oatmeal with walnuts and dried cherries--though I could have used a little more brown sugar. The giant pancakes on the table next to us looked delicious. Cozy little place to read the paper and enjoy a slow breakfast.
