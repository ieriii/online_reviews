food was ok. there was absolutely nothing special to it. typically a meal i could get at a dennys or ihop. service was lacking as i had to ask my waitress twice for my orange juice and when i needed a refill on water, she could not be found. space is nice and huge and able to accommodate large parties... but the wait is unbelievably long. huge waiting line in front that spilled out onto the sidewalk. highly suggest getting there early.
