If there was a negative rating system, I would use that. The valet practically pushed me out of the car, and then squeeled my tires as they pulled away. When I mentioned this to the host, they didn't seem to care. The waitstaff was pushy and rude and seemed to be preoccupied with other stuff that must have been more important than his job. The food wasn't cut very well and the seafood smelled funny(I didn't eat it for that reason). The drinks were rediculously overpriced. If you were unfortunate enough not to get a booth, you got crammed in next to complete strangers. I know that the only reason they serve fondue is because of health code violations in the past and they weren't allowed to cook food there anymore. What a joke, I will NEVER reccomend this place to anyone unless they want to get ripped off. I felt like I was in a dungeon having raw food thrown at me with annoying crappy guitar music (the guitarist needs lessons BAD).
