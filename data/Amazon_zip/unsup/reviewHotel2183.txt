I stayed at the InterContinental for three nights, I have to admit, if it wasn't for the fact that I booked through Travelocity, which means no adjustments, I would've checked myself into another hotel after the first night. Front desk lady was very friendly however that was the extent of good customer service. I got to my room, waited 45 minutes for my luggage (I only had one); The Mini Bar was missing in my room so I called the Concierge and was told there will be one coming my way. After nearly an hour and a half, I called the front desk to cancel the Mini Bar delivery b/c it was approaching midnight. The lady simply just said "Kk."  I believe the phrase she was looking for was: "I'm sorry, I'll get that ready for you right away." Ordered room service, was told the food would be ready in 30 minutes or less, waited over an hour; again, no apologies from the staff. The best thing about this hotel is the location. It's right on Michigan Avenue, close to lots of shops, restaurants and convenient stores. There's a Nordstrom & tons of other shops right across the street; a Walgreens adjustment to the hotel; Grand Lux Caf & Joe's Seafood/Steak restaurant is two blocks down; Fox & Obel grocery & caf is four blocks behind the hotel; Bank of America is right across the street; the hotel is within minutes of walking from many attractions; not to mention there's a Starbucks downstairs. Even though the hotel itself was nice as previously stated, but the rooms are very small (standard sized room), you can barely get the room service cart in through the door! Lack of toiletry. Most importantly, given hotels are supposed to be about hospitality and customer service, I'd have to give my experience a three star and I believe that's plenty generous.
