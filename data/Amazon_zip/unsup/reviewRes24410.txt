Tried this place for the first time and really enjoyed everything we ate. The green salsa in a bottle is awesome and has a bit of a kick. The spinach and cheese empanadas are great. We had talapia tacos, veggie tostadas and tacos that were great as well. Guacamole was mild but very tasty. They have a large delivery area as well and the prices are very reasonable. Service was friendly and fast. It is BYOB and cash only.
