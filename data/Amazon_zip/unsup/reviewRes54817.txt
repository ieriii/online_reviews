Overrated and disappointing. I ordered the traditional eggs benedict. What they call Canadian Bacon was a quarter inch slab of dense, flavor-free pork product, which was rivaled in rubberiness by the incredibly resilient English muffin underneath. No wonder they gave me the biggest steak knife I'd ever seen. Sauce was bland. Sides were tasteless. Even the orange juice seemed weak. My friend's omelet was equally disappointing, and three quarters of it was left untouched. Service was OK.
