Bone marrow. Fat. Yummmmmmmmmm Food here is awesome. Seems like there is a copycat trend going around and I dunno who was first, but between Purple Pig, Publican and Gilt Bar they all have bone marrow and pork belly. And try as you might, you're like a moth drawn to a flame - if it's on the menu, you gotta get it! Everyone mentions the speakeasy theme - I like it, though it is a bit dark, and the bar is a bit small...and you might have to wait awhile to get your specialty cocktail made...but like Heinz, the best is for those who wait. For those who like 'em strong, the Sazerac is great for a try...even comes with some absinthe. We ordered a variety of things to share: Bone marrow - it's good. it's fatty. Not a lot, but easy to scoop out, and it's great on toast. Steak tartare - also good on toast, probably could have used a bit more quail egg or a runnier quail egg for more flavor, but great with aoli and siracha adds a nice twist Truffle pasta - it's truffled! Like bacon, everything goes better with it Pork belly - Above average in my opinion, good for American cuisine, but Chinese people do this dish best. Fries - Fantastic, tastes like the fries you get in Europe with mayonnaise. Gilt Bar is a trendy place and we were definitely underdressed (maybe due to the after work crowd), but the hostess and our server were very nice and courteous with us, no air of attitude whatsoever. It's great for small groups so you can order the entire menu. Be sure to drink lots of water though as these dishes that inspire gluttony while tasty are high in sodium and oil. Reading Max M's review, I think I'll be back to try the ribeye.
