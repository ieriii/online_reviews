I kind of got a Sam I Am thing going- I don't eat ham (green or otherwise) BUT I did the night we went here and sweet jesus was it good. Really all the food we sampled that evening was excellent. It's pricey-which is fine for the quality- BUT the Beer list is a bit absurd- I don't need a 20 dollar beer no matter how wonderful it is. I was drinking some 7 dollar beer, (can't remember what it was) and it was quite good, but I'd have been fine with a Bud or something.
