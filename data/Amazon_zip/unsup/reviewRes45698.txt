Been here a bunch of times and I must say I have had some really good times here, the food is really amazing and the craft beer selection is top notch but expensive in my opinion. There late night menu while still good is nothing to write home about but the dinner menu is to die for, the chef does a good job balancing the flavors of each dish and the waitstaff is usually good with pairing wines and beers with meals. I will defiantly be going back soon!
