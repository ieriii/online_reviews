I love any excuse to head up to Andersonville, so when my friend suggested heading to a crepe place I was easily sold. I've eaten dessert crepes all over the place, and I've enjoyed many crepes at La Creperie so I figured this would be something I've tried before. I was pleasantly surprised by the differences. First, the place was pretty empty so we had zero problem picking out a table of our choice (I'm very into booths). The waitress came by a couple of times to check on us, and didn't seem annoyed that we were taking our sweet time deciding. I finally went with creating my own crepe: mixed greens, avocado, caramelized onions, and bell peppers with muenster cheese and their house sauce. It was definitely tasty but I wasn't blown away. The crepe was almost rolled or folded, instead of being more like a fancy burrito (which is what I was used to). Also typically crepes are oozing with melted cheese with the other ingredients floated among it, but this was much heartier. The crepe itself was sweet but not over the top. I only ate about half of it and was pleasantly full. Another fun addition: the crepe comes with a cup of soup. I am not a huge fan of soup in general, but their vegetable soup was amazing! I have been thinking of calling this place up and trying to trick someone on the staff into giving me the recipe.
