OH yeah. Where shall I begin...well their patio is amazing. You definitely need to eat your food outside and enjoy the nice weather. Their service is pretty awesome. Our waiter was super nice, funny, and informative. I would just go back for the awesome service. But of course the food is quite amazingly amazing. I ordered the lechon sandwich with congris. The meat and congris were a little dry, but the flavors were pretty good. The tostones are really good, especially with the garlic. Definitely is a must try!
