This place was pretty hyped up before I went...here's the rundown: The atmosphere was great, I love the diner theme...not too big, classy interior. The staff was attentive and pleasant, recommending the sablefish which was delicious...albeit a little small for $20 but oh so flavorful. Could they spare more than two roasted red skins split in half however? The clam chowder was excellent, however I'm not too keen about eating soup out of a coffee cup...we don't need that much schtick. The only beef I have, after spending $10 on a six pack of Corona at the beer nazi next door, is paying $5 to use a bottle opener. Listen, I've been in this city for 5 years and have never paid at a BYOB, let alone a BYOB that actually does serve alcohol! Sorry, but that just isn't going to fly.
