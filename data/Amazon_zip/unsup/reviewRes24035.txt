Really good food, service is great but ordering the hot pot meal is confusing as hell! Apparently its a charge of $16.95 per person no matter what if u want the hot pot. No way was I going to pay 80 dollars between the 4 of us at the table. Though I got it for 38 dollars one time just for 2, but the lady couldn't explain why we couldn't get the "for 2" amount and share it amongst 4 people. So confusing. Other than that I can't really complain.
