I thoroughly enjoyed my food and wine at Sunda. I'm hesitant to bump it up to five stars because I thought our waiter could've been a lot better. At a place like this I would expect a personable waiter armed with suggestions, but we had to pull information about the menu from him, and with a menu this big we would've welcomed the help! All other staff (and there were a lot) were super friendly and accommodating. Although I've only been to Nobu once, the menu seemed reminiscent of theirs, which I loved! Anyway, here's what I tried: - Honey Walnut Tempura Rock Shrimp: quite tasty, big portion (very unhealthy!) - Spicy Tuna on crispy rice: perfectly spicy, and the crispy rice added some excitement to a standard dish - Firecracker Roll: good roll, but nothing you can't get at any other sushi joint in the city - Jalapeno yellow tail: AMAZING - buttery fish and great accompaniments I can't wait to return and try more, and hopefully I'll have a better waiter next time!
