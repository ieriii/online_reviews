I don't generally crave specific foods, but this is a HUGE exception. I've tried almost everything on the menu but I usually get the falafel--extra spicy--and maybe some of their baked cheese and egg bread. Maaaybe some lentil soup. Everything is amazing. If I have people in town visiting I make sure to bring them here..it has never disappointed!
