This restaurant is so overrated that it is laughable!!! My friend and I went there last night and first of all the service was horrible. The bus boy (teenager) slung the water in the glasses and plopped the bread on the table. Then after about 20mins I had to get up from my table and ask this same disinterested bus boy if there was an actual waitress. When the waitress finally does come over she too is less than customer focused. We had to ask her about the specials of the evening. Eventually, two salads are placed in front of us that had lettuce on them that was older than the homeless guy's underwear standing on the corner. I had the Spinach Ravioli Gorgonzola Pesto Sauce it was okay more pesto than ravioli's. My friend had the Fettuccini A Mare Chiaro it was soup and the calamari would have been okay if we had thought to bring along a microscope. This restaurant is relic of the 50's and one I do not need to be reminded over i.e. no need to preserve for historical reasons. Perhaps if you are not a regular they treat you like *$&$(*$& so you don't come back. It worked! The only good thing about the restaurant was that it did not smell like urine and the Maitre d had a really nice custom made suit hmm!!! For those of you that love this place God (or somebody) bless you but we hated it. Bon a petite!!!
