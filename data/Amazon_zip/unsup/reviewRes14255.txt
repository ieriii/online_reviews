(Back in January, I set out on a road trip from the Twin Cities to Toledo, Ohio. I decided to make it a culinary trip, visiting six restaurants between St. Paul and Chicago. I tweeted reviews at the time in 140 characters or less, but here is a more extensive review) "Small eating area. Impressive plantain sandwich. Soild empanadas. Strong cafe cubano. Friendly service. 4.5/5" After being stuffed four times today, I picked up my friend at O'Hare and we went to search for dinner. Well HE searched. We initially stopped by Kuma's, hoping the crummy weather would keep people away. No sir, the wait was 3.5 hours even with the rain coming down outside. Wow. That's okay, I had another place in mind. Today was a day of culinary firsts for me (historic boxcar diner, Norwegian lefse, German weiner schnitzel, limburger cheese) so I was hoping to try my first cuban food. And I had heard about 90 mile, and it was nearby. Was it fate? We almost missed it when we drove by the first time. Wait, this little corner building was the epicenter of cuban food in Chicago? Something must be wrong here ... We walk in, and there was a couple people ahead of us. There was just six or so stools lined up around the back of the building. Very small indeed. The menu had a decent selection of authentic cuban food. I settle on a sandwich I had heard about where the white bread was replaced with plantains. Oh my goodness, what a great combination. My friend got empanadas which we shared. Solid tasting. I also had the cafe cubano which was nicely strong, enjoyable. While we were waiting for our food and eating, we saw activity pick up. This location was busy for deliveries and pickups, we were the only ones to sit and eat. At one point there were over twenty people waiting for food inside. I don't know how they do it and not get overwhelmed! But I can see why the place is popular, even though it don't look like much from the ouside. Amazing food. Amazing find. Totally unexpected.
