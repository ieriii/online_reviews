Was here yesterday for lunch. Can't say I'm a huge fan of this place. On the plus side - valet parking for free (but please tip your valet). Nice atmosphere. The people seem friendly and willing to help if you could find them and they spoke English. Our table ordered saganaki - very good. Calamari - I didn't taste this but the rest of them loved it. They also loved the lamb ribs (didn't even know these things existed). The service was terrible. I asked for vegetarian moussaka and as soon as the plate was put in front of me, I saw meat on it. I asked him to take it back which he did. I had asked for it to be vegetarian twice in my order. He brought me out my veg moussaka which was pretty decent but certainly not the best I've ever tasted.. Then he disappeared. One lady at the table asked for anchovies. They were a long time coming. The box to put in leftovers was long time coming. The check was a long time coming. You get the idea. We chased down someone else to give us these things. The restaurant had only about 5 other tables - so it wasn't a rush hour issue. I've been to Roditys and I like it there fine. This place, not so much. I think going family style is the key in this place. I will say, in their favor, they have delicious eggplant appetizers. Will I go back? Maybe to give them another chance, but personally, I don't find the lack of service very appealing.
