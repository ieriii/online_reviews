After an hour of yoga, sweating and stretching all those narsty toxins out (or whatever)...a friend and I decided we were hungry. I've been wanting to go here for a few years now! I'm so glad I did. This is probably the best food I've had for so cheap. I got a falafel sandwich, even though I wanted rice. (It was close to closing time so I had limited selections but wasn't unsatisfied, since it was so good.) My friend had a fish sandwich? I'm not even sure, but whatever she had she liked it. And I had nice distractions during our conversations - meaning i liked the decor. Some things to keep in mind: 1. It's cash only. Which is bad news for people like me who hate carrying around cash. Erg. 2. I went back maybe two days later around noon. They weren't open, so apparently the times on yelp are wrong. I was tres triste. =[ *tear* Anyways, go...NOW. You will love it. =]
