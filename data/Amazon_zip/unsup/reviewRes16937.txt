If you want something convenient and downtown, hit up India House...almost as good, definitely pricier, but easier than the hike up north to devon. Faves are palak paneer, chicken tikka masala, channa masala, alou ghobi, chicken tandoori, samosas...etc. I ADORE their kheer...it's essentially rice pudding w/currants & cashews. We cater them all the time for lunch, and have never had an issue.
