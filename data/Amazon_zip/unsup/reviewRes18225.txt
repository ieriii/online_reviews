Truly amazing! I won't rehash what's been said more eloquently by others, but: - the calamari is on the short list for the best i've ever had; perfectly cooked, not over breaded (so often the case), and incredibly fresh and flavorful - the gnocchi special is indeed a thing of beauty, catch the fever! - my stepmother's lobster mascarpone ravioli were amazing; she saved the sauce separate from her leftovers to use on some pasta at home - both the lemon and chocolate tartufo desserts were simply stellar; if they weren't out of the tiramisu I would have loved to have tried that, but I do not feel like I settled by any stretch BYOB, etc., all great, can't recommend it enough, esp. for a great date. Try it for lunch, they have all the same specials but they drop the price.
