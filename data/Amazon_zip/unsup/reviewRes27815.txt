Genuinely hot salsa without a lot of sugar in it--hallelujah--and extremely cheap food. After coming here for nearly 30 years and sometimes being really happy and sometimes just dealing with it, I think the secret is to stay in the easternmost room where the lighting is softer and the vibe is more cheerful. The booths by the window rule. As do the cheese enchiladas with mole sauce. It's especially pleasant on quiet week nights--can get raucous on weekend evenings. The liquor store next door is civilized and affordable and had something decent with a screwtop in the cooler.
