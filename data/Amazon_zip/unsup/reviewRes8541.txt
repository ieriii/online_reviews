An article in Time Out is what brought us from the Wicker Pk/Bucktown area to Spacca Napoli. After our drive, I was looking forward to sharing some amazing pizza with my boyfriend and our good friend (it was her bday). It was an extremely busy night, so our wait was over an hour. Our stomachs didn't like that much, but they gave everyone a bit of wine to soothe the mind. A nice gesture. By the time we got to sit down, we were anxious to order anything! It took about a good 10mins+ before I stopped someone to ask, "Who is our server?" The man quickly grabbed utensils, etc and took our app. orders. I got the caprese, which was very good. Everyone else enjoyed their apps as well. We were still uncertain of who our server was. After the appetizers, noone had returned, so we asked the owner who our server was. I believe the person he appointed to our table was one of his sons. This guy didn't seem enthused in the slightest. Instead, we were all pretty sure we took him away from what he liked doing best -Gawking at the customers. I'd have to say, for being a 'gourmet pizza server,' a simple job, this guy failed miserably!! On to the pizza. I expected OooOoos & Ahhhs & several Yummss. But nothing. All 3 pizzas were OK at best. Nothing to tell your friends about. Just one of those places you go to once and leave feeling like you won't be back. After all the time waiting, the terrible service and the hope that this would be the most extraordinary pizza that ever arrived in Chicago, we were all greatly let down. I'll stick to Homemade Pizza or Crust in Wicker Park.
