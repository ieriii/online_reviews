The food is alright and that's it. It's not bad. It's not great. It's just alright. It's cheap. That helps. But it's still just alright. The workers are alright. Not super ultra awesome, but not bad. The decor is alright. Nothing special. There's a buffet, I think. It looked alright. My falafel was alright. My review of the restaurant? Hm. I guess it's alright. I don't get the hype, I know a lot of people that really really enjoy it, but I am mostly unimpressed. I wouldn't pick this place to eat at again but it wouldn't be bad if someone else wanted it. Well, whatever, I guess.
