The only place in Chicago where you can get amazing deep dish pizza. So many people raved how great Chicago's deep dish was and I tried so many places and they all dissapoint tremendously.  I was especially peeved at Giordano's... probably the most over-rated food place I've ever been to... See Art of Pizza is amazing even for a thin-cruncy-crust lover like myself. The cheese is so gooey and melts in your mouth and doesn't taste like the bland processed crap they put into Giordanos. I've put many friends/co-workers to the challenge of finding me pizza that was not mediocre at best and they all fail with Chicago's horrible deep dish.  The only place you can get delicious Chicago deep dish is Art of Pizza.
