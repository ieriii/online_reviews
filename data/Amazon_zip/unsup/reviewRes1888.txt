I never really ate hot dogs until I moved to Chicago. Even then, they always seemed a little...lame. They weren't a real food, not very tasty, so on and so forth. Then along came an office outing to Hot Doug's. I was assaulted by the sheer amount of choice available to me, ranging from the type of dog ("encased meat", as they call it here), to various toppings for the hot dog. All of it is delicious. The restaurant is exactly as you'd think it would be: loud, obnoxious, and altogether lovable. You'll wait in line for a bit to get in, but it's worth in the end. I really wish that I'd know about this place when I still lived in the area.
