Being born on the east coast and moving to Chicago in my 20s, I was in desperate need of thin crust pizza. Piece totally took care of my needs. Their toppings and sauces vary offering clientele different options every time. The shape is not round, nor square, but an organic oval shape. SOOOO GOOOOD! Every time I am in town I make a point in my schedule for my fix. The table wait is usually obnoxiouslly long, but totally worth it. Piece also brews their own beer and offers a full bar in which you can relax in during table wait. They also have great events such as live band karaoke, football nights and holiday parties.
