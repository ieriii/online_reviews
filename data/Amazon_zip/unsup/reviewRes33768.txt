Oh dear, I hate coming to such a great place and then ordering what turns out to be an almost inedible dish. I mean, don't get me wrong, it was delicious, but after a couple of bites I was simply stuffed. And I'm not a pick-at-your-salad kind of girl; I have an appetite that puts all my guy friends to shame. What did I order? The banana french toast with peanut butter. I thought it was going to be banana-flavoured bread... but it turned out to be huge, chunky slices of banana CAKE. Well I mean, it was banana bread, but the density and sweetness of the dough made it more reminiscent of cake. The taste was mind-numbingly sweet and dense and I enjoyed the two bites that I had, but after a minute or so I felt like I had bricks in my stomach and could only wheeze my way out of there. Damnation. But aaaanyways, I'm giving this place 4 stars anyway because everyone else's orders were f*cking delicious. Our server was fantastic and such a patient, patient man. We had a party of six, and all of us were indecisive morons, so I have to give our server kudos for not tearing out his hair in front of us. He even exchanged our coffee for a fresh pot when we complained that it was stale... and he did it with a winning smile. Guess who got an extra big tip that day?
