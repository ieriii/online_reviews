Top drawer/ Best pan pizza around. I went to the location in Niles when I was a lad, and now I go to this one. They are consistently good. Fast service, had to make the 630 movie, walked in at 540, food came out quick. DO get: Pan pizza with garlic, basil and extra cheese. Do not get: liquor. I got 4 shots, 2 beers and a small pan and the total was $65 without tip. DAAAMN! I was feeling splurgy since it was my mistresses bday. Gotta spoil em. REAAAALLY good pizza dough, (DID YOU CATCH WHAT I DID THERE?) my favorite in the city. The crust is amazing. I want another right now. No pool tables. But full bar, with Makers neat = 2.5 fingers.
