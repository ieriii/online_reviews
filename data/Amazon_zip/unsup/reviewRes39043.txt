There isn't that much that puts this restaurant ahead of any other in the Logan Square neighborhood. The food is really good, maybe a bit overpriced, but the service (our waiter) needed an attitude check.  The least you can do when spending $100+ for lunch/dinner is say "your welcome" when you drop off drinks at your tables. Smile, you may receive a better tip. Presentation - beautiful. Food- good. Service - not so great. I'm still not sure why this place is so popular. Overrated. if you go, go for the cocktails and then head to Telegraph to eat.
