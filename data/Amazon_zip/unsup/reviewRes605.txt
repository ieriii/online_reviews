Went there for our wedding anniversary and all I can say is WOW! The best dining experience of my life! From the moment we walked in, the superb service began. And when the food started coming with our chosen wine pairing, I was blown away by the complex and exciting flavors. Every piece is a work of art so everyone in the restaurant were taking pictures of the food before consuming it. Even got a chance to meet Grant Achatz. It was a perfect experience in every way. Definitely worth the $$$$
