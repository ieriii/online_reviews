I had a very nice time here. The food was tasty, surprising and interesting. The staff were friendly and incredibly attentive. Here are the reasons it's not getting an extra star: -My mind was not blown. Maybe molecular gastronomy isn't for me. The food was like nothing I've ever eaten, but it did not connect with me the way I'd hoped. In addition to tasting flavors combined in new and interesting ways, I would have like to experience familiar flavor combinations done better. -Some of the dishes were too salty for my taste (the rabbit consomme, black truffle explosion). That's strange, because I like salt.
