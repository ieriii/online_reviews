I am certainly a fan of this place and would come back. The food was fair in price, although we bought the most expensive item on the menu, the Vitello M'Briaco. It was $29, unlike the $26 it said on the menu from the website, but some of the best veal I've ever had. Topped off with a bottle of red wine. The meal was well worth the price and the place wasn't too busy. I still recommend getting a reservation on Open Table if you plan on visiting during the weekend.
