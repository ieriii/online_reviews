I live in California and eat Mexican food literally ALL THE TIME, so I know whats good and whats just an imitation. The food at XOCO is unlike any Mexican food I've ever had! So good that I don't think I can settle for for the stuff in Cali anymore... I went on a pretty cold/rainy day so the line was shorter than what I've read about. The special of the day was goat barbacoa (which I got) and my cousin got the Pepito (shortribs). Don't be intimidated by the goat!!! It was soo tender and flavorful...it was definitely better than the Pepito BY COMPARISON (the Pepito was also amazing). The bread was is one of the highlights of the sandwich (choose the wood oven sandwiches over the pressed ones). As for the drinks, try them! The cucumber mint aqua fresca was refreshing and very unique! Overall...I loved Rick Bayless in Top Chef and I'm happy to say that his food is amazing! XOCO is now a must if I'm ever in Chicago again!
