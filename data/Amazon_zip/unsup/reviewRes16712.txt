One of those grandiose places that actually manages to pull it off - the busy atmosphere lives up to its name, with a giant bar and epic restaurant decor. We were in a rush to see a show, and they were accommodating enough for us to eat a full course at the bar counter as we were waiting for the table. Am still navigating my Latam dishes, and ordered something Nicaraguan I never had before. Excellent quality of beef. Would like to go back with more time.
