I wish I could have tried more of the hot dogs. The jerk chicken one with plantain stuff on top was FANTASTIC. The thai one with peanut sauce tasted like a too spicy sausage with peanut butter on it. Not as good. But still, it was very yummy and I hope to go back and try some more! Especially on a weekend when I can get the duck fat fries!
