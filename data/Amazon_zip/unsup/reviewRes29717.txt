Rick Bayless, how I adore thee. Your restaurant is worth the 1.5 hour wait without a reservation, and your cookbooks are easy and excellent. I haven't been back in a year or so, but it is at the top of my list to retry. If you can get 6 people to pick a date, they will take a reservation, but it has to bee fairly far in advance. Otherwise, they generally have two sittings to start, a 5:30 and something around 7:30. My suggestion is to get there around 5:30, put your name in for the second sitting, and then go walk around Michigan Avenue for a while. It is totally worth it. Please have a margarita.
