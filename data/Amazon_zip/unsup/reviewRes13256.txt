Wow...not at all what I expected. When I hear that a local microbrewery also serves food, I expect the usual bar fare -- burgers, fries, salads, sandwiches, blah blah blah.  When you step into Revolution you're overwhelmed by just how massive the space is. There's a huge island bar in the middle of the room and numerous tables around. Then you find out there's also an upstairs seating area. Even though the place is monstrous, expect to wait a few minutes for a table (longer on a Friday or Saturday night).  But the wait is definitely worth it. As an added bonus, you can saddle up to the bar to sample some of their fine brews while you wait (I highly recommended their Belgian ale served in a tulip glass). As for the food, three words --- bacon fat popcorn.  You must start with that.  Also the pretzel.  As for entrees, all the burgers were well-seasoned and cooked perfectly.  There are several pizzas on the menu as well. The giardiniera pizza caught my eye and was tangy, sweet and salty at the same time --- yum. I hIghly recommend Revolution Brewing either to begin your night out on the town or as the final destination.
