I've always had a good experience here. When making a reservation, they asked if we were celebrating anything, and I informed them it was our anniversary. We were treated to a complimentary dessert. The preparation of the steaks is exquisite. I must admit, I've only gotten the Petite Filet in the 4 times I've been there, but I've never been disappointed. One time I couldn't finish it and was taking the leftovers home; the waiter accidentally dropped them on the floor. They immediately apologized and quickly cooked up an equivalently sized portion, just for me to take home.
