Had such a great night at Gilt last night! The decor is very cool, the tables are not too close together, the service is very friendly, the beer and wine lists are very good, and the menu provides numerous delicious sounding options, but not too many. Had the burrata and tomato salad on toast (yes its bruschetta) which was good, the mussels which were very good, and tried some of my friend's orecchiette which was very rich and indulgent and delicious, and the brownie dessert ala mode, which was very good but we could only eat a few bites. The food was good, but honestly the experience, from drinks, decor, and the service was really what made the night. I would note that I had a friend who went at 5:30 on Friday and had a less positive experience. I went at 8:30 on Saturday and it was just right. I also wouldn't choose Gilt if I was in a hurry, because the service is somewhat slow, but personally I like leisurely dining. I will definitely go back, probably with a bigger group the next time. Highly recommend :)
