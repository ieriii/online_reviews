Living in Albany Park for five years, i know all of the Kabob places in this area. And i have to admit, Noon O Kabab is my favorite for a fine dining. Everybody complains about prices. Well of course if you want something worthy and good quality the price will be high. I once spoke to the owner, and i was amazed of what he does to keep his food the best. The guy actually hired, yes PAYED an inspector to COME and inspect his restaurant. I was there, and shocked. And if you had a bad plate, don't blame the restaurant, probably the chef is new or something. Try the place at least twice before trashing it on here.
