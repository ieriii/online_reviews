This is the place you go on a third or fourth date. You've already decided the other person is worth the money and time. The four course meal will last a couple hours. During which, you can talk about your passions, beliefs, families; bat your eyelashes; brag about yourself, lie about what you've accomplished, etc. You will not be sorry you came here on Sunday. The chef prepares flawless cuisine based on the freshest local produce, meat and seafood. **NOTE: This is not the place you go with someone who is hungover. That is when you order pizza instead. Trust me, I'm serious.
