Wow XOCO. I hope this place gets picked up and moved closer to me. The agua del dia was a papaya lime juice and it just tasted like hawaii. Chips and guac were ok, very little guac for the price. Mushroom Torta - I'm not a huge mushroom fan but this was the only veggie torta they had, and it was mindblowing. I could of eaten ten of them. Arugula, black beans (make sure you ask for the veggie ones), goat cheese, and garlic mushrooms inside an oven roasted crispy bread. It was just perfect. The churros and chocolate were very good, they weren't disneyland good, but hot and fresh and a great way to end the meal. With all the people inside it was very overwhelming but their system of having someone find a table for you and give you a number, then youre allowed to order at the counter makes everything run smoothly.
