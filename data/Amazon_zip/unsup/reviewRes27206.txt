I say...3.5 stars, but I'll round up b/c This place is yummy in da tummy. I can see why it's a hit or miss among pizza lovers - but really, when it comes down to the perfect pie - it's more about preference...BUT i will tell you this...I am a thin crust lover...and I go gaga over the deep dish here. The crust will come out and look all burnt up, but it's so tasty and crunchy and adds that perfect punch to go along with the rest of the pie....mmmm goodness.  My only gripe is that beer is so damn expensive. I supp I can always JUST get pizza here, but that's no fun...that would be like mac with no cheese...well, for me anyway =p So I shall deem this as an "occasion" spot like a chill date night before a movie...well, that what we do anyway...but go on and do it too...can't go wrong!
