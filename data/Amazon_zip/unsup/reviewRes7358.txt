I have been here twice - the first was the weekend around Valentines Day. We reservations and a big group - we were sat about 45 minute late, our food took about an hour to come out - taking too long seemed to be the name of the game that night. But thankfully, the manager apologized multiple times, gave us free desserts and a few bottles of wine. All was forgiven. Then, my husband and I were here on a Friday night and sat on the patio - once again, it look a long time to get our food, a long time to get a glass of wine, and a long time to get our check and pay. I do attribute it to one server for the whole patio - while not her fault, she should have had some help. The food is good here - I think the prices are very reasonable for the neighborhood; if it weren't for those two, Q would be getting a lower rating from me.  I just wish they worked on their timing.
