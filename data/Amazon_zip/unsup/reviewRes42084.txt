This stuffed pizza was just plain awful. I had two slices and tossed the rest. Too much distasteful sauce all over the top. It goes over the crust, under the ingredients. And the crust was 75% of the pizza. A little bit of cheese. Sausage pellets that must have come from the cages at Lincoln Park Zoo. I love deep dish pizza. I will stick with Bacino's, Pizano's, Malnati's, or Due. All are vastly superior to this pie.
