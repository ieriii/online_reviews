i am so disenchanted and i will never EVER return. here is why: 1- the hostess was extremely rude. she tried to seat our party of five at one of the low japanese style tables (the kind that requires you to sit cross legged on cushions). when i pointed out that three of us had sundresses on, she scowled and led us back to the waiting area without saying a word. 2- once seated, we proceeded to order. this wasn't my first rodeo folks. my best friend happens to be korean, so i've done the bbq thing a million times. yet, the waitress decided to cook all our food for us, all at once! and yelled at us the entire time to "eat eat eat". i have never felt more rushed. 3- while cooking the food, she spilled blood from the raw beef on our lettuce, making the wraps inedible. when we requested more, we were told no, and she repeatedly gestured to the tainted wraps saying that we had plenty. 4- the waitress put the cooked meat on the same plate that had held raw meat. can we say cross contamination? 5- a live insect of some sort was crawling in the dipping sauce that accompanied our pancake appetizer...that we had already eaten. barf. we called the waitress over to show her the critter and she and several others examined it closely, took the bowl up to the front of the restaurant and never said anything more about it. but when we left, the bowl was sitting up there, so clearly they wanted someone to take a look at it. so i am done. and you have been warned.
