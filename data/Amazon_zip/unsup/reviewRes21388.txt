Oh. Hell. Yes.  Superdawg Drive-In is exactly where you want to be on a Saturday night after going to a haunted house nearby (see my St. Thecla's review). See, this is a REAL drive-in. You park, order your food, and they bring the food to your car. You can also eat inside, but that's not as fun. I'd rather eat like a pig within the safety of my car, thank you very much.  I haven't been to Superdawg in years, so it was a real treat to eat here tonight. Initially I was going to order the "Superdawg" (duh), but I was extra hungry and decided to order the "Whoopskidawg" instead. It was a char-broiled Polish sausage, with barbeque sauce, grilled onions, and pickle on an onion bun. I was a bit skeptical about the bbq sauce (it's labeled "special sauce" on their menu), but it was perfect with the slightly spicy sausage. And the toasted, sweet onion bun was excellent!  The meal also included delicious, crispy crinkle-cut fries and their signature pickled green tomato. I had a pop to wash it all down, but I wish I had room for a milkshake... My only regret :) This place has been around since 1948, in the same location, and still family-owned. The food is great, and honestly... how could you resist a place with larger than life Hot Dogs flirting and winking at you to stop by? Take part in Chicago history and just go. Now.
