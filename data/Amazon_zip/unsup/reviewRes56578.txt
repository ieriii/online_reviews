One of the best meals I have had! Mastro's continues to impress and dish up the best steak I have had in the Chicago area. The bar is rather cramped and its hard to get a drink so make sure you have a reservation or you go at an off hour. But all in all, it was worth 30 minute the wait! So glad Mastro's finally made an appearance in the Windy City!
