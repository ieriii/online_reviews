Color me impressed! Went here for the first time for brunch over the weekend.  Loved the decor - although after hanging out in the darkened recesses of this pub, I felt like a mole-person seeing sunlight for the first time when I exited Wilde after brunch. I recommend the three-berry waffle. Very yummy. Prices are very reasonable! Our server was great: very knowledgeable about the menu (what exactly is blood pudding anyway?), efficient, always kept our glasses full and friendly. I'll definitely be coming back!
