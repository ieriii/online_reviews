What the Pho? This is THE place for that complex, savory Vietnamese soup I love so much! I've been here three times now, and although the menu is huge -- 257 items ranging from Roasted Quail to Pig's Intestines with Pineapple -- I can't seem to get past the Pho.  And I'm not alone. Take a look around this ever-busy dining room, and you'll see that the vast majority of diners --Asian and Caucasian alike -- are happily slurping noodles and hunks of meat out of huge white bowls filled with steaming, spicy broth.  Go all out and order the #40 -- with sliced beef, well-done brisket, well-done flank, soft tendon, bible tripe and meat ball. Tendon? Tripe? Hell yes! When your soup arrives, add in items from your "Pho Kit," an accompanying side plate heaped with bean sprouts, sliced jalapenos, lime wedges and sprigs of fresh thai basil. Drizzle in a little hoisin sauce, some Hot Siracha, some Thai Chili Paste -- maybe a touch of soy sauce.  Now, before you pick up those chopsticks, suck up a big spoonful of the broth. Taste how complex it is -- it's a hearty stock made from unmentionable animal parts obviously simmered for hours. The result is savory and rich with high hints of spice. Can you taste the Star Anise? The whiff of cinnamon? This is what makes good Pho, and Tank Noodles' is vastly superior to that of other Vietnamese eateries -- even those right down the street. Tank Noodles is not the place for an intimate, romantic dinner. It's big and crowded, with customers lined up in the entry way waiting for a spot at a communal table. Service is friendly but spotty. This is the kind of place where people come just for the food. Pardon the pun, but Tank Noodles is one "Pho King" restaurant! Anthony Bourdain once said that he'd happily perform, er, wanton acts of sexual desperation involving Estelle Getty if he could just eat Pho like this every day. If we're going to Tank Noondles, I've got dibs on the sloppy seconds!
