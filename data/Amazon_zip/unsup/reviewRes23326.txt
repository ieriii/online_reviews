The first time that I went here, I was skeptical as the crpes were all very non-traditional. But it worked, and the crpes were delicious. The crpes were folded in a triangle and made for a satisfying meal. I've since gone back a few times and been very happy with the food. ...And then I went back very recently and the whole menu is changed: the crpes are smaller, so they suggest ordering two. But the crpes aren't just smaller, they're not the same. Something was off for my crpes as well as my friend's, and we both agreed that something was off, flavors weren't well-balanced, and everything was somewhat bland. I'm not sure what happened. The new menu also says all over it that the restaurant is gluten-free, which is terribly confusing as the crpes are made with wheat and therefore are not.
