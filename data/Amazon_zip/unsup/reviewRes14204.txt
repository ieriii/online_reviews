Revolution Brewing had the most ridiculous Tempeh Reuben I've had in Chicago. I heard a lot about this place and I've read the reviews for some time now. Finally, I was in the Logan Square are today, texted a friend, and before I knew it, we had plans to hit RB at 8PM. So glad we did! Let's just say it was one of those damn days where all I wanted was a vodka rocks. So I did! I was waiting up for my friend and ordered a Ketel One on the rocks. Bill came...$8. I was shocked! I braced myself for the usual $10 plus tip and was thrilled to see a vodka rocks ring up in single digits. Finally my friend arrived and we were promptly seated against the wall. I have to get it out of the way, but I love the atmosphere and decor. It was loud, but a good loud where you can still hear the person sitting across from you. Awesome dark wood throughout with the cool globe lights. I was a fan. We decided not to get an appetizer because nothing looked too appetizing to me. I don't like cheese plates and the popcorn didn't sound appetizing. No big deal. As the token vegetarian-leaning-vegan friend, I went with the Tempeh Reuben. Seriously, this thing was a monster. Amazing! I still can't get over how spicy it was with the cheese and mayonnaise on toasted rye bread. It's been a long week so I went with the fries, which were also fantastic. My friend went ahead with the Rappini pizza and I'm going to say...that was this reason this place didn't get 5 stars. I just wasn't impressed with the pizza. I'd eat it just because I'm a food machine, but compared to the Reuben, I was left expecting a little more. Service was cool. I was a little disappointed that we didn't receive water refills and it was a little warm in there. Not too big a deal...but refilling waters should be second nature. I hate to be nit picky, but that just stood with me. After all that...I will be back. I'm going to be dreaming about the Tempeh Reuben tonight. Wow.
