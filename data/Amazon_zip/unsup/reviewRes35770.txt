I love Shaw's. I don't care that as an independent food service provider that I am only supposed to extol the virtues of other like vendors. Lettuce Entertain You does it right. The oysters are plump and fresh. The crab legs shells snapped to expose tender meat. The calamari was perfect. Again, I love Shaw's.
