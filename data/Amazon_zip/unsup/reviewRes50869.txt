As a former resident of both New Orleans and Houston, I miss Southern style cooking. So when I stumbled upon this place and saw they served "grits" - I knew I was in a good place. Their shrimp and grifts are TO DIE FOR. I mean, literally, they're so rich, and creamy, I think one of my arteries was clogged after the meal, but it was SO worth it. I also LOVE their Crawfish Cakes. Those are an occasional special, so consider yourself lucky if they're one of the offered specials for the day. :) I love coming here for a Sunday brunch or breakfast, but I've been here for their dinner as well, and it's equally as delicious. Note: Come here prepared to be among tons of families and their babies, some screaming, some not. Maybe you can dull some of the noise or campy family vibe with one of their Mississippi Muds or a mimosa (or, three). :)
