I really enjoyed my experience on their sidewalk patio last night. My friend and I ordered the chips (fries) and curry gravy, which was excellent. We also had the peppered hanger steak and carmelized lobster which was also excellent. I had a great peach bellini and we left satisfied after sharing all three of our dishes. Loses a star for being a bit pricey. Also, the guy at the table next to us had his phone stolen right off the table while we were sitting there. In the same hour, a guy came right into the patio and was begging for food and money and was chased away finally by a waitress ready to call the cops. Not exactly how I want to spend an expensive meal, but this is on Michigan Ave and it was during Blues Fest.
