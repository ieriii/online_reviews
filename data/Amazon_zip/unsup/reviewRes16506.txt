Ventured to this Latino hot spot on a Friday "Date Night" with my foodie partner in crime. The experience started off on the wrong foot with a 30 minute wait for a table for 2 - even with our reservation and a call ahead that evening to confirm. Luckily there is a comfortable car area with plenty of seating and great views of the West of the Loop sky-line.  Once we got seated in the festive main dinning room, with changing lights and 3 story ceilings, things were looking good. We did the red wine flight, goat cheese, and guacamole with corn chips to start. The chips were thick and wet with oil, but the guac was creamy and chunky. Goat cheese and red wine flight were average, although the fig jam and interesting nuts made a nice compliment to the firm and pugnant goat cheese.  For entrees, we did the pork shoulder with plantains and the Mariscos with lobster broth. The pork shoulder a but dry and served with a heavy rice. I couldn't taste any rum glaze that was listed on the menu. The other dish also came with a heavy rice, which had soaked up only potential broth and left this dish with more like a paste.  Everything had tons of flavor but less than half way into the meal, our stomachs felt like we had eaten a lot more than we thought. Not sure if it was the grease in the chips or the half pound of butter used to cook the rice.  Both feeling sick at this point, we skipped desert and signed the check.
