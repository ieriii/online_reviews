i've been to RJ grunts a couple of times. once with my husband and with a group of girlfriends. both were great experiences. the food was good and the service was great. ...love the buffalo chicken nachos! it's a great spot in that area thats reasonably priced for families or after a day in the area shopping, zoo, etc. i thought my glass of wine was on the high side $9 but i should have checked the wine prices before ordering or else i would have picked something cheaper. I dont understand why some posters complain when a restaurant has "lots of kids and families" when its clearly a "family" restaurant atmosphere. How is this a negative? It's not Tru its RJ Grunts! definitely would go again.
