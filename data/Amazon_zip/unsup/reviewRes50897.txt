I live pretty close to this location, I had no idea it was southern style food.  Upon discovering this I was a little hesitant. I'm from the South so I have crazy high expectations!  Kidding mostly... I enjoyed the greens and mac and cheese. My old roommate appeared to like the crab cakes. The lunch menu is a little higher than expected, but that's prolly my own fault for eating out when I was broke.
