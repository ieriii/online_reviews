What a cool website this is. Anyway, off to my first review - My girlfriend was intent on going to this place for months so I finally allowed her to let me take her there. I'm a lucky man. The first time I walked in I thought "this place is in a basement and it's dark and there's a little band singing some spanish jazz tunes. It's Chicago's version of "Hernando's Hideaway" from Guys and Dolls. I'm not sure if that was a good thing but my High School play definitely described this place. No, I wasn't it it. Anyway, we squeezed into a two-seater ordered some cheese and became content. It was delicious. I like Fondue in general and this place went above and beyond average tasting melted cheese. The only problem I had was the table was very small. At one point I bumped into my glass of water and it covered the entire table in 2 seconds flat. People snickered, I shot dirty looks, a child cried, the music played on - it was very dramatic.  We've been back now three or four times and usually just stick with the cheese and chocolate. We've tried the Grande Pupa meals but they never seem to be worth it -plus, they skimp on the cheese part when you order the oil meals. I say stick with regular cheese fondue and chocolate and you can't go wrong. The price is right, it's a romantic environment, and it's tasty.
