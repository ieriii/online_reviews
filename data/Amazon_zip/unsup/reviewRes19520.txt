I had such high hopes of having multiple oohs and aahs when I bit into my meal at XOCO, and was a little disappointed when I thought it was just "good". Now, if I didn't hear the buzz from hundreds of people about how AH-mazing this place was then I probably wouldn't have been disappointed, I would have been satisfied with my meal. However, another case of having too high of expectations and being slightly let down. I'm also to blame after falling madly in love with Rick's other lunch destination Frontera Fresco, and assuming I would fall head over heels about this place too. I tried the Cubana Torta, and I enjoyed it (I mean, it's hard to go wrong with pork, bacon, avocado, and cheese melted on yummy bread). It was large but not out of control, but it was messy and all over the place. I also did some chips and guacamole for an app but also thought it was just good, nothing to write home (or Yelp) about. My friend got caldos, but was not impressed and only ate half of it. Warning: there is no good place to sit in this restaurant. If you are going to come here, get it to go. That way you won't be bumped into every 90 seconds by a fellow patron or member of their staff. It really was distracting and took away from enjoying the meal (and my company). And let's be honest, I think that if this wasn't under the everything-is-perfect-umbrella of Rick Bayless that there would never be a line around the corner, it would just be a yummy place people occasionally head to to grab some quick Mexican food for lunch.
