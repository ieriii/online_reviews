I used to think Big is not always better, but I've been proven wrong. Big Jones entered my mouth with their delicious food and into my heart with their great service. We took advantage of the prix fixe menu for $25 consisting of: *Appetizer - Fried Green Tomato (4 stars) & Crab Cake (5 stars) *Salad - Blackberry salad (4 stars) *Entree - Stuffed Quail w/ fried hominy and a sweet corn puree (5 stars) *Dessert - Red velvet cake w/ cream cheese frosting (5+ stars) & Mississippi Mud Pie (5+ stars) *Beverage - 1/2 price bottle of sparkling wine (5 stars) I ate my food like I eat my [insert here]; yes, it was that good! The server was wonderful, attentive, knowledgeable, fantabulous, pure awesomeness (okay, I'm running out of words here)...point being, the service was outstanding. She brought out glasses of wine to taste to help us determine which bottle we wanted. The servers also came around to show us what the dishes looked like before we ordered it. I wanted to kidnap our server, take her home and have her serve me for the rest of my life. Okay, that really sounded demented, but she really was that good! I'll definitely be back. I think tonight (Tuesday) is a fried chicken special with $5 margaritas... Hmmm, wonder where I'll be!! :)
