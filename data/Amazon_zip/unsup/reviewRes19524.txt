It really saddens me to give this place less than 5 stars. Have been for lunch several times and LOVE it. Seriously, the jamon torta with the fried egg added is like seeing God for the first time. Sure, the line is crazy long and they take forever even if you get there and only 3 people are ahead of you, but the food is worth it. So why the low rating? Breakfast. Do NOT go here for breakfast. They only have 2 "tortas" on the menu for breakfast and today when I went, they were entirely out of the only one I get (chorizo and egg). The other, open-faced one is no good. Slimy, messy and not much to it. Instead of either apologizing or offering to make the good torta without the one ingredient they were missing, the rude (and idiotic) lady at the counter just said "You want the open faced torta or not?" WOW - great customer service you hired there, Rick Bayless. I've had issue with that lady before - she's not a smart cookie. She always seems confused and it takes her 30 minutes to figure out the register for each and every customer. So yes, I am going against the grain and voting them low, but seriously, how does an amazing restaurant screw up breakfast? Why bother - just start the day with lunch if you're going to mess up the easiest meal to make of the day.
