I love Tank! It's often packed but even on days when you can't get a seat without waiting, they'll ask if you'd like to sit at a table of other "irregular" customers that were all seated together because there was no room elsewhere. Interesting way to meet new people for certain! The food is great, spring rolls and beef pho are the best I've had in the city and the #1 appetizer is an insane portion of good food. It'd be a five star if the place were a little cleaner (I'm not fond of the bathroom, but I have no qualms about the utensils), and the service isn't always attentive.
