came here at 7pm on a friday without a reservation.. had drinks in the the bar downstairs during the ~1hr wait (8 parties ahead of us).  bar: - ridiculously dark (had to use cell to read menu- the puny candles achieve nothing)... but loved it. :) very romantic, cozy, chill, secluded atmosphere with big leather couches lined along the wall and big, old fashioned tables in the middle with tiny, flickering candles.  - we all got girly drinks. decent, not great. - the host came to find us when we got a table in the upstairs. you can bring your drinks, but you pay for it there. lounge (same menu here as the restaurant) - pot roast, truffle pasta, and pork belly: all delicious, especially the pot roast. portions are not big, but not exactly small plates size. - loved the waiter. very friendly, stopped by occasionally, not too often. - everywhere is dark... bar downstairs, bar upstairs, lounge, restaurant-- which could be annoying for some people i guess, but i loved it bc you get a feeling of seclusion/ privacy/ intimacy while sitting in open space. - music is very loud. great food, ok drinks, great vibe. cozy & intimate (lighting, furniture), energetic and urban (noise, crowded, the people). a bit pricey. tips, drinks, dinner for 3 girls came out to over $100. it's easy to look good in this restaurant- dress nicely, but no need to fuss with makeup/ details. i would come here again to relax and hide after a long week, but still want energy and stimulation.
