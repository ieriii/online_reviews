I recently went to Gilt Bar with my guys for dinner. In short, the food and the service were great, but not without some complaints. Read below to find out. Don't worry it ends well enough. Seeing as this was a popular spot, I had the sense to reserve our seats way ahead of time. We arrived 30 minutes early and were told that seating will be on time. We were directed to their cocktail lounge to enjoy ourselves while we wait. It was pretty awesome down there besides the extremely dim lit setting; we had to pull out our cell phones to read the drink menu. So when the 30 minutes were up, we went back to the receptionist and asked for our table. They were seating behind schedule and no estimate as to when they would be seating us. Peachy. We decided to tough it out and wait... for 1 whole hour. To add insult to injury, a receptionist told us that it would be an additional 10 minutes because they had forgotten some poor couple's reservation ahead of us and had to seat them first. It was already 9pm at this point -- borderline ridiculous. The manager then came to apologize and offered to buy us a round of appetizers. Miffed, we motioned to leave, but magically a table just opened up and it would just be a couple more minutes... Sure. I had them take our order while we waited. When they finally seated us they apologized again and said they would have our food right away. At that point, things started to get better. With our empty stomachs making such furious noises, it was easy to devour anything in sight. From the bread to the rib-eyes, our meal was wonderful. It satisfied my hunger twofold and gave me such peace I thought I was going to die and go to Heaven just then. If Heaven had food, it better taste like Gilt. 23 bucks for our troubles sounded like a pretty good bargain. Moral of the story? Reserving at Gilt Bar means nothing.
