Piece is a very unique piece of Wicker Park that everyone should try at least twice. Once on some random weekday evening, and once at 11pm on Saturday night. They're two entirely different places. Weeknight Piece is a great place. Wide open, clean, attentive wait staff, and some of the best/most unique pizza I've ever had. Their award-winning beers are about four notches above what you expect when you hear "Pizza joint that brews their own beer." Weekend Piece is, I'm sorry to say, a stereotypical Wicker Park bar that just so happens to serve great pizza and fantastic brews. If you don't have a reservation, you're going to have to fight your way to the bar while you wait for a table for over an hour. If you do have a reservation and get a seat, you'll probably be seated about two inches from your new best friend in the party next to yours. I really, *really* enjoy Piece, but not on the busy weekends.
