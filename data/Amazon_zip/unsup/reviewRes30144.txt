We have lived around the corner from The 3rd Coast for over 10 years and go there several times a month for breakfast, lunch and/or dinner.  It is a fantastic place for many reasons; food is really good; the staff is friendly; the owner is engaged / involved; the atmosphere is very laid back (art/patrons/music). I highly recommend The 3rd Coast for both tourists and locals.
