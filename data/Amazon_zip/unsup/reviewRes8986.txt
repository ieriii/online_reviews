I went here with a very large group and had an excellent meal. I was happy to try out a Turkish beer for the first time, and I think the warm babbaganoush was one of the best renditions of this classic appetizer I have ever had. I had a ground beef kebab, and lamb with Persian dill rice. Since I was with a large group I was able to try the lamb, beans, and spinach side dish, as well as several others. I wish they had a family style option for a group as large as ours. There were vegetarian options as well and these were also amazing. They brought us a sampler of sweets at the close of dinner and these were great. They were nice and split the check for us (all 7 ways), and there is a small parking lot just south of the restaurant (the Noon O Kabab take out cafe is there) so you might be able to save feeding the meter.
