An ice cold, snowy Chicago pre-twilight afternoon. My brain, body, and soul in need of a cozy, warm place to sit, relax, and even my keel. The lady and I stepped into a simple looking cafe... We walked into Icosium Kafe for the first time and began to melt - this feeling grew as time passed. I unbundled myself and sidled into a booth. The decor is Algerian, as are the coffee pots, creamers, and a lot of other touches here and there. The service was friendly and kind. Is that cucumber in my water? Nice, simple touch. We ordered coffee and a Nutella crepe to help chase the cold and drear away, and it worked - it was Nutella, after all. The crepe was wonderful, light, slightly crispy on the edges, and warm, with chocolatey, hazlenutty goodness soaking into every pore. We sat, healed ourselves, and watched the snow fall over cup after cup of hot coffee as the afternoon passed. This is what I needed, and this is exactly where I needed it.
