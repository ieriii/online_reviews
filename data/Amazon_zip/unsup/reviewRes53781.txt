I love the Green Mill. When I go, I usually frequent it on Monday nights when they usually have the Patricia Barber Quartet performing. In fact, this review is mostly about Monday nights with said performers.The atmosphere is great. The waitstaff are attentive, professional, and respect the performers as do the audience.If you have not yet been on Monday nights to see the Patricia Barber Quartet, I highly advise you do. Check the calendar on the website to confirm said group is not touring abroad however. What else to say? The music is organic, sultry, sensuous, real and imagined, and the sound quality is top-notch.If you are looking for a semi-intimate and somewhat romantic getaway on Monday night, look no further. It will change your mind.
