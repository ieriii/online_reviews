Prior to moving to Chicago, I actually considered dining here alone (if they would allow a table for one). I was so happy to make and meet friends in the city that had the same interests in food and gastronomy as me.  The restaurant can be a bit difficult to find, especially because there is no sign outside. But the minute you open the door, be ready to be impressed and wowed.  Prior to this experience, my favorite places to eat was a tie between Providence in Los Angeles and Per Se in New York City-- now, its a three way tie. From start to finish, I loved everything. The staff is very accommodating and knowledgeable. Everyone was very friendly and welcoming. I arrived earlier than the rest of the party and i was allowed to sit by the kitchen and watch the chefs and cooks prepare.  Sure the price of admission is pretty expensive but totally worth it. If you're weary of the price, the amount of food and entertainment they provide you makes up for it.  The three of us dining were all pastry students and of course I had to slip that in during the meal. And to my surprise, Chef Grant Achatz came out to prepare our table side dessert. I was in awe and still in shock from watching him create the beautiful presentation of flavors and textures that was oh so delicious. Truly a memorable experience. I don't think I've ever had a four hour dinner. I will definitely come back again someday.
