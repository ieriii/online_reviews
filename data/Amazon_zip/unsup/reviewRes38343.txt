Long wait. Decided to order take out. They make their pizzas by the order, so I had to wait 40 minutes!!! Pizza was thick, one slice filled me up. Usually I can eat three or four slices of a regular pizza. Had sausage deep dish. Small size was around $25. I guess it was an experience. Left over deep dish was good for the next day.
