We had a girls-only dinner here yesterday and I was quite satisfied with the prices, portions, atmosphere, and service. Our original plan was to go to Duke of Perth, but we were told that it would be a 1.5 hour wait so we decided to try out luck here instead. Wilde is a very big restaurant with high ceilings and tables that are decently spaced apart so it doesn't feel claustrophobic. I really liked that. We were told that there would be a 35 minute wait (acceptable for a Friday night) so we had a drink at the back bar (there are 2 bars inside) while waiting. The merlot, at $12 a glass, was more expensive than I thought it should be. We were seated at a very cute round booth which was small enough to be intimate, but large enough so that we didn't feel squished. The waitress was really nice and left us alone while we waited for the fourth person to show up. The menu is quite extensive with a page each of appetizers, burgers/sandwiches, and entrees. I decided to try their "Wilde Burger" (1/2 pounder with caramelized onions, cheddar, barbecue sauce, and lettuce & tomato). I ordered it medium and while it came out cooked properly, it only tasted ok. The meat wasn't seasoned well (if at all), and the onions & cheddar added little to the overall taste. I couldn't taste the barbecue sauce at all. The patty was quite juicy though and made the bun soggy in parts. The fries were decent. Prices were good for the service and atmosphere. The burger set me back about $15 including tax and tip. I would probably come here again just for the comfort factor - but I'll order something else the next time.
