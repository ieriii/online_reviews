The Violet Hour is such a fun experience. For a first timer, it is so thrilling to look for the door handle under the dull yellow glowing light and wonder what will happen when you pull on it. Will it be locked? What will be inside? A dark cramped hallway jam-packed with other people, you soon find out. Now what? Will someone ever come from beyond the curtains to seat me? Eventually, yes. Hopefully, you have a small group, so you can raise your hand when they ask "Any parties of 2 in here?" There was a group of 9 in front of me that I wasn't sure would ever get in. But my group of 4 only waited for 30 minutes at around 8:30 on a Friday night. Despite being treated like cattle in the waiting process, the service is excellent once inside. The servers are attentive and are able to recommend drinks based on your tastes and do not carry any haughty attitude towards people who are unfamiliar with some of the contents in these creative cocktails. Despite the ever growing line outside, patrons are not rushed at all. The dimely lit room is dark and romantic and is the perfect setting to sip sexy and exotic cocktails. Great for a date or a fun night out with your girlfriends!
