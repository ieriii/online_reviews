Eh. We had their multiple course Valentine's dinner this year, and we weren't very impressed. The place is cute and swanky, but pretty tiny. The food wasn't anything memorable, and we felt like sardines amongst the sea of other couples packed into the place. The price was right (about $125 per person, which included the wine flight), but I'd really rather go somewhere else and pay a little more.
