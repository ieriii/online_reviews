We were lucky enough to walk in on a Saturday and be seated right away for lunch. I don't know why, but I wasn't that excited initially about going, despite the facts that pork is obviously the centerpiece of the menu AND that they have a whole section of the menu devoted to fried foods.  But the snow outside and the Purple Pig quickly changed my mind. Everything was just really tasty: a nicely roasted bone marrow, a cold arborio salad with shrimp and clams that was light and toothsome, a tartine with serrano and poached duck egg, a slightly spicy and not-at-all-chewy sepia (like cuttlefish), and a light salad with watermelon radish and luxuriously creamy feta. The communal tables are nice because everyone just ogles each other's food and then says "I'll have what they're having" and everyone's happy! Very friendly unpretentious service, too.
