Saw this place on the food network and had to give it a try! The BBQ roasted duck is fantastic and to die for! I'm not a huge fan of the BBQ pork only because of how dry it was when i tried it. They have a huge area to sit and eat in and they have alcohol! The staff is very nice and very helpful. So far, I've gone here 4 times and the food is consistent and as always, delicious
