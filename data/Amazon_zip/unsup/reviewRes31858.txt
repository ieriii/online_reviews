Every time I visit Chicago, I try to visit the Chicago Diner since I'm vegetarian. I've tried numerous dishes and never been disappointed, though my favorite of course is the Reuben.  It's a great portion and they even have a gluten free bread option which is still hard to come by in most restaurants I frequent. The Titanic burger is also great, as is the country fried steak! I might have to move to Chicago!
