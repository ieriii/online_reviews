We came here for my birthday dinner, and since I read the reviews I expected it to be scene-ey with the chance of a celebrity spotting. I didn't see any celebrities, and i really didn't think the crowd was all that interesting. Granted, my birthday fell on a Wednesday so there was probably a lot of people from the after work crowd instead of the clubbin' crowd on the weekends. First of all, i love that the menu is pretty much compiled of small plates. The hubster and I love that, because you can order a bunch of things and keep ordering until you're stuffed. The food and the portions were great, but the service was just okay. We told our server that our table was wobbly twice, and she never came to fix it. It was so wobbly that if my husband leaned forward the table would make a loud noise and my chopsticks would roll off my plate. The trek to the bathroom is pretty ridiculous after you've had a few pear sake-tinis (B-T-Dubs: AMAZING!). Also, not that a bathroom makes a restaurant, but it really wasn't that nice and kinda dirty. For a swanky place like this i expected at least some fancy fixtures and cool artwork, and definitely not random toilet paper squares on the floor. We'll probably come back eventually because the food was great, but I think we'll check out some other cool restaurants in the area first.
