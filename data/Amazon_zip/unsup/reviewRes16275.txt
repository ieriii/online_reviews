Everything about this place is awesome! The decor, the food, the drinks, the dessert....wow, even the waiting room is hot! They have a bar area where you wait for your table. You can sit down for a drink and enjoy the heck out of yourself before you know it you are entering a huge room with lively music, and fantastic food. It is a great place to bring a date, but the prices aren't cheap yet....I hope you aren't either!
