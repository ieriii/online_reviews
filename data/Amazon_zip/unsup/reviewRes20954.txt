On Saturday, my friend and I ate an earlier light dinner, so decided to stop in for a small bite or dessert later in the evening. We arrived around 8:30 and the line was out the door. We read a sign about take-out food, but stood in line about 10 minutes before we saw an employee to ask about the take-out situation. She directed us right to a register to order. We ordered churros and hot chocolate. It didn't take long to get them and we were on our way. We ate them when we arrived back at our friend's place and they were cold, but still really good. I loved that the dipping chocolate was not too sweet. We tried to go back on Sunday to eat, but it was closed. I will definitely go there next time I'm in town!
