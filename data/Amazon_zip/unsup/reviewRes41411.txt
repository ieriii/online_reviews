been craving for pho. Tank is my #1 vietnamese restaurant. We ordered pho, fried rice and the beef with lemon grass. OH my gosh it was very delicious. I dont think im gonna try any other vietnamese restaurant anymore, i found the best already. The service was ok, it's not that great but im giving 4 star because i really like the food, one star off because of the service. (they forgot to give us plates and whatever we need to start eating the delicious food LOL) 2 thumbs up tank!
