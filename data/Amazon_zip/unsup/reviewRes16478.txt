I kind of love this place. Even with their stupid rules and their overbearing pretentiousness, the artfulness of the bartenders and the strong, complex drinks make up for it all. Loved the Juliet & Romeo. Can't wait to try their other drinks. Also, is it just me, or do all of these speakeasy/prohibition themed lounges require bartenders to be outfitted in a tuxedo vest over a rolled-up button-up shirt, and grow out a shaggy 'do and beard?
