What a diamond in the rough! I understand that this terrific restaurant has been in town for 13 years and I finally had the opportunity to experience 3rd Coast.In short, the food was great and menu diverse. It has a neighborhood atmosphere and great service. They were extremely flexible and kid friendly - important with a two year old.We had the fortunate opportunity to meet the proprietors, Chris and Janet. Make it a point to say hi to them as they are two of the friendliest - knowledgeable restaurant owners I have met.Treat yourself and head to 3rd Coast.
