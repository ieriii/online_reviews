Wow, amazing! Just happened to be driving NW on Clybourn and this colorful little building caught my eye. The exterior is brightly painted with an outdoor scene of clothes hanging out on the line. Inside the music plays as you read the food selections from hanging chalkboards. My friend and I shared a tamal cubano filled with tender chunks of chicken, a veggie empanda and a beef empanada, and one of the dinner specials that included large pork chunks flash fried, crispy on the outside, tender and juicy on the inside. Alongside this was an orders of sweet plantains and black beans and rice. The counter staff assisted us with descriptors of the specials. The staff also came out twice to ask how the food was, very friendly and helpful. I will definitely be back...so many choices.
