I've been to Carnivale on several occasions but most recently for their 5 year anniversary celebration. As far as the celebration goes I was disappointed. They had an array of oddities such as jugglers, guy who lays on a bed of nails, guy on stilts but overall it just felt...well...ODD. There were no dinner specials or special entrees or drinks. It was the same old menu. All glitz and glam but really no substance. Anyway, moving on...the service here is always pretty good. The food...well it's hit or miss. I definitely think it's overpriced for what you get. This time I ordered the Arrachera well done. It came out still pink so I had to send it back. The Yuca was good but the garlic was overpowering. I had a Caipirhna to drink which was good but the glass was so tiny and it was stuffed with ice. I'm sure there was only about a shot and a half of actual liquid in the glass. That kinda ticked me off. Finally, I ordered the Tres Leche for dessert and it was absolutely amazing. So it ended on a good note. So to sum it up, service was good, dessert was excellent and everything else was *thumbs down* :-\
