Yum yums. I heard awful things about the wait so I went immediately after work on a Friday (around 5:30PM) and got a table right away. Had the delicious Willie beer, which knocked me on my butt and was delicious. Started with the sweet potato cakes which were a little greasy and kind of hard to eat but SUPER tasty. Decided on the Farm Burger, which is a burger with a frickin' EGG on top, and it was delicious. As were the mashed potatoes it came with (made with frickin' cream cheese!). My veggiesauras friends ordered the tempeh reuben and tofu sandwich and were pleased. We followed it all up with the beignets and choco dipping sauce- not as mind blowing but I was drinking the chocolate out of the cup by the end so it's not like I can say I wasn't digging it. Service was great-especially for how busy it was by the time we left. The place is really pretty inside and full of hipsters which gives it kind of a snooty feeling but hey. I would go again. And I would eat and drink like a pig. Again.  Overall, good experience. I feel fat and hungry rehashing it. Yum!
