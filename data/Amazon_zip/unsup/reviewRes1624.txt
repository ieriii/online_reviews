Doug's takes the dog to a new level. Thank God I'm back to eating meat again! I had the Ribeye dog with Chimichurri sauce. Dude. How can you not love a STEAK HOT DOG??? The only thing that would have made it better would be to wrap it in bacon (are you listening, Doug????). The line is hellishly long, but moves quickly and there is somehow always a place to sit (since people scarf down those encased meats like candy). Free refills on drinks -- my new favorite is 1/2 7-Up, 1/4 Cherry Coke, 1/4 Fanta Orange. It kicks ass. Seriously. Doug could not be nicer if he tried. Adorable and bespectacled and willing to explain any of the meats on the menu if you're uncertain about their ingredients. My ribeye dog was incredible. The chimichurri sauce is basically like a parsley pesto. Excellent, but extremely garlicky. Bring breath mints. While I hear the standards (named after famous celebs and members of Doug's familia) are excellent, I would recommend the Special encased meats...gourmet concoctions with interesting relishes (i.e. cranberry-pear relish or goat cheese or the aforementioned chimichurri). I'm craving a ribeye dog right now, honestly. Mmmm....encased meat....
