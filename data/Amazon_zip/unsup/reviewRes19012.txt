Food is fantastic but it is pretty expensive. It's not that much better than really good mexican food. Also, I would never eat at the restaurant. Place is packed, loud and just all around traffic-y. We thought about eating in until we saw the stupid-long line. So we placed an order for take out and it came out in 20 minutes. Not too bad I suppose.  Good food but not worth the wait. I would return when I see that there isn't much of a line and definitely would drop in for their Aztec drink.
