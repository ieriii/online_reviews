I was visiting from LA, and Gino's East was a must do item on our list. We were so full from Hot Doug's, but we came and ordered a small Gino's East Supreme with the Sausage Patty. After waiting for about 40 mins, it finally came out. I was super excited for the first bite, and it was really good! The bread was fluffy, and the sausage patty was amazing!! However, I did not like the crust! It was just a thick piece of hard bread and I was not a fan of that. I first had half a slice, and although I was full, I finished the other half. Don't hate me for this, but after trying Chicago deep dish, I think I like NY style pizza better.
