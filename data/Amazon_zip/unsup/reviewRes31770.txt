I love that that they are a 2 minute walk from my place. I have been going here since the first day they opened. I visit every Sunday! The food is consistently very good whether you choose the breakfast or lunch items. I recommend anything from the specialties list, everything on it has an authentic Mexican touch. The Poblano sauce is definitely a good add on to any of the meals. The organic chorizo is amazing! The coffee is good but a little too much on the light bodied side for my tastes. The espresso drinks are very smooth and made with an artisan's touch. The service is good and the wait staff personality ranges from overly talkative to efficient but all are friendly. You can often find Nana herself seating people. I recommend taking the time to chat with her. She has an old world charm that is unmatched and can hold a highly intellectual conversation. The only two negatives I have are the cramped space when it gets busy and the lack of a waiting area. I look forward to the additions of outdoor seating and the upcoming dinner menu.
