This is probably my favorite restaurant in the downtown area of Chicago. Could it be the meat, meat, and then more meat? Quite possibly, but the are so many other great things to behold there. First is the atmosphere. It just has a great feel. Dark wood and fireplaces everywhere like an old ski lodge. The rooftop bar is great! The harvest table has a little of everything. Lots of flavorful salads and cheeses. Many of the combinations, I would never think would go together. Like the smoked poblano deviled eggs. The black truffle butter goes great on any of their delicious breads. Another must mention is the duck pastrami. My mouth is watering just thinking of it. The harvest table done, the meat parade begins. The buttermilk sirloin was probably my favorite, followed closely by amaretto pistachio duck breast and the pork belly. The lamb deserves mention, but it all was good. Did I also mention the meats and harvest table are unlimited? I am not going to do a separate review for the brunch which is equally great, but I will give a shout out to the maple Cajun bacon and corned beef hash with a poached egg. The service has been great every time I have eaten here. My quick tip would be not to rush, you need a minimum of 2 plus hours to enjoy this feast, The only bad thing I have to say is that parking can be a pain depending what is going on at the time.
