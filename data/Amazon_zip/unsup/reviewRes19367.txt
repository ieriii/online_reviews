So, no Rick Bayless sighting this time, but I'll let it slide as I hear he's a very busy man! On this busy Friday (with a seating capacity of 40, I fear the line will always be a long one), I chose to apologetically stuff my face with the Cubana, guacamole and chips, churros AND with a lemonade to wash it all down. Guac: A-. Chunky yet smooth, fresh and zesty (I think there's some red peppers in there). A small portion, so we doubled up for our party of four. Cubana: a solid A. It's a torta from the griddle, so the sandwich is pressed and grilled; the bread, perfection. It's filled with smoked Maple Creek pork loin, bacon, black beans, generous chunks of avocado, artisan Jack cheese, and a smidgen of chipotle mustard. This is my new favorite sandwich creation here, and also runs head-to-head with another sandwich I love, the al pastor Cemita of Cemitas Puebla fame. Churros: B+. Sugary, buttery, messy and delicious. Lemonade: A-. Very sweet but in a different way... really can't put my finger on what makes it so unique, but it's a treat in itself. I can't believe I ate the whole damn thing... but then again, this is the kind of meal you strategically starve yourself for. Anticipation is very powerful when you put the fate of stomach real estate in the hands of the gifted Mr. Bayless. Bravo!
