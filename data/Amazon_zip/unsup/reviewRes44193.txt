Super sad because I found this bakery just a few months before I moved and am addicted to their macaroons. The flavors change from week to week, and sometimes I'd come too late in the afternoon and all the macaroons would be completely sold out. Liked all the flavors (although the rose macaroon tasted a little perfume-y, but still pretty good), but passion fruit was my favorite. I think the key is the cookie part is crispy and not gummy like some other macaroons. Still haven't found a place in Hawaii that quite compares...
