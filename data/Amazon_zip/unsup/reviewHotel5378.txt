Well when I booked this hotel I knew that it was not a luxury hotel. I was on a budget and liked the location. First I booked two double beds for my friend and I, but when I confirmed I was told I had "one cozy bed". The rooms are clean enough but really, really small, like smaller than a dorm room. We didn't have room for our two suitcases, they just had to lay open on the floor and we walked over them. The room was either really hot or really cold and the train and construction is loud so bring ear plugs. Don't expect a view! The worst part was the cleaning. We stayed five nights and our room was only cleaned two times, after we complained. We had to request cups and towels everyday. We ran out of toilet paper and they brought us a half used role! So if you must stay here, bring your own tp, cups, hairdryers, and don't expect a clean room every day! On the bight side, the wifi is free!
