I've come in here a few times and always loved it. I love korean food in general and crisp is more of an americanized korean but still very very good. I have had ordered the baby buddha or also known as the bim bim bop and it's really good. Almost very similar to the actual bim bim bop. I also have had the crisp bbq. That is probably the best bbq wings I've had in Chicago. it's a little spicy, a little sweet. It's really yummy. I also had the plain jane, which is really plain. I don't think I will order that again. The service is fast and friendly. When I order for delivery, it's very fast too. Overall, this place is good.
