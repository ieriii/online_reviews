I'd give its oyster bar a solid 5, but their entrees weren't that impressive. Their 4-6pm half-priced oysters is such a good deal, and the oysters are always fresh and tasty. And we also tried their no rice sushi roll, which was surprisingly very yummy. In summary, go for their happy hour at oyster bar, you can never go wrong with it!
