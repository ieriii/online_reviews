Loved this place! My husband and I went here while visiting Chicago and it was our favorite part of the trip. We got there around 4:30 p.m. and the kitchen didn't open till 5:00 p.m. So we just hung out on the back patio and had some beer. My husband is a beer nerd so he was felicitous from the moment we walked in the door.  You feel very at home on the patio and it's fun checking out the different beers people are ordering. The food was fantastic. The mussels were great and so fresh. The fries were delicious as was the cashew butter sandwich. We also ordered the squash blossums, which were tasty and unusual. I hope to go back the next time we visit Chicago. If I lived there, this would be one of our "places".
