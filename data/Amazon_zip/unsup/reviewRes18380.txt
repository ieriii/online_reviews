There are already over 1,200 reviews of this place, and I'm just as crazy about Xoco as everyone else, so I'll keep this short! I've had the Cubana and Choriqueso tortas, the seafood caldo, churros, and champurrado hot chocolate and all have been outstanding. The DUCK SOUP they have right now though (the special Winter caldo) is absolutely to-die-for. Very large, succulent pieces of duck, deliciously roasted winter root vegetables, plentiful strips of poblano peppers, a very complex and tasty broth, and (this is my favorite part) it's topped with these crunchy strips of beets that I reeeeally need to figure out how to make at home. I just posted a picture of the soup. It is the best thing to get at the restaurant right now, before it turns to Spring.
