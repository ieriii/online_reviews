Recently moved to Lincoln Square neighborhood and heard several recommendations for Garcia's. I love Mexican food, and I was thrilled to try this proclaimed "neighborhood gem". Neighborhood, yes. Gem, not quite....by a long shot. I was going to give one star, but the second star was granted for their prompt friendly service and their excellent, fresh, perfectly spiced salsa. Don't let the delicious salsa blind you to the rest of the sub-par menu. Went there for lunch with a friend (also a Mexican food efficianado). We both commented on the bland, flavorless rice and beans, the mediocre main dishes (ground beef tacos and veggie fajitas), and the green paste-like guacamole, for which they should seriously be ashamed of themselves. I make a mean homemade guac...Perhaps I should consider selling...Anyway, I digress. There are too many great Mexican places in this fine city for me to patronize this establishment ever again.
