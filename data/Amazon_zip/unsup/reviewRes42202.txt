Meh. It's pizza.  I'm not a big fan of deep dish pizza. It reminds me of Pizza the Hut from Spaceballs. And, Pizza the Hut is Teh Nahsty. That being said, I ordered from here because if anything was going to change my mind about Chicago deep dish, it was the Art of Pizza.  My mind? It is unchanged. It was edible but not pleasurable. Some advice: do NOT order a deep dish pizza with sausage, pineapple and something else (peppers?). I let my buddy from Oakland pick the toppings and not only were they nasty (but not Teh Nahsty), but they gave him did-a-dead-cat-crawl-out-of-your-ass? gas. I contemplated kicking him out. Aw man, I am getting a flashback! Ugh. Minus another star for pain and suffering.
