Decided to eat here because of all the good reviews on Yelp. We originally had reservations at the Chicago Firehouse Steakhouse. I switched the reservation because Ruth Chris had better reviews. I was able to switch my open table reservation and get a reservation at 4pm on NYE. We arrived right on time and were sat right away. Our waitress was Petra and right off the bat, she was really nice and explained all the specials and quick background on the restaurant. I liked where they sat us, which was upstairs in a more private setting, than downstairs. It was alot louder downstairs, so whichever night out you want, I would make your reservation requests on that. They give you complimentary bread that was just ok, just was plain bread. I ordered the petite filet with shrimp and it was a generous portion. When you add a salad pre meal and a veggie side. I was stuffed! The meats are all served on a hot plate, which when I say HOT, I mean HOT...I bumped into my plate serval times throughout dinner and almost had second degree burns. Overall the service was great because of Petra, the food was good. It's just not my favorite steak place in Chicago.
