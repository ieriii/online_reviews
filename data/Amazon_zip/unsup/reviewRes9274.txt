I love this family owned restaurant. My husband is from the region and says the food tastes home cooked and makes him a little less homesick. I highly recommend this restaurant whenever your in the mood for babaganoush, kebab, humus etc. The staff is very warm and friendly and I find the prices quite reasonable.
