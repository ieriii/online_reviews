I've been back several times with different groups of people. Everyone always enjoys their food, and I finally broke from my tempeh reuban tradition (it's so yummy--it was tough to try something new) and got the Chicago style tofu. I had my doubts I would like it since they have actual veggie hot dogs on the market, but you know what? It was fantastic. If they took reservations, they'd be 5-star. I get why businesses don' want to take them, seeing as many people are inconsiderate & late, but I think it's unreasonable to not even take them for larger parties. I have twice waited an hour for a table with a group of 6 & a group of 8, and another time we came in a group of 6 or 7 and left because the wait time was just too long. It can be a long wait for 2 or 4, but a crazy wait for a larger group. Wouldn't it make life easier on the restaurant, too, if they knew to expect & plan for a large group? If we aren't there on time, give away the res...too bad for us! I'm just not a fan of waiting when I can make a res elsewhere.
