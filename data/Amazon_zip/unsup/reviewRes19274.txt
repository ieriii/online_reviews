Xoco is one of my favorite spots in Downtown Chicago. When it's mid-day and you're craving some Mexican goodness, Xoco surely provides. Minus one star because there ALWAYS seems to be quite a long line, especially on weekends. Their Tortas are very good but their smaller treats are what keep me coming back. Chips and Guac? Some of the best I've ever had. Xoco Churro? Warm, crispy, cinnamon-y and GONE within minutes. Agua del Dia? Yes, I'll have another! My favorite is the Papaya Agua del Dia. One day, as I was enjoying these treats, I looked up and saw Rick Bayless walking right by me and back into the kitchen. Knowing he was there, probably hopping through his 3 restaurants, it just made everything taste that much better. Although Topolobampo, Xoco's upper-scaled sister restaurant next door, surely proves that you can do Mexican food gourmet (& scrumptiously for that matter), Xoco brings you back to the real reason you fell in love with Mexican food in the first place. It's casual, it's quick, it's hefty, it's a little messy, and it always hits the spot.
