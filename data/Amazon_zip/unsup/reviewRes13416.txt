New neighborhood, new brunch spot. Thank you, Glenn. The weekend brunch menu had the perfect options for both halves of our twosome. He prefers spicy and savory, and I prefer the ridculously sweet (but only on weekend brunch. maybe because when I was little Saturdays were the only days we got to veer from our regular Cheerios and Corn Flakes to indulge in the forbidden "sugared cereals.") Bananas apple foster pancakes? Yes, please. Stuffed with apples, topped with rum soaked bananas and some delicious cream cheese drizzle? Holy high heaven, I had to counteract my sugar rush with cup after cup of black coffee.  It was, in a word, sublime.  And some spicy New Oreans scramble with rice, shrimp, andouille, egg and peppers for him. Two thumbs up. Plus it had this little rice cake that was conveniently located on the edge of the plate nearest me so as to provide the perfect angle for swipes from my fork. Yum. On top of that, our server was top-notch, no wait for coffee refills from anyone, and the hostess went out of her way to grab us a glass of water while we waited for a table. Look out Glenn, I'm coming back soon for dinner.
