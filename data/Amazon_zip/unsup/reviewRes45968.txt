I loved this place! There was a group of about 20 of us that went for work. We had a pre-fix menu (our group requested it). It included a salad with goat cheese and beets which was great (and beautiful presentation). Then choice of three entrees - I selected the salmon - and what a fabulous choice that was. The salmon was perfectly preferred, moist, no fishy taste, and seasoned tp perfection. I couldn't stop eating it! And although we were all stuffed, for dessert we had a duo of creme brulee - one chocolate and one vanilla. Both were fabulous, but the vanilla was over-the-top fantastic! Service was great, too, even with our big group. I will definitely return here!
