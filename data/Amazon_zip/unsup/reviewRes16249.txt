Look ma! I'm cool! Violet Hour is a place that is intended to make it's visitors feel cool, and that's exactly what they achieve. For one, they don't have a sign nor do they advertise, so there's already the allure of being an "insider" that knows about the place. Secondly, it's very chic inside, think velvet curtains and chairs, and lots of WHITE. Drinks are at least $12, and most of them are combinations that you've never had before. They do have a food menu, but last time I was there everything I ate was pretty bad, and honestly, I'd prefer a Subway sandwich to the food at Violet Hour(resulting in the 1 star ding). Socially, you don't go to Violet Hour to meet anyone new. It's just not the right atmosphere for that, but it is the right place to bring a date or impress some out of town friends with how cool you are. The gimmick here is "being cool". If you're already too cool for gimmicks, then I don't think Violet Hour is your place!
