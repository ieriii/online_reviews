Next time I go to Sapori I am going to bring a tape measure, cause the size of my piece of lasagna made me want to get all up in some elementary math. I swear the area of their lasagna sized up at no less than 36 square inches of yummy goodness.   Affordable vino, crusty bread with parm and olive oil. A nice Friday night spot for Saturday am leftovers.
