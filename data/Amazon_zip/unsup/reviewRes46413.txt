Yeah, it's touristy, it's on the Mag Mile. But considering that, it's actually a pretty excellent place. The wait can be kind of long on popular nights, but I don't think I've ever waited more than 45 mins (I don't think that's bad). I've never had a problem with the service, always very fast and friendly. The menu is big and really good. I've never tried anything here that was bad, and most things are really quite delicious.  They have some really good cocktails and the specials are always excellent. So far, this place isn't any different than any other "upscale" eatery. What makes me want to come back again and again and share this place with others are the made to order desserts. They all take at least 30 mins s you have to order them at the beginning of the meal. They're all fantastic. The Chocolate Lava cake is really good, but my favorite are the beignets. They come with three different dipping sauces, and I really like dipping.  I wouldn't hesitate to tell people to come here, not for a local Chicago eating experience, but for a good, moderately priced meal.
