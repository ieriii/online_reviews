If you asked me to review Icosium Kafe two weeks ago, I would have given a 5 star rating, no question. Unfortunately, that has changed.... After my last visit this past Friday, I'm not sure that I will ever return. I suspect that many of these rave reviews are soon to change upon their next visit. Everything has changed. The crepes that were once over sized and stuffed with a variety of amazing fillings are now meek little cigars that make me oh so sad. When I asked about the price change, I was told that the crepes were too expensive and this is more affordable. Not true. The crepe that once cost approximately $9.50 came with soup and would more than accomplish it's job in filling you up. Now, crepes cost $6 each and you would need to get two to come close to satisfying your hunger. This new style leaves you with more crepe than filling and an unfulfilled palate. I honestly think mine had two tomato wedges, 3 mushrooms and 6 cubes of mozzarella. I was also told that if I ordered two crepes the soup was free. Apparently those both have to be savory crepes. Needless to say I am very disappointed and hold on to the hope that with enough requests they will return to their previous style of crepe. p.s. the pictures featured here need to be updated to reflect the new, pathetic, crepes offered. well, I suppose it is better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all. Goodbye Icosium, it was great while it lasted.
