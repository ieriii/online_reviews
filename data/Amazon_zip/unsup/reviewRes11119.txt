After living for a whole year in Chicago, I finally tried the much talked about Bongo Room! I'm a big fan of brunch, so I was pretty excited to check it out! Like any other brunch place, there was about a 20-30 min. wait. The restaurant itself is a bit small, so I always see a pretty large amount of people waiting around outside. But this time, I was determined to wait it out! And I wasn't disappointed! Our server was very friendly and I enjoyed the bright, cheer decor. I ordered on of the french toast specials, which was covered with pears, some sort of cream sauce on the plate and sprinkled in cinnamon, It was absolutely delicious, if not too sweet for me! I'd steer away from it if you don't eat many sweets. So I balanced it out with some of the potatoes on my friend's plate. They're doused with dill and are definitely worth the order! Just dip it in some ketchup or chow down plain! And the omlettes re definitely a yes to order! I'll definitely be back again to try some more of their food!
