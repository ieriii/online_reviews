Last minute change of travel plans (thank you snow in upstate New York) left us to scramble for NYE plans. Great call by the hubsbie to take in "Battle of the Saxes" at Green Mill! Evidently this is a tradition at Green Mill every NYE. Features Von Freeman and Edward Peterson and the Green Mill All Stars. Cover was $25 per person which we felt was pretty appropriate considering our plans were so last-minute I loved the dark, cozy atmosphere of the place. We got there early enough to snag a table near the stage and shared it with some different couples. The music was wonderful. I'm not a Jazz expert, but I was totally wowed by all musicians. Willie Pickens on piano was my favorite. Our waitress was really friendly and I didn't think the drink tab (4 vodka drinks and 6 beers) of $45 was all that bad either (especially for NYE) Oh and Hey, every table got its own bottle of champagne to share when Midnight rolled around--wow, that was unexpected. It was a real treat to meet the musicians after their sets and so refreshing to meet people that feel so passionate about what they love to do. I almost feel like dusting off the ivories on my piano and getting back to playing---well, almost. I think trips to the Green Mill would be easier. Who knows, maybe this will be our NYE tradition now...
