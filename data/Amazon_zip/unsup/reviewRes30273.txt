Quite simply, my favorite restaurant in all of Chicago! And I eat out frequently. Reservations are tricky. My suggestion is pop in for lunch early on a Saturday (or other days)-maybe 11ish and sit at the bar. I suggest you try a couple of their signature margaritas - they will take your breath away! More than 2 and you will be woozy... ok maybe after 1 you will! Enjoy!
