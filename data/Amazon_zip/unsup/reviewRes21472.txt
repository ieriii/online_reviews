I've tried Xoco about 5 times. The food is sometimes alright, and sometimes not good. The service and wait bring the rating down. Even if there is no line, the wait for food is way too long. A big gripe is that I ask for churros with sugar only because I am allergic to the cinnamon chocolate mixture. Sometimes I get what I ask for, sometimes I get regular churros, sometimes I get plain churros (which aren't very good). There are better places around town without the poor service and all the hype. All in all, you'd have to twist my arm to get me to go back.
