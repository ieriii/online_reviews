I went on a Monday evening, with a 3 person reservation at 9:00 pm. We showed up late, but the staff seated us quickly and courteously. The customer service was excellent and the waitstaff was very attentive. They were also very familiar with the menu, which was nice. The 3 stars came from the meal however. We went for their "Lobster Festival" which was happening all June, and they offered a 1 lb. lobster with coleslaw, potatoes and corn for $23. Great deal, but the lobster was the problem. Along with being remarkably small, I've never had lobster that was so... messy inside. The claws were fine, and the tail, albeit small, was fine, but there was a massive amount of excrement and organ debris from all three lobsters. I've cooked my own lobsters, and had lobsters at other restaurants, but never had to slog through that mess in any other instance. All in all, the meal was good, and the price made me overlook the lobster mess. I recommend this restaurant, but if you plan to pay full price for the lobster and get a mess, don't hesitate to say something to your waiter.
