Food is excellent! Pretty cheap too. The only thing I must complain about is the service. Our server (some guy, older, balding) was soooo rude! He deliberately answered back with insulting remarks when we asked questions. At the end, when he got tipped 10%, he still had the guts to approach us about it, He had the balls to say he was just being funny and sarcastic. Sarcasm w/ a roll in the eyes doesn't work when you are working for a tip, idiot! Just go to the bar and eat there, or if you see an older balding guy approaching your table, immediately request another server, SERIOUSLY!!!!
