Loved it, every little bit of it. The best location and really the best service. Honestly I am no hotel aficionado and cant compare it to much so I guess I speak from a disadvantaged position. The design was minimalist by nature and I liked it, the bed was uber comfortable and really the service was excellent. Not a darn reason to not go back again!
