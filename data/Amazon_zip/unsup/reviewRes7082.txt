So I hate to admit when I first saw Chicago q on the Restaurant Week list I passed it up not even wanting to check out the menu. But, I have to give kudos to my dining partner on making me take a second look. I was sure wrong in not wanting to try this place out!  My mouth is salivating just thinking about the kobe brisket, pickles, mac and cheese, hush puppies, honey butter cornbread (more so the honey butter then corn bread was a bit dry) and the key lime pie. A feast fit for a BBQ Queen!  Service was attentive and thankfully not over bearing and I didn't get an eye roll when I asked for more honey butter to pack with my cornbread. I'm definitely coming back with the bf who loves bbq and was annoyed i left him out.
