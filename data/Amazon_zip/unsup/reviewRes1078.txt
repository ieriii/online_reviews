Link Meat...Encased Meat...Hot Dogs...Suss'eege(Italian way to say it), whatever you call it...Hot Doug's takes it to a whole new level. Mary and I wanted to scratch another Best of Hotdog place off our list! Day: cold as hell for May 14 in Chicago  - 47degrees. Line: LONG at 10:20 in the Morning streched to the end of the building. Wait: 45 minutes plus! Conversation: with the couple in front of us...interesting, since we talked nothing but food the whole time and and comparing notes on great places to eat in the city. FOOD: Smoked and Spicy Alligator Sausage with Shrimp Remoulade and Smoked Gouda Cheese (Mine) Pepper Jack Cheese- Stuffed Chicken Chorizo with Tomatillo Mole and Queso Asadero (her) Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel (share) Antelope Sausage with 4-Cheese Dijonnaise and Roasted Red-Spicy Cherry Peppers (share) Duck Fat Fries The Eating Experience Service: awesome...fast and friendly once you actually got into the place. Price: lil on the steep side...when you think of hot dogs...you dont expect to toss down 39 bucks and change for 4 dogs...but for exotic dogs/meats like these they come at a price. Ranking: #1 Gator...nice and gamey..great spice fantastic smoked cheese flavor...worked well with the over taste. Loved it! #2 Chicken Chrizo jack cheese...perfect blend of spicy and mexican flavor...the mole was GOOD! # 3 Antelope Sausage...was a great combo! alot of black pepper flavor with good snap to the casing...really enjoyed it. #4 Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage ...it first this sounds over the top...who puts Foie Gras on a hotdog??? The taste to Me was very sweet...very rich...and the texture was a bit to mushy. Disapointing. Duck fat fries...was good...not greasy for hand cut..and hot when served. Conclusion: Great experience...would love do it again. Hot Doug's will forsure be in our TOP 5 hotdog places to eat in the City.
