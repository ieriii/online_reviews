I only stopped for drinks so I can only review the beautiful 1st floor bar, so sorry if you are looking for a food review, but I do plan on coming back ASAP to try the food. OK, first the bartender was great! He came by and asked everyone what kind of night we were having and just was all around cool. The ambiance was amazing. The bar was clean and crowd was solid.  As far as the drinks well my bartender made special drinks for us and even bought us a round of shots because we made his night enjoyable and he said he had normal people to talk to...SWEET! So all in all I had a great time here and will make this a regular spot from now on!!! I recommend most def if you have not tried it out yet!!! 5+ stars
