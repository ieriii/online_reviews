Fabuloso! Food was delicious and service was prompt and attentive. The atmosphere was lively and colorful (a nice change from the ordinary). We started with assorted ceviches which were fresh and delicious. I thoroughly enjoyed the arrachera (although I did ask for it medium vs. the medium-rare which is typical). Friends enjoyed the daily fish special (halibut) and the pollo. We topped it off with blueberry/peach cobbler. Only caution is if you're looking for a quiet place to talk, this probably isn't it. Formerly the Drink nightclub, this place is HUGE, cavernous and vibrant.
