Seriously how could you not give this place 5 stars? I was traveling on business and co-worker (based in Seattle) told me to check this place out. Well on my way to O'Hare I decided to check it out. I was not disappointed one bit. There was a small line but nothing that would turn me away. The staff was extremely friendly. I simply ordered two hot dogs and a small coke. The price was like $4.75! I almost could not believe how cheep that was!  I went with everything on the dogs (except tomatoes) and loved it. I think the thing that pushes it over the edge of good to great is celery salt. The place is clean, unique and goooooooood. I would most certainly make this a must visit when in Chicago and would recommend it to others.
