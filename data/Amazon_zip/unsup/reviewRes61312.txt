I stumbled across this cafe last weekend, and what a score! I had a sandwich called, "The Lechone". It had juicy roasted pork, caramelized onions and delicious fried sweet plantains, all in the sandwich. Yummy! My friend had the "Cuba-no", which he also enjoyed. The only draw back was that the cafe didn't have tables. It had stools and counters. It's great for lunch. I also love the name!
