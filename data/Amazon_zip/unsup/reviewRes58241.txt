The music is good and the actual location is really beautiful. It is one of the prettiest bars I've been to and the atmosphere was great. But the bartender and waitresses. UGH!! Rude...and slow. I ordered a coke from the waitress and she mumbled something and then I waited for over 15 minutes. So, since there weren't many people, and I was thirsty, I went up to the bar to just get a coke. The bartender said to me, uhhh...you know a coke doesn't have booze. Not jokingly, but like I was an idiot. Why yes, in fact I do know that a coke doesn't have alcohol, that's why I'm ordering it, thank you very much. Then the waitress walks by and says, hey she ordered from me. and gave me the coke on her tray. Granted, he did already have the coke ready to go so I could see his agitation, but I apologized a couple of times and paid the waitress. He gave me a really dirty look and shook his head. Then later when I left the bar to go outside, he purposely gave me a really hard stare down. Way to make the patrons feel comfortable! It is a coke for god's sake! A tiny tiny coke for that matter! If you take away the bartender and waitress and their haughty attitudes, it would have been really nice.
