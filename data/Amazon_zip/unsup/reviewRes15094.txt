Sabatino's has excellent food, and great service to boot. I have been here twice for large parties, once in the upstairs room and once seated at a long table in the back of the restaurant. Both times, the service was impeccable, food was outstanding and the portions are enough to feed you twice. My husband and I eat here frequently and I highly recommend it! If you like fish, the Chilean sea bass is the best I've ever had, and the bartender's make a killer dirty martini.
