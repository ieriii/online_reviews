LOVE this place! And coming form the Northwest suburbs a breeze to get to :-) Awesome food- best ever homemade guacomole, awesome Ropa Vieja, the Churrasco melts in your mouth like I never knew a filet could! The Mojito's are unbelievable as were the Carnivale Margarita's! Everything we tried was fantasic! The ambiance is so beautiful yet warm & inviting with a lot of character. The service was impeccable....this has become my new favorite place that I plan to visit often!
