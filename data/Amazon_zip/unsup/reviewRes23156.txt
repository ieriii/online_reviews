As a visitor to chicago I am amazed at how many reviews this place has, but you have to love a restaurant that posts a yelp review by the door. We waited a while for a table Sat night, but it was well worth it. Like mentioned before they are BYOB (which my Washington DC is SEVERELY lacking), and while we were waiting the guy behind the counter suggested we run across the street to a conveniently located liquor store! We asked for our servers favorite two shakes and he brought out Oatmeal and Oatmeal-Banana. I am a huge fan of both! They were refreshing and helped cool my mouth from all the yummy hot food. For starters we had the fried yuka. Warning to daters: it is covered in tons and tons of yummy garlic. Not just garlic oil, lots of chunks of garlic. I thought it was amazing, but I was burping garlic the rest of the night. : P I had the veggie burrito with mushrooms and it was HUGE and delicious. I couldn't come close to finishing it, but man did i try. The green sauce on the table is amazing. I want to put it on everything I eat. I guess this place is pretty hyped up, but i say its worth it. it would be dangerous if i lived in the delivery zone.... luckily i'm a few hundred of miles outside of it.
