Interesting...somehow I have completely forgotten to write a review for this place, which has become a go-to location of ours for years. Normally I try to avoid the Mag Mile and all its chain restaurants like the plague, but during off-times we end up here quite a lot. Every trip has resulted in perfectly cooked food, great service, and (if planned right) short to no wait times. I'm also very stingy with 5 star reviews, but considering the competition in that area of the city and the expected costs, this just hits the mark. For a kitchen that can roll people in and out in mass quantities I find the food is always spot-on. The Double Stuffed Potato Spring Rolls are a de facto standard and is partially the reason we go here in the first place. Otherwise I usually pick something different for an entree and although the selections never seem that great on the menu the results that arrives at our table always look and taste wonderful. I'm not sure if they need photos or just better descriptions of the food but I continually arrive here less than enthusiastic, but always leave wondering why we don't go there even more often. The only down-side is the ridiculous wait that queues up during normal eating hours and especially on weekend and holidays. During peak hours I'd recommend venturing off of Michigan Ave and use your handy-dandy Yelp app to find some other gems in the city, but if it is off-hours and the downstairs lobby is not packed to the point that the revolving door is wedged full of tourists then don't skip this one.
