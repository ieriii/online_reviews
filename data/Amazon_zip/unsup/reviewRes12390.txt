Went to Cafe 28 on Wednesday night for my husband's bday dinner with a group of friends. What a yummy meal! Everyone left stuffed and happy. We all drank the pomegranate mojitos which were very tasty and a little too easy to suck down. We ordered the bacon wrapped dates- who can resist a bacon wrapped date? Not me. Also started with the baked goat cheese, ceviche and coconut shrimp. All really delicious. Although the bread and butter and baked goat cheese seemed odd for a cuban/mexican restaurant but whatever. They were yummy. I had the pistachio crusted chicken and ordered it with tostones instead of whatever it comes with. The chicken was delish! Really juicy with a delicious pistachio crust- perfect! And it was a massive amount of food- I do not ever take home leftovers. I am a proud member of the clean plate club, however I had one last piece of the chicken for lunch today. Now that says something! ha. Other dishes people ordered were the salmon, ropa viejo, the honey jalepeno pork chops, the pork, all were very happy. Cute atmoshpere, pretty dead on a Wed night- would be fun to go on a weekend when it was more lively, good service, excellent food. I'll be back!
