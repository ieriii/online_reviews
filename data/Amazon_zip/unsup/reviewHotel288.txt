I am in Chicago for an interview and decided to stay at the Seneca because you can not beat the price. I am staying here for 89 bucks a night for 4 days and it is well worth it. My room is huge. It has a living room, kitchen and two closets. Now from what I have seen this is not a normal room. And I asked at the front desk if there is anything special with my room and there isn't anything. I just got lucky. If your coming to Chicago and you want to be close to Michigan Ave but you do not want to spend a lot, then you should check out the Seneca.
