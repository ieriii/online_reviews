I arranged a friend's birthday dinner here. I thought the food was fantastic...the guacamole was perfection, and my pork dish was delicious. I even enjoyed my limeade (nonalcoholic) beverage. I did, however, have to subtract a star due to the attitude of the staff, especially the hostesses. I am a former hostess and I would never speak to customers in the way they spoke to me. I would return again, however, just for that guac! yumm...
