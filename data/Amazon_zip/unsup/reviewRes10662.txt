Love the pizza. Nice, east-coast style thin crust. However, the staff leaves something to be desired. The skinny a-hole boy at the front door has about the worst attitude I've seen in awhile. Lighten up, bub, you work in a friggin' pizza joint! Go for the food, and the eccletic beer menu. But be on the alert for some 'tude from the chatch at the door.
