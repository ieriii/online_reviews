I was IN LOVE with this place. The minute I walked in, I felt like I was on vacation in some sort of tropical destination. We went on the hottest day in Chicago, and yet it was a FABULOUS meal. The patio in the back is wonderful. They have lights hung and cuban music playing to really set an enjoyable mood. They were super flexible with our party which started as a party of 12 and ended up being a party of 7. The server gave us his recommendation (Churrasco and Ropa Viejo), and we were VERY pleased we followed his direction. I got the Churrasca and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was cooked perfectly and was topped with some delivious chimichuri sauce. They even offer Sangria mix (to go with wine that you bring) and mojito mix (to go with the rum that you bring). While I had a bit of sticker shock seeing that it was $12 for the Sangria mix, I still enjoyed it. I cannot wait to make my way back over to 90 Miles!
