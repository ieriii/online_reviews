Definitely not the normal mexican you usually think of, but it's delicious! I loved the spiciness of my sandwich. I got the gunthorp chicken and it was really good. I also got the chocolate churros for dessert and they were very good too. I went on a Saturday at like 2 and waited in like for 45 minutes, but it was definitely worth the wait.
