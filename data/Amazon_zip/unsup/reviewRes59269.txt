I've driven by this place several times and finally got a chance to stop by for dinner. I will definitely be going back -- soon. First, I have to say that the outside looks very cute (which is why I'd always notice it) and the inside is, too. It has cool artwork on the walls and has a laid back feel. They have some great drinks for reasonable prices, like a lychee martini and ginger mojito, I think it was. Now to the sushi. It was fantastic! We ordered 5 different maki rolls, and the green curry, all excellent! It was all fresh, great sauces, and wonderful combinations. I think I have a new favorite sushi place!
