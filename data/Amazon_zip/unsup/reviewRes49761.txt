This is my second visit to this restaurant and didn't feel compelled to leave a review the last time. What we ate? Empanadas-Cicken and Beef -Good Skirt Steak and Calamari Combo-Awesome! Had this both times-$20 Columbian Entree- Can't remember name, but it had pork belly and ribeye steak basically heart attack waiting to happen..lol- Not bad, but still liked the Skirt and Calamari. Service-First time very informative and very pleasant waitress. Service- Second time super slow and food didn't come out for at least 30 to 40 minutes after the appetizer. It made me question whether I would return to this place, but I love the skirt and calamari so I might just ignore how bad the service was. Maybe something was going on this night because it seemed every wait staff was peeping into the kitchen through a little window on the door wondering where? Why? Food was taking so long.
