so what is there to say- it hasn't changed in 30 years.... Food was good, Fun time overall but..... they need to improve their game. Our initial cc was declined- when I called AmEx they told me it went through. Gave them another cc and they only charged half the meal on it. We told them they were wrong and it took yet another long period of time to correct that and give us the appropriate bill... No I am sorry- almost as though it were our issues. Perhaps we should have left when we were ahead... with only half the bill... but we were too honest for that....
