I got seriously, violently ill after eating the mussels here one night. Also, the ham and cheese sandwich was a horrible, greasy, soggy mess. I shudder to even think about that night. To say I was disappointed in my experience here is putting it mildly. I would not eat here again, but the bar is great because it has poltorak mead, which is hard to find. The lambics are great, too. Come only for the drink and partake of the food at your own risk.
