The food was good and the service was outstanding. Our waiter, I think his name was Armad, was excellent. He was very knowledgeable on the wine list as well as the food. I was surprised how fast our food came out especially for a Valentines Day dinner though we did not feel rushed out of there at all. I would definitely go back.
