I think the only thing great about this place is their dessert-like breakfast items. The pancakes are really something, and I understand the hype over them. For anything else, the wait's not worth it. Their Bloody Mary was hugely disappointing, despite us getting the "premium" one. A breakfast / brunch joint that fails to deliver a good bloody really doesn't cut it for me.The Reuben smelled like a wet rag for some reason.....
