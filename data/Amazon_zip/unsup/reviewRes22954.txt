Stopped by with Anders B. to buoy my blood sugar before getting inadvertently tanked at the Map Room. The purported prophylaxis: Pepito with peppers.* Described by some as God's gift to Chicago, the best way I can describe the pepito is as a Costa Rican version of an Italian beef, and if you throw on the peppers I dare you to tell me it doesn't taste exactly like an Italian beef with giardiniera. You won't do it. You CAN'T do it. The sandwich is top tier with warm French break and juicy steak. The fish taco that Anders had was hot stuff as well. Irazu was packed like...umm...Janice Dickinson at Plato's Retreat. My advice to you: If you don't mind staying mobile, get your food to go. Anders and I took this tack and we had our food within five to ten minutes. Otherwise you would be wise to get to Irazu early. The place isn't huge and I can't imagine it takes long for it to fill up. *Forgive the alliteration. I know it's dumb. Also, the pepito did nothing to stymie my inebriation, but the thing was tasty.
