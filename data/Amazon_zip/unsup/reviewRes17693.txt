i've been to all the indian buffets in the city. this is by are the best. First, the cleanliness in this place is a priority. You can tell that. The sizzling tandoori chicken brought to your table puts this restaurant head and shoulders above all others. Recommend lunch buffet if you work downtown. Downside.... you're back in the office and wearing the aroma from the food as your new fragrance.
