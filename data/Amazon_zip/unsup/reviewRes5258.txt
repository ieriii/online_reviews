Cheese, Swine & Wine - what more do you need to know? I was in town for work staying at the Intercontinental and wanted to find a place nearby to get a light dinner and glass of wine. I walked in as a party of 1 and only had to wait a few minutes as the hostess tried to determine which communal table to place me at. The bar was completely full but since they had several communal tables I only had to wait a few minutes to be seated. The tables are a bit tight on space - they are high with as many chairs that will fit as possible. I'll assume she realized that I was not from here and wouldn't be able to handle the cold and sat me inside away from the door. ;p The wine list was fairly long with Italian and Spanish varietals which will pair perfectly with the tapas style dishes. There was a lot to select from and it was so hard to pick just a couple of dishes as there were many I wanted to try, but this would be a great place to come with a few others to share many dishes. I started with the Roasted Beets with Goat Cheese and Pistachio Vinaigrette and then got the Jamon Serrano with mushrooms and farm fresh egg. I was bummed they didn't have the butterscotch pudding but had their affogato which came with chocolate soft serve - different, almost like having a mocha. Overall my meal was very good, only complaint was that my grilled bread was a little over grilled so it was very hard to cut through the crust. Had great conversations with a few strangers at the communal table - funny that 2 were from California.
