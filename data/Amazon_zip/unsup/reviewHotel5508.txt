I used to live next door to this hotel in the early 90s, before Best Western took it over. At that time it was an SRO, full of hustlers and discarded senior citizens. I hope Best Western brought in an exorcist, along with the fumigators and structural engineers. Be aware that if you are one the south side of the building, you window will have a view into the bedrooms of one of the courtyard buildings on Roscoe.
