We went to Carnivale one Saturday night in a group of 10. It was a rainy night, so we used valet parking for $5. The place has colorful decor with multicolored checker-board stained-glass ceiling, huge colorful paper drum lamps and paper flowers. The decor was fun and vibrant and made me smile After we were seated, the server served us guacamole and chips (I think it was complimentary but I don't remember). The glauc was fresh and nice. The chips, on the other hand, were oily and really sad. We have several vegetarians in the group. The only two entree options were Gnocchi and some kind of a platter. The two veggie sides were mac+cheese (with no addition of the bacon) and house salad. We ordered the gnocchi which was quite passable but tending on blah. Considering the quantity and quality of food, I thought Carnivale was a tad expensive. Expect to spend $30 per person without the drinks. I won't be back for the food. But, I might come back with out-of-town friends to enjoy the decor and ambience.
