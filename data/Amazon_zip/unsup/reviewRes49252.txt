This place has totally changed since the last time I was there, it now resembles a restaurant more than a lounge, gone are most of the couches--replaced by tables instead and much more muted lighting in the dining area. Seating is still a little tight and tables are too close together. The mozzarella and Camembert my friend and I had with our wine flights were not that great. I got the Argentinian red flight and my friend sampled the sexy red flight, both were decent but not fabulous. Because I'm still not impressed by their appetizers/cheeses, I can't give them any additional stars. Again, I would stay away from the pricey food/appetizers and just stick to drinks.
