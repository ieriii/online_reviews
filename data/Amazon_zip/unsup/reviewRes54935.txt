Named in homage to a SR22 insurance company television commercial mascot, this establishment features chill food and delicious atmosphere; it's like Montmartre meets Portland in Lil' San Juan. My only problem: when do I get to come back? No, seriously, when will that restraining order be lifted? I luv you, Longman & Eagle! Lay an egg on my car hood before the locals steal my car battery!
