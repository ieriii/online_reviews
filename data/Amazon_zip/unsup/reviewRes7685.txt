This is our second time back here. I was equally impressed on this second visit. After our attempt to eat outdoors was squashed by a mosquito cloud, I am actually thankful we moved inside. The inside is dim, friendly, and just noisy enough to have a conversation with your table but know that not everyone around you can hear. The food was phenomenal. We started with the special of the night; an avocado bruschetta. The plate was cleared entirely immediately. For dinner I ordered the Cappellacci di Zucca (pumpking stuffed ravioli). It was amazing! The other 3 dishes that were ordered were equally amazing. Everyone left the restaurant full and satisfied (especially after we each ordered our own dessert). I would definitely go back.
