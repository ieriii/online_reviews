I'm new to the neighborhood and finally chose to stop her to get my coffee in the morning. I was impressed by the intricate cakes displayed in the windows. Although the inside it quite small the coffee and my bagel were Delicious. i also noticed the area next store where i could see myself stopping on my way home to catch up on some work. I will definitely be back soon
