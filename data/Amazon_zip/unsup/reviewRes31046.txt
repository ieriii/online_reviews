If the prices weren't so high it would have gotten four stars. It just wasn't worth the money. The steak was delicious but not worth the price. Expect to drop about $70 a person just for dinner, no drinks. Our drinks got comped because we had to go up and down the elevator a few times while they decided where to seat us. The sides are served family-style, and the waiters serve you when they first bring them to the table. The mac & cheese was good. I thought $10 was a ridiculous price for sides until I saw they were enough to make a meal out of by themselves. We also got the mashed potatoes and creamed corn. Lawry's corn is better. Anyway it was nice to try something new, but I won't be going back.
