Came here to celebrate Mia, Tony, and my mother-in-law's birthday. It was an awesome experience set up by Tammy and her fiance. It was our first time there and we all really enjoyed the food. Tammy and Leo did a great job picking out our dinner that evening since they were well acquainted with the food from previous dining experience. We had the Peking Duck (comes with the sliced duck & buns, rice, and soup), lobster, steamed clams, bbq pork, roasted pig, and steam chinese broccoli with oyster sauce. Tamia and Tia loved the bbq pork, duck and broccoli, so that was a big plus because they are finicky eaters. I loved everything we ate. You get to build your own nifty duck sandwich. They take what's leftover from the duck after carving it, and turns it into soup and fried rice. Nothing really stood us for us beside the Peking Duck. I guess the big plus for me is because it doesn't look so dingy inside as it does Hon-kee. Sun Wah is definitely worth trying. It's byob. Very inexpensive. Customer service is on and off so don't get all thrown off when they forget of you. SPEAK UP and they'll come.
