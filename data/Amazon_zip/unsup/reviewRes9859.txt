Some highlights... ravioli with mushroom and asparagus braised beef with pea tip greens Do not get the fish - it tasted so dead. Lastly...the waiter tried to speak Japanese to a table of middle aged Chinese ladies, which was kind of funny, until he said 'I don't know, all look the same to me' while making slanty eyes with his hands. I was a little shocked to say the least. He was older and seemed to be an Italian immigrant, so probably more ignorant than anything..
