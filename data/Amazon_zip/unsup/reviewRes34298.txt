Second time here in a long time, forgot how cheap and filling and different this place is, I should go more! Of of the few places that didn't have a 45 minute wait in the general vicinity. Part store and part restaurant, they have a salad/variety bar to get food by the pound and a menu of sandwiches and dinners.  Only gripe was my utter inability to understand a word that the guys serving food and taking orders were saying, although they were plainly American and speaking English. It took me several tries to actually order something on the menu that they actually had left for the night, and half the time I couldn't tell that they were actaully taking to me. But eventually I got something to eat, whatever it was, and it was good.
