had the pleasure of going back to the gage this past weekend, where i was able to sit outside with the boy, my bf, and her mom for a little birthday celebration. needless to say, i have gotten over my fear of the bathroom in the basement, and the tables were nice and spread out on the outside patio. this time around we opted for beers as our drinks, as it was in the mid-80s at 9 pm and we needed something refreshing. us girls stuck to familiar beers, where the boy strayed away and chose a new beer. for the eats we started with the cheese board, where each cheese was perfectly paired with an accompaniment (such as honeycomb, pineapple jelly, and candied walnuts). for entrees, i had the lemon tofu, while my fellow diners had the chicken, the short-rib with fusilloni, and the venison burger. being vegetarian now, i was unable to sample the others' dishes, but let's just say we were all members of the clean plate club that night. everything was absolutely delicious, where my lemon tofu was nicely balanced with a pea curry puree, mushrooms, and israeli couscous. de.vine. i also want to send a shout-out to tony, our waiter, for his great energy and recommendations throughout the night! having a great staff makes all the difference. until next time (which will come soon)...
