Great vegan/vegetarian restaurant in Boys Town, don't forget to check this place out. Once you step inside, it gives off a cool vibe in this old-school diner type of establishment - kind of dark, but that's okay. You can either choose to sit in or outside. I had the 'Crab' Cakes entree which comes with seasoned & baked tofu patties with remoulade sauce - the sauce was tangy and creamy, which was great with the 'crab' cakes, (which tasted a bit like crab, I must say). It also comes with brown rice mix & sauteed vegetable medley, which was sauteed slightly, so it was pretty crunchy and good. Don't forget to get a side of stir-fried seitan with onions - it is salty, lovely, and DELICIOUS! They're like thin strips of tofu-like meat (sort of reminded me of flat fishcakes), and it's so darn tasty! I also had their Raw Blueberry Cheesecake - it was SO FANTASTIC! Yum!!! Creamy, blueberry-ish, and cold! I had their Vegan Milkshake with a scoop of soy ice cream and you have a choice of soy milk or orange juice to mix it all up - get the OJ - it is like a vegan Orange Dreamsicle. Always filling your glass with Chicago's finest tap water, great service, and have extremely nice servers.
