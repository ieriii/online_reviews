I brunch a lot. I try to eat at a new brunch place every month and every time I do, I always buy a scone. The scone is my yardstick, my Big Mac index if you will on how brunch places compare to one another. To me, omelettes taste the same across different restaurants, but scones can have so many interpretations and ingredients--it's exciting every time I try one! I've been a fan of scones ever since my mom bought me those triangular-shaped blueberry scones from Safeway when I was a little girl. I think it's safe to say that I've eaten a lot of scones in my lifetime, but never in my life have I come across scones such as the ones from 3rd Coast. For one thing, these scones are shaped like a dome and are bigger than my fist so they are heartier than most scones out there. The scones come out warm and toasty as if they're arriving straight from the oven. The outside of the scone is hard and dry, which makes you think the scone will be like that on the inside. But, once you break off a piece of the scone, you can see that the inside is soft with huge chunks of fruit and the scone just melts in your mouth. This is exactly how I envisioned the perfect scone to be! Tough as a rock on the outside, but cozy and fluffy on the inside. I think 3rd Coast has only three varieties: raspberry, chocolate chip and blueberry. The chocolate chip scone tastes like a giant butter chocolate chip cookie, which is fine with me. The raspberry scone is a little too tart for my taste, but the blueberry scone is just divine. I visited Chicago recently and I bought 6 scones to bring back to California. Each scone is $2.50 each, which I think is a bargain when you're paying for a scone the size of a softball. The scones weren't as fresh as they would be if you dined in, but the crumbly, buttery taste was still there. If you ever make a stop in Chicago, you have to try the best scones in the country--I dare you to prove me wrong!
