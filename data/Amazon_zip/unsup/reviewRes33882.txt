Quite possibly the best Italian food in Chicago. Reasonalble prices, friendly staff and tasty original dishes. No chicken parm served with french fries like some other fake Italian restaurants. In fact they don't even serve chicken parm, they come up with more original dishes that will blow you away and have you coming back for more..even if it means waiting an hour for a table! It's so worth it. Try to make reservations, because they do get busy. Without reservations you will wait so if you show up without reservations and don't have the patience to wait for your table, go down the street and settle for mediocrity at Leona's or Chicago Pizza. You can surly be seated right away at those lovely establishments.
