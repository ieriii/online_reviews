Go here for the pho and stay away from other items on the menu. This is the most popular Vietnamese restaurant on Argyle, it's usually always busy. Service is fast and they get people in and out quickly. If you have a large group or are introducing someone to pho this is a perfect place. I've been fortunate enough to have some home cooked Vietnamese food and I have to tell you it's a different ball game. I feel like the pho here has a decent amount of MSG added to the broth and that's over compensating for a broth that lacks the long slow cooking that is involved in making a great rich broth. I've been here about 6 times and have tried other things on their menu. It's one of those situations though where I'm hesitant on my food choice and always end up wishing I got the pho. Their bubble tea is the only bubble tea I've ever thrown away after a few sips. I wanted to like their frozen yogurt but it was in the freezer little too long and that caused it to be more ice than the yogurt I was looking for.
