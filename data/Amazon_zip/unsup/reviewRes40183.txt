Update! Recently had brunch at L&E and was really impressed. We had the bacon bourbon glazed donuts to start, or should I say "donut" - singular. One was enough for four of us to enjoy! Everyone loved their food, and there were some really great choices. From the usual and traditional brunch fare to some really unique dishes. Also, we recently ate dinner at L&E and the pulled boar was delicious, as is their comfy soft pretzel appetizer. We have brought lots of out of town guests to L&E and everyone comes away impressed! Keep it up!
