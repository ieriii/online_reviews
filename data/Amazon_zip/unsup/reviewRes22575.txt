On my way to the airport, headed back to Cali, I had to stop at Superdawg before I left. I have seen it so many times on Hot Dog documentaries that I had to see it for myself. So I park my car for the car-hop service. I order the Superdawg with a side of onion chips. The waitress brings it out to my car five minutes later. We open our boxes and my face lights up. From the poppy seed bun and bright green relish, to the crispy fries, this looked to be a delicious dog. It didn't disappoint. I especially love that they don't put ketchup in the hot dog. Hot dog was delicious, fries yummy, and onion chips were damn tasty. Chicago 1, New York 1.
