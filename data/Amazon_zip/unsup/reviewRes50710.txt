Three and a half. The consensus is dead-on. The beignet treat to start out the meal was a nice surprise, and I have to say, the non-menu mimosa was fine (and CHEAP, I thought). I also LOVED the fried green tomatoes. The remoulade on them was delicious, although I didn't like the pickled shrimp so much. I think that's an just a taste issue, however, and not so much that the shrimp were bad. Other people at the table enjoyed pumpkin pancakes; other people at the table did not enjoy the baked apple very much. (It wasn't done enough inside.) My boyfriend had the cottage cheese pancakes, and like them--I had a bite, and thought they were quite good. I had the Eggs Romero, and I think I'm just not a huge grits fan. But I adored the pulled pork (and the BBQ sauce), and the poached eggs were...poached eggs.  I'd love to try dinner here, and I'd even like to make a return brunch trip, to try something else. I'm not sure it's quite worth the haul to Andersonville all the time, but it's worth it every once in a while.
