Geja's Cafe is hands down one of the most romantic places I have been too. I'm not sure if I equate making your own food with romance, but I still love this place. While people say it is small, I think that gives it a more intimate setting. We were a few minutes early, and still waiting for one of our party members, so we waited around the bar area, and took in the beautiful flickering candles and general ambiance. Once seated... we were in a comfortable booth, which was perfect because their were 4 of us. Our waiter was very helpful, as we had never been there before. He explained all of the different dinners and combination. Fortunately, I was with a group that really liked to eat, so we went all out and ordered the Prince Geja's Combination. Wow, talk about a lot of food: We started with a salad and the cheese-fondue... the melted cheese was full of flavor! Very good! Then came the meats: Aged beef tenderloin, lobster tail, jumbo shrimp, Atlantic sea scallops and boneless chicken breast. I especially appreciated the variety of assorted dipping sauces that accompanied the dinner course. Once word: ridiculous. But in a good way! It was a ridiculous amount of food and it was ridiculously good. We enjoyed doing our little meat-cooking session, even though we were all a bit apprehensive at first. Our waiter answered our questions and was very helpful. All of the meats/seafood were excellent, it was hard to pick a favorite! We all ate so much, it was difficult to eat much dessert, we all had one or two dips of the yummy flaming chocolate dessert fondue then had to call it quits before the food-coma set in.... Geja's Cafe will always have a spot in my heart.... and I will be visiting this exceptional restaurant again soon.
