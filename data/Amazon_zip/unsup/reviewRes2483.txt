This place is no joke! I had been greatly anticipating my trip here after watching it on 3 TV shows and reading all the mouth-watering reviews on Yelp. Thank god my brother lives no more than 2 miles away and lent me his car for the day.  We made the short drive over on Friday morning and arrived at about 10:10. By this time there was a decent 20-person line outside with half of them being locals and the other half being tourists (the ones taking pictures of the line and signs....like me). The place opened promptly at 10:30 and we were at the counter ordering by 10:50.  The two of us shared four dogs: Scott Christman - Swiss Cheese Smoked Knackwurst w/ smoked paprika mayonnaise & smoked provolone cheese, Ribeye Steak Sausage w/ Horseradish Cream Sauce, a Keira Knightley, and a regular Chicago Dog. And of course we got an order of duck fat fries. My favorite was definitely the Scott Christman, which had a really nice smokey flavor and loads of cheesey goodness. While I can't attest to how the duck fat fries compare to the regular fries, they were unbelievably good and lived up to the hype.  Oh yeah and Doug? One of the nicest guys you'll ever meet. You can see any sense of impatience disappear from the people in line as soon as they get to the counter talk to Doug. Plus he paces the line nicely so that there's always an open table. Really the only thing that could make this place better is if they cloned Doug and they opened up locations throughout the country.
