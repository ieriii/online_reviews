This hotel is the only property physically connected to McCormick Place, which makes it popular for exhibitors who want to be right next to the convention center. The hotel facilities are all nice and relatively new, but wouldn't you rather stay somewhere in the downtown area? Staying here isolates you from the action that is in Chicago.
