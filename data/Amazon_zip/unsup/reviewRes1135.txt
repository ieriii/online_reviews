Seriously a great place to eat!  Yes, you're going to wait in line 99% of the time, but it doesn't really matter once you get up to the counter. Doug is always pleasant, you you can tell he's genuinely thankful that you've come in. No matter how long the line he takes the time to say hello. As for the food. What more can be said that hasn't been in the hundreds of reviews? The place is amazing, and his creations are always unique and tasty. This is one place I'll just point to the specials because I know anything I get it going to be great.
