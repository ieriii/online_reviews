As a huge pizza fan, it is hard for me to give any one pizza place 5 stars...but Pequod's definitely deserves it. The caramelized crust is unlike any other Chicago deep dish and the sauce and toppings are extremely fresh. But the best part of Pequod's is their lunch special. $4.95 for a 7" one topping deep dish pizza and a draft beer or pop. The pizza is hearty so a 7" is definitely enough for even big eaters, but I wouldn't expect to have leftovers! On rare occasions the wait can be longer than expected for pizza, but it is well worth it!
