When I first moved to the Ravenswood/Lincoln Square neighborhood, I was trying to find a good pizza. A friend who used to live in Andersonville recommended Calo, saying they had the best thin crust, so I went on her recommendation and she was right. The thin crust is excellent. It's tasty and it's not overwhelming with the sauce or the cheese. The best thing is that even the next day it's still unbelievably good cold. I've been ordering from Calo every so often. When they appeared on GrubHub a while back, I was ecstatic, being the slave to modern convenience that I am. Since then they have disappeared from the site. I will still keep ordering the hard way, though, and I will keep trying to drag my friends there when they visit. It's that good.
