What can I say, I didn't really know who Rick Bayless was even after my friend told me. I never watched Top Chef Masters, I didn't know he owned a corner of Clarke and Illinois, nor did I know that he takes his staff on yearly trip to Mexico, for culinary inspiration, how Awesome is that!! According to Rick's website, XOCO is slang for "little sister" in ancient Aztec language, didn't know that either. ;) What I did know is that everybody and their mothers were raving about Xoco, so of course I wanted to try it. The tortas were very flavorful, specially with some of the habanero salsa we had at our table. The only thing I didn't really like was the hard crusty bread. I mean, it was pretty hard for a torta, but that might be his little spin and other people like it, so if it's not broken why fix it right? The pozole that I had was in a white broth and it had chicken in it, very different from traditional red pork pozole but it was alright. There was no way in hell I was going to be trying my friends Pork BELLY soup...ughh, but she liked it. (Ok, Ok, after talking with Renita M. I don't think the pork belly soup would have been that bad. I'll give it a shot next time). The churros were great. No filling, just simple crunchy but soft on the inside rolled in sugar churros. I regret not getting any chocolate now that I think about it. The agua del dia that I had was very limey, thing is, lime wasn't an ingredient...but it was refreshing. They have sparkling water on tap. I thought "that's for stuck up people", I changed my mind after the second glass ;) Overall the experience was nice. Soon, I'll be trying out the other two Rick Bayless restaurants. No doubt.
