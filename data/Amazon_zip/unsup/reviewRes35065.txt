The 5 stars is courtesy of my husband for I am a vegetarian who never liked fish and is allergic to shellfish so... I cannot really write a review on a seafood restaurant.  HOWEVER... I did rather enjoy my mixed greens salad and I LOVED the bread.  We came here on a Wednesday night on my husband's birthday. He wanted seafood and because of my... complications he is very rarely able to enjoy said cuisine so he takes advantage of the one day a year when he gets to choose where he wants to go. We had a 7:15 reservation. Like I said before, I ordered the mixed greens salad and ate copious quantities of delicous bread.  My husband ordered stone crab claws or something as an appetizer and whitefish for his entree. He also ordered a side of the au gratin potatoes. Ahh, and he ordered clam chowder which he describes as "verrrrrry good, it was very fresh." I was set with my bread and salad and I was going to order a side of macaroni and cheese but then our waiter said they could make me a plate of grilled vegetables and I'm very glad I decided to order it because they were soooooooo good.  It seems like fewer and fewer restaurants still do this, but at the end of our meal, they brought him out a piece of chocolate cake with a candle stuck in it - NO CHARGE.  I allowed myself one bite of it, and of course it was delicious. THe husband also ordered a slice of pecan pie since that is his absolute favorite. He ended up taking the desserts to go since we were both so stuffed.  We've been pretty frugal lately so it was nice to splurge a little and get top notch service.
