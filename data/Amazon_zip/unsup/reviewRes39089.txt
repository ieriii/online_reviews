I've read review after review about the poor service at San Soo Gab San. I cannot say I've experienced the same. In most cases my service has been outstanding. Aside from all that the BBQ is what it's all about. The kailbi, bulgogi and dak kailbi are great. And the value is almost unmatched. Several panchan dishes, miso soup and each order of meat is plentiful. I will not argue with the fact that if you go with someone fluent in Korean the experience is even better. Of all the Korean BBQ restaurants in city limits (I've tried nearly all of them) this one is the best value and best food.
