Pequod's pizza doesn't taste like anyone else's pizza, so they've got that going for them, which is nice. But, they had a fire a few years back and I don't think their pizza has been as good since. I know this place gets great reviews and I just wanted to include my opinion because a friend went recently and was disappointed after reading so many glowing reviews. Everyone has different taste in pizza and in my book Pequod's pizza is just average.
