I tried to snap pics of the food, but it looked so good that my fork wold get to it faster than this old I-phone - And that was pretty much the theme of the night. 20 minutes earlier, when I first walked in, I instantly felt the authenticity and charm, it's as if my cab dropped me off in Greece itself. The food was not to disappoint either To be honest it was the best Greek food I've ever had! I am in Chicago on business so I am dining alone, which makes me super attentive to nothing but the food, as there is no company to enjoy! In fact as I am writing this I am secretly trying to convince myself that I should come here one more time before I leave town :). I ordered cold lima beans, Greek salad which came with a fresh block of feta on top and a delicious virgin olive oil dressing and moussaka for the main course. The moussaka melts in your mouth and it had a nice thick yet buttery layer of potatoe on the bottom. It was also served with a piece of a piece of perfectly seasoned garlic potato baked in the oven. All were extremely delicious. I'll end this by saying that the food was soo good, I ordered dessert, Yes I did! and this after cleaning out the generous portions of the items I mentioned above (by the way I was shocked by my behavior as well). I figured if the food was this good then dessert is not to be missed. I was right and finished the entire Tiramisu. Sadly however I had to walk the few cold miles back to my hotel to make up for the splurge! Totally worth it, YUM!
