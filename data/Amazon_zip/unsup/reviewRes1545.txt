If there was a six star rating, I would have given it. My husband and I ordered two hot dogs each (please don't judge us), and the duck fat fries....I had not one ounce of eaters remorse, only regret that I didn't order three...:-D I'm just sayin!!! I've been here twice now, I'd come more often but I live in the burbs. I did especially love the Foie Gras & Sauternes Duck Sausage, I had it both times I went. Who new hot dogs could be so classy. Expect to wait in line 30-40 minutes, it's not hype, it's edible art and Doug is a master.
