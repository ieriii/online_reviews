Oh Yolk, how I love thee name. Scrambled, sunny side, over easy, you name and I'll eat it especially that delicious yellow goodness of a Yolk. Came here after a race downtown on a Sunday morning and boy were thou busy! Possibly overly busy due to the a lot of race participants looking for some grub and oj to keep them from dropping over. The PA system worked well, people outside heard them, but they did favor people they "knew" over others that have been waiting for 20 minutes or more. But who doesn't play favorites when their friends walk in? I opted for the Southwest Benny (http://www.yelp.com/user) which was pretty decent, love the chorizo. My right arm man, the bf went with the French Toast Combo (http://www.yelp.com/user) which he enjoyed, but he's had better FT before. I wish I had the same love for thou as I do for the Yolk itself, unfortunately, since I'm a suburbanite I wouldn't travel the great distance.
