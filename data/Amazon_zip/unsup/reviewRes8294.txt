Been here twice, and this place just blows my mind away - never mind the salad bar, I basically went almost all out for the placecard facing up; meat with more meat with even more meat. The pork links were especially good, as were the various beef and pork cuts - all excellent. But don't forget the sides - the cheese bread, the fried bananas, and mashed potatoes to just name a few and all something that your mouth and taste buds will love you! Great place for the seasoned (and unseasoned too) folk who like a nice cutlet of meat, along with some veggies and sides too. Oh, and the drink Caipirinha, whoa mama...its as potent, if not more, than Bob Chinn's Mai Tai's. But if you don't like mixed drinks, they do have beers too. Worth the price and then some...and then some more...
