I love this place and can't get enough of it. I eat here 2-3 times a week and have yet to be disappointed. The menu is huge, diverse and if there is something you want that isn't listed they'll figure it out and make it for you. The quality of the food is fresh, consistent and delicious. A few of the people who work there go out of their way to be friendly, and those who don't aren't rude. The place is packed from open to close and I have yet to ever have a bad meal or experience there.
