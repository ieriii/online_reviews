Was introduced to this place by friends and had a great meal for our first fondue experience. We also would of never stopped here just by walking by. This is a long meal (hour and a half plus), multiple courses and on the expensive side. Cheese founde was my favorite part of the meal. You choose a meet entree and also get a chocolate founde dessert. Get the coffee at the end of the meal, excellent. Wine list impressive, beer selection not so much. Overall a great place for special occasion. Not recommended for over a group of 4.
