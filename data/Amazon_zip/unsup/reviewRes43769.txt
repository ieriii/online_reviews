Went here with 2 friends for a Saturday brunch. It's a small cafe with an outside sitting area w/ umbrellas which is nice! We had the pancakes w/ nectarines on top and the huevos rancheros? They both were pretty scrumptous. And for the price was totally well worth it. The entrees are about $7 for brunch. Will definitely come back again!
