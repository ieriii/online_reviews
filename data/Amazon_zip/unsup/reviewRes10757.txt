We've been here for brunch several times, and every time the food is really good. Today, the food was definitely the best I've tasted come out of their kitchen. I had the Beef Tenderloin Benedict with Potatoes. The steak was perfectly cooked, the english muffin perfectly toasted, the egg had a perfectly runny yolk, the potatoes were perfectly spiced, and the porcini hollandaise was perfectly addicting. Yeah, it was perfect. I was tempted to lick the plate. So why not five stars? Well, I hate the wait, and I'm not in love with their space. If you're lucky enough to get one of the booths, it's great. There's lots of room and people who are walking by or waiting are less likely to bump into you. But the rest of the tables are really small, and the area around them is cramped. I can't imagine what the hassle would be like for someone with special needs or a wheelchair.
