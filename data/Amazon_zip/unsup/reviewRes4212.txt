Amazing. It's without a doubt the best food in Chicago (better than Alinea I thought) and the price is a steal. The quali egg ravioli is out of this world. The atmosphere is unexpectedly casual but it worked for me. I didn't think I'd ever say this, but it was well worth the frustrating reservation process.
