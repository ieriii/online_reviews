I've only been here once and am not a frequent visitor like Lauren d. ;) but thanks to her I wanted to try it. I love, love the vibe and the space. I feel like anywhere you sit you won't be disappointed. The service is great and the food was excellent. We had the peach salad and gnocchi which was mouth watering! The drinks were great too and you don't find too many "hip" spots that serve PBR for $2 - without all the hipsters. They had a lot of other great beer on tap: two brothers, three floyds, etc. I was a huge fan of the music playing too- some of my favorite bands. And no lady gaga. I look forward to going back!
