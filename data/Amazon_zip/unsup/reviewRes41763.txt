I've been meaning to visit Gilt Bar for a while, but things always got in the way. I finally came here with a friend last week, and am sad I'd waited so long. As a starter, garlic lovers can go for the simple option of a ton of roasted garlic cloves served with a loaf of bread, olive oil and balsamic. I tried the ricotta gnocchi (with peas, pork belly and lemon), and it was, by far, one of the best gnocchi dishes I've had. Continuing in the porky theme, I had the duroc pork belly with more peas and a delicious herby farro. Cocktails were delicious, and they have an excellent craft beer list. Pro-tip: The place is dark, and would make a great date spot for the facially challenged.
