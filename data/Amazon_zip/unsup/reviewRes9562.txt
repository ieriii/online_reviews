Amazing. What a fantastic little spot to have a lovely date night. The waiter described the menu as a "choose your own adventure." I love when people play to my childhood nostalgia. That said, the food here is all grown up. Me: Octopus, lamb, lemon Boy: Veal, vennison, butternut I think I preferred my selections to his, except for dessert. The butternut was very interesting and the lemon was a little strong for me. He preferred my octopus to his veal due to textural dislikes. The veal was just across the line into mushy territory. Our "extras": passion fruit sparkling Riesling shaved ice, "grown up" grilled cheese with white cheddar and apples paired with a fruity sauvignon blanc. Ambiance: small with a fair amount of noise on a busy night, but the staff is acutely aware of the space and didn't bump my chair once. Add in a yummy bottle of syrah and a hot date and you're in business! I should also note that they were incredibly gracious when I spilled a glass of water all over the floor. (We were waiting for the check and having a thumb war. At least nothing broke.) I think there is some kind of monetary threshold that, once crossed, means people have to put up with a little bit of crazy from you.
