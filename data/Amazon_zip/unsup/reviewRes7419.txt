Amazing service, food and pricing. I have to commit to working out for a week after each visit, or I would be here much more often. The first time I came, I brought my mom on the recommendation of a friend. We were seated right away with huge smiles from the waitstaff. Our waiter was quite knowledgeable of both the food and wine, and provided a spot-on wine recommendation and also suggested a few dishes we would like. Wow did we! There was this pumpkin, butternut squash pasta situation that was absolutely to die for. When we were done, our waiter came back and just pointed to a dessert. No words, just a "you must eat this" look. It was great! All in all, this cute restaurant is by far one of the best in the city. It feels so welcoming and neighborhood-y, and the food is always great. Plus, they constantly have coupons and special offers for date nights, tapas and family-style dining. Perfect for dates, friends and out of town visitors!
