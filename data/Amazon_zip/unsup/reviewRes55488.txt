The food was good enough and the pizza we split was delicious, however the service was among the WORST we had ever had. The waiter had an attitude from the moment we sat down and was disgruntled to see we had brought our own bottle of wine. Really? Why the attitude when you charge a $15 corkage fee? I suppose this was the reason why the waiter refused to return to our table ONCE to fill our glasses. Once the food arrived, the waiter disappeared for 20 minutes. Good thing they have much more attentive bussers who were able to assist us. Long and short, the food is not nearly great enough to overcome poor, unattentive service. Fortunately, we have many great Italian restaurants in this town to go back to!
