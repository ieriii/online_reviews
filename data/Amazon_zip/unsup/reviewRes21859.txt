The Mayan Palace is one of the better options for Mexican in Lincoln Park. Come prepared with an appetite: the portions are generous and the staff keeps the free chips and salsa coming. And, most importantly, Tuesdays and Thursdays are home to the always-popular half-price margarita night. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu, although I did have an unfortunate incident a few months back with some undercooked chorizo the Mayan enchiladas. Still, affordable tasty Mexican and mean margaritas will keep me coming here for a long time.
