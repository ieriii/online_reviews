If nothing else, you need to go to Sultans Market because the falafel sandwich is $3. Picture this: a couple of falafel balls, hummus, and Jerusalem salad, all wrapped up in warm pita goodness. Plus they'll add as much spicy Sriracha sauce as you want. And did I mention that its $3! Also, the J.ru salad deserves a special shout out because its so awesome and very finely chopped, might I add. Seriously, Sultans Market has the most cheaptastic food, I just want to move in!
