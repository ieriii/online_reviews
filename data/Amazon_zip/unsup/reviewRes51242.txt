YUM! The food is soooo good. I like to try something different everytime. Most recently it was crunchy french toast - that was a very smart decision! You definitely want to get here early to beat the crowds, especially on Sunday mornings. My only complaint is that the tables are really close together - it's hard to avoid eavesdropping on the couple 12 inches to your rights. So if you aren't an insanely private person, you may even make a friend. Other than that, the food is probably some of the best I've had, and the service is really good (not that fake kind I've grown to detest). See you there next weekend!
