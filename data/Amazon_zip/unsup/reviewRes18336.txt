All right, so I went back, and the seating went okay. They asked if I had a reservation; I reminded them that their web site says no reservations for parties smaller than six (we had five), and they were completely friendly after that. The food was so good I nearly wept. Just ... just ... wow. God. Man. So effing good. Just go. Really, just go.
