I am a frequent business traveler throughout the United States and I get to Chicago at least half a dozen times each year. As a creature of habit and loyal to quality brands I typically stay in the same hotels and even the same rooms. I recently received an e-mail from the good folks at Club Carlson about the Radisson Blu in the Windy City and decided to try it out. First of all, it's a great location in downtown Chicago with great views from just about every angle and a short walk from the CTA. A short walk across Wacker will put you right on Michigan Avenue and the Magnificent Mile. Upon entering the hotel you will find a modern and attractive lobby - much like a W Hotel minus the "cheesy" factor. For germaphobes like me, the wooden floors are perfect and perfectly clean as is the bathroom. The lighting is plentiful, the beds really comfortable, and the best part is that the TV channels are mostly in HD. I was assigned a corner room on the 16th floor with a balcony and plenty of windows. The staff could not have been nicer or more accommodating. This is not your daddy's Radisson - it's a whole new and refreshing experience - particularly for those of us who can't be home most of the time, but can 'come home' to a really comfortable and classy setting.
