We were pleasantly surprised! I saw a recommendation on NPN's (neighborhood parents network) message board about this place, and we decided to check it out. We are always trying to find new places to eat and drink...and to also bring along our 4 month old. We decided to venture outside of our usual Lakeview/Southport area and head north. The burgers were fantastic and we especially loved the pretzel bun! We're a huge fan of Rockit's burger with pretzel bun, and we think the burgers here are just as good. My husband loved the beer selection. If we could do 1/2 stars, I'd give 4.5 stars. We were disappointed that there was no dessert. But we just stopped by dairy queen on our way home. :) We will be back soon! Oh, and I think we will check out the other restaurants in the area!
