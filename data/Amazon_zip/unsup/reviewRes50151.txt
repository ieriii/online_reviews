Three stars sounds pretty apathetic, but the truth is that I have both high affections and lowly criticisms of the place. The 5*s go to: -The Hell Burger. I love spicy, and not even Kumas beat the spice in this. -White Sox Props. Thank you for the Brian Anderson sammy. Why you picked semi-mediocre BA, and not something like a 'Jim Thome Grand Slam Sammy' is beyond me. But I like BA. -TVs. Plenty. Many Chi-sports bars lack them, but here there's a view from every angle. -Good seating options, inside and out. The sad lone stars go to: -This place really doesn't fit this neighborhood. The hipsters avoid it like the plague. It's definitely got a certain kind of crowd that might seem more apropos in Wrigleyville. I also think this is one of those places where a female has to be very attractive even be considered for employment, while adeptness is probably not such a concern. -When there is a rain delay, don't put on Seinfeld reruns - you're a sports bar! -When the game is on, put it on. Don't make me ask you three times to have you not put the game on. (To be fair, when I ask the bartenders, they do it right away, just not the waitresses).
