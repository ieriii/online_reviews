I am glad that the reconstruction of the Montrose stop has ended and that ambient volumes in the vicinity have gone from ear-splitting and anxiety-inducing to a normal residential neighborhood level (yes, there is a difference). When it gets warm and sitting outside at lunch time becomes a possibility, I will be spending some time under their umbrellas and eating some really tasty diner food. As in, it's definitely not standard crap-diner food. I've had several of their sandwiches and all have been good, very good, and I've been unable to finish any one of them in their entirety. There is just too much sandwich. I really recommend the shrimp po-boy and the meatloaf sandwich if you're into that sort of thing. If you're not, they do have a wide selection, though it is definitely skewed to the seafood side of things. You should definitely try the house potato pancakes. I like them smothered in vinegary hot sauce rather than ketchup, which I wouldn't have thought before I tried it. Their omelettes and egg dishes are also good, and they "specialize" in cold cereal, with a fairly large variety of favorites. It's not very cheap, but I suppose neither is the cereal itself. Everything else is very fairly priced, considering how much food you get. Now that I think about it though, I'll likely eat here before it gets warm out, though I will definitely be sitting inside. That's fine, it's easier and faster for the servers. They're good people, but sometimes it seems like they could use person just for the outdoor seating area.
