Love the mojitos and love the brunch-we have tried just about everything on the brunch menu and have enjoyed everything-plus kids get a free large pancake! Love the Carne al la Parilla for dinner and my husband always gets the Almond Crusted Halibut-both are great. Overall, we really enjoy this place.
