Sapori Trattoria in four words: Great food, great service. My favorite is the the pumpkin ravioli...yum! My brother's exact words upon tasting this dish, "It's like Christmas in my mouth!" Anytime I bring people here, they always rave about the food afterwards. The service is also impeccable. Be sure to fill out the mailing info after your meal. The chef will send you hand written cards with coupons. The coupons are nice, of course, but that's not what keep me coming back...it's the unparalleled customer service. You really don't see that kind of personal attention too often (especially in a big city like Chicago)!
