There are like a billion Mexican restaurants within walking distance of my house. I wish I could say that I've tried them all. I haven't and so I can't compare Garcia's to much of anything. What I do know is that the food and service at Garcia's are very good. I have tried a couple of things. First, a ground beef tora with avacado and cheese. Very tasty. The ground beef was well seasoned, the bun nicely toasted, overall a great dinner. Secondly, a chicken burrito. This was huge and way more food than I could eat at one sitting. The chicken was flavorful and not overcooked. Both of these dinners could (with rice and beans) be had for around $10. That is a steal. One could complain that this might not be the most "authentic" Mexican restaurant, but this is in the heart of gentrified Lincoln Square, what more do you expect?
