OMG! I love this place, its been my favourite for years, this is another place i try to get back to whenever im in chi town! I never pick anything off the menu, i order my own thing (not much vegetarian stuff on the menu), great place for a get together, but does get kinda loud and sometimes the wait is a bit long! but worth it!
