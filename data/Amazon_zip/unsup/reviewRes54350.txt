Pizza is great, but in Chicago, many pizza's are great. So when it comes to the difference between pizza places, service is one of the important factors to separate each place. Service here is A-Ok but nothing more, they miss a lot of things and also mix things up by bringing wrong drinks to the table, or wrong checks, or regular coke when it should have been diet coke, things like that, no biggie. the last few times here it happened too many times, not complaining, just weird that it happens so much. the food is great though, and you will go back, you just deal with the mishap service; it's funny after a while. and for sure, i could use a few laughs,  I will be back again.
