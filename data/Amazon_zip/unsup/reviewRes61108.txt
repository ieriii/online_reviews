OK so I cant recall how many times I have driven past this restaurant and never really gave it a chance. But I have to say that after a couple years of passing this place up. I finally decided to stop in. The menu itself is well priced and the food was good considering that I have tried a variety of Mexican food. I have to say that I had a good experience here regardless of the hostess not being very accommodating but after all the seat is the least of my concerns. I will definitely be back.
