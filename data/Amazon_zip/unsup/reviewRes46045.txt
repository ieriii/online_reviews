So good - but right on Michigan, so it's a total tourist trap. Don't even try going on the weekends.  The bar area is first come, first serve though, so even when they are busy during the week, usually there are tables up there.  Food is great - I've had many of their appetizers, and a pasta dish, and everything is excellently prepared.
