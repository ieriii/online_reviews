I've stayed at this location twice - this first time was nice, the second time was okay, and that was mainly because of the customer service. The front desk staff seemed like they did not want to be there. Customer service was lackluster. This hotel is very posh, chic - I love the lighting and decor. Its slightly over priced though. Rooms / bathrooms were very clean and nice, the extra towels were a nice touch. On day two, l had to call the front desk to send towels and it took them forever to send them up. I also thought my room was a little small for the price. No free wi-fi. Okay view of the city - very good location to shopping (walking distance or short cab ride). There are so many other hotels to book in the city, and though its a cool spot, I probably will never stay at this hotel again.
