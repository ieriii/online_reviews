This place serves up great delicious duck fat fries and gourmet dogs. My favorite is game of the week, but every dog I've tried has been delicious! The dogs are all served on the standard bun but it works well. I'm only giving this four stars because of the hours and insanely long wait. You may also have to wait for a table due to the crowd. Highly recommend this for the food though.
