Rocker chic at its best! First things first, come here for their whiskey. Unlike fine-dining places that only serve wine n beer to not kill the palate with strong alcohol (uhmm... Mr Achatz), LnE boldly boasts an encyclopedic collection of whiskeys, scotches and bourbons. Me n the husband started off the evening with a bourbon recommended by the bartender and a Belgian pale ale. Then moved on to their expertly crafted cocktails, Rye Tai (decorated with a large sprig of mint) and Kentucky Daisy (hidden inside was a long orange peel). Next, come here for their Michelin star winning food. As vegetarians, we really appreciated a separate menu that neatly listed all our options on the menu (those tiny letters in dim lighting can be hard to read after 4 drinks :)). We got the Agnolotti (5 stars), slow roasted cauliflower (a must-try whether you're a vegetarian or not) and the risotto with a slow-poached egg (4 stars). Lastly, come here for the desserts. We only had room for one and got the churros. They're not like the crispy stuff that I know and love but like linear beignets accompanied by a warm white chocolaty sauce. Since they do not take reservations, I strongly suggest that you come during the weekdays as I can only imagine how crowded it'll get during the weekends. Also note to not drink and drive!!
