This review is more for their wedding planner/event planner not the hotel. If you are planning a wedding, I suggest going somewhere else. I can't even remember his name because it was like a bad dream. First, there was no congrats! That is just a basic greeting. Also, we were planning a wedding with a very large budget, but he was making us feel like he was doing us a favor. He just seemed liked a miserable person who was far from helpful and also suggested we move our wedding day to a Sunday when we clearly said we wanted a Sat. night wedding. I am a low key bride and this was the first time I could see how people go insane planning. There are many great hotels in the city for weddings..go somewhere else!
