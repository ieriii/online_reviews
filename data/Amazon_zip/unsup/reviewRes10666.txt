The food is quite fabulous and I'd definitely rank it as one of the better spots I've been to. The wait isn't too ridiculous either, just make sure you know what you're in for. The problem we've had multiple times is if you come with more than just a party of two. They've had alot of trouble admitting that they don't put a good effort to let you know your table is good to go. Both of the last times we went, we were skipped and when we politely asked what the problem was, we were treated poorly. They acted like we made the mistake and it was on us. The first time we brushed it off as a bad day and waited a bit longer for our table. The second time we were disappointed and decided that would be our last meal there. They did send us a complimentary dessert, however, the offending employee/manager did not directly apologize for their rudeness. If you decide to give the Bongo Room a shot, you'll enjoy the food, but be sure to watch the line closely.
