Yes, its not fancy looking at all. It looks like a shack. I've always found it to be very clean though. I think that people like it because the food is very, very fresh and not -processed tasting plus its delicious. To me it tastes very flavorful and you get a lot for your money. If you eat meat I think its got plenty for you but if (like me) you don't eat meat you are not shortchanged at all. There is lots for vegetarians. Plantains are yummy and I absolutley LOVE their cabbage coleslaw. The papaya shake with water is so refreshing and good for you as well. I stand by this place having some charm! Only wish it were open later.
