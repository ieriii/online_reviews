Theres nothing to say that hasnt already been said about this place but damn its some good chicken!! We got the whole chicken meal for $20 which came with 2 sides and 2 drinks. On one half we had the Seoul Sassy which was amazing. Sweet and hot at the same time, a ton of flavor. The other half we had the sauce that is more soy sauce based, which was also tasty, but the BBQ was my favorite. Be prepared to get messy and lick your fingers clean! There was so much chicken we had enough to take some home and enjoy the next day. The fries are good but a little thin for me...think McDonalds. The fried mushrooms were decent, but I dont think Id get them again. This place is seriously the best wings/chicken in the city in my opinion, I will be back for sure!
