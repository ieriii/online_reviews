I wanted to like it here more. I really did. But the service started off as so annoying and anal, we were irked before we even sat down. We were told that if we were more than 15minutes late for our reservation a $50 fee would be assessed to our credit card. Who does that? Who does this place think they are? Alinea? Tru? As soon as we were 10minutes late, they began calling us to see where we were. The asked my friend who got there before us when everyone would be there every 5 minutes. When we finally all arrived (barely missing their 15min cutoff thankfully), we found the place to be mostly empty! And after all that stress! Ugh.... Cocktail selection was good. Great whiskey selection. Food was fairly good, but looked better on the menu than it came out. Not really a fan of raw duck, but the crepe under my duck was splendid. Most people enjoyed their food, but weren't blown away. Probably won't be back unless I'm in the area and can't think of anything else.
