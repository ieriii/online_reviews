Bin 36 is what a wine bar should be. It has a long list of wines by the glass and a handful of "flights" that allow you to taste four different wines that follow a theme (though some of the themes are fairly weak). The food is geared towards pairing with the wine. They have a fairly extensive cheese list and offer cheese tasting plates that are fun and a perfect accompaniment to a wine-tasting experience. The also offer appetizers like hummus, flatbread, or smoked salmon that are good for a group to nibble on while tasting wine. Generally I steer clear of the entrees. They're ok, but it's not a lot of food for the price. I definitely would not go to Bin 36 just to grab a meal and a glass of wine (why go to a wine bar if all you want is a glass of wine?). But if you're looking for a place to enjoy wine tasting with some tasty appetizers that go well with wine, Bin 36 is a solid choice.
