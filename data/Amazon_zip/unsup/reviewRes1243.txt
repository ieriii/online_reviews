ORIGINALLY REVIEWED JAN 27 2006 - this review below is from January 7, 2008 on a balmy day in Chicago A truly great idea and a wonderful place to eat, a very cool place to get a hot dog, sausage, or polish... And now the reality: This place has gotten just WAY (and I do mean "WAY") too trendy. I miss the old days (about two Summers ago) when this place wasn't as nearly as crowded as it is now. Back then you could walk in on a weekday and they're would only be a few people would be in line in front of you, if that. Saturdays were always a bit crowded, but it's just seriously out of hand now. I go by there on Saturday afternoons and see that the lines just go around the f*cking block....what is this? A restaurant or a nightclub? Even though I'm less than a mile from here, I just can't rationalize spending 45 + minutes to stand in a line for what basically is a Hot Dog (and some of them are getting obscenly over priced as they creep towards the $10 price) - I don't care what kind of gourmet meat and or fusion-infused topping is being used. The food here is really good, but again, I can't justify waiting in line so long only to sit down and be hustled out quickly so someone else can eat at my table... This place needs to move into a bigger space before I can justify returning here.
