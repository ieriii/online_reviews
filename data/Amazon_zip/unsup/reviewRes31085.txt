Oh my, Nana is delicious.  My employer rented out the entire restaurant for a private party, so I haven't actually dined here in full, but I feel like we all got a feel for the deliciousness of the food here.  We were able to sample almost all of their entrees in a modified appetizer form, which was delicious. My favorite was the beef brisket and the quail egg. We had a large number of others (about eight in all) and everything was totally delicious. I love anything that involves pickled beets and Nana satisfied my craving. I really look forward to coming back here to eat an entire meal since a lot of people rave about the food. From the samples that I had, I can definitely see myself loving all the food at Nana.
