Fantastic location for an intimate drinks date. Unmarked from the outside, giving this location a secret, prohibition-era feel. Upon entering, candle-lit, blue-toned space is peaceful and relaxing. Seating is perfect for groups of two with high-backed leather chairs and small tables. Noise level is low, but the high-backed chairs give privacy and sound control. Drinks menu is unique and small-plate food menu is very good, though the low lighting makes menus hard to read. Service was also very good. For a party of two with drinks and appetizers, our bill was about $80.
