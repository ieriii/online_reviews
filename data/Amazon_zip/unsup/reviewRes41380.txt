4.5 stars! I love me some filet mignon. It is far and away my favorite cut. I think it's the only thing preventing me from being vegetarian to be perfectly honest. And I think Ruth's Chris makes it the best! I got it medium-rare and it was unbelievable. Melt in your mouth good, I am absolutely salivating right now writing about it. Bottom line - go here if you love filet mignon! As for the rest of the ambiance, it was an interesting crowd. I went for restaurant week so I'm not sure if it was more boisterous than usual but there were the 20-somethings who love to wine and dine and the more regal older couples who love their classy meats. It wasn't too loud but there was enough noise to make it comfortable to have lively conversation and it was okay to laugh out loud. :)
