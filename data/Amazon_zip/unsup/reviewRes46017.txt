The Lemon Chicken Picatta is AMAZING... Pasta Telefono was just alright... I feel it is either a hit or miss with Grand Lux Cafe. I always have a good experience when I go, but sometimes the food is a little cold, or takes a bit longer. Overall, this is a great place to go. I frequent it with my boyfriend, and we both think the food is pretty good. I like Grand Lux better than the Cheescake Factory (its sister restaurant).
