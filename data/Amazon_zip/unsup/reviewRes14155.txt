very cool place. I went with a bunch of friends and they all liked their food. I forgot exactly what i had it was some sort of hybrid fish but it was good. One of my friends had her fish covered in cereal or something like that and that was good too! Its BYOB! nuff said. Its about $20 per person. I'd go back for sure if I had someone with me who likes seafood. Im not a huge fan of seafood, but I can tell its was good seafood.
