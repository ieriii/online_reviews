So...the man and I finally made the Easter pilgrimage to Hot Doug's last Friday. The weather was perfect and THANK GOD for that minor Easter miracle because we stood in line for....wait for it.... 2 HOURS and in platform heels (me, not the man).  I had the duck sausage fois gras dog and sampled the regular dog and duck fat fries. Maybe I will anger some devout Hot Doug-ites but I think if I wait in line, hungry, in high heels, for about two hours, anything you serve me will seem heaven-sent. I think that cuts in favor of people leaving better than warranted reviews. After all, who wants to wait for two hours and then feel like the food was just ok? However, I will try to be objective. The duck sausage was very good and so were the fries. However, I don't think they were wait-in-line-for-two-hours-in-heels good. The fries were good but very comparable to Wiener Circle or any other place that has nice, hand cut fries. In other words, you can't taste the duck fat. Also, this place serves no beer. I realize other dog places don't either, but again, I waited in the sun for two hours and would have paid through the nose for a cold one. Doug himself is friendly and service is polite. I hope Doug pays his cooks well because they're working their butts off. Would i go back? Maybe, if there were lawn chairs and beers involved...but I'm not sure, the cost/benefit analysis is not very good. At least I got the Hot Doug's splinter out of my mind, that made it worthwile...
