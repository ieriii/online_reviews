This is by far my favorite Brazilian BBQ restaurant in Chicago. The salad bar is simply put, AMAZING. There are so many choices, including sushi, that the other two Brazilian BBQ restaurants in the city do not have. In addition to the meats there's also grilled pineapple and shrimp. At first when the waiter was introducing the pineapple to us I was thinking "no way am I going to waste my stomach space on fruit, I'm here to eat the meats" but boy was I wrong. The pineapple is delicious. I came here December 2011 for my birthday and wanted to go back a couple months later but the restaurant closed due to a fire in the building according to their website. I was so sad but wanted Brazilian BBQ so bad that my hubby and I tried Texas de Brazil and was not satisfied. A month later we tried Fogo de Chao and I am still not satisfied. Luckily Brazzaz is open again and we've made plans to go tonight for dinner. By the way, if you go on Monday through Thursday, dinner is $35. Friday through Sunday dinner is $50. Pricey, yes. But Fogo de Chao and Texas de Brazil is always $50. I love how many more options you have at Brazzaz and how it's a lot cheaper too. You really can't go wrong. I a so happy they're open again.
