While we were planning our wedding my husband suggested we check out Revolution to hold our reception. After one visit with Meg, their event planner, we were sold. The atmosphere is friendly, warm, and fun. Their beer is fantastic (Strange Bird is my personal fav), not to mention a great selection of comfort food like a homemade pretzel with cheddar cheese sauce and pulled pork sandwiches. Compared to the rest of the Chicago Wedding scene, I'd say the prices are also very reasonable for the quality and service that you get. The night of our wedding reception couldn't have been better - Meg, the team of servers and bartenders took care of everything for us - and our family and friends said it was one of the best parties they had been to. A few groups of people even took advantage of the brewery tours. If you are looking for a place to hold a reception for up to 115 people, or just looking for a fun place to have a pint and a bite to eat - this is a great place to do it!
