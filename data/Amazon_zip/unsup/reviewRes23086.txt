Can i please have more stars to award to Irazu?!?!? The owner, Henry, sent me a nice email after my initial review which drew me in, yet again, this weekend. Even though Irazu is a good 15 min drive from my place downtown, i eagerly anticipated the taste of the oatmeal shake on my lips every minute i got closer to Irazu, and i was very excited to introduce this mecca of yumminess to my bf. We had the nicest waiter probably i've ever encountered, and Henry came out to say hello to me, which was so nice. They do read and appreciate these Yelp reviews, people, so make sure to give them good feedback. I love the family-owned and operated aspect of Irazu, it feels like you're walking into a restaurant in a small town where everyone knows your name and order (being from small-town Texas, i appreciate that!). I had to order the same veggie burrito (which we split because this baby is MASSIVE) and oatmeal shakes so that my bf could know the wonderment that i had been telling him about all week. He was in heaven...i knew he would be! We also ordered a trio of empanadas - spinach and cheese (yums), chicken (super yums, my fave) and plaintain (sweet like a dessert = yums) - as well as a side of plaintains which were prepared in the traditional style. The whole meal was yet again about $22. We are making Irazu a regular stop on our eating out tour...I wish I lived closer so we could go at least once a week. At these prices, you can't afford NOT to try it! Thanks Henry and team for a wonderful meal (again)!!
