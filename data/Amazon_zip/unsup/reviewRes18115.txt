The best churros in town with thick Mexican Hot Chocolate. Rick Bayless will spoil you with his Horchata receipe in soy milk. The Mexican soft serve ice cream with mango and honey are tasty and addictive. Soup Bowls are meals in itself. It's amazing how all staff is as passionate about XOCO dishes as Rick Bayless. Avoid: Chicharon -- generous portion but too dry and not much taste with the dips.
