I had one bad experience here, and it was a really bland veggie black bean burger. I am somewhat of a black bean burger connoisseur (I've tried it at 89327613 different restaurants in Chicago) and the ones at Chicago Diner are somewhat bland and don't come out hot! My black bean burger was lukewarm to the touch, and it was unappetizing. But since their peanut butter and cookie dough shake is AMAZING BEYOND BELIEF, I guess everything is okay.
