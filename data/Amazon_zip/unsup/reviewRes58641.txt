My co-worker and I picked up lunch from Nuevo Leon today and took it back to the office. I got enchiladas verdes with ground beef (picadillo). On my second bite I discovered, to my horror, a cockroach inside the enchilada. It wasn't small, about 3/4 of an inch long, and completely intact save for an antennae that I fear I might have eaten in the first bite. We called the restaurant and told them what happened. They said we could bring the food back and get a refund. They did not apologize on the phone; nor did they offer an apology after we drove back to the restaurant. We walked in and the manager was at the register waiting for us. I said we called. Without a word he took the food and walked away. The cashier gave us our money back and that was it.
