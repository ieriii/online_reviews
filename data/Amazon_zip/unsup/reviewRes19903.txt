I've been here 5+ times now and left every time a satisfied customer. Things I've tried: Pork Belly Vermicelli - SO good! The pork belly is crispy, the broth is flavorful and not too spicy (I'm a wimp when it comes to spiciness and this was the perfect amount), and the avocado pushes it over the top. The only con is that, at least on the weekends, by the time the caldos (soups) are served, the sit-down line is ~1hr+. Churros - Crispy, sweet, just a hint of chocolate.. almost funnel-cake like. mmmmm.. Cubano - The smoked pork loin is very tender and moist, and not too salty. The bacon and avocado really make the sandwich. Pepito - Very nicely braised short rib. As far as tortas go, though, I preferred the Cubana. Menudo (Saturdays) - perfect amount of spiciness, loved the tripe Mexican Chocolate Cupcake with Peanut Butter Frosting - the frosting was perfect! Not too thick, very light--the cupcake was really rich as well, but not too dense. Almendrado & Classic - perfect thickness of hot chocolate for me, but the almond milk in the almendrado really gave it a richness that I preferred over the classic. Barcelona - Good, but THICK! I think they add cornstarch to thicken up the chocolate. It's good though, but takes patience because it takes awhile to drink. That's my opinion though, because a friend of mine said it wasn't thick enough (compared to hot chocolate she had in Spain). To each her own. Weekdays and mornings are better--I've even gone at 7-8 am on a weekday for breakfast. On weekends I've waited between 30 min to 1hr 30 min. The take out line is always fast, but make sure they have what you want (they have specific takeout hours for different items). This is a perfect place to bring friends from out of town. LOVE IT!
