Best Mediterranean meal I've ever had! The lamb schwerma and the lentil soup were delicious, fresh, and flavorful. Loved the "international" mix of grocery items such as wasabi peas, tamarind or lychee juice, and the service was fast and friendly to boot. I craved this place for days after and for $20 bucks my hunny and I ate like kings...or sultans! I definately recommend the schwermas over the dinner plates...just one gal's opinion.
