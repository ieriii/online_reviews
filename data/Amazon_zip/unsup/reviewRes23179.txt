I like Greek food and i like Greek Islands' rendition the place is massive and it seems that everytime i am there, it is packed i always get saganaki, fish roe and grilled octopus when i am there and for main course, any preparations of lamb is good there never got to try their desserts and that's because with so much food, who can still fit in desserts?! good food, great place, pleasant service, reasonably priced an free valet, what more can one ask for?
