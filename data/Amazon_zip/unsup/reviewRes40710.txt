fun fine food, what a find. broad range of options for the adventurous diners. our group of seven absolutely enjoyed every dish, including - roasted marrow spread, wild boar sloppy joe salad, smoked sweetbreads, seared scallops, grilled foie gras, pork cheeks, soft shell crab, tandoori lamb shoulder, cod, pork belly porchetta. the desserts did not disappoint. flourless chocolate cake topped with bacon ice cream, creme brulee, apple tart, peach cobbler, were all wonderfully prepared. will definitely be back for fun fine food.
