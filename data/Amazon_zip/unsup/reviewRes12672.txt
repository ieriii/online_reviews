I've been here once before on a weekday but last time I was here... it was for Father's Day. It was so packed and the service was horrible! I'm never coming here on a holiday or a weekend anymore. The meats didn't taste as good as it did the other two times (Chicago and Schaumburg). They didn't even tell me if they were medium, rare, well done, or etc. I had to ask. I felt like I waited forever for the meat to come too. I hated getting the plantains (what I looked forward to the most) at the end of the meal as well. They gave me the mashed potatoes during the middle of the meal which was such a tease because I really wanted those plantains!!! Another downfall was I HAD TO ASK WHO THE WAITER WAS! I mean come on now... you're that busy that you can't introduce yourself?!?! I even had to request someone to light the candle. We sat upstairs (I hated sitting up there away from the salad bar) and the lights were way too dim. My eyes were straining. I just came here to eat and left as if I was eating at Panera. I usually have a good time at Texas but this was a fail. I should have taken my dad to a restaurant near his house in Orland Park.
