I'm not a big Deep Dish Pizza guy, but this place is a must for every first time visitor to Chicago. Again, I had family in town for the first time and took them. Even the "big eaters" couldn't finish it all. If you go, you must get the original deep dish with a sausage patty. No matter how many times I get this, I am always amazed at the pizza sized patty. I mean, how could this not fill you up. This is just a fun place to go and hang with great food, fun atmosphere, and fun wait staff. I challenge anyone to go there and not enjoy your meal or not have a good time. It's just not possible.
