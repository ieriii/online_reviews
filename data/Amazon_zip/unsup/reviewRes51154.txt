I went to the West loop location for breakfast this weekend to sit outside. Let me start by saying that the service was terrific. However, the breakfast burrito was far from it. I've tasted better microwave burritos. Dry and bland. The breakfast potatoes were worse. Hard to mess up potatoes and as an Irishman, I know a thing or two. My dining partner had the same meal and agreed with my assessment. The cornbread muffins were delicious and a reason why I will return.
