So last night I was watching food network and on Throwdown, they had a Cuban Sandwich challenge. I asked around where to get a good Cubano Sandwich and everyone answered "90 miles". I then searched "Cuban Sandwich" on Yelp and "90 miles" came up the #2 answer (#1 is closed though). A coworker also mentioned they had good Tostones (fried green plantains). Suprisingly, I've been to "90 miiles" a number of times but never tried (or even noticed on the menu) the Cubano. I like the Chicken dinner plate with a huge butterflied grilled chicken breast smothered in onions with rice, beans, and sweet plantains. Anyhow, this time, I switched it up. I got the Cubano I was craving from watching Throwdown and I got the recommended Tostones. The Cubano was a very good ham and cheese - basically a Croque-Monsieur with a Cuban twist. The bread was toasted and pressed perfectly to crunch on the outside and be a bit chewy on the inside. The combination of fresh sliced pork with ham, cheese, pickle, and mayonnaise was quite traditional and definitely hit the spot. I was a bit disappointed by the Tostones -- I think Irazu's are better. I didn't finish my order of Tostones and neither did my other coworker who ordered them -- so I'll definitely skip those next time. I wish I would have gotten one of their awesome shakes instead. The Clybourne location for this restaurant is a very small place with no tables inside (counters) and is not good for big groups. Best to do takeout or just close friends.
