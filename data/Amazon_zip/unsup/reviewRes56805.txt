I visited here once and oddly- we were one of only three tables eating in the dining room- much to my surprise. Likely this was due to the snow storm that night- in fact we were there because our flight to PHX was canx so we had an unexpected night at home...anyway I was so eager to try this place. It came so highly recommended- from friends who I consider real foodies, but alas I was pretty disappointed. The pizza's are fine but nothing I would go back for...and I HAVE been to Italy to eat the real thing. I would definitely be willing to give it another shot but currently I am less than impressed.
