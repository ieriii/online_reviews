I was originally taken here by an Italian ex-pat who told me it was "the real deal." How could anyone possibly turn that down? The pizza is excellent - ultra thin crust the way I like it. All the food is fresh. I had anti pasti with various sausages & cheeses & olives that were a foodie's wet dream (not that I consider myself a foodie). The last time I went I had the ice cream truffle thingy and it was REALLY good. The owner came by and served us glasses of prosecco and we were given miniature cannolis on our way out the door. Really charming. This is my kind of place. The location is a little tucked away spot on along the train tracks. I've never been patient enough to wait for an outdoor table, but I haven't had to wait long for a table inside. Yes, the food is a little pricey, but I feel like I'm getting a special meal, so I don't mind paying extra.
