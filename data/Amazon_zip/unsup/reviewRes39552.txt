Sure it was an 1.5 to 2 hour wait for a table, but it wait was worth it! The daily crudo special is a must.... as is the pork. But there were also some fun suprises on this evening...like duck testicles! For adventerous and patient eaters....this is the place. I only wish it was closer to my neighborhood.
