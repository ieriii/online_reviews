This review is about Chris in the catering department; he is amazing! Chris has been helping us plan our wedding at the Intercon and he has been such a pleasure to work with! He is very responsive to emails and has never seemed annoyed by the endless questions I have to ask. We haven't had our wedding there yet but if Chris is any indication of how our wedding with go, then I have great hopes that all will be wonderful!
