i LOVE this place! my boyfriend lives in wrigleyville and last night we were craving italian (me to carb load before my 18 mile marathon training run this morning). My bestfriend met us as well and over 2 bottles of our own fav wine, we started with an amazing crapese salad paired with bread and this little plate of garlic and red pepper that they give you to mix with olive oil. then, we each had GIGANTIC pasta dishes. athletes, this is seriously your place to carb load! my pasta was incredibly rich and savory (prochini mushroom sauce!!); my boyfriends was super meaty (had both italian sausage and meatballs - he was in heaven!) and my best-friend's was super cheesey and rich (ravioli with creamy tomato sauce!). The atmosphere is fantastic - artsy and low lit- especially the little background. We will all definitly be going back!
