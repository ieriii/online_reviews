From Adversity: Our 8pm reservation, for a table of 10, turned into a 40 minute wait. The party before us decided to stay and chat. At first, the reservationists setup a table that could barely hold 8 and just wouldn't work. Having out of town guests for a relaxing evening I lost my patience. To Delight: As a gesture of good will the manager came to the rescue. Seeing our displeasure he offered us free drinks and appetizers, with a new table as soon as it opened up. His willingness to make it right prompted us to keep our table with a few modifications. I couldn't have asked for more, but I did. My nephew, a chef, was in town and commented on the design of the kitchen. I asked the manager if he could walk over and view the prep area. To my surprise he did one better. After dinner he honored my nephew by addressing him as "Chef" and took him on a half hour tour of the entire facility. Most establishments would not be willing to open their entire operation, on a busy night, to outside review. Mercat a la Planxa is First Class in my book.  Thanks for making this a SPECIAL night for me and my guests.
