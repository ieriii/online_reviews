I have literally changed my rating from 4 to 5 and back again at least 10 times. What I struggle with in rating Alinea is whether or not food should be evaluated as art. Powerful visual art is not always pleasant to look at, but it doesn't matter because its purpose isn't always pleasure. Maybe this makes me unsophisticated, but I cannot shake the feeling that eating is a more basic, hedonistic pleasure than other art forms and therefore should be evaluated on the basis of sensory experience alone and not sensory+cerebral experience. There is no doubt that the food at Alinea is provocative and that the experience of dining there is absolutely extraordinary. BUT, some parts of my meal were unmemorable or flat out weird, and I don't know if I can ignore that. Dining at Alinea is more like going to a modern art show than eating at a restaurant--the experience is meant to play with your senses, confuse you, and challenge you to think differently about food. It absolutely accomplishes all of those things. The restaurant itself was designed in such a way that you felt isolated from the rest of the world and oblivious to the passing of time. The service was impeccable-- the server even noticed that I'm a lefty and adjusted his service accordingly. Some parts of the meal were more delicious than anything I've ever tasted in my life (e.g. Black Truffle Explosion, Hot Potato). Other parts, though, were conceptually and experientially interesting but I found the flavors to be too weird to be enjoyable (e.g. Bubblegum). Don't get me wrong, though, I am extremely grateful I went and the meal is still one of the best I've ever had...It's just hard for me to proclaim it "as good as it gets," especially given the small fortune it cost me to eat there.
