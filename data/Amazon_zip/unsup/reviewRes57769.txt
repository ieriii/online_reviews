This really is a hidden gem in the Gold Coast. This place is tucked away and very unassuming. The food is well priced, portions are big and quality and variety are great. I've been here mostly for brunch, but they do also serve lunch and dinner as well as a full cocktail menu. If you go on a weekend for brunch there will usually be a wait, but it's worth it.
