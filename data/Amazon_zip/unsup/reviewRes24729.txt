Got our reso through OpenTable and were running about 15 minutes late. We called on the way and they said it was no problem, and it wasn't so that was appreciated. We didn't have a waiter greet us for longer than I'm used to, and when we did, he didn't introduce himself. We did the chef's tasting menu with the wine pairings for $85, and got an insane amount of food. The wine pairings were also tasty, and the white that came with the first course was an amazing blend of what I called "if Pinot Grigio and Riesling had a baby." The service left a lot to be desired, as a different person delivered each course, and they did not introduce each item unless we asked for it. I want to eat this every day for the rest of my life: Bacon Wrapped Dates Shortrib flatbread Bread with tomato jam (it was the starter and literally exploded with flavor) Grilled ribeye with what I can only describe as avocado chimichurri cream on the side I'll pass next time to save room: Butternut squash dumplings (kind of gummy, not very well seasoned) Jumbo prawns served a la planxa (my prawn was grainy, like almst sandy feeling grainy) I'd come back for sure!
