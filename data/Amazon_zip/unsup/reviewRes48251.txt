I friggin' love The Publican. I've been here for both brunch and dinner and was thoroughly impressed both times. Their food is always fresh and I love how they buy their ingredients from local farmers. Now to the food: Brunch (only on Sunday): 1. Red wine poached egg - Great flavors and beautiful dish. The egg was cooked perfectly. Highly recommend. 2. Banana bread - very dense but very good. 3. Fulton Market Quad - Excellent 4. A salmon dish, can't remember the name - Delicious and fresh. 5. Great tea selection!!!!!!!!!!! But also GREAT coffee. Dinner (Come with a group of people since the food can be easily shared): 1. Oysters - One of the best oysters I've tried in Chicago. They were so good, our group ordered two platters. 2. Spicy pork rinds - ORDER IT. Freshly made and the spices they use are amazing. 3. Blood sausage - I'm not a big fan of blood sausage but I heard a lot of people like them. 4. Pork Belly - Delish 5. Frites - Fries with a fried egg on top. Fried eggs make anything taste better. 6. Some salad - can't remember the name but I remember it being very tasty. I can't remember what else we ordered (their menu changes often according to which ingredients are in season), but I remember that every dish we ordered was phenomenal.
