this place was sweet! i loved it. However, I only had the salad bar. I wasn't too hungry so I didn't have the meat portion of the meal. The only thing I didn't like is how they tried to force you to eat the meat portion. Me and my gf were only planning on the salad bar and they say you're supposed to flip this card over in order for them to begin serving you the meat portion. We didn't flip anything over and the server was pushing my elbow with a plate behind me trying to fit a plate on our table!!!! it was pretty funny but ridiculous because just a few minutes later another server walks by and begins serving three dishes that come with the meat portion. I told him we didn't order this and he said but it just comes with the portion and I said well we didn't order that though. Anyways, that was kinda uncomfortable. But the salad bar was awesome. It costs $25 each for the buffet bar, but very well worth it. Good Sushi in it and Im not even a big fan of sushi.
