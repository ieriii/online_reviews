i didn't have a normal dining experience here because we were in the private dining room upstairs but this place was very yummy.  i love the mayo shrimp!! that sounds yucky but it's very good. =P there are a lot of different dishes to choose from but some of the dishes that were ordered for us were very spicy. so becareful and make sure to ask how spicy a dish is because there have been restaurants which claim the food is hot but not really.
