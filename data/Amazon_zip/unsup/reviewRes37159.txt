Great food even better beer. Set me up a cot in the back, I would like to live at Hopleaf for a couple weeks. I don't know if this would be enough time to try all their beers. Their beer menu tends to favor the Belgian and Belgian-style offerings. Nothing wrong with that, the Belgian's have been doing it and doing it well. The rest of their beer menu is well crafted with most styles being offered in some form and most countries being represented. I found the offering of German beers to be a little slim. However there are many other delicious beverages to try out. There is an impressive wall of glassware behind the right side of the bar. It is always nice to have a beer poured proper and into its designated glass ware that is usually crafted by the beer's manufacturer. My only real complaint was the lack of any sort of table server. It was a relatively busy mon/tues night as I'm sure a lot of nights are at Hopleaf. Still, having to order every single drink throughout the night from the bar, I also had to order food from the bartender. While the food was great, It felt odd being served such great offerings by the line chef out of the kitchen. After completing out meals, our plates just sat at our table for nearly half an hour. Not ideal for me, when I'm trying to focus on my beers. With improved service, Hopleaf is nodoubt a five star. Unfortunately, after my single visit, I can't move myself to anything above four.
