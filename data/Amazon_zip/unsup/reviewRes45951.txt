Oops... two months later and I'm just now rounding out reviews for my trip to Chicago. Sorry, guys! I know what some of my fellow NY-ers might be thinking. Rey P. is giving four stars to a CHAIN RESTAURANT?!?! Has he gone off his head? Maybe it's that I didn't expect much, but I really did have a fine time here. We went here for my little sister's birthday brunch -- we being, my sister, her husband, his sister, my 2-year-old nephew, my new niece, and I. Which brings me to star number 1: this place is great for families. Lots of space, lots of large tables, and staff who know how to accommodate babies and tots. As is typical of chains of this size (they're related, apparently, to The Cheesecake Factory), the menu is gigantic. In fact, when you go to their website it says, "Grand Lux Cafe: Something for Everyone!" I ordered chilaquiles, knowing full well that they wouldn't be chilaquiles, but happy to have the egg and tortilla mix. I asked the waiter whether the beans in them were vegetarian. He didn't raise an eyebrow or look at me weird, he just said apologetically, "No, I'm sorry they're not." I asked him to omit them and put more avocado on, and he said great! Star number 2. When my food came out, it was scrambled (not fried!) eggs with tortilla chips (not lightly fried stale tortillas!) mixed in, topped with salsa (not stewed in it!), monterey jack cheese (not queso fresco!), avocado, and shredded tortilla chips in a little spindly tower shape. Like I said, not chilaquiles at all... BUT... um, it tasted good. Star number 3. And, finally, they have a dessert for which the are pretty well known, and it's really, really quite good. Beignets served with a vanilla cream, a chocolate sauce, and some raspberry compote. THEY ARE DELICIOUS. Star number 4. So, in the case of Grand Lux, I'm afraid I'm going to have to break out of my mold a bit and say I had a good meal, some good company, and a good time.
