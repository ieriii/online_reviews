I've been coming to Anteprima since it opened and have yet to be disappointed. I consider it the best restaurant in the neighborhood and often take my parents here when they visit. Over the years, I've had a variety of pasta dishes, such as squid ink linguine, tagliatelle with mushrooms, stinging nettle linguine, etc. All have been excellent. Same goes for the appetizers. Early on, I tried ordering a couple of salads here and was not thrilled with those. I found them to be oddly salty. Since then, I've steered clear of salads. Desserts are also delicious here as are the little vegetable tarts they bring to your table as a starter. One thing that is a bit annoying about this place is that it's become incredibly difficult to walk in without a reservation (this was not so when they first opened). A friend and I did manage to walk in and get a table recently on a Sat. night but that was only because we got there at 6 (they needed the table back by 7). It's a popular spot for a reason, however, and I'm glad they're doing brisk business.
