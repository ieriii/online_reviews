My friend suggested the avena shake (oatmeal shake) so we all got it. It was delicious. Light. I thought it was going to be some thick oatmeal sludge, but it wasn't at all. I ordered the pepito sandwich again. This time with avocado on it too. Delicious. Loved it as much as the first time. AND the sandwich is only $4.95.
