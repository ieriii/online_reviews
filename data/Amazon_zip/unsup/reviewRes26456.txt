Is the food decent? Yeah. Is it anything really special? No. Is it worth the exorbitant prices? No, unless you really want to pay for the romantic atmosphere. I personally won't be coming back. Went during restaurant week which made it seem like a deal, but it still ended up being $50/person with a single glass of wine for one person. And they wanted me to tip on the non-discounted price? Uh, no. If you're looking for a new type of restaurant experience, and want a dimly lit romantic basement type feel, then Geja's might be a good choice. Again, the food is actually pretty decent - I mean you cook it yourself so how could it be bad? But, they do give you a decent spread of items and they seem like high quality items, although nothing out of this world. I just find it terribly overpriced for what it is, so wouldn't recommend others shell out $50/person for it. There are much better places in Chicago for this price in my opinion.
