I went here on a Saturday night. I made a reservation and had no trouble being seated.  Ordered wine, asparagus, scallop, lamb, and chocolate. Everything was wonderful. The popcorn was also included and was yummy. The server was super friendly and knowledgeable and the hosts were engaging and friendly as well. Next time I would order the tasting menu. The people next to me experienced it and everything looked delicious.  I would also try and reserve a table by the window.  Overall a wonderful dining experience with a great atmosphere.
