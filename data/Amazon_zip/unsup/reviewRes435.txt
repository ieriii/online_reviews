The most unique, exquisite and thoughtful meal I've ever had. To say it's an experience is an understatement. There's a reason this restaurant is ranked in the top 10 restaurants in the world. The flavor combinations are unexpected but wonderful. Pricy? yes, but worth every penny of it. There's not much more I can add that hasn't already been said. But I do know that I will never forget my meal.
