When here out of a whim with four friends (the Robyn show was cancelled, so our Friday night was wide open). Very cute place, not too loud, not too quiet. We arrived around 6.30pm on a Friday, but as soon as 7.30pm hit, the place was poppin'. We had the goat cheese appetizer...amazing! Between a few girls, we ate like wilder beast. One of my friends had a pork dish that was great. Very sweet. I had the duck dish. It was interesting because I never had it Cuban style, only French. It was a different taste. It wasn't as fatty as I was use to, and I think it was cooked under the boiler. Not a bad thing, just a different taste. The only issue I had was that, our waitress added the tip of 18% to the bill, but included tax in the tip, which made it more. Between 5 of us, we somehow had a bill for $200. I understand we ordered a few drinks, but ouch? I don't know if I'll be going back.
