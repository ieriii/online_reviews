Stayed here for the Chicago Marathon. We were allowed to check in early and assigned to a fantastic room with tons of space and a SPECTACULAR view. The bed is awesome, pillows were not my style but comfy enough - other hotels are worse! The staff is VERY friendly and helpful. You need toothpaste? they have it, shaving cream? got that too. There were a few hiccups (Marathon related) but nothing significant to really complain about. When I go back to Chicago, I'm staying here again!!
