Arrived at 9:25 on Sunday morning, and there was a wait of 40 minutes. We were kind of rushed in and out. The menu looks great, but the food (at least what I had) wasn't worth it. Remembering the same dish at Leo's I ordered the sweet potato burrito. It didn't at all compare with Leo's and I felt like I had been duped because it cost $10.50! Coffee is good. Leo's how I miss you!
