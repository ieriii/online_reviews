I think the level of hype surrounding this place led to a bit of a letdown for me when I finally tried it. Our server was mostly absent, despite the place only being half-full during our early reservation. The beer list is impressive, but it can be hard to choose with no descriptions and no server to help you (especially when it comes to the more obscure imports). The food was hit-or-miss. Duck hearts were tough and under-seasoned. The suckling pig was also a disappointment-- bland and chewy. The scallops, however, were perfectly prepared with a delicious romesco. Surprisingly, the highlight of the meal was the vegetables. Perfect brussels sprouts. I might give them another try, just based on their reputation. But I definitely left my first visit a little disappointed.
