I thoroughly enjoyed my breakfast here. I had Huevos Rancheros, which are only available on the weekends unfortunately. They had a good taste to them. I don't like overpowering spiciness and these were perfect for my taste buds to really savor. I had a side of bacon which was ultra crispy, just the way I like it. I was able to taste Lara's Orange Brioche French Toast, which was also very good. The place is very open but was very cramped as it is not all that big and it was very crowded. There were a lot of people mulling around waiting for a table to open up which made it seem even more cramped. Were were very lucky to get a spot by the large front windows. On a cold winter morning the sunshine felt really nice shining in on me. The menu is very limited and the only things that really caught my eye was the French Toast and the Huevos Rancheros. They do not look to cater to the masses. They do what they do very well. They do have a good selection of sandwiches also. I will be back for more and more, hopefully at a less busier time of day.
