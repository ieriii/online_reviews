9/25. The service was HORRIBLE. I can't review the food because we didn't stay after dealing with the incredibly unprofessional staff. We expected a wait, especially with a large party, but after an hour and a half the hostess told us it would be at least another 45 minutes to an hour because she said our group was not complete when we put our names in...this was not the case because we arrived together in one car. When we pushed back she became very smug and admitted they gave our table away to a "VIP"...in other words, she lied first and tried to put the blame on us and then her inflated ego got the best of her and she slipped up. As if the hostess wasn't bad enough, her manager was even worse. It was clear the second he walked up to our group he had no interest in helping his customers. He was very offensive and actually SWORE and PHYSICALLY THREATENED us when he realized we were not push overs. The guy should lose his job because at no point is such atrocious behavior acceptable, especially in the service industry. And I know we were not alone that night because there was another very unhappy party in line behind us waiting to talk to the manager. The great thing about Chicago is the endless number of restaurants that offer exceptional food and service, so we didn't miss out on an amazing dinner that night. Unfortunately for the Purple Pig their poor service and attitude will eventually bring them down.
