I really liked this place. My girlfriends and I dined here on a Saturday night at around 7pm. Without a reservation, we were seated within 10 minutes. The sushi was great and staff were friendly. I liked the fact it's BYOB. The ambiance was very relaxed, in my opinion. We had gomaee and edamame (of course!) for starters then a few maki selections like the dragon, salmon, scallops and crab. Everything we ate was yummy!!! The only bad experience we had was the parking. We had trouble finding a parking spot in the area, but it could've just been our luck...but, valet would be a nice option....
