Best Greek food in Chicago! Do you love lamb? They have the best rack. Love grilled octopus? They have the best tentacles in town. My friend and I go and order a bunch of appetizers and share the rack of lamb and riblets. Forget ordering a big entree, you're better off enjoying a variety of tastey sides rather than filling up on meat and rice. Meats are seasoned to perfection, and every dish is full of Greek goodness. If you're Greek and/or a fan of Greek food: this place reigns supreme. The only downfall is the wine... Not much of a selection and Greek wines are not my personal favorite. Here are my favorite dishes: Taramosalata, Saganaki, Skordalia (get it if you love garlic), Grilled Octopus (be brave, try it and guarantee you'll love it), Keftedakia (tender, tastey, lamb meatballs), Pita Bread (for dipping), Lamb Chops, and Lamb Riblets. (At Greek restaurants, it's encouraged you eat with your hands!) Sounds like a lot, and it is. But you can split this meal with up to 4 people (or have yummy leftovers the next day). Opa!
