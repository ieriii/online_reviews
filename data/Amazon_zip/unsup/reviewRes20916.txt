Great menu - there's a whole section for seasonal foods and drinks, but the regular menu is sparkling as well. The real appeal is the variety - you can have a delicious meal that's heavy or light, cheap or expensive, meaty or vegetarian, large or small. Highly recommended all around. Sat at a bar table, great atmosphere, and on top of that, the wait staff is friendly, helpful and aesthetically pleasing to boot.
