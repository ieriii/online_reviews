Checked out Meli with my Madre a few weeks ago and it was amazing. I'm a huge breakfast guy and this is the best I've had in Chicago. Bacon avocado and Gouda omelet was delicious; and the potatoes are so good I'm convinced adding condiments to them is sac religious. So much so I've petitioned the vatican accordingly.
