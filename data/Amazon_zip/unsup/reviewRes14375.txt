Revolution has rapidly become one of the places that I always end up taking people who are in for a visit. Friday and Saturday nights do tend to be a little on the packed side, but I've mostly had good luck sneaking in before the mad rush starts. Lately, I've mainly stuck to lunch and early dinner as the crowd plus the noise is not very conducive to dinner with a date or small group on the weekends, but if you're considering if it's worth the wait: yes, yes it is. They've got some really good brews that pair great with their delicious food. My favorite thing I've had so far is the wood-fired pizza topped with duck confit, gorgonzola, pistachios, onions, and rosemary: marry me. I've never been disappointed with anything I've had here, and I can't wait to work my way through the menu at each consecutive visit.
