MMMMMMMMMMMM BEST pizza in Chicago that we have had! OMG I think about this pizza a lot -- it was soooo good!! Definitely get the Red Pizza -- it is fabulous! I am so sad we are outside of their delivery zone, although I think it is a blessing in disguise because the pizza is too, too good. Being a CT native, I appreciate the shout-out to New Haven. :) I am so happy to have found such delcious, amazing thin-crust pizza here!
