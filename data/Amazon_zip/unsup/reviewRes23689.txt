Meh. I went on a Friday around 8pm and the place was mostly dead. I had a feta and chicken crepe with veggies and it was remarkably bland. Crepes aren't my favorite food, to be certain, but I just felt like the imaginative combinations listed on the menu didn't play out in practice. The Turkish coffee took forever (even longer than other places where I've had Turkish coffee) and tasted a bit off. I'd give Icosium a second chance since it's got so many positive reviews, but it'd take a good showing for this to become a place I go to often.
