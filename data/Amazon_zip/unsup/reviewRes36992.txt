Note- This is a review for the cafe only... Ugh- I was not impressed with Fox and Obel. We had a waterboat tour within the hour, and needing a little food to sustain us on the 100 degree day, we headed to the cafe. We ordered some sandwiches, and judging from the half-empty sitting area, I thought it would be a total of 20 minutes to get our food and eat, leaving us plenty of time to get seats on the boat. However, I was totally wrong- it took us over 30 minutes to get our food! (Breaking news- you don't need a degree in rocket science to make a freakin' sandwich!). Once we finally started eating, I certaintly wasn't "wowed" by my meal- I think Whole Foods makes a better (and faster!) sandwich that is made with healthier and fresher ingredients. While we inhaled our food and barely made it to our tour, there is no excuse for a small cafe like Fox and Obel to lack on its service
