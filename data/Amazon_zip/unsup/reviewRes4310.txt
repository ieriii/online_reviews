Thanks to yelpers I was not taken aback when the bouncer at the door totally bit my head off last night because I was holding the door open (because there was a group of people ahead of me). I brushed it off and expected more effrontery according to yelpers. But, from then on, it was nothing but good times. We didn't get shushed, though we weren't a rowdy group and were genuinely there to enjoy the music. However, I saw no other supposed shushing going on. The decor here is amazing! Really unique and beautiful. I was glad to see a place like this is still thriving in Chicago because in Milwaukee there are a lot of old time places like this but I hadn't seen one yet in Chicago. Oh and I truly appreciate that the women's bathroom mirror is a total skinny mirror. Gives you a little ego boost just as you're about to walk out virtually "on stage".  Drinks truly are small and overpriced but atmosphere is what you are paying for. Great place to take people visiting from out of town!
