Hands down the best pizza place in Chicago!!!!!!!!!! My fiancee and I have been on a hunt for some great, authentic, Italian style pizza for nearly three years. Our search is over - Spacca Napoli is the best pizza / Italian establishment we have been to in Chicago. The staff is friendly and the food just great. The fried zucchini is a must-try, so are the grilled vegetable plate and pizza Capricciosa (often offered as a special). Can't have enough of Spacca Napoli.
