This place has been on my list for a really long time. We have passed the Armitage location a lot in our adventures around town and decided to check it out one summer evening. Boy we were in for a delight. We started out with apps, which unfortunately came out with dinner. But the taste more than made up for it. At the table we had chicken napolitano, lechon over fire, empanadas and croquetas de pollo. All of which were tasty, the right amount of spice and flavor to be sensitive to all palettes. To drink (and of note) the passion fruit tea was mild and delicious. And to finish we had a cortadito, a very strong sugar-with-coffee drink that hit the spot. In all the bill came to around $50 with tip, no alcohol. (They do a sangria BYO that my partner will surely check out with her girlfriends.) To top it off, we had friendly, playful server which made the experience just right. So quaint that they take your order on paper lunch bags, then deliver the bill in it. So nice. Additionally, the music level outside was just right so you can actually enjoy each others' company. It's a great place for a date night or even a first date night. Parking was plentiful even at 7p on a Friday.
