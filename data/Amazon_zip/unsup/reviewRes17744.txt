It's all been said before, but basically violet hour is a great date place (more than just a casual date though,) and has some of the best drinks you're likely to get in the city. I guess Aviary probably presents some stiff competition, but I haven't been anywhere that has noticeably better drinks than VH. One's experience of the atmosphere, as you might gather, depends heavily on your attitude going in.  My advice is play along and have a good time.
