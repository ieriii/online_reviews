Let me tell you about wishbone: This place is something else - the artwork is disturbing; however, the food is delightful! I usually track my way up to wishbone for brunch on Saturday or Sunday. I always seem to order the Shrimp and Grits. Wishbone is one of the few places I have found up here in Yankeeville where I can actually get that great brunch delicacy. It is a rarity to find sweet tea anywhere above the Mason - Dixon; however, at Wishbone I can order all the sweet tea I like. Which is saying something, especially since sweet tea is an essential part of any good meal experience - well that and a good stout glass of Makers. I would recommend trying wishbone for brunch, I do it weekly!
