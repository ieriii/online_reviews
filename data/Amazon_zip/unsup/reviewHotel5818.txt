If you're looking for a Marriott or Hilton, go to a Marriott or Hilton. I have the opportunity to stay in the upscale hotels while traveling for business and have no issues with staying at the Heart O'Chicago.The HOC is a economic alternative when my wife and i travel to Chicago a couple of times per year to visit our son. It meets all of the basic criteria you look for when you're planning most of your time visiting the city. It is clean, affordable, and conveniently located to the Northwest side so that we do not have to travel far.
