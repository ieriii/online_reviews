Like Cristin M. I did not know going in that pan was "the thing". I really don't see how that could have made me like this pizza though. I ordered a small thin crust pizza with ground beef, basil, and mushroom. The ground beef was not GROUND. They should have called it meatball pizza. In addition, the meat tasted like crap. I ended up picking it all off just to make the pizza edible. And basil? Please, there was hardly any in there! Even that couldn't add flavor to the lackluster sauce on this pizza. It tasted no better than Chef Boyardee. Really! I came over here for the first time after a killer kickboxing session at Bally's across the street. (I know, counterproductive.) I had hardly had a bite all day and I was starving. I also wanted to catch the Monday Night Football game. Pequod's had the game on, but the volume was so low you could barely hear the commentary. Come on; this is a casual pizza joint. Turn up the volume!! The service was good enough, but was the pizza? This Pequod's reminds me of an alt-pizza joint. Like you have to be wearing a goofy winter hat, be a man with crazy long hair, or be wearing skinny jeans to really fit in. Funny, cute, and adds to the stlye and originality of the place. Maybe next time I stop in I'll get the pan pizza, add garlic and gardinera for a flavor boost and ask them to TURN UP THE GAME!
