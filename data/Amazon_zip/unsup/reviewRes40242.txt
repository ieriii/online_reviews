oh lord. so good it kind of hurts.. It reminds me of a cross between a high class old timey saloon and a new classy restaurant. Lots of beautiful hardwoods, high ceilings.. there are two adjoining rooms that are both intimate in size, it feels quite perfect for the food being served. delicious meat,, I mean, REALLY delicious. And its funny because I love and believe in the concept of useing the entire animal.. if you are going to kill it, nothing should be wasted. But then when served beef cheek, as in, the inside of a cow's mouth, i bit my lip.. and then tasted it. FYI-- COW CHEEK IS AMAZING!!! everything ruled. i had the catfish that i had to force myself to slow down and savour it. Friends had the veal (oh man.. so good) the scallops, the sausage sandwich, and the sloppy joe. It was all profoundly delicious, such great flavors! and the servings were perfect. It left you satisfied in a healthy way, not in a side splitting way, and i didnt want to like the plate because i hadnt gotten enough.. i wanted to lick the plate though. just because its deliciousness was still on it a little! we finished up with the banana bread pudding. it made me close to weeping with awesomeness. so... i want to eat every meal there now. all of them. so good. ouch. go. do it. you'll have to wait. big deal. or wait a year. or go early. just, go.
