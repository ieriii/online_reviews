We hosted our son's rehearsal dinner in the upstairs private room at Mia Francesca's. WOW it was amazing. From the 1st phone call to the event coordinator to the actual event I was treated so pleasantly and so accomodating. The food was incredible and very generous portions. On a 5 star rating I would give a 6.....The atmosphere was quaint and the staff so pleasant. Would recommend highly.Jan S
