We love Avenue Hotel Chicago!My daughter and I went on girl's weekend shopping trip and stayed at Avenue Hotel Chicago. We truly loved the hotel! Everyone was friendly and helpful. The location was close to fabulous shopping (American Girl Place, Disney Store, Chanel, Boss, Brooks Brothers...to name a few) and great restaurants. We decided to get a kid-friendly room and we were so pleased with it. The room was bright and comfy and we had a ball with the Wii! We are planning on returning closer to the holidays and will definitely stay at Avenue Hotel Chicago again.
