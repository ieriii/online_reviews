Ahhh, I went all Fatty McGee here. I knew the Original Buddha was more than enough for my Buddha belly, but the idea of not eating any chicken was too sad so I split a half chicken Seoul Sassy with my buddy. Now I'm lying down in near comatose state with the laptop on my engorged belly typing up this review. The personable manager, I want to say his name was John, was friendly and even hooked us up with some kimchi! How was it? Great flavor, super 'crisp'y... get it? Shut it. No really, it was crunchy. I could have eaten the whole bowl.  Suggestions for the store.... two things, help out the customer eating bibimbap with chopsticks. Get him a spoon or a fork or a mini shovel. Failing at chopsticks never looked so painful. I would have done it myself but I didn't want to be 'that' Asian guy. Second thing, could you carry Squirt? I love Squirt. I love chicken. I love Squirt with chicken.
