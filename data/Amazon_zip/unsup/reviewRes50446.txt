When my friend Sharon told me to pick a place for dinner in Andersonville, I knew just where to go. Here: http://www.yelp.com/list  I trust John B.'s reviews, and he didn't disappoint. We had a great dinner at Big Jones. I had the Tallgrass Beef burger, which was wonderful: enormous patty of grass-fed beef, Worcestershire, wild mushrooms, onion, Fontina and garlic aioli. Incredibly tasty and too big to finish in one sitting; I finished it the next day for lunch. My side salad was good, with a citrus-y balsamic dressing. Sharon ordered a fish entree, which I forget, but she enjoyed it also. The dining room itself is warm and elegant. We ate here on a Monday night, and we practically had the entire place to ourselves for most of the meal. (go Monday if you don't like crowds). Our server was friendly and attentive. Drink refills were promptly offered and, at one point, he replaced my dirty knife that I'd used to put spread on a cracker. (my friend urged me to put more spread on a different cracker, to see if he'd replace that knife, too). For dessert we split the Mississippi Mud Pie, which was truly decadent and too big to finish. We felt free to linger and, eventually, left happy and sated. I'd happily return to try some other dishes here.
