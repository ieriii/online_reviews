I had a Lettuce Entertain You gift card from work so my girlfriend and I decided to give this place a try. Everything was great. As soon as you walk in the door you are greeted by the smell of a woodburning fire, which is a welcome experience on a chilly winter night. The food was delicious. Everything I had was cooked perfectly and was exploding with flavor. The crab stuffed mushroom caps and crab and lobster bisque soup were great as appetizers. The special of the night was three small filets encrusted with a choice of flavors. All of them were delicious. Service was great, prices were reasonable, and the atmosphere was nice. A great place to go. We didnt have reservations and got a table for two in under 40 minutes at 7:30pm on a Saturday night. Not bad at all.
