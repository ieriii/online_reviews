My wife and I loved the food here! We each got a bottle of Hitachino Nest White Ale, which is a witbier from Japan -- very refreshing. To start, we ordered a half dozen raw oysters (I think we could have done a full dozen). They were extremely fresh and the waiter will explain what the different types will taste like, so you can order the ones that sound most appealing to you.The waiter told us that Shaw's was most known for the Alaskan King Crab legs, so I got the The Signature, which is a 6oz Filet Mignon and Alaskan King Crabs legs, and my wife got the Seasonal Crab Combination which came with Alaskan King Crab, Dungeness, and a Crab Cake.WOW! The Alaskan King Crabs were delicious! There was a ton of meat and it was extremely sweet. I wasn't expecting much from my Filet, but I was shocked at how good it was. We shared a Key Lime pie for dessert, which was good, but maybe a bit too tart for my taste.We are definitely going back to Shaw's!!
