An absolutely delightful experience. This restaurant restored my belief in customer service. I had an interesting experience. I was served the wrong starter twice. After the third try, we got it right. Gracious service and the Beet Soup was lovely. I had the Veal Paprikash and it was well prepared and delicious. A very limited wine list, but the owner found me a nice dry riesling that was floral and superb for the price.The service was entertaining. It was apparent that the owner loves his work. I felt very welcomed and the atmosphere is really nice and CLEAN.
