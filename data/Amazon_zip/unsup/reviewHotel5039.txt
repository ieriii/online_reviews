I double booked a room for this hotel, my mistake due to misunderstanding of not accepting their offer of an "upgrade" on internet. I realized the mistake immediately after booking and seeing two confirmations to my e-mail. I called customer service and was told it would not be a problem to cancel the first reservation, but it would be 4-6 weeks to process refund. I booked several weeks out and figured they would take care of it. My family and I went to check in, they said I had two rooms, I explained situation and that I did not need two rooms, they said OK they would take care of it. Again thought it would be taken care of. Two months later no refund, I called customer service and was given the runaround, representative eventually agreed to review my initial calls with supervisor the next day and get back to me. Didn't happen. I posted on Embassy's Facebook, basically the same response and lack of action/communication. Think twice before dealing with this group.
