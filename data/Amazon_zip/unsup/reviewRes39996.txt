If you're over 30 this is NOT the place for you. Don't have a clue what the food is like because after waiting two hours for a table and watching people being seated before our party of three, god forbid you would push two tables for two together, I stormed out, ruining my son's birthday. Who needs 35 kinds of bourbon? This is a very pretentious place.
