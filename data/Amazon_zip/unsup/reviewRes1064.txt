Holy hell I had no idea that a Hot Dog could be so damn good. Waited probably 40 minutes on a Thursday. Doug took our order and he couldn't have been more welcoming and appreciative of the business. Ordered "The Dog" which is the standard chicago dog with all the fixins. Everything went well beautifully and was the perfect hot dog. Best Dog I have ever had. The Foie Gras Dog- Just plain insanity. Definitely the most decadent dog I have ever had. So rich and creamy and everything worked great together. So much flavor in every bite. Just delicious. French Fries- The fries here are damn good. Can't even imagine how good the duck fat fries are! Definitely check this place out. Great selection and great service for a very reasonable price. There is a reason there are so many good reviews.
