I give it 5 stars!! We're regulars. I am obsessed with this place.I've heard that some of the meat dishes aren't as good, but I'm usually craving the vegetarian options when I go and I've never been disappointed with these.The shakes are DELISH. The vegetarian burrito is amazing. The sweet plantains are great. The ceviche is delicious.The customer service is amazing. Everyone that works there is always in such a good mood. I just love going in there.I don't understand anything less than a 5 star review. Even if you did have any complaints, the prices are so low!! If you compare the amazing quality to any other similar food you can get in the same price range, Irazu is the best!!!
