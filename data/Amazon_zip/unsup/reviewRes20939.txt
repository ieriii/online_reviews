My go-to place for taking out of towners after the obligatory Bean/Millenium Park outing. As a matter of fact, it's probably my favorite place in the Loop-ish area. Everything I or my companions have had here has been out of this world. I've only been to lunch, but it seems like it would be a fun time to come for drinks any time of day/night.
