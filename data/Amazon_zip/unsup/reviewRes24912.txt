Great place to go for lunch or for a light dinner. And it's on the cheaper side, which is a plus. I really recommend trying the artopitas, which is baked flaky pastry filled with a variety of ingredients, depending on which one you order. My favorite is the one filled with smoked ham, Kasseri cheese, and spinach. The rosemary potatoes make a delicious side dish. As for desserts...there's sooo many items to choose from!! The chocolate mousse cup is exquisite and goes great with espresso.
