This is definitely one of the best in Chinatown. It's one of the first places (Ken Kee being another) that I bring people to when they want to try Chinatown in Chicago for the first time. I love the 3 cup chicken there as well as the pork belly on preserved vegetables. Tony's Dry Chili Chicken is a great dish that is a good compromise between the authentic Chinese food critic and the person in your group that might still favor the Americanized Chinese food that most people in the US are familiar with. The decor of the place is pretty tacky but I'm not going there to admire the chairs.
