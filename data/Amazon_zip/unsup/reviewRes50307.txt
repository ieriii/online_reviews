this place objectively deserves 5 stars...it has everything and does everything well...sweet patio, check...awesome layout, check...lots of nice tvs, check...good service, check...tasty food, check...fancy drinks, check... but... when i come to a sports bar, i want a sports bar...not a "sports bar", meaning a club cleverly disguised as a sports bar...the peeps, cost, lack of draft beers, bottle service, and tons of foo-foo drinks...what do these things have in common!? you guessed it--it's like if manor and sluggers had a hideous love child...and they try to hide this by offering authentic dive-y teases, like the 40s... but paying $10 for a 40...that ain't right...
