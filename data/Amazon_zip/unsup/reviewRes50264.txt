I've been to Big Jones a few times and have never had a bad experience. My favorites that i'd recommend are the burger, shrimp and grits, gumbo and red velvet cake. It's probably my favorite comfort food/southern spot in Chicago, my sister lived in Charleston, SC for 5 years (which is another league) but at least for the Midwest i would say it's high quality. It's really nice that it never seems to be too crowded so reservations/waits are rarely an issue.
