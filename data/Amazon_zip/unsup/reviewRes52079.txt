Tourist trap, yes. But since it's one of my favorites, I'll deal. Everytime I've been there, it has been amazing. My only complaint is that one time, some friends and I were there, and a friend decided to be funny and write "nice ass" on one of the chairs (as graffiti is the decor), but next time we checked back it was removed. haha, come on, it's not like it's a family atmosphere or anything. ;)
