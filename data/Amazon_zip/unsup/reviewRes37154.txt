Fox & Obel is like the Dean & Deluca of Chicago. This is a hop, skip & a jump from my office and one of my fave spots to nosh on some gourmet yummies. They offer such a unique variety of stuff that I simply cannot seem to find anywhere else from the pre-made entrees, bakery, cheese and tea selection-- there is something for everyone. The prices are a bit on the high-end, but you must remember this is a small(er) store with an exclusive selection of stuff. My latest GREAT find, Jeni's Ice Cream (http://www.jenisicecream). I can just snag myself a pint rather than pay an arm and a leg from the site. I'm in heaven! The cafe is quaint, and offers a good amount of seating. I love to cuddle up with their tomato bisque soup and a grilled cheese along with a good book. I suggest you stop by and check it out for yourself.
