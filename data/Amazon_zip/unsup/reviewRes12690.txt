It's been a while since dining here, but I can confidently say that things have changed. Stopped in to for a quick lunch last week with a friend that wanted to check out the place. While the shirt steak tacos were tasty, the overall menu was not inspiring like I remember it was. Maybe because the focus is no longer on the lunch crowd (given the sectioning off of the restaurant & reduced lunch hours), but its still worth mentioning. Still an enjoyable place to dine with a tasty selection, it just went from top of my list to somewhere in the middle.
