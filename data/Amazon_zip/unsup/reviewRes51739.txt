Garcia's hits the spot everytime! The interior may be lacking, but aren't we here for the food people? So why does it matter that the interior reminds me of Abuelita's? Just keep those complimentary chips and salsa coming! I've tried numerous items on the menu and I definitely recommend the carne asada! The tostadas are loaded with fresh goodness and the burritos are as big as your head. Make sure you gulp it all down with some tasty Horchata! Buen provecho!
