Without fail, I am here at least once every time I am in the mood for a nice glass of wine. I first began coming here when I was living in Chicago a few years ago, and even though I don't go as often, I try to make it a point to savor a glass of wine at Bin36 every time I'm in the city.  I especially love coming here with friends who are new to Chicago, as the location is right next to the river as well as the House of Blues.  The ambiance here is casually intimate in my opinion. While the intimate lighting, the soaring ceilings, and overall decor call for a highly upscale place, the general mood of the place is classy yet invitingly so. I do not feel as though the place gives off an uppity pretentious vibe. I normally get a seat at the bar and I have found that the bartenders here are very helpful in making wine selections as well as food pairings. To be honest, the little seasoned pretzel-sticks at the bar are my favorite! :) I also love the pairings of the cheese flights with the wine flights.
