Best. Fried. Chicken. Ever. Maybe I just don't have enough exposure to Korean fried chicken but one bite in I was already planning a return trip. I had the world's best chicken in sandwich form, with the Seoul Sassy sauce (also amazing). Only four stars because the side I got was average (some sort of sauteed vegetable mix that was a little mushy -- might be better eaten in than carried out) AND also a warning that if you order a sandwich that says it comes with Mayo they really heap it on there. Next time I'll be sure to tell them easy on the mayo and try a different side.
