I came here with a group of three on a Friday night for dinner. I never had Colombian food prior to the visit but the detailed menu helped me picked the perfect meal. We began with the Frutos del Mar (grilled shrimp, octupus, and calamari in white wine sauce) and washed it down with their signature sangrias which was served by the pitcher. The seafood was cooked to perfection and their homemade salsa added a nice heated tang to the taste. For the main course, I had Bandaja Paisa (char broiled Colombia style ribeye with fried pork belly, rice topped with a fried egg, beans, sweet plantain, and avocado. The flavors were orgasmic. I can't describe in words on how good the food tasted. As for the service, our waiter was really friendly and courteous. He explained the menu very well to us and had a really outgoing attitude. The only Con that have with the service is at the staff that worked up front. I would figure that it would be customary to greet every guest that came through the door or acknowledge them when they leave. Maybe they couldn't speak English but they should of at least waived and smile. The front staff whether they like it or not, has the power to set the tone for incoming and outgoing guests which affects how much spend there or their chances of returning.
