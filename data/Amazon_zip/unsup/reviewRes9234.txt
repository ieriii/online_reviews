Found this place walking through my mom's hood and what a great find. My family and I went to this place for the lunch special, starting at $7.95, which includes salad, bread, rice, and your choice of kabab/entree. I had the ground chicken kabab with dill rice, probably the best dill rice I have ever had, oh so fresh. The kabab was tasty, very flavorful. I was thoroughly impressed with the veggie curry dish, just the right amount of cinnamon. My nephew ordered the ground beef kabab, which was a burst of flavor in your mouth. I will def order that the next time around. Since we went during lunch, it was not very crowded but don't get me wrong, this place has a steady stream of customers. Yet another neighborhood spot to add to the list.
