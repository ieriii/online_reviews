I've been to this Gino's East location probably 5 times now, and while it is my husbands favorite deep dish in Chicago and a favorite among friends visiting from out of town, its not my absolute favorite. If you are craving deep dish and are in the area, spending an afternoon showing guests around Michigan Ave, or are visiting from out of town then its a solid stop, especially in the winter when that Chicago cold can leave you craving a warm meal. My husband LOVES Gino's crust, but the cornbread like crust is so thick to me that it always leaves my mouth a little dry. The toppings are definitely the highlight of the pizza for me and I try to keep some around until the end of my slice so that I can add them to the bites of huge crust. Last night, we ordered 2 smalls for 4 people and it was plenty after having tried a couple appetizers. I liked the supreme w/sausage pizza better than the meaty one we ordered. Took a leftover slice home and had it for lunch today, and I honestly thought it tasted better this afternoon! All in all, good Chicago tourist spot, good service, always leave feeling full and satisfied but I think if you have some time to explore around the city you will find better pizza options.
