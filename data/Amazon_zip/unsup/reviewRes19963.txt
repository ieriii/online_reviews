I went there once and it was pretty tasty. It was for business and the other people picked up the tab so I was happy (you can easily spend over $20 on lunch if you get soup with your meal) I had some soup. I can't remember what it was but I remember I liked it. (basically I remember my meals so if I don't remember it probably was not worth remembering) my sandwich was an open faced brisket sandwich with some kind of cheese, fuji apples, and some micro greens (think small lettuce you buy in those bags of premixed salad). I asked for some of the curry sauce for the fries. That was def worth remembering. I do not live in the area, but if I'm back in that area I would stop by for lunch and possibly a beer or two. Speaking of which the beer selection looked a little weak for a place that should be a gastropub. At least they got the gastro part down pretty well.
