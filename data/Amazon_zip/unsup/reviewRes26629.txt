wow. wow. wow. this food was incredibly good. we stopped in on a late whim on a warm summer night. we ate outside, which only amplified the experience. we had the white and seasonal sangria, both good, although we agreed the white was tastier. bruschetta-like bread came free of charge while reviewing the menu and was very, very good. we ordered three dishes and each bite was amazing. the mushroom rice with asparagus was so incredibly good we immediately wanted more, the flavors were just, wow. the patatas bravas were unique and adorable and super yummy too. we also ordered a wild mushrooms, which were very good, but did pale in comparison to the other two dishes, which were out of this world. because the food was so good, we decided to go with a dessert, though all but one option on the menu was nearly indecipherably exotic. the one we got was also so, so good (chocolate hazelnut mouse with some dollop of ice cream and i don't even know what else, but good-God, it was good), we were so glad we risked it. the presentation was excellent, the service very good, and the food delectable. I can't WAIT to go back! inside looked very swank, though i only saw the bar and the bathroom.
