I don't know what the trendy westsiders love so much about waiter-less sit down eateries. It's so awkward, do you leave a tip? Who does it go to? What if I want to leave it to the person who brought my food and not to the person that took my order? In Milk's case, I didn't want to leave a tip. Iwas starving and I ordered a turkey reuben and it was ice cold in the middle....ICE. If I'm not mistaken, part of the glory of the reuben is that it's grilled. They did make me a new one, though the cashier was totally not friendly about it. But, I was too hungry to care and in the end the sandwich was solid.
