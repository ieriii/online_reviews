I have been to Brazzaz before and honestly, I prefer them.. The salad bar was okay, but I wished they had things labeled so you know what you were eating. The meat was wonderful, but I truly did miss the pineapple and shrimp that you get at Brazzaz for the same cost. The service was great though and they were quick to refill your sides and bring more meat. Most meat originally came out rare to med. rare so we had to wait for them to come back with med to med-well.
