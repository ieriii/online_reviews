My brother, his girlfriend and I eluded the apocalyptic storms last night - tried to walk into Coobah's on Southport and they turned us away due to flooding. They did suggest we try Cafe 28 if we truly wanted Spanish cuisine and I am so glad they did!When we parked I realized I live down the street from this place and I had never noticed it before. I was a little weary of it when we first walked up because it was so dark. We walked in around 9 p.m., feeling sheepish about wanting a table so late. We first got turned away, but we explained our adventure to get there and they graciously sat us. The ambiance was beautiful. Great music, not too loud. The art was phenomenal, colorful, but not overwhelming.We split two appetizers, the baked goat cheese (the added spicy tomatoes were perfect) and a Cuban style pork and grits - both were delicious! I had the simple spiced steak and a side of plantains. I liked the plantains more than the steak, but I have a sweet tooth. We had sangria with the meal, which was a perfect way to take the edge off the evening. Our waitress was very pleasant, attentive and she knew the menu very well. We greatly appreciated the hospitality after trekking through the storm to get there! I'll definitely be back for more! :)
