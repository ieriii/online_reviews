Carnivale doesn't look like much from the outside... but its really spectacular inside. High colorful ceilings are really something to look at while you wait for your mojito or steak to come out, although it doesn't help when trying to converse with a group of more than a few people. Four of us stopped by for a late dinner.. but of course started with a few mojitos. The drinks were fresh and authentic. Next up were appetizers of cheese, meats and tortilla chips. All were delish.  For the main meal I had the Bife Angosto (Wood grilled Niman Ranch New York Strip, yukon gold potatoes, Spanish chorizo, manchego cheese, chimichurri sauce). I highly highly recommend. The meat was beautifully seasoned and cooked. Every bite was juicy and well worth the wait and cost of the meal. I'm still talking about this meal and when people ask if I've been to Chicago this is the first place I bring up.
