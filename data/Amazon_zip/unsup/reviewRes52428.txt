Went here for Mother's Day 2011, since we were already downtown with our two kids and had a gift card to use. This will definitely be the last time we go here.  - We had a 5pm reservation, and weren't seated until 5:30pm. Annoying when you have two kids and make an early reservation on purpose.  - Tried to pay part of the bill with gift card, and were told that when whomever purchased it, they didn't "enter it into the system" correctly. As a result, they only honored 50% of the gift card and they told me I could call the office on Monday to try and get a certificate for the other 50%. - The service was horrible. We had to ask our waiter twice for drinks becuase he didn't check back with us. And he forgot to bring my daugher's drink even after we ordered it a second time. Drinks are pretty much the only thing the waiter is responsible for in a restaurant like this. - Food was pretty good. For some reason I remember enjoying it much more, but I'm sure the poor service and the whole experience played into that. I think Brazzaz was good when it first opened, but it seems like they just got complacent. I will not be back again unless someone makes me go here.
