Meh. My wife and I went here recently and had the vegetarian entree (comes with the obligatory cheese and chocolate fondue).  Cheese Fondue: Disappointingly underwhelming. Maybe it's just me, but melted cheese on grapes - not a fan. The cheese itself was good, but not great. Veggie Fondue: They were alright. I thought the brocolli and mushrooms were the good. The rest were just mediocre. Chocolate Fondue: Didn't even finish it. Like one reviewer said, it's like Hershey's syrup. For the record, I have a serious sweet tooth. So me not finishing was quite a statement. That said, the service was good and the atmosphere was romantic. It's not going to make me come back here because the price (for the quality of food) is asinine.
