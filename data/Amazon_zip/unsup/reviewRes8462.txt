I stopped at Fogo for lunch and it was spectacular! Its funny that all the waiters swarm you unless you have your red card showing. I didn't try much of the salad bar so I could save some room for the good stuff. If you are ever near a Fogo de Chao I would recommend anyone to stop into one....you won't regret it. I think I will take my fiance here for his birthday that's coming up.
