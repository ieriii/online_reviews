You can only find better deals at that sketchy hot dog stand where you fear to tread. This place is clean, efficient and welcoming, and to get yourself a polish for this cheap... c'mon do yourself the favor. Just avoid it between the hours of 11:30 and 1:30 on weekdays and you'll be alright. If you can catch it any other time I promise the wait is no more than 5 to 10 min depending on your order.
