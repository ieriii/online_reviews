Had another fantastic meal at Calo's this past week-end. I love the neighborhood atmosphere and although I usually go for the pasta, this time my wife and I shared delicious deep dish pizza preceded by an excellent smoked braid salad (Italian smoked mozzarella cheese topped with arugula prosciutto and grape tomatoes with Italian vinaigrette dressing and dressing and garlic crostini)
