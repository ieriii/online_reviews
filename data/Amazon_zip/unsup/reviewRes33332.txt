So. I'm out in the 'burbs and we have some REALLY GOOD breakfast places. I have to go back to see if the breakfast measures up, and I will change my rating. I had the warm chicken, pasta, spinich, broccli. It was ok. Have them to add bacon, that's what I did when I got home! Orange strawberry juice was very good. ENTIRE wait staff from greeting, to seating to serving, needs to be trained.
