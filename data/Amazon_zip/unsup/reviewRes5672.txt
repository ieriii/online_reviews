Love this place. We went with foodies and we ended up ordering almost everything on the menu (a great advantage with small plates/tapas).  Each dish was either good, great, or awesome. The best word to describe everything is "flavorful." Some especially notable dishes: Pork Fried Almonds with Rosemary & Garlic, Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs, and Octopus with Green Beans, Fingerling Potatoes & Salsa Verde. Go early or go late--this place is super crowded all the time! (1 hour+ wait).
