This is hands down, the best mock-meat restaurant Ive ever been to. Most other places ive been to give you large chunks of prepared seitan or processed tofu. Here they create meals and do an amazing job of it! Ive been here well over a dozen times and have never been disappointed. So far, the meatloaf and the Ruben sandwich were my favorite dishes. The margaritas were just right (not too strong, not too weak and with a great taste). I also had a milkshake that had all of my favorites in it (cookie dough, peanut butter, chocolate, and vanilla ice cream)The service is just as good as the food and everyone is really friendly and knowledgeable. The big downside is that the place is small and i hesitate bringing large groups because it would take quite a while to get that many seats together. Id say no more than 6-8 people unless you have the time. Ive never had trouble finding street parking and there are a few fun shops/bars in the area if you do ending up having to wait.
