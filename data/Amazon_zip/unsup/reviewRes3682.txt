Maybe my expectations were too high after reading such great reviews. There were 5 of us and we decided to just order a bunch of things and share. We ended up getting the wings w/ all the sauces and really the only one I liked was the Seoul Sassy, the rest were just bleh. DO NOT order the onion rings or mushrooms, they are the generic prepackaged crap you can get in your local grocery freezer and they aren't even the good kind. The buddha bowl was nothing special. We also ordered the side of veggies, which were ok and could have definitely improved if they were seasoned. I don't really know if I would come back, nothing was fantastic. I will admit the staff was super friendly and helpful, but that's just not enough to make me want to come back.
