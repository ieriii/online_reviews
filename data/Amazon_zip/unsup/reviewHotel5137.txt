Was this building originally designed to be something other than a hotel? The layout and decor are... well, not conducive to being a hotel. There is one elevator, and it is located in the middle of the floors; two hallways from the lobby. Then, on either side of the elevator on the second floor (the hotel has two floors), there are big empty areas. Then you go down a hallway and through two sets of doors before you reach the actual rooms. They hallway is decorated with exposed concrete that doesn't seem to fit. Someone had to actually make the decision to put concrete on the walls. Didn't that designer have a boss to question that? Anyway, the rooms were fine but they had bugs. That's the worst sin a hotel can make in my opinion. The continental breakfast was as disgusting as I have ever seen in a hotel. The "eggs" were covered in cheez-whiz. Gross! They say there's no such thing as a free lunch, and I guess you can say the same about breakfast. Also, I am not usually a big allergy sufferer, but as soon as I walked into the building, I sneezed four times, and couldn't breathe until I left. I don't know if it was the cleaning materials, beds, blankets, or something else, but if you have allergies you might want to pass on this one.
