(Obama reference to come..) I can't say i hate Hot Doug's, but after having been here several times, I just think its not worth it. I gave in to the novelty at first and I'd probably go here again if a friend wanted to try it. My beefs with hot dougs are: There is no reason to wait 1 + hours for anything and you can almost count on that here. The whole novelty of this place is the "gourmet" hot dogs which can yes at times taste pretty good but honestly often times not for the price you pay... and 1 dog is too small for a meal so you have to order another regular menu item or maybe another special dog, plus fries.. plus a drink.. So your hot dog meal ends up costing 15-20 bucks?!... did i mention the line? Seriously this is one of those businesses which intentionally restricts either its size or efficiency to build lines and thus popularity. Good for business, annoying for me. There is absolutely nothing physically around this building and instead of expanding, or maybe adding say.. 1 more cashier... just ONE more.. they keep things the same... Heres an idea Doug - decrease the wait to say 20 minutes - and you'll still have a line outside but at least I won't be totally running out of things to talk about while I'm waiting, checking my watch every 5 minutes, and can actually enjoy the dogs you serve. Not trying to be a hater, this place is still gonna stay at 4.5 stars overall even if I gave it 500 2 star reviews. But for such a unique Chicago restaurant, I think some CHANGE is due.  YES WE CAN YES WE CAN! ..k a lil contrived, i realize:)
