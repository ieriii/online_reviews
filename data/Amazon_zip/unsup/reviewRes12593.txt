I have heard of the place but never went until yesterday, April 28. It was easy to get a seat on a Tuesday at 730 and the service was great. Never had to wait, the waitress was informative of the menu and what was her favorite and what the restaurant is known for - their 2 thick pork chops which I had. I have had pork many times in my life and this dish was by far the best prepared pork I have ever had. I am a big foody and will rate this as one of the best dishes I have ever had at any type of restaurant.. My date had the Almond crusted Halibut and it was a great white fish choice. As for drinks. we had the Pama Mojito and this is I think better than Sangria. I highly recommend this place and would suggest reservations if they take them on a weekend.
