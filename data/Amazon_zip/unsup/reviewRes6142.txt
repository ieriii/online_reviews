The food here is really good. Our tables favorites were the steak with three different toppings (mushrooms, parmesean, bernaise, blue cheese, peppercorn, and one other i can't remember!), the double baked cheddar potato, and the creamed spinach. The bread to start is really fresh with an interesting kick - one light bread with onion baked on the crust, and one dark rye-ish bread with raisins. My only suggestion - don't come out here with a group on Friday. It was really really crowded at the bar and in the restaurant. Not that crowded is a bad thing, but it just seemed a bit rushed and like we were sort of in the way even when we were seated.  Will definitely be back with my fiance to dine here sometime during the week! I've got my eye on trying the martini flights!
