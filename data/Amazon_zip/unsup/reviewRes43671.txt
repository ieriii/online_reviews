Milk and Honey gets ridiculously crowded but IMHO, I think their food looks better than it tastes. Their heuvos rancheros is very popular and looks amazing, tastes pretty decent. It is a huge ramekin with a bunch of beans, eggs and cheese with other stuff in it. Their scrambled eggs, sausage and toast sides are all decent. They have other sweet things on the side as well, which are good. Their waffles are really good, especially with raspberries and almonds on top. Not the best breakfast place I've eaten and I only go there because I live in the neighborhood, probably wouldn't go back if I moved away.
