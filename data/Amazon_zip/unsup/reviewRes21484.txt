Three reasons why I give it five stars. 1. Food, of course. My chimichanga was hot, fresh, and made with high-quality shredded beef. The sides were great, as was the fresh pico de gallo, guacamole, and chipotle mayo sauce it came with. My girlfriend's veggie burrito was huge, fresh, and delicious (according to her)--and only $5.25. The salsa that came w/ the tortilla chips at the beginning was great, too. 2. Service. We went in on a Wednesday afternoon around 3:30--not a time when many waiters/waitresses are in the best and most attentive of moods--and our server was fantastic. He was happy, with a genuine smile, and very attentive. And our food came out really quickly. 3. Cost. Not an out and out steal of a deal, but really great Mexican food for a very reasonable price. With my chimichanga and my gf's veggie burrito, and just water, we got out for $14.50 before tax. Glad I listened to earlier reviewers. Yelp hit this one right on the head. I'd definitely go back.
