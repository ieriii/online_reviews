One of the things I was looking forward to at Hot Doug's was meeting Doug himself. He's funny, witty, and makes me want to see him again and again. I don't know why but I'm a little disappointed to know that Doug doesn't make his own sausages. I feel it would add so much authenticity to a place that already has a loyal following. That being said, the standard Chicago dog was delicious. I love how you have the option of how the dog will be cooked. Charred was the obvious choice. The rib-eye sausage with chimichurri and fried onions was a bit tough. The flavor wasn't what I was expecting either. I hate to admit it but I actually liked my original better and it was 1/4 the price. The duck fat fries were outstanding as well. Not the best I've had but they were perfectly salted and pleasantly crunchy. Would I be back? Maybe. If there wasn't a line I would definitely be back. I just wish the sausages were made in house. It would lure me back much faster.
