I don't know why Chicago is so lacking in the falafel joint department, but Sultan's Market's amazing level of awesomeness certainly makes up for our city's falafel dearth. This is how my trips to Sultan's usually go: my bff JVH and I are running through our Wicker Park/Bucktown errands and decide that we have time to bask in each other's delightful company. We meet at Sultan's, each order a spicy falafel loaded with all the salad accoutrements, and split a sesame flatbread or a lentils and rice side dish. We slide into a booth and gush for about an hour, enjoying our super cheap--especially since we drink the water provided by the restaurant--decently healthy, amazingly yummy meal, and continue on with our adventures. Some day I might branch out and load up on the salad bar, which always looks incredible, or order a schwarma, but for now it's the spicy falafel, in all of its generous, crunchy, hummus and Jerusalem salad-loaded goodness. MMmmm...just remember to have cash!
