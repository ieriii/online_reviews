I was previously in LOVE with this place, but as some other reviewers have mentioned, they raised the prices, with no noticeable differences to the quality and a reduction in the portions. Things that used to come with the crepes (ice cream, nuts) are now considered $1.00 "extras." Furthermore, the service has been lagging lately - and when I say "lately," I mean for the past four months, so my review doesn't boil down to them just having an "off" day. Bummer, because I was so in love with the idea of having ridiculously good dessert crepes with a friend for less than $20. Now it runs me $30, and I have to wait for my check.
