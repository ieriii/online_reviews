Very posh accommodations for any out-of-towner! My room actually reminded me of a studio apartment (a VERY NICE studio apartment), rather than a hotel room. The hardwood floors and desk made it feel like you were coming home at the end of the day...and I like that feeling. The floor-to-ceiling windows were cool (awesome views) but it got to be a pain by day two, as you have to pull down the shades if you want to take a shower, change your clothes, or do anything that you don't want the businessmen in the building next door to see :) OR if you are an exhibitionist, this is the place for you! And I'm still confused as to why the shower is glass on both sides, especially the side closest to the bed. Does someone who's sleeping NEED to see you washing your hair? The privacy curtain takes care of that problem, but I'm wondering why it was built that way originally. Based on the last two hotels that I've stayed in for work, The Curtis and its talking elevators ("I seee youuu") and now the sexy shower at the Dana... what kind of job did I just sign up for? I kid, I kid... I would absolutely stay at the Dana again, as its location is within walking distance of a lot of great shopping (Hello Michigan Ave!) and cute brunch spots. For someone who isn't terribly familiar with Chicago, I felt like this was a perfect spot for this Country Mouse :)
