I am new to Yelp, but have found all the reviews helpful even before joining, so I thought it only fair to submit one or two. Bin 36, although I am sure to hear it from the regulars and there are many, is not something to write home about, or rave about to a colleague or customer, but it has been consistently good for the occasions I visit. The menu has something for everyone, whether on the lighter side (I like the flatbread and cheese options) or the entrees (you can't go wrong with the steak or fish options).  Then there are the wines. They have a few dogs, and are a bit touchy when you find one of their wines a bit heavy on the tannins, but are also quick with a recommendation that is usually on the mark when you let them know what you enjoy. The service was excellent on each occasion I've been to the Bin.
