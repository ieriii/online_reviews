Here are the criteria I'm going to judge this place on: How was the food?, How was the atmosphere? and do I think Oscar Wilde would hang out at Wilde Bar and Restaurant. First, the food- it's pretty good. It isn't going to change your life, but as gussied up pseudo-gastro-pub food goes it certainly doesn't disappoint. The reuben is particularly delicious. I give the food a four. The atmosphere- the first time I came to Wilde it was a Saturday night. The music was loud, obnoxious dance music, most of the lights were turned low, and it was crowded as hell. On my second visit, it was a quiet weeknight, and I sat outside. It was nice. So, I would give the ambiance a 2.5. Finally- would Oscar Wilde like Wilde Bar and Restaurant? Good food, lavish decor, and a menu filled with stupid puns? Yes, I think he would.
