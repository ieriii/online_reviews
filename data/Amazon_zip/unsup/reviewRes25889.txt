Yes, it's a beautiful space. The food was good but there are more delicious (and price-appropriate) tapas to be had here in Chicago. There were four of us and the waiter really pushed us to order 3 plates each. The result was that we had way more food than any of us could finish. It was ridiculously over the top in amount and came out spradically so you would alternately be inundated with plates or sitting and waiting for the next item. We asked several times for bread and never got it. Our waiter disappeared at one point and we all sat there drinkless for what seemed an eternity, then were inundated with 4 plates from the servers (that's one way to really irritate, leave me sitting dry). The two stars here are for the service. I'll stick to Las Ramblas in Andersonville or Azucar in Logan Square. Better food and more fabulously attentive staff and service.
