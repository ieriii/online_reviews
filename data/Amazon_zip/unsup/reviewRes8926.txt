I made the trek all the way into the city for THIS? I sat in bumper-to-bumper traffic for an hour on the Kennedy for THIS?  Granted, the dill rice was pretty good. But my skewers of beef and chicken were really dry, tiny, and definitely not worth the $15.95 price tag. Thank goodness my friend was treating. I'll stick to my local Pita House, tyvm.
