I'm not sure what the big deal is. The hot dogs were good and the specials were definitely interesting (I had a smoked crawfish and pork sausage) but I'm not sure it was worth waiting 1+ hours in line.  Also, maybe I'm not gourmet enough, but what's up with the duck fat fries? I like duck but I really didn't taste anything special about the fries. Maybe I'll have to try it again, but I just don't know what the big deal is. But the food was good but I probably wouldn't wait in the line again
