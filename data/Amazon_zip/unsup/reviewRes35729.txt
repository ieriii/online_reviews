Super tasty! Those walking by, don't be intimidated by the roasted duck hanging in the window... Just close your eyes and just run into the building and you'll be A-OK. Oh, and don't forget to order it because the duck is so fatty and delish. :) ...Fatty is good! Indulge, dammit! The new building is a big plus too! I remember their old place being... ech let's not talk about it. This new place is very large and open and clean (which, frankly, is hard to find in most Chinatowns). The service might not be SUPERB, but you can't expect too much. We got all our things in order eventually with a bit of flagging down two waiters, and our food came really fast. But then again... it was Monday noontime. I like ordering the plates over rice. The portions are good enough for two people, they're plated very simply, and they're very satisfying (and cheap!). My mom ordered the fish and tofu over rice and it was melt-in-your-mouth happiness. I ordered the beef curry, and the flavors were fantastic. This place isn't over-Americanized and for the flavors and price, I highly recommend it. Don't go sweet and sour, orange chicken, blah blah anything. Be adventurous! Close your eyes and point and I'm sure whatever your finger lands on will be deeeeelicious. :)
