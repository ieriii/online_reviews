Grand Lux is an absolute MUST try if you're in the downtown area of Chicago. This is perfect after a long day of shopping on Michigan Ave. This place has become a staple for my Mom, Sister, and I whenever we all get together. They have a huge menu, so there's something for everyone. We always try something new as far as entree's, and so far everything on the menu is delicious & comes in very big portions. Do not leave without trying one of their desserts! Our favorite is the strawberry shortcake. Very fresh strawberries and perfectly cooked pastry! Easily shared between 3-4 people. Giving it a 4 ONLY because it does get very busy, mostly Friday & Saturday night's, and they do not take reservations. However, once you're in, the waiters are excellent and very personable. It's definitely worth the wait if you have to.
