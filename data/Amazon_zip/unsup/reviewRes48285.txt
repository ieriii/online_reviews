YUM! So much yum! We had the pork rinds, sweetbread and the mussels. I had few beers too but I forget the name of them. There was only two of us so I that's all the food we got. Everything was delicious and service was top notch. I will definitely be going back to try their seafood extravaganza thingie. You're supposed to call ahead and their chef gets to choose what seafood to serve. Sounds awesome!
