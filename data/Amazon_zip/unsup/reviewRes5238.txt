Kicking off our restaurant tour of all things swine we decided to finally check out Purple Pig. I knew about this place before their recent media blitz , but reading about all their food in the RedEye was the kick in the butt we needed. We were seated and immediately eyeball everyone's dishes. It's pretty easy to do with communal dining. Everything looked and smelled amazing. If given the chance I would have ordered everything off the menu, but we had to stick to our guns...charcuterie! We order the Purple Pig Platter, which was all the cured meats, choice of five cheeses, and one meat that wasn't on the menu. We told our server to pick five cheeses for us, and after a couple of questions of preferences he was all set. I did chuckle when he asked what kind of water we wanted, he made the tap sound like we were drinking untreated lake water. I drink sparkling all the time, so the up sell for Pellegrino was entertaining. The food arrives and we both start drooling. Sadly I can't remember the cheeses the server picked out, but it was a non stop party in my mouth. All the meats surprisingly paired well with any of the cheeses. We slowly noshed on our pig platter and order the Roasted Bone Marrow. Marrow arrives and at first glance it doesn't look like much. We dig in and a third of the way I'm done. It is such a rich spread I couldn't believe how full I was afterward. My friend did the honors of finishing my marrow. Next time we'll have to try the small plates. The only reason I didn't give it five stars was price. With so many mouth watering plates, you can drop $50 pre drinks easily...but it is so worth it!
