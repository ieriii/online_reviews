Why are you so far? I finally made the trek up to Hopleaf and it was pretty much what I expected: great beer selection, delicious food and a relaxed atmosphere. I guess the beer selection is bigger than my more frequented Map Room, but enough for me to shlep out there? no. The food was fantastic (better than expected, but I was also drunk and very hungry after a long ass bus ride.) The mussels (beer) were good, but a little small) fries were good (not great) and mac n cheese was also good....The PBJ was the standout, with the duck sandwich also geteting high marks. Now that I really think about it I think the copious amounts of butter added to the outside helped a bit, but I would like to try some of their other main dishes. The service was slow at first (crowded,) but got better as people left. Bottomline: Is it worth a trek? Yes....more than once in awhile...nope (unless you live close of course.)
