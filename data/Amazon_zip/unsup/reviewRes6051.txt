Sometimes, when you expect a lot from a place over a long period of time, the expectations grow that much larger. But even walking in with that, this place did an excellent job to impress! We were a table of 14, a little bit of a challenge for the server, but he was patient and none of our orders came out wrong (you sort of brace yourself for that with a loud large group). The bruschetta had different toppings on each slice, and each of them was delicious! The cheese-stuffed focaccia was unique and rich (heavy), but delicious too! I had the risotto for my entree, but tried my friends' ravioli and pizza too. I was probably the least a fan of the pizza but all the other dishes were great! Now, if you're looking for an authentic Italian meal, this isn't your destination. But for something fun and creative, yet filling and good, I'd highly recommend Davanti Enoteca. I liked it so much that almost went back 3 days later with another friend, but alas, the 1 hour long wait even on a Tuesday night was a huge deterrent!
