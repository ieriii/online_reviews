What an amazing treat! Some really incredible sushi and combinations that truly tantalized the tastebuds. Watermelon that is carmelized and topped with unagi - incredible! Sunda also had an incredible saki selection - try the Green Ridge - bursted with apples and complemented our plates phenomenally. Remember to save room for dessert - highly recommend the "Ridiculous". So many selections that our server (Choo) helped us with some great tastings!! Definitely will go back - just need to save up for the next special occasion.
