The hotel is decent: nice decor, comfortable rooms, beautiful view. Unfortunately the staff is rude and incompetent. In short: I paid for a room filled with flowers, they did not deliver the flowers. The next morning they promised to refund my money and send a make-up bouquet to my wife. A month later, after three reminders, they sent the bouquet (with a blank card). A week after that their staff said everything was my fault. They have still not refunded my money. My credit card did the dirty work and charged back the flowers. Again: nice hotel, just avoid the concierge.
