Vibrant atmosphere! The restaurant is huge but divided off into sections so it doesn't feel like you're eating in the mess hall. Bold bright colors and photos throughout, very lively. I've been here before but last night we tried a bunch of different menu items. Started w/chips and guac, they were your basic chips and guac. Nothing made it stand out from any other I've had. Shrimp ceviche was excellent with a bit of a kick. I ordered the ropa vieja as my entree w/a side of rice and beans. I loved the dish, the fried plantains add a bit of sweetness. The rice and beans are a bit on the spicy side. Hubby had the pork adobo which he enjoyed and a side of the mac and cheese which I tried and have to say it was a little bland. Both our meat dishes had amazing flavors and were very tender. Whats even better than a great dinner with good service? Using our $30 living social coupon towards the bill!
