We stumbled by here last Saturday after a weekend of St. Patty's day activities. Because of the "holiday" most places in Chicago were either too packed, or full of too many drunks to bring my 11 year old brother in law along. The free parking was great, and the staff was excellent. It's a little expensive, but for a nice sit-down restaurant in Chicago, the price was comparable. Plus, the portions are really large, most of the chicken dishes come with 3- 5 oz boneless breast pieces, so a plate could easily be split. The best part was how accommodating they were for my wheat allergy. We were going out for my birthday, so had the waitress not worked with us, it probably would've turned out as bad as my lunch at Flat Top. They let me sub my pasta side for lemon asparagus, and the when the waitress realized that the cook adds flour to the meat sauce (who knew?), she quickly told me not to eat it, and got it redone, wheat-free, very quickly, and the meal was delicious. My husband got Corned Beef and Cabbage, which he loved it (coming from an Irish man "the best I ever had"), and the half slab of ribs entertained the 11 year old quite well. Living in Bridgeport, I've been to some of the cities "best" Italian places, often on the recommendation of my Italian neighbors, but this has to be my favorite. I'll definitely be back. Oh and they gave me a flourless cake for my birthday dessert, on the house!
