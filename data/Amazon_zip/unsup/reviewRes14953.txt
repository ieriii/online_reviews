LOVE this place. If I lived in Chicago I would be a regular here. Sit by the bar! It's fun watching the bartenders mix and conversing with them. I love the idea of speak-easy bars, and it's even better when their drinks are solid. It was a lot bigger than I had expected. The high seating gives each table an intimate feel and the whole atmosphere is just sexy. The first night, I went with my sister and we sat by the bar. The El topo was the first one I tried and I loved it. Very different, refreshing, and had that nice spicy kick to it. I brought my entire family the following night, and every drink wowed us. The bouncer in the front (Damien) was really nice, and I appreciated the fact that he let everyone in. The people in front of us were a bit rude (and tipsy) so he was a little short with them so I was nervous at first when I talked to him. The "Golden Rule" held true - "do unto others as you would them do unto you".     And I, along with the rest of my family, adored Patrick. He seemed like a sincerely nice guy. He treated us very well both nights and even wrote down a list of restaurants to try while we were in Chicago. He definitely made the whole experience that much better by conversing with us and making some killer off-the-menu drinks (just describe what you want and he'll deliver).
