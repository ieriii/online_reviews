A particular foreign songs starts playing in my head whenever I think about this restaurant. The song isn't important, but the experience is. You may think by the time you take your first step into the place that you're under-dressed, but that might have been just me and my significant other. That all changed the moment they greeted us. Such open, generous, genuine smiles will make you feel really welcome. once you're seated and they start serving your meal, you'd start thinking things are over priced, but as they keep on serving such delicacies on and on, you start to realize the amount of food that your going through. Imagine a table filled with delicious hors d'oeuvres, layer upon layer (in a neat way), all hidden away. Something like that. This is definitely the place for a romantic foodie date.
