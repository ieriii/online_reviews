I'm basing this review solely on my brunch experience. Although, I would like to give this place a second shot for dinner. Anyway, came here for brunch with a group of friends. The restaurant was pretty empty....it was around 1:30pm so that could have been the reason? Anyway, the brunch menu was pretty limited. I wasn't crazy for the options so I requested the continental buffet (meats, cheese, pastries, etc) but for what ever reason they stopped offering it just before we got there....(whateva). So I ended up ordering the brioche french toast and the rest of my party ordered the steak and eggs. Although everything tasted ok....the portion were so small that we were all considering going somewhere else to grab a "real" meal.....but then we realized it was just the fat kids in us and opted not to. Overall the food was just ok....nothing to rave about. I won't be returning for brunch nor would I recommend it. Maybe dinner would be a different story.
