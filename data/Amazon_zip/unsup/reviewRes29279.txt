This is one of my favorite little places in my neighborhood. It is fast, delicious and super cheap. I love taking my suburban friends here so they can have a city experience and not drain their wallets. The wait staff is always super friendly and very helpful. I read some of the negative reviews on here and I have to say that they are a bit nitpicky. I don't know any where in the city that you can get a sit down meal complete with appetizer, dinner, a glass of wine and dessert for under $25 per person. Plus, it is delicious and fast. What more could you want??
