Ahh the Piece. Good brew (obviously). Our server was great, even though the place got PACKED as soon as we got there (which was 6 PM on the dot on a Friday night). I met Yelp buddy caroline e. there, along with our significant others, and we had a great giant New Haven pizza with multiple toppings. Yum. Only downside? A wee bit pricey, but since this isn't your average pizza joint I'll let it slide. And I'll be back in June to sample caroline's favorite summer beer, with an update...
