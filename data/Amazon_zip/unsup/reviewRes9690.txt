Attention Yelpers: If you are uncertain about Sprout, DON'T BE! I took my husband here last week for his 31st B Day. Every year I must take him to a nice dinner. It gets harder and harder every year. We've been to SEVERAL places as we both are foodies. Okay, so let me get to the point. Interior pictures are hard to find for Sprout. People have mentioned things about it being in an old house and that it wasn't so pretty on the exterior, I don't know what they are talking about... It's beautiful and very modern on the exterior and on the interior! Don't let the menu freak you out, I will admit I was a little scared and didn't know what to expect. They have a pre course for $65.00. You get three items that are DELICIOUS (you get to pick a variety) and they bring out Moooose booose ? ha ha I can't spell that (2 of them) in between dinner. They are AMAZING! Service was super! Truly great! There wasn't a moment that we needed anything and yet the service wasn't intrusive either. Highly recommend! Great for special occasions or just a night out. We will go back and try their brunch! I can see why this place won a James Beard Award and a Michelin award!
