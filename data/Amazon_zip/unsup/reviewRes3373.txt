Ok-true confessions, and I hate to do this. I grabbed two Steak Bowls for my boyfriend and I a couple minutes before closing. It was like, Yay! We made it! Until I got home, and heard my boyfriend say "Uh, Katie? What's in this?" There were these gold tinged nodule covered lumps throughout both of our Bowls. At first I was like, "oh, just ignore it, I'm sure it's fine." But this stuff was disgusting. I felt like I was eating the inside of a cow's intestine. And the lumps kept getting bigger. I would say a solid 30% of the meat was comprised of these nodes. Ugh. That was over two months ago, and I can't bring myself to go back. I wanted to email them the next day to try to figure out what it was, but they don't have an email on their website. Phoning/visiting seemed a little confrontational (my problem, not theirs.) I don't know. Crisp, I've been your fan for so long, and I sorely miss you. I just can't think of you without feeling sick to my stomach. Sorry.
