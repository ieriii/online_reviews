A good place to go when you're craving for regular pasta. Get the fetuucini alfredo. I've tried their other tomato-based sauces, which are okay, but not really great (putanesca, frutti de mare, bolognese). Their drinks seem diluted in water. The servers are friendly at times, but it's hard to get their attention (more often than not). It's an interesting place. The place is clean. Bathroom is clean. An ok place to eat during the weekday.
