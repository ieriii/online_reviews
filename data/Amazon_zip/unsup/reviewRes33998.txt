cute little italian place on clark. went here for my birthday and had a wonderful time. we showed up for our reservations and were promptly seated by the windows - it got a little chilly after awhile, but that's really the only bad thing i have to say about the experience. i didn't notice the restaurant being too loud or too quiet, or the service being too pushy or not attentive enough. everything seemed to be just right. our food was very good, and tasted freshly made. i love that the menu is handwritten every two weeks; not only does the menu change throughout the year, but it's a nice little touch. word on the street is it's jennifer aniston's favorite restaurant in chicago.
