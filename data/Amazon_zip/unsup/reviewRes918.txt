We came on a Saturday afternoon -- no line? Yes!  On closer inspection, they were closed due to flooding.  Because they are closed on Sundays, it meant my supposed life-changing experience with Hot Doug's will have to to be delayed until Monday.  We come back on Monday and the line looped around the corner, with an estimated 45 minute wait.  Given the fact that I waited 2 days and 45 minutes (not including travel time away from the Loop), expectations were high. And Hot Doug's did not disappoint and did change my taste buds for hot dogs forever. The Foie Gras Hot Dog is delicious. The creaminess from the Foie Gras and the fattiness from the hot dog, marries extremely well. I expect Foie Gras from now on --- on all of my hot dogs.
