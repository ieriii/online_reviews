Stayed at this hotel at the end of the year to check out the fireworks at the Navy Pier. The hotel valet enterance is easily missed (on a one way street), but made it in the 2nd loop. Also the valet area is very crowded with people checking in and out, as well as cabbies. We waited for a few minutes before we could pull in. (Our car blocked the drive during check out, but we were prepared to load up and go. So only about a 3 minute hold up...) Upon checking in, the car was moved safely into a heated garage space by the valet (yes we snuck out and checked later). The hotel registration is up the elevators to the right. After we cheked in, we went up to our floor, and was welcomed by a grand view (see posted picures to see what I am talking about.) Already mentioned in a lot of other reviews, but... 1) Cooked-To-Order Breakfast (6:30am - 9:00am) is basically a tailored omlette your choices of spinach, chedder cheese, ham, bacon, jalapenos, peppers, onions, sausage, mushrooms and tomatoes. I just went for everything! 2) Managers reception (from 5:30 till 7:30pm) is basically free drinks and appetizers (chips and fries). A nice perk. 3) The room has a bedroom with either two full or one king (we stayed at the one king room suite) and a door that separates into the living room with a pull out sofa bed. (I heard that it was on the stiff side, but hey I didn't have to sleep in it.) 4) Pool, gym and sauna (6:00am till midnight) are available for people who want to work out. I went for couple laps at the pool, and used the sauna. Very refreshing in the morning. 5) Walking distance to main shopping area of town (i.e. Michigan Ave.). 6) Navy pier is two blocks from this place. A great place for a family visit Definitely a great family hotel, and if the rates meet my budget, definitely will stay again.
