I bought the groupon here 3/10/11. I checked their delivery area to make sure my location was included. It was. I ordered a pizza today 3/14/11. They told me they now don't deliver here. That is known as the old bait and switch. I updated my one star to five stars, based on customer service. After posting the review above that stated that they didn't deliver to me after stating so, I received a message from the manager, who fixed the problem and went out of her way to provide excellent customer service. I appreciated this a lot and see this restaurant is working hard for the customer's business.
