The wings are gigantic!! Baby Budda - nothing baby about it, it was more than enough for me, at $5.95, you can add meat for just a buck more. Did I say the wings are gigantic?? Fried to the "crisp" just enough so when they tossed with one of their sauce, it coats it perfectly. Sweet, sticky and messy....Love It! Not the kind of food for you if you don't like to eat with your hands. Although I saw these 2 Thai girls eating it forks and knife, weird. Go for the wings, try some bowl, you should be good to go.
