Just go there and enjoy a deep dish pizza. You'll love it. I shared a small deep dish pizza with another out of town-er at 830 at night on a Wednesday. She had heard about this place because it had won some contest on the food network!!  Believe it or not there was a 40 min. Wait for a table at 830 on a Wednesday. I can only imagine how busy it would be at 6 on a Friday on Saturday. Don't think twice you'll love it!!!
