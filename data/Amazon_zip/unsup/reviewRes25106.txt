My GF and I checked this place out looking for some casual tapas so we were taken by surprise when the food ended up being gorgeous and delicious.  We ate at the bar as tables would have been a 45 minute wait but we were served promptly and the waiters recommendations were great. I was happy to see they had Alagash belgian beer so I had about 3, my GF had a drink called shoko which was an interesing mixture of peach vodka, sour, cucumber and basil leaves. Very refreshing. For food I highly recommend the following: Bacon wrapped dates Arroz with Morel mushrooms Short ribs with scallops The chefs mix of cheeses The ravioli with boar bolognese The plates are small even for tapas but the food is filling and phenomenal, a word I rarely use. I would go back in a hot minute.
