The food is great. I never thought I would like a savory crepe, but this place turned me around. I also really like the turkish cofee and the fruit bowls are always delish. I admit the service can be a bit slow, but that is pretty typical of a true Cafe' experience where you come to catch up with friends and family. I also really enjoy the atmosphere. I always feel like I am being transported to another country. Bottom Line: Great food, Great Price
