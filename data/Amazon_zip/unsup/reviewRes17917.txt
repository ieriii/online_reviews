i hate to do this because i love this place and i hate for those who don't know to start going there and make my wait longer, but i have to sing the praises of the violet hour. the coolest bar you will ever go in. cheap? no. real drinks and real bartenders? yes. quiet and cool so you can have a conversation and a tasty drink without scores of drunk on canned beer barely 21-ers bump and grinding into you. bring cash and be prepared to experiment with some of the best mixed drinks you have ever had. weekends are crazy busy, but weekdays are easy to get in. no entrance until there are seats available!
