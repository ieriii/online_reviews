I am a huge fan! This was our first time here. We tried to get into (k)new (which is another fabulous Logan Square hot spot), but reservations were not available. I was a bit relieved because it gave me a chance to experience yet another great Logan Square eatery. The atmosphere was cozy but open and was perfect for a beautiful Chicago day. The doors were open, and people were seated outside as well. If your goal is to eat outside I would say get there early! Patrons tend to sit and stay....all night. There's a sizable menu of wonderful beers and wine's to taste and I can see why those who were there last night stayed at their table for 4 hours.  We opted to eat indoors versus waiting for a table and we were not disappointed. For 4 people we ordered 3 small plates, one salad, & 3 Entrees. This was just enough food for 4 people. Every single dish had something to love. I can't complain about any of them. I highly recommend this place.  It is first come first serve. We went at 8pm on a Tuesday night and waited at most, 20 minutes. Enjoy!
