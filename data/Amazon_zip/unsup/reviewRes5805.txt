We were in Chicago celebrating my husband's 45th birthday. He had eaten at Wildfire while in Chicago for work and really had a good experience, but I'd never been so we made reservations for Friday night at 8. We were seated close to our reservation time (probably 10 minutes after it). The restaurant was completely full on a Friday night - a very good sign.  I loved the atmosphere of the restaurant - it just buzzed.  Our server did a really good job keeping up with both our table and the 10-person party right next to us as well as a couple more tables in the section.  Our food was very, very good. We both had a filet with blue cheese crust (definitely get the crust - I was tempted by the horseradish crust but went with the blue cheese instead) and we shared our sides of macaroni and cheese and broccoli - very big and very good. The petite filet was plenty for me with the side. Especially after we ordered the smallest size available of the chop salad to share. We barely made a dent in the salad. It was very good but I would suggest not getting the chop salad unless you plan on taking some home or you are sharing it amongst four people. This restaurant was definitely worth a visit.  I wish we had saved room for dessert.
