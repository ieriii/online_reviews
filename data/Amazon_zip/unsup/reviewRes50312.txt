We love this place! Beer cocktails are fun and delicious. We shared the boneless tangy BBQ wings. My husband said they were the best he's ever had. I had the Omnivore burger with sweet potato fries. My husband had the turkey burger. Big portions, we couldn't finish the burgers! Wait staff was nice too. We will definitely be back!
