I love walking in somewhere and it smells SO amazing! That was how my visit began and it only got better. We arrived prior to 5:00 and the place was already hopping. While the kitchen does not open until 5 the offered great little nibbles of marinated olives, nuts and cheese plates. A great list of beers, interesting cocktails and an impressive list of whiskey offered a great start to our experience. Menu changes daily. Small plates, salads and entrees gave a wealth of choices. We started by sharing a butter poached lobster with sea urchin and cuddle fish pasta. AMAZING! Definitely on the rich side. My meat eating husband looked incredibly pleased with his duck duo dish and my butternut squash risotto was perfection. The portions were very ample and I loved being able to look forward to eating my left overs even before finishing. The only disappointment was both of us being too full to go for dessert. Next time! Our server was very knowledgable and attentive until nearing the end of our meal as the place was slammed. The host was great to check in on us and our table was always cleared and redressed in a blink of an eye. You must have their Old Fashion....absolutely the best I have ever had. Go! Eat! Drink! Enjoy!!!
