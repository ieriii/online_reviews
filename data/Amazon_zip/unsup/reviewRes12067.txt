I walked by this place every day on my way to work and it never looked open. Then I realized that they do lunch primarily, which solved that mystery. I went today with women from work, and we were all impressed. The coffee was great--not watery or run-of-the-mill. For lunch, I had chilaquiles with scrambled eggs. I've never had them before today, and they were great here. The chips were nice and crisp, and not too soggy under the salsa. At our table, we also had a cubano, which apparently had a great bread-meat ratio. There was an order of spinach quesadillas, which I almost ordered and which the eater loved. Two of the women ordered tacos, and again, thumbs up all around. I'd absolutely come back for lunch again, especially since I now know the elusive business hours. Could I have checked online? Probably, but that's no fun.
