My wife and I ate here on 04/06, and I have to say, this was far and away the dining experience of my life. If I could give it 10 stars, I would! Everyone will tell you about the food. The creativity of the presentations (I ate a BALLOON!), the intense flavors in each course (I could have had about a dozen of the razor clams, or black truffle explosions, or a gallon of hot potato/cold potato, or the lamb course), or the the dessert finale (presented at our table by Chef de Cuisine Matt Chasseur), the food is truly spectacular. What I would like to highlight is the service. Going in, you know it's a truly world-class restaurant, from the 3 Michelin stars, critical acclaim, internet reviews across the internet, and so forth. What you won't know about is what it's like to actually be there. Once you are there, you find that the service is exceptionally down to earth, and at the same time, disarmingly precise. I loved that they weren't afraid to laugh with you (custom "hot pot" picker-uppers), and at the same time serve your dishes as if it were a Russian ballet. Of course it all does come with a price, but once you go, you are left wondering "how the heck am I going to get back here?" I'm still trying to figure it out!
