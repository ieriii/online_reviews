This is easily the best pizza in the city. From the caramelized crust, down to the sauce, it doesn't get any better. Or does it??? Oh yeah, $5 lunch special every week day: a personal pan pizza with one topping and one free fountain drink or Miller Lite. I'm not a big fan of Miller Lite, but when I pay $5 for a pizza and a beer, it's hard to beat...
