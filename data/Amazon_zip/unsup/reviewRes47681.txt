I don't know why I don't go here more often?! Whether it's during the warm months outside on the roof deck, or inside by the fire when you want to bundle up indoors, this is my favorite place to brings friends, family, or a date. I haven't tried the endless meat experience =/ but I love ordering the assorted fondues with a pitcher of sangria. The meat and cheese and veggies are all roasted to perfection and can be comfortably shared among 3 friends. And the bartenders are always very helpful and knowledgable when trying to decide on your next drink and/or nibble. The roof top has a tendency to be on a 'wait-list' during the summer but it's worth it if you can find seating. In the downstairs bar, it is surprisingly easy to find a spot to sit either at the bar or at a table.
