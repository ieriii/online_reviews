I've been here countless times since they've been open, yes its loud but you won't find more authentic food in Chicago.The food follows the seasons in true Italian tradition. I am amzed at the variety and depth of the specials. Last time was fresh grilled sardines to halibut in parchment. A true gem. Another plus is the wine list there are many options by the glass and the staff is most accomodating with letting you sample.
