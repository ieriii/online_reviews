Outstanding again! This was our 3rd time and it was as good as the last. We had the bone marrow, beets, crispy brussel sprouts (best ever!), mussels, pork shoulder and a tasty espresso based dessert......can't recall the name. Perfect Greek wine pairing suggested by our server. I will be back again soon!
