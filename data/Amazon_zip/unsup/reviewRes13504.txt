I'll never know about the food because the doorman was such a douchenozzle I will never return. We walk in - me and my Yelpin' buddy - and the place is packed. The smarmy door-guy actually had the gonads to ask us to let two groups go ahead of us. One - he said - was an old man. The man couldn't have been much more than 55 years old. I am 47 so I am not hearing that. The other group is outside smoking a cigarette -but he is willing to go grab them to get them seated faster to get us seated faster after them. Later loser. We walked out the door. We walked down the street and got a nice dinner - then we went across to Margie's for a bit of heaven. There is nothing Glenn's has to offer - except a crappy door guy who looks like the guy from the Brawny paper towel commercials except without the hygiene. Done!
