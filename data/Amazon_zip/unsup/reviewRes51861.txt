Besides the long ass line ... I'm talking about a line that goes at the end of the block! Deep dish w/ spinach, sausage, mushroom, extra cheese w/ a lot of beer is the way to go on winter.  There were writing all over the wall & ceiling (if you can reach it). There were some on arcades too. But the bathroom was immaculate! Remember, this is a tourist spot. You don't go here for the best pizza in town (just like cheesesteak's Geno's or Pat's in Philly). Go to Lou Malnati's if you're looking for the best one.
