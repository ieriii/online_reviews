Found this place thanks to YELP on a solo late dinner two weeks ago while on a work trip to Chicago. Amazing. Service was awesome, Atmosphere was very convivial. I ordered the Pig's Ear, Brussel Sprouts, and Milk Braised Pork Shoulder, all on the recommendation of my waitress and have not been able to stop thinking about them ever since. If you can find this place, don't miss it.....
