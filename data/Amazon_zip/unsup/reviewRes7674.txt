This is a really nice neighborhood options for people in Lincoln Park. I suppose it is fairly close to the Diversey Brown Line stop for travelers as well. Everything that you would expect from a nice Italian place. Clean with a large variety of dishes to choose from. Both for your palette and your budget.
