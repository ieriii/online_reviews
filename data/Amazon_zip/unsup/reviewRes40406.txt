You have to love the place because you can eat here in a fancy dress or jeans and a baseball cap at 2 AM and not feel out of place in either. The food is average, the service is what it is. They're polite but not friendly, they want to feed you and get you out so they can feed more people.  If you order the quesadillas be sure to specify Nortena, because they are sooooo much better. They come seeping in a delicious tomatoey sauce that is to die for. Or at least, to wait for.  The burritos are ok. They're made to appeal to a big appetite that's not too picky. The meat is not at all tender and though it's a taqueria, it can do better by it's beef. And if not, then be cheaper on the price about it. I cannot use a bathroom that close to a dining area. Just can't do it.
