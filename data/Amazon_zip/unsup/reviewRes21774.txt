This place used to be awesome before everyone found out about the 1/2 price margarita Thursdays and went there. The food is just OK, it has gotten spicier over the years and they raised their prices. Margaritas are pretty good, but not nearly as good as other finer establishments like El Cid or Garcia's. Every Lincoln Parker loves it so they can get drunk, but that's what MP does well....gets yuppies and college kids drunk for relatively cheap.
