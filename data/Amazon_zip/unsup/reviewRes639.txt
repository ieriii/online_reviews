I had no idea what this place was about as I was in Chicago on a quick business trip and was asked to join some friends and colleagues last minute. It's incredible! By far the best restaurant I've been to. Looking at the menu and prices, you try very hard to find something wrong with it, however, it's simply just fantastic. For the six of us, the bill was easily over $2k, so be prepared to fork over the card!
