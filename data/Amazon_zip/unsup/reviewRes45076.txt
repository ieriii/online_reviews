A party of 10 and I took Anteprima by storm this past December. My roommate waited for about an hour when she went to Anteprima the weekend before, so I was happy to have enough people to make a reservation. However, while the place was certainly happening, it never felt overly crowded. The dim lighting was romantic, but while I could see bringing a date here, it wasn't only a DATE place.  As for food, we tried the octopus(pulpo) as an appetizer and the waiter was dead-on when he said it was one of the best items on the menu. I also had a half order of the pumpkin ravioli. The ravioli was delicious--but in trying to save $6 on the whole order, i got literally 4 piece of ravioli. Youch. Good thing there was plenty of bread and olive oil! **Hint, breadpudding lovers--look not further. The breadpudding here many be the best in the city--and def my hungry stomach feel all better pronto pronto!
