I went to TRU about 5 years ago for my birthday. I still think back fondly on that night as THE greatest dining experience I've ever had...and I've eaten at a lot of restaurants in Chicago and throughout the world. Bill was $300 per head (with tip), but it was completely worth it. They have trained their staff so that serving is an ART. The food is so imaginative, presented so beautifully, and so delicious. I still think about the caviar staircase, the most amazing soup I have ever had, and the phenomenal dessert. I think I've talked myself into splurging again at TRU very soon!
