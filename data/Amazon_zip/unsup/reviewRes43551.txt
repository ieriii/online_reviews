Milk & Honey has a nice, bright atmosphere. The food is delicious - from sandwiches to salads to breakfast to desserts. The service isn't always the most outgoing/friendly, but it hardly detracts from the experience. Keep in mind that they are only open until the late afternoon - so dinner is not an option.
