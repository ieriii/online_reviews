Went here for the first time last weekend for a friend's birthday dinner.  I had a reservation, but I saw that even if you didn't have one, the staff was more than happy to accommodate parties. Given the nice weather, most people, including me, wanted to sit outside. We were sat immediately and our waiter was prompt, personable and helpful. I ordered some appetizers and my friends ordered main dishes and we shared. All were delicious. We were very impressed with the veal saltimbocca and the pumpkin ravioli. The portions are decent. The wine list was comprehensive too. We were very happy with the selections recommend by our server. The only complaint I had was that we were seated outside by the kitchen entrance and they were doing some cleaning in there and there was a strong odor of bleach by our table. I asked the server if there was any way to shut the door or something, and he took care of it. I don't know why they thought to bleach the place during dinner rush but hey - at least they're clean! Overall, it was a very nice dining experience and I'll be back!
