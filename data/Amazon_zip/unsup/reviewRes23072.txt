I love going to Chinese restaurants with my chinese friends!! I learn so much about the different regional food. Anyway, Sze Chuan style food is all about spicy! And so we had a lot of the traditional Sze Chuan style dishes such as dan dan mein, mapo tofu, and this beef in chili sauce dish. The dan dan mein were these noodles in chili sauce with pickled vegetables (appetizer)- and was surprisingly tasty. The beef in chili sauce was very tender but there was so much cabbage vs. meat. I think next time I would only order one of these spicy type dishes b/c they were too similar. We also had some dumplings and shrimp and broccoli which were tasty but average. I think this place is all about what you order, so I'm sure I can change my rating next time around. It's so crowded and a very popular place when we went for Friday lunch. Yummy option in Chinatown.
