My first visit was on a Tuesday night last week with a group of ten people for a special occasion. I had made a reservation two days in advance over the phone. Open Table had said there were no reservations for the date and time I requested, so I am glad I called the restaurant directly, so I recommend doing that.The atmosphere was fun and classy. All the servers and staff we encountered were fantastic - friendly, very helpful, and enthusiastic. Each person took extra time with members of my party and it was much appreciated and refreshing.For my meal, I had the gnocchi. It was very tasty - different than other gnocchi I had eaten before and much better. The sauce was the most perfect blend garlic and light butter flavor and was not greasy at all. The vegetables were perfectly cooked and the whole dish had great flavor. I would definitely order it again.The only reason I withheld one star was because the dinner overall took more time than I thought it would. It took awhile for the waitstaff (the people helping our server, not our server) to clear plates or bring more bread, etc. Overall, it did not leave a lasting negative impression on me or the rest of my party, but I just remembered, so I thought I would mention it.I would definitely go back for a quite private dinner and recommend it for a special occasion.
