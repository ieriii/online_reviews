Is it just me or is every dish here way too salty? I expected to leave this restaurant happy and satisfied. I left wondering what the big fuss is about. Most dishes approached great, but left me gulping down water because of the sodium content. Service started out very helpful and attentive, but as the restaurant filled up I started to feel forgotten about. We sat near the kitchen and I also saw one of the chefs taste the food and then stick the same spoon back in the pan. I'm sure this happens more than I care to know, but when you see it happen right in front of you, it heightens the ick factor.
