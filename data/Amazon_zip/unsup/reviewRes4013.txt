Edit 2: Still amazing. Had an awesome meal where they took excellent care of us after having had to cancel a few days beforehand. I know it can be annoying to get a last-minute call wiping out your hard-won reservation. I swore and called them awful names for hours afterwards. But they REALLY do try to make up for any inconvenience, which they could certainly get away with not doing. The baked potato soup was an amazing dish. So playful and fun.
