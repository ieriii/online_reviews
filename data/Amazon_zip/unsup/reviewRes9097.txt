Why Le Colonial? I really wanted to like you...(Unfortunately, things did not work out between us). The decor is beautiful but it reminds me of being in Louisiana and not in a chic Vietnamese/French restaurant, either way I really liked the way it LOOKED. Now onto the food! First, let me start by saying that there might be a reasonable explanation to my two stars....maybe it was the arrogant chef who was too busy focusing on the one "it" client in the restaurant that he forgot how to cook food...not sure, point being the food was so boring. I was expecting a "kick-pow-wow" in your mouth moment followed by the silence that only occurs during incredibly delicious meals (this skill is only acquired by few very talented chefs and in my opinion, is what food is all about). So that moment never happened...I was incredibly dissapointed by the lack of attention to (maybe just our dishes) and the lack of flavor and uniqueness that should come with such meals. Maybe I should just settle with knowing that everyone's standards and taste buds are different, either way this might be the type of establishment your taste buds and societal standards are accustomed to. Maybe I'm being too harsh but I've sampled dishes from around the world so when it comes to food I am extremely particular about the flavors, preparation, and concepts that occur with the art of cooking. Therefore, Le Colonial, it was not your presumptuous air that turned me off, it was your food.
