Will go back, but will not get red sauce pizza. Pros: The service was surprisingly attentive, the home brews were good, and the Caesar Salad was awesome, with real anchovies. Also, I do like to watch the cubs on TV, and could do that here without having to be around a ton of douche-bags. Hurray for that! Cons: Am no fan of a pizza slice you can't hold in your hands to eat. I tried the red sauce pizza, and it's greasy. The crust was super thin and spineless. Also, not enough toppings on the pizza. I counted three small pieces of Italian sausage on each large slice. Maybe it's not always so topping-sparse, but it was like that last Monday when I was there. So yes, will be back, but will try one of the other types of pizzas.
