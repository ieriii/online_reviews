I really enjoy the food at this place, but what's with the music??? Our food was delicious - flavorful, plentiful (without being gluttonous), and moderately priced. (I had risotto appetizer, tilapia entree, and creme brulee dessert). But it was soooo noisy, and the chatter was compounded by loud and inappropriate music. Justin Timberlake in an Italian restaurant at 7pm? I had to yell across the table to be heard. And pop music doesn't make for a relaxing meal.
