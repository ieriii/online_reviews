How is it possible that I've found the best tasting Korean BBQ here in Chicago that rivals any L.A. Korean BBQ joint in K-town?! This place is amazing. The meat is well seasoned & packed w/ flavor. They even make the chicken taste incredible (which is not usually something I recommend ordering at a K joint.). Beef is where it's at. Kalbi, baby! Skip the beef bone though, the cartilage is way too tough.  You will leave stuffed. Get one of the combo specials w/ a big group of people to share. There's a salad course, a spicy soup course, Jap Chae (glass noodles), the plethora of pickled goodies in tiny bowls.... then apps get the seafood pancake and the dumplings for sure. All of this before you even get to the succulent pieces of meat & hot sticky rice. YUM. My only reservations about the place is that they need better ventilation. Expect to leave smelling like Korean BBQ until you shower. Not a bad smell. Just a smoky bbq smell lingering in your clothes. (Leave your coat in the car.) Also, some people in our group were put off by the tradition of taking your shoes off before sitting at the larger tables. I thought the idea was cute but again, BE PREPARED TO TAKE OFF YOUR SHOES! Get a pedicure/wear the socks w/o holes/keep the stinky shoes at home! Once you get over that, it's a sweet find. Great for groups and an interactive dining experience. I would definitely go again!
