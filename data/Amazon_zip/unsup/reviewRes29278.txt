This was by far some of the best vegan food I've ever eaten! I got a chocolate banana milkshake and the BBQ burger. The group of us also shared the buffalo wings. The ranch was to DIE for! We sat outside on the patio which was a bit quieter than the diner inside. I think my only real complaint is the vegan mac n' cheese, which I was really excited about. It was really quite bland and not cheesy at all. They could probably stand to reassess that recipe. Otherwise, everything was spot on perfect! My cousin raved that it was the best veggie burger she'd ever eaten! I can't wait to come back next time I'm in Chicago!
