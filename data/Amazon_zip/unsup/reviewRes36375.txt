I love Indie Cafe and Sushi. It's the ideal place for a date, dinner with a friend, or a large group. The menu is huge, with several sushi options, japanese cuisine, and Thai dishes. I have a hard time deciding, so I usually end up ordering a little bit of everything: a couple of pieces of sushi or maki, an appetizer, and then a Thai dish for my entree. Everything is well prepared, presented artfully, and prices are more than fair. Street parking is pretty easy too. And don't miss the weekend lunch specials. One of the best bargains in the city.
