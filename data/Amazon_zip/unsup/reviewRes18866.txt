I recently went to the Bad Apple with my wife and her family. We were just looking for a good dinner out with some drinks, nothing fancy as it was a Friday night and a long week at work. I ordered the Pat LaFrieda burger which was fantastic. The burger came out as ordered and was everything I hoped it would be. There is something about blue cheese on a cheeseburger that makes me happy. Everyone else agreed that the burger options were immense and the resulting taste was great. The beer selection is pretty good too. Oddly though, we went here on a 90+ degree day and the air conditioning wasn't on, or wasn't on very high. Not that we were uncomfortable, but it was a bit warmer than we would have liked. No big deal, it won't keep me from going back, but it was a little abnormal.
