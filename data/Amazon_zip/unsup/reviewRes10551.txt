Needless to say, after running 10 miles, almost anything would sound delicious. In all honesty, I was a little hesitant at first - I had serious cravings for some heavy carbs, but I acquiesced given the raving fan following Piece has. We ordered the queso de cabra - which again, I was skeptical... that's a Spanish dish... at a pizza joint? Boy, was I wrong! Delicious... so much so that we kept the marina sauce for future dipping pleasantries. Our pizza arrived shortly thereafter. I was truly disappointed... our order was wrong. The one ingredient that I dislike, was all over our pizza =( We informed our waitress and she removed the pizza. How devastating.  Now here's where Piece earns a place in my heart. Our waitress returned with the incorrect pizza and offered it to us to gnosh on while the correct pizza is made. She apologized and assured us that our right pizza was on its way. Well of course, we ate the vast majority of this onion-laced pizza - which was still delicious, by the way. Just needed to pick off those breath evil doers and I was good to go. Our waitress returned with the onion-less pizza and that was ALSO devoured... just a bit more slowly than the first. When the waitress presented our check, she told us that they took half off the cost of the ONE pizza and that she would gladly box up the remains of BOTH pizzas. So if I do my math correctly here... we consumed 2 pizzas for half the price of one... meaning we paid 25% of what we got. Talk about great customer service! I'm sorry I didn't get our waitresses name - I blame the fatigue of SF10, but kudos to her and whomever hired her!
