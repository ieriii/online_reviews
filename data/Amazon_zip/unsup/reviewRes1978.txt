Delicious, gourmet sausages, and damn good regular old hot dogs too. In fact, my favorite thing there is the plain old bratwurst. Their brat is fairly mild, but with a really nice mix of spices so it's got great flavor without being too overpowering. Then the weekly specials are always interesting and creative. The duck fat fries are delicious but nothing to write home about. Long lines as well.  However, in short: AWESOME!  Should be on an episode of Best Thing I Ever Ate, for sure.
