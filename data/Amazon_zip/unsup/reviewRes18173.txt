Great gourmet bar-food, amazing beer list, and a comfortable atmosphere... with a waitstaff who knows what they are talking about. I had to give my one-sentence review for this place because they have received a lot of okay reviews from people who take a while to explain themselves. The result? A lower rating with no clear reason... Great gourmet bar-food; I'm talking BURGERS and sandwiches. Thank god, you all know I'm a Kuma's addict, but with no monthly special burger I have been itching for some variety. Welcome burgers with peanut butter (yeah, it is good. just be prepared to nap after ordering the Elvis). The beer list is outstanding. Local, varied, seasonal, sexy... and the beer list was bigger than the food list. Atmosphere--outside patio, inside modern planked seating, with a secret room filled with games for the more casual patrons.  I wasn't crazy about the Waygu, but it was my first, so maybe this burger-lover just doesn't rock the waygu.  Next time I will be checking out the sandwiches (instead of burgers) so I can try more beers. It is that kind of place.
