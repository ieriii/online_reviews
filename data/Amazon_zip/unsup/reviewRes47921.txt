i actually went here as a client and so i got the whole "wow" experience but i can't imagine that it would be any less amazing. the harvest table itself was worth going for. it's not the "feeding trough" buffet style that i think of when i think of brazillian steak houses. everything was gourment and well presented. the meats were to die for - they had venison, duck and a buttermilk-soaked cut of beef (can't remember which cut exactly) along with several others. it was so amazing! even the chicken was something to rave about! they do everything seasonally including the drinks - i had a white grape martini and an old-fashioned that had cinnimon infused into it... in the summer they have a fancy-pants lounge-ish rooftop where you can go watch pretty people and drink hoity-toity cocktails. the lounge downstairs is pretty cool too. our server was knowledgeable about all the wine and food and super attentive. the decor is comfortable but contemporary and i can't wait to go here again!
