We went here for my mothers birthday. It was hands down the best place I have ever been to. That is saying a lot since I have been to a lot of different restaurants..... and I love to eat. The plates were all amazing and the presentation was impeccable, as was the service. They also made some special plates due to allergies of my sister. The chef is actually from my hometown and I guess we were the first people (besides his family) from his town to visit the restaurant. I would love to go here again since I am sure the menu has changed since last time I visited. Great all around place and a must for any foodie that visits Chicago.
