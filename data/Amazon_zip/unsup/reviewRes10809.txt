Piece is a combination Microbrewery and Pizza bar/restaurant. When I lived in the City I used to go here often. Their specialty is the White Pizza with Olive Oil and Garlic. They also have excellent salads. The best one is with pears and goat cheese with a balsamic dressing. The microbrewery is also very good. Their brew list is not extensive as Goose Island or Rock Bottom, but is still excellent. Although I now live in the suburbs, I will definitely head back here from time to time.
