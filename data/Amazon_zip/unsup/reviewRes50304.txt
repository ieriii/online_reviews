Jalapeno Jam. That stuff is bomb, I can't stop thinking about it. Had Brunch on a Sunday at 10:30, not busy but picked up to a fully bustling restaurant shortly after. Coffee was great, I wasn't drinking but the selection seemed well rounded and classy. The food was tasty and they gave free beignets. Went with the eggs Benedict. It was a sold choice. All in all great outing, solid service and moderate prices. Parking was a breeze.
