We gave the Indie Cafe a shot a while ago and rarely go anywhere else for sushi. The food is awesome.For those who do not want to spend a lot of money on sushi... you can easily order sushi AND thai for a great price. Their chicken fried rice is delicious. I also enjoy their Popeye sushi.Also, the wait staff is soooo friendly. For example, one night we were there after they closed with friends. They came up to us and said "would you mind if we vacuumed around you?". They didn't want us to leave, they saw we were having a great time. That was very sweet of them.We love you Indie Cafe!
