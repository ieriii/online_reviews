Actually 3 1/2 stars. The dishes I tried were all good but a bit ordinary... bland maybe? I expected something orgasmic with all the wonderful reviews I've seen on Yelp. Bummer. For starters, I had the corn cake and lentils. It was decent. There wasn't anything in it that made me go "wow" or "what is that". The lentils and the corncake had similiar textures, so it made the dish a little boring. The lime helped a bit... For my entree, I had the monkfish with braised taro. Nicely made. There was some mango salsa for the fish which was refreshing but nothing special. I'm not a big fan of bread pudding but fellow yelpers raved about it so I got it. While it was tasty, I was disappointed. It was the same bread pudding I've eaten a dozen times before. The homemade ice cream kiley had was good though... Overall the food was good but nothing really surprised me. I loved the casual atmosphere of Bonsoiree and our server was great. I'll be coming back for sure! You really can't beat the price. I'll give the lamb a try next time...
