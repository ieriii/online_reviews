Saturday, September 18th - Reservation - 8pm. After a terrible experience at a competitor the night before, this was a refreshingly great experience. The food was great, service was great, and we were seated shortly after our reservation time. The food was seasoned very well, not too salty or overwhelming. The staff replaced plates after each serving such that we never ate from dirty plates. We will definitely be returning to this restaurant!
