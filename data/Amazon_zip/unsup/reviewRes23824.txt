This place is getting my first ever 3 star review. So gettin down to business, we saw this place on Check Please the evening before and having past by plenty of times as it is a 5 minute drive away, we decided it was time. I got the Chicago crepe. It was ok, it was good. It wasn't good enough so that I'd ever want to get it a second time unfortunately. I was pretty underwhelmed. It tasted good and fresh but it just wasn't as savory and "omg i'm gonna devour this" good. It was more like "eh this is decent, not to shabby" good. The boy had the Icosium crepe and although he said he liked it alot i had the same consensus about it after trying a couple bites. I definitely wouldn't come here if i was uber-hungry cuz these crepes will not hit the spot. Now for dessert, we got the plain nutella crepe which elicited a "yum-o gimme more!" response ;) Dessert crepes are definitely the prizewinner for me at this spot. I wouldn't mind coming here again to give the other crepes a try but would definitely not mind frequenting this spot for dessert alone.
