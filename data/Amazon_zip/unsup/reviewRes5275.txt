First meal in Chicago - LOVED IT. Had: pig ears, bone marrow, meatball sliders, brussel sprouts, chicken thighs kebobs, and the pork shoulder. I could go on and on about how good this place is but it seems redundant if you read the other Yelp reviews. I will say, pig ears are my new favroite food. Everything else was delicious as well. Stop reading Yelp and just go try it!
