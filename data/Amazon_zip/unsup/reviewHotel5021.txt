I am a little late on my review because I just discovered this site. My wife and I spent our wedding anniversary here in October. We couldn't go out of town but wanted to get out of the house! Even though the W is close to our condo we decided to spend the weekend here since we are big W fans! I had flowers waiting in the room when we arrived so the hotel knew it was our anniversary. They upgraded our room and treated us like it was our honeymoon. They went above and beyond our already high expectations due to years of staying at W hotels. The bartenders knew us by name and knew our drinks. The food was amazing! The pool was better then our health club. All amenities were first class.The view is one of the best in the city and worth the room rate alone. The customer service was top notch. I will have all out of town guests stay here going forward. This hotel is the overall package. There are still other W hotels I like better but as far as hotels in Chicago this one tops them all. From the min we walked in the door we know we made the right choice. Keep up the great customer service on every level and this hotel will always be one of the best and our home away from home right here in Chicago! Thanks for making our anniversary one of the best!
