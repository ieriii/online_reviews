This places rocks!!!!! I've been excited about it since before they opened. It took the place of the tragically poor Calvin's BBQ. Now that they have table service and the best patio in the near west side. They are truly one of my favorite places in the city, let alone the hood. The empinadas are awesome, the bisteak, guarito and lechon sandwiches are all killer. the steak dinner is great as well, the mariquitas are covered in a pungent garlic sauce that is very addictive. their house hot sauce is very good and they offer habenero sauce for those of us with true chili pepper addictions. A great spot to pick up a strong coffee. At one visit the owner stopped to see how everything was and was very nice and seemed genuinely happy to have us. The place to be on a nice summer night. Reasonably priced
