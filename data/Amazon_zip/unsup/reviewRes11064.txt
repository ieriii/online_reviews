Pizza is good. Beer is good. Wait can be long. Luckily, we are old fogeys so we typically eat early and this has not been a problem. Ingredients are fresh and combinations are innovative. Can be pretty packed and cramped which is a bummer. Beware: pizzas are HUGE. Plan on taking some home. Or waddling there.
