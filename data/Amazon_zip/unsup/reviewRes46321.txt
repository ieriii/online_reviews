This is the better version of The Cheesecake Factory. You simply cannot miss at Grand Lux for a great meal paired with great service in a beautiful room. It is a wonderful place to go for lunch with co-workers or clients. The menu is behemoth, but very well organized so it is easy to find what you want. Don't skip on creative cocktails [both with and without alcohol] and be sure to order the chocolate chip cookies the minute you sit down. They will be hot and ready by the time you are done with your meal.
