Went here for the first time last weekend. The food was extremely yummy and the serice was pretty fast, definately worth the 30 minute wait, if you are looking for unique brunch items. However, I have to take off a few stars because the bacon strips that came on my sandwich consisted of 99% clear fat with a millimeter's worth a meat, so that was inedible. I put it aside and a busser took it away before I was able to let the server know. I also understand that they are very busy and want to turn their tables over quickly, but I felt like we were being rushed out of there once our meal came. Like I said, the food was very tasty (minus the bacon) and unique, but I wish they had more "pure" chocolate items, everything chocolatey was mixed with banana.
