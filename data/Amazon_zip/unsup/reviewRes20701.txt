Sooooooooooo good. I love this place. Never had a bad meal, the staff is very professional and even though it is crazy busy, everything runs so smoothly. Saw Rick stroll through today to keep an eye on things. My friend had a seafood caldo and it was HUGE with lots of shrimp and mussels. The woodland mushroom sammie was excellent. Go early -- the line can get ugly.
