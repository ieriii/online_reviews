I love Bin 36. It was one of the first places I tried once moving to Chicago 4 years ago and then getting into wine. We took a wine class here and while it seemed a little advanced at the time, using what we learned later become a challenge and we found we were far more knowledgeable than others who have been into wine longer. We usually only go for wine and port flights, but on our last visit we had a meal and a cheese flight for desert.  For a successful visit to Bin 36, ask the servers for their opinions. They are trained in the cheeses and wines. Looking around and observing, I've noticed that people feel they need to know about wine before going in. Just the opposite is true; use the knowledge of your server.
