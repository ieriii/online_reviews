My mum took me here for my birthday when she visited this year. We went on a Friday night without a reservation, but a combination of my mother's super persuasive charm and the accommodating Greek host got us a table in a relatively short amount of time. The food was excellent. We shared a couple appetizers and then I had the lamb. I converted to meat-eater-ianism about 4 years ago and every so often I come across a dish I've never tried before. Like lamb. Or marrow. Both of which I had that night and both of which were delectable. We finished up with a Greek version of tiramisou and three jolly Greek men singing me happy birthday. Then I got a kiss on the cheek. And then my mother got a kiss on the cheek. And then my mother got a kiss on the lips and suddenly became all smiley and toothy at the lovely old Greek guy who had led the chorus of birthday wishes. Anyway... The service was excellent, although perhaps slightly over enthused on the part of the water guy. It got to the point where every time we saw him nearing our section, Mum or I would whisper a word of warning and cover our water glasses until he'd passed. We felt like secret agents. Altogether, however, a thoroughly enjoyable experience. There were obviously lots of people enjoying themselves and I felt certain that I'd want to come back again.
