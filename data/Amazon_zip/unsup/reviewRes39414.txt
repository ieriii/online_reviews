I loved almost everything about Longman & Eagle. The hostess was a bitch, but maybe she was having a bad day. The food was outstanding. We tried three apps - meatballs, panzanella salad and the tete de cochon. My favorite was the tete de cochon. For our entrees we had the short rib/filet with foie gras and fried bone marrow ( I've loved marrow all my life), pork belly and the wild Boar sloppy joe. Not a miss in the group. I may never go back. The noise level was excruciating. I'll wait until they offer room service and book at room and get dinner.
