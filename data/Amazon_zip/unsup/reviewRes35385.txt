This place offers the true, authentic Chinese experience. Any by that I mean that you honestly feel like you are one of 1.3 billion people when it comes to waiting in line or trying to track down the waitstaff into giving you your bill.  Those prices, though are the flipside.  In keeping with the whole China thing, they feel nearly subsidized by a government, they are that cheap.
