This was a destination restaurant so that should say something to begin with. I heard raving reviews and they were all correct. Tucked away from the busy streets of downtown Chicago, the PP provides a private atmosphere in a reasonably calm yet bustling hotspot. I recommend ordering the Asparagus and Hazelnut salad - a perfect mix of crunch, sweetness and fresh vegetables. I really enjoyed the Camembert Cheese (think of a brie crossed with a rich goat cheese) and DON"T MISS the Eggplant Caponata with Goat Cheese - without a doubt the best dish I had.  Be warned, the Roasted Bone Marrow is difficult to eat. I say this as someone who does not get grossed out easily and I had to work to dig the marrow from the bone and could only have one taste - it was too much for me. Go, eat and enjoy!
