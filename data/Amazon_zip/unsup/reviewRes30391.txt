A "be seen" place with lots of beautiful people to look at (along with some douchebags if you like them too). That said, we were pretty pleasantly surprised with our shared dishes. We ordered 6 shareable dishes for 4 guys, which was plenty as the portions are pretty good sized Standout dishes were the steamed buns with roasted duck, served as a sandwich, pancit noodles, with shrimp and pork belly, and duck hash served tossed with a sunny side up egg, daikon cake, and frise.  The fried Brussels sprout salad with fresh chilis was also quite tasty as was the Devil's Basket, a duo of fried softshell crabs on a bed of wok fried chilis that are blazing hot. Skip the desserts as we tried 3 of them, and found them boring and not worth the calories. Service for us was very quick, attentive, and friendly. Overall dinner was about $60 person including a couple of drinks each and tip. I recommended this to a local friend for he and his wife's date nights.
