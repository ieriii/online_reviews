Was excited to hear that yet another local brewery was opening in Chicago - and after hearing stories of 2 hour waits - I was even more excited when I went and walked right in. First, the beer. Loved the Bottom Up Belgian Wit and Coup d'etat. Perhaps it was the mood or the first honestly "warm" afternoon in Chicago, but they seemed more to be more the "craft" beer I was looking for. The Iron Fist Pale Ale and Workingman's Golden Ale were good as well, if perhaps the "safe" choice for customer and brewer alike. For dinner, we were torn. I was eying the PLT with pork belly, but they were out. Instead, we had the mussels in cider/blue cheese sauce to start. They were perfectly cooked and warm in the broth. Order the extra 4 pieces of bread for $1, its more than worth it. For an entree, we decided to split the rueben and fries and a pizza. We had the arugula, parmesean, and lemon olive oil pizza. Now, I'm a sucker for all three of those things, but the pizza lived up to the expectations. Perfectly crispy crust and a pile of shaved cheese and arugula made it a great complement (oddly) to the rueben. It wasn't the healthiest meal I've ever had, but it was certainly tasty. Each would have been perfect as a whole meal, but we were happy to try more from the menu. Would love to try the burger next time. I'll be back to pick up a growler one of these warm days and definitely a meal. Parking is easy along Milwaukee and its a perfect spot to meet friends coming from the Loop - the Blue Line stop is just a 5 minute walk.
