Think "upscale Courtyard Marriott" is an oxymoron? You won't if you stay here. My stay here felt similar to my stays at hotels in Chicago with reputations for being more higher-end. Beds were plush and very comfortable, staff was super friendly and very accomodating, and the lobby was warm and inviting - complete with a fireplace, a giant jar of cookies, a bowl of crisp apples and a dispenser of apple cider. Very convenient location, just a short block off Michigan Avenue. (Though if you are watching your calories, be warned: Getting to Michigan Avenue from this hotel requires passing Garrett's Popcorn; be prepared to be very tempted by the waff of hot caramel!)
