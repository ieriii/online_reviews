This is one of my favorite places for breakfast/brunch around Chicago. I love their coffee: the one that leaves that bitter/ashy aftertaste. Food is also really good. I love their omelettes and the home potatoes. Wait staff is great and they are very kid-friendly. The only thing is that it can get pretty crowded sometimes. However, all in all, it is a great place!
