My favorite pizza in Chicago, hands down. I remember when it opened a few years ago and everyone was complaining about the prices (as in, they were supposedly too high for the size of pizza). Well, now that the gourmet pizza trend has fully caught on, it seems that everyone else is charging about the same. Which is to say that I think it's perfectly reasonable that they charge ~$15 for a pizza big enough to be finished by one hungry person that is topped with premium ingredients. I got the white pizza topped with arugula (my absolute favorite!!! not offered as an option in nearly enough places!) and prosciutto. I didn't love the prosciutto on the pizza, though it was good quality. But I'd definitely get the other arugula topped option they had with mushroom, I think). The other pizza we ordered was the sausage -- far and away the winner of the evening. I love the fennel sausage with a simple tomato sauce. The pizzas are thin crust, but have a fairy sizeable chewy outer crust -- the perfect combination, in my opinion. They cook so quickly (something like 90 seconds) that once you've ordered, you have nearly instant gratification. Also great selection of inexpensive wines by the glass. Convivial atmosphere. Fast service. Easy street parking. Try it.
