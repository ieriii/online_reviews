Well it has been about 2 years since I have done a review on this place. I came here tonight with a friend for dinner, and Wow! really enjoyed the food. We sat on the upper level, which I did not know they had, we had a great corner table with a view of the downstairs level which was really nice. The beer here is always good, great selection. I ordered the CB&J sandwich which was made on a sourdough bread, then spread with housemade cashew butter, fig jam and morbier cheese. All those flavors together on a sandwich and grilled was incredible! Such a great flavor.  Also came with a side of Hopleafs famous Stilton mac and cheese.  Will definitely be coming back here for dinner again soon.
