Me and a couple of my girlfriends went to Chicago last weekend. We heard about Brazzaz and decided to go. The service was lacking a little, we had to ask several times for water and we looked for our server a few times to ask some questions. We were at the bar before we sat down and I'll never forget his name Fritz was the best. The drinks were delicious and he was so knowledgable about the wines, and the place in general. What we thought was lacking in service he made up for in the beginning and at the end. What a bartender!!  If you go, make sure you stop at the bar.
