If you are looking for a great price, yummy vietnemese food where you could either take your date or a group of friends this is a great place. It is small and cozy but not in your face. I saw people here dressed up and then those (like me) wearing a t-shirt - just looking for a new place to eat some good food. I was really in the mood for pho and am not very familiar with the Chicago area. My friend - a local - has only had pho once. So here we are searching for pho closer to the lake view area. I loved it!! There is only one pho on the menu (i think) but its delicious:). The service was amazing. Our waitress, a young girl was adorable. She also told me about areas where to find "simply" pho. The older gentleman at the door was the cutest. Greeted every one.
