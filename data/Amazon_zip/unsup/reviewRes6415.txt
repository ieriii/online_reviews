On a recent trip to Chicago a friend took us here and we had a fantastic meal. I started with a dirty martini that was fixed perfectly (no vermouth for me, thanks) and had plenty of olives so I got my veggies in. The steak was cooked (rare) to perfection and the sides were delicious. Service was top notch. The restaurant is very open so it was a little difficult to hold a quiet dinner conversation but it worked.
