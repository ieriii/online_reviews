I've been to most of the major "touristy" deep dish pizza players here in Chicago, so when my friends invited me to Pequods, I was definitely game. We arrived at 7:00 on Friday night and our party of 5 was seated in under 5 mins. I give MAJOR props for that.  I thought the food was a little underwhelming. We ordered a medium sausage and a large peperoni.  They are famous for their pan (deep dish) pizza and the caramelized, burnt cheese crust. I was expecting it to be better than it sounded, but wasn't really digging the taste-- too much burnt, not enough caramelized. The crust goes on for DAYS too. Where a lot of pizza places fill the deep dish with cheese, Pequods uses a tremendous amount of bread. It did make one slice quite filling, which added to the bang for your buck prices-- as long as you like tons of crust. The sausage was my favorite part. Very satisfying-- just the right amount of sweet, salty and spicy.   Pequods didn't make my Top 5 on the Chicago Pizza list, but it delivers a solid pizza for a good price.
