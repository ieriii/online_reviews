OH EM GEE. I love this bar more than I should. After hearing about this bar from a friend I finally decided to check it out. After roaming up and down the street trying to find this place in -4 degree weather it was worth my 3 frost bitten toes. The bar is FREAKING beautiful. The music is chill, there is a "no talking on cell phones" rule and I loved every second of it .It's like a magical land of booze and candle lite. it .is. fab. Violet hour, I would marry you if I could.
