So when my stellar hot date told me to meet him at a place in Uptown, I started questioning his sketchiness factor. But no sooner than I walked through the doors of this assumed dive with the glitzy exterior, I fell in love. Live jazz music and a beautiful vintage decor...it truly had that old Chicago feel to it. Though we were often hushed from talking because of the performance, things cooled down a bit and we ended up drinking and chatting the night away in a cozy, candle lit booth til 4 am on a Sunday. Brava! I will be back.
