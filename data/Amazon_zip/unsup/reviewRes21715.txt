I adore XOCO's food! The Ahogada: Golden pork carnitas, black beans, tomato broth, spicy arbol chile sauce, pickled onions. (Dine-in Only) Is the best sandwich in Chicago in my perspective. Order it mild with chili on the side to increase the spiciness (if you dare). For desert get three churros and a Mexican hot chocolate for dunking! The service leaves something to be desired but they do a good job for how busy they are. The 30 minute wait for a table and no reservations is the main downside.
