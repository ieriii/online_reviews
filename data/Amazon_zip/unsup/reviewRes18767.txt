Amazing. Had to come here twice in four days. Here's the quick rundown: - Ahogada torta: mindblowing (and it comes spicy!) - Chips and guacamole: so THIS is guacamole. - Carnitas caldo: delicious, salty, and even spicier! - Cucumber agua fresca: surprisingly spot-hitting. - Churros with dipping chocolate: good, very good. - Champurrado hot chocolate: sheez, overkill! Definitely coming back.
