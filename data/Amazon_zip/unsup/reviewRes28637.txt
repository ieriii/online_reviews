Ok... so everyone I know goes apeshit over the Pasta Bowl. So when Sarah B suggested we meet here while waiting for The Other Side (the adjoining bar) to open, I was game. After living around the corner for 7+ years, this was the first time I had set foot in here... and sadly, probably the last. While I waited for Sarah I ordered a beer from a disinterested server. I was going to cut him some slack as it was the tail end of the lunch rush, but... there was hardly anyone in there. In addition to a beer, I also ordered a cheese garlic bread appetizer to tide my growling stomach over. The cheese garlic bread with marinara was perhaps the least flavorful thing ever. The sauce was very runny and the entire thing was the very definition of "meh." But what put the final nail in the coffin wasn't the service or the meh food... it was me witnessing not one, but two sanitation issues. If you're going to have an open kitchen, maybe teach your staff basic sanitation. While I appreciate you handling my food with gloves, the gloves are a moot point if I see you stick your finger in sauce, lick it off, then touch food. Gross! Then while we were next door at the adjoining bar, The Other Side, one of the Pasta Bowl busboys was standing in the doorway that connects the two picking at a scab on his arm. Out in the open. In front of customers. Did your stomach just turn? Mine did. Again.
