I had to update my review because I recently dined at Bin 36 for lunch and as it was a workday, opted to forgo my usual wine and cheese and simply order an entree instead. I had the lobster club and it made one thing clear to me - there's no point moving beyond the wine and cheese on the menu. The pieces of lobster in my club were TINY, and almost unrecognizable. Seriously, it looked like tuna salad and didn't taste much better. The tarragon in it was tasty but overwhelmed all the other ingredients. Yes, at its price point ($17) I wasn't expecting a ton of lobster, but I would have appreciated bigger pieces, much like in a standard lobster roll. I'd also gladly have paid more for this, because as it was it seemed like a waste. The bacon was also not crispy at all and nothing special. The one redeeming thing on the plate was the fries. They were matchstick and probably double fried as they were exceptionally crispy. My only wish was for an aioli or some kind of dipping sauce to accompany them. So you might be wondering, with all these complaints, why did I keep the 4 stars? Well, I do think they do wine and cheese exceptionally well, and as those are my two favorite things in the world, this alone is worth 4 stars to me. They have a well curated selection of both that will make cheese and wine lovers swoon. But the regular menu, in my opinion, seems to be lacking. It's possible that dinner fares better than lunch but seriously, if you can't elevate a sandwich and make something great out of ingredients like lobster which are pretty perfect and indulgent on their own, it has me seriously questioning their culinary chops. I think the bottom line is that to truly get the most out of this restaurant, go for the wine and cheese. That's what they are known for. If you're looking for a more standard entree and not planning to drink, you can fare much better elsewhere.
