I'd probably give this place 4 stars if the order had been done correctly. I'm sure it was just happenstance, but when you order sushi takeout, I don't check to make sure they put the soy sauce in. Soy sauce is a pretty integral part of sushi. Once I figured out the mistake, I had to go back. They really didn't pay much attention to me, just gave me the soy sauce and I was on the way. I don't know what more I really wanted; I was just grumpy making a 2nd trip. Ok, part of the blame should go on me, because for some reason, I was out of soy sauce at home.  The food was good. I like the edamame a little saltier, but the specialty rolls were good. Seemed like reasonable prices. I'd order from there again. I hate checking my order in front of the staff, but maybe I should make a habit of it.
