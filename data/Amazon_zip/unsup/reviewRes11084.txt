We came here because my friend who lives in the neighborhood knows of my passion for French Toast. I don't know if I have ever had anything quite as outrageously amazing as the Chocolate French Toast. I felt guilty eating it, as if I wasn't supposed to have something that rich. What would my parents say if they knew I ate that for breakfast? My husband had the eggs Benedict which he also found to be amazing. I find that a wait for a brunch restaurant is pretty standard, few take reservations, so I didn't mind the wait. I had be warned that it may be lengthy but it was a good 15 minutes which was fine by me. We were a little squashed in at the table by the window, it was a table for 2 that they made into 3, but but we're close friends so it didn't matter to us. Our server was good and we left very full and very happy.
