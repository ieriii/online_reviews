Living in the South Loop it's easy to get stuck in a rut going to the same place for breakfast over and over - Thank Heavens for YOLK! The ambiance is fresh, inviting and lively. Feeling like you're inside of a Swedish flag with the blue and yellow vibrant colors it's just a happy space to be in. Excellent menu choices and the BEST hollandaise sauce I've ever had in Chicago! Just the right touch of lemon in it - YUMMY!Great service, and excellent pancakes.Love it.
