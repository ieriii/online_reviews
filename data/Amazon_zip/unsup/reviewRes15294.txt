My first time at the Violet Hour. My friends in Chicago LOVE the place. It was a Saturday night so expected a line, but it wasnt bad at all. BUT, does it HAVE to be so damn dark?? I know theyre setting an ambience but when you cant read either the menu or the check, they could drop the cool level a little and have maybe a bigger candle on the table? Secondly, the music was way too loud. I dont mind some funky tunes but when I cant hear someone across the table its crazy. The drinks however were AWESOME. I had the Half Way Cross Town - fabulous. Im not writing this place off, theyll get a mulligan and Ill visit the next time Im in the Windy City. ( both my friends were also less than impressed, so it wasnt just me )
