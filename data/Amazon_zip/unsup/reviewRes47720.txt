I was impressed with Zed451. Our waiter was great and the chefs serving the food were all friendly and chatty. The harvest table was great - lots of varieties and some great flavours. Meat was wonderful - plenty of variety.  I'm deducting a star because we couldn't go to the rooftop bar afterwards, unless we'd have gone outside and queued. We were at the top of the stairs when a guy appeared and told us to go outside and queue - he wasn't very polite and just barked that the bar was separate to the restaurant. This should be explained on their website and when you arrive as it spoilt an otherwise perfect evening.  Definitely worth going for the food.
