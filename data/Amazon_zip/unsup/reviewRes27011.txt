Was in town for a conference, and stopped by here in a whim for dinner. The wait was over 2 hours for a table, but luckily, the server told me that they have open seating by the kitchen counter. Within 5 minutes, I was seated and ready to eat. Had seen Rick Bayless on top chef master, and was always skeptical about really how good his mexican cooking was. after all, he still is a white guy cooking Mexican food.  I started off with the frontera ceviche, which comes on top of tortilla chips. I thought the ceviche was perfectly seasoned versus a lot of places where they put way too much citrus. The meal was off to a good start. Wanted to taste as much as I can, so I settled for the mole trio. I think I remember mole sauce was one of his specialties.  The first of the three was the pork in clemole - the pork was extremely tender. The dish kind of reminded me of a less soupy chili. I love chili, so no complaints there. The second trio was the mole poblano enchiladas - thought it was good. I honestly haven't had a lot of experience with mole sauce, so I thought it was good, with the right amount of sweetness. I think this is like the most common type of mole sauce. The third trio - local vegetables in green mole sauce was by far my favorite. I think the vegetables were potatoes and squash when I had went (not sure if it varies).  Ended the meal with the chocolate pecan pie. Wasn't too sweet, and was a really good way to end my meal.
