Violet Hour is in the old Del Toro space. Even knowing that I passed by it twice. There's no address written on the outside and you really would think it's an abandoned space. Once you walk in you'll see the deep blue curtains...and then another set of curtains, then finally a host! The space is beautiful - very modern and romantic. If you're looking for privacy this is the perfect spot. You can actually carry on a conversation here. That being said this is not a place you can go and meet new people because the layout is such that you sit with your group and you can't really see anyone else. I loved my Juliet & Romeo gin cocktail -- a perfect mix of sweetness with a little bit of a bite. Foodwise I enjoyed the now famous pb, banana & bacon sandwich deep-fried, the breaded pick bites, waffle fries with creamy dipping sauce. Deviled eggs were good but I'd probably take a pass next time. Curried rice krispie squares were good too but I had trouble tasting the curry (probably because of the strong drink!) Come early and avoid standing in line waiting for a table.
