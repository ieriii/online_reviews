So I have visited Nana twice. Once for dine-in and once for take-out. While the food is delicious and something that has absolutely no competition in the neighborhood, the service is severely lacking. I have been in the food and bar industry for most of my adult life, and there is nothing special about the way they treat their guests. I have to now wonder, if their pretentious menu and organic offerings are worth the attitude from the server and then a forgotten take-out order. Nana, you can not just get by on your looks, the insides count too. Please take the time to not only fill your guests bellies with delicious food, but also satisfy your guests as individuals by offering superb service to each and every guest. This definitely left a bad taste in my mouth, and remember a bad experience travels much faster than a good one.
