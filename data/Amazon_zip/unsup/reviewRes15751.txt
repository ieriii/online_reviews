If this restaurant was half the price, I would have enjoyed myself last night for NYE! I do love the decor and some of the fun events (man on stilts was hilarious) they had planned last night...but the price for the food (the menu online has cheaper prices than the menu in the restaurant-false advertising!) was ridiculous....I ordered one of the specials for the night and my halibut dish was fine but not amazing and for $38 it better be amazing. We got a mouse cake dessert that was $10 (and was quite pretty) but it was about 2 tablespoons of mouse.  The hostess last night was not in the NYE spirit-quite rude about us coming early and dismissive....I've been here 4 times so far and my first experience was the best...things have just gone downhill each time I go. My last time here we took some friends from the UK and they were willing to spend more on meals because they use the GBP...but they didn't think the meals were worth the price then.  In a nutshell: TOO EXPENSIVE FOR WHAT YOU GET! There are better restuarants with less expensive food that I will be going to instead.
