I have to say, Opart is a dual threat...performing equally well with their carryout and dine-in food. I've probably gotten takeout from them 20-times and never had any issue with quality, order accuracy, or speediness... For an eat-in experience, Opart has a sneaky large amount of seating, and they manage to maintain an intimate and comfortable atmosphere despite it's location on Western Ave. The staff has always been helpful explaining dishes and accomodating levels of spiciness (always important with Thai!).  The food has never been a life changing experience (see: 4stars), but everything is quite good. Better yet I haven't run into any duds on the menu. My favorites are the Pad Thai, Panang Curry, and Beef Lard Nar.  Oops, almost forgot the two best parts: 1: BYOB 2: It's great value for dine-in, as the portions seem to be slightly larger Overall, a solid 4-star thai restaurant in an otherwise saturated Thai area. Go for: -Date night -BYOB/Good Value Skip it if: -You're a authentic Thai snob :)
