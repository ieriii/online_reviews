Came here last night with the bf and must say that Davanti certainly lives up to all the positive reviews posted here. The wait for a Sunday night at 6:15 was only 15 minutes. We shared the pork belly pizza, the big ravioli, and the penne with sausage. All delicious. Can't say that you could go wrong with anything on the menu. The quartino is a pretty good deal for wine, giving you a glass and a half for 7-10 bucks. They also had Sophie on tap, which the bf liked. The best part of the evening - FREE DESSERT compliments of the owner. Can't wait to come back and try the Polenta special!
