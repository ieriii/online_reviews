Amazing food! VERY long wait, but we knew this before we went. Tip: DON'T go to the bar and ask for "a glass of Merlot". They gave my husband a $17.00 glass of wine. At the table we found several great choices on the wine list for $10 or so. Other than that, it was a great time. We would go back for sure!
