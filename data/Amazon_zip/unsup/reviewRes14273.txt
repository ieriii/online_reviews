So one Saturday, late morning, the gentleman friend and I decide that our hangovers need some food. He suggests this place because it's really close, so they'll deliver quickly. My hangover cure is a good sandwich and a coke, so I order the veggie sandwich and a coke. OVER 2 PAINFUL HUNGOVER HOURS LATER....our food comes, but the delivery guy forgets the coke. We steal his pen and tell him he'll get the pen and his tip, when he comes back with the soda. He did, so he got his pen and his tip. (point being he clearly didn't have to come back...we took his pen for God's sake...but he did. props to him for that) Now onto the food...absolutely delicious, holy potatoes was that an amazing sandwich. And the restaurant threw in some extra goodies because we had to call 3 -4 times to get the food... So they lost 2 points because I A) had to wait over 2 hours to get fed, and 2 hours is a LONG time, regardless of me being hungover or not. B) Because I was STARVING when the food finally came, I may have eaten anything and thought it was delicious. I drive past there a lot, and the place looks fun - I'm looking forward to giving them another shot.
