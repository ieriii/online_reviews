For a downtown hotel...choose another! I stayed one night and had two rooms in my name. We had rust stains down our wall and hair in our shower! We told the front desk about it and they simply done nothing! Horrible experience and will never return! The rooms were tiny and the second room had no view! The only view was the roof and another building! If you are going to pay this amount of money for a room, go to somewhere else downtown.... This is coming from a Marriott employee!
