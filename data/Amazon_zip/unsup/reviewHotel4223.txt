Our one-year-old son's knees were filthy from crawling on the floor of our 'newly renovated' hotel room. Also, the concierge made a big mistake with one of the services we requested and there was almost always a really, really long line at the concierge desk and it was completely pointless to try to call the concierge from your room, you would just sit on hold for 20+ minutes. (I'm not exaggerating the time spent on hold waiting for the concierge before I finally gave up and this happened on three occasions.) After spending three nights at the Hyatt and three nights at the Palmer House Hotel (which we had to move to because the Hyatt was overbooked), I whole-heartedly recommend the Palmer House and discourage anyone from staying at the dirty Hyatt.
