I can't say enough good things about Longman and Eagle. First of all, the place will be packed pretty much anytime you decide to visit.. so be prepared to wait. The place is so accommodating that they took down our cell phone number and actually called us when we were up on the list so we didn't have to wait in the crowded bar if we didn't want to. While we waited, we helped ourselves to some of the delicious beers and whiskeys on their incredible list! The quality in their alcohol choices was supreme and decently priced.. ESPECIALLY for the city. If I wasn't already getting tipsy after the first few, I would have tried to make my way through the entire whiskey list.. well, like I said, I would have tried. I highly recommend trying a flight if you want a taste of a few delicious whiskeys.  When we were seated we decided to order a bunch of dishes and share them. I think this is the way to go. There is too many good things to neglect and sharing gives the option to try many of them. We decided to go with marinated olives, duck rillettes, pretzel, foie gras, ricotta gnuddi, and the wild boar sloppy joe. EVERYTHING was unbelievable and to die for. I really can't wait to go back and try more. The only thing I would suggest to Longman was a tad bit better service from the waitstaff. Although I was not upset by it, at times we felt ignored or unattended to. As a server, however, I understand they were busy and that sometimes you just can't give the best service possible. 5 stars FO SHO!
