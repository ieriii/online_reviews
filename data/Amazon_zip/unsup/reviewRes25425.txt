Not quite sure what happened? I had high such high expections, however, it is pretty questionable when you're able to get a table on Valentine's Day literally 20 minutes before arriving.  The space is beautiful. I enjoyed the ambiance, but the service was sub-par. Kinda almost felt like I was talking to a used car salesman while choosing different items.  The food was overpriced and not as delicious as I had imagined. Some items we ordered included: patatas bravas (I was expecting more than 6 tots), costillas de ternera, pollo a la planxa (which was overdone and rubbery), and tocino con cidra. However, their complimentary tomato flatbread was delicious, and I should've filled up. After about 25 minutes of waiting for our next set of tapas, we decided to cancel the rest of the items. The wait in between was kinda ridic. Definitely a let down for me, but at least the drinks were delicious.
