This place is my favorite place to eat and drink. I've lost count how many times I've been here, and I still haven't been enough times to write a review worthy of this place. The menu does change but there are old standby's that never leave such as the sloppy joe, the duck egg hash confit, the burger, the pear salad, and usually some variety of pork belly. All highly recommended by the way. So take your time browsing the menu and ask your server plenty of questions both about the very good food and the meticulously prepared cocktails. The only real tip I'll leave, is that starting with the Gruyere donuts is a highly recommended. I know, I know... that's a dessert dude! So what! Start off with that as you navigate your way through the menu and a wonderful dining and drinking experience. Ah, and during the more pleasant months, there is an open air but limited selection bar on Schubert on the side but close to the back of the restaurant. A great place to catch up with friends and have a drink especially if the bar inside is packed tighter than sardines in a can.
