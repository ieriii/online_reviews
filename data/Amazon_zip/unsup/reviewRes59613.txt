Now this is how I imagine kalbi is supposed to be. The meat was lean and had an amazing flavor, helped along by a smokiness from the grill. Our server was attentive and refilled the little dishes a couple of times since we couldn't get enough of them. The potato thing was fantastic and went well with the kalbi. Excellent food, good service, and good price, that's what I like.
