A small group of us went there after we bagged the 3 hour wait at Kuma's Corner. It was a good move because both the beer and food were delicious. I was expecting a bit more from the bacon popcorn, which was sort of ordinary but the pretzel with the cheese ale dipping sauce was yummy. I had the Hombre burger piled high with avocado, smoked poblano, cheese, red pepper sauce and tortilla strips. The burger was cooked perfectly, slightly smokey from the poblanos and crunchy from the tortilla strips. Yum! In addition, good fresh cut fries that were not too thick or soggy, sinful mashed potatoes and interesting blue cheese potato salad. Everyone in our group was pleased and we would absolutely return!
