I had my birthday party here in February and it was wonderful! The service is always stellar and the food is spot on. No corkage fee is definitely a highlight...and no cake cutting fee! Fabulous!I also went there for another birthday party this past weekend. We had a group of 20 - the servers and owner was hardcore attentive and everything was great. They sure do know how to work a room and flip tables boy. Wow! Well, the avocado cream cheese won-tons are AMAZING! They make both meat eaters and veggies not even miss crab! Yum!I love this place. Consistent and nice service. I highly recommend for large groups - it gets very loud in there. Great Lincoln Park find!
