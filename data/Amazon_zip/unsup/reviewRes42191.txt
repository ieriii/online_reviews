Yeah, I waited for a long time to finally pay my visit there, love it, solid, great atmosphere, I like how they mix the lounge area with the dining areas. We were lucky to get seated at the sofa right in the middle of the restaurant, it's a great place to ppl watch.  On to the food, probably the best bone marrow in Chicago, I had tried many places but Gilt is probably the only place that does not over bake it, they should probably serve a little sea salt and some side pickles, it would have been perfect. Did not try any cocktail but the beer selection is strong.  It's my first time visiting Gilt and would like to go back the second time before updating my review.
