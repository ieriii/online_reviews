My sorority hosted our convention in beautiful summery Chicago and booked all of us here. 200+ women all in one hotel ...yep, a lotta ladies and googly-eyed men. I arrived in the late afternoon to hundreds of sisters as well as another company's convention and regular guests. I thought, "oh man, this is gonna suck." I was surprised because check-in was fast and sweet. We got warm cookies with our room keys (yum!) My room on the 25th floor had an amazing view. Our rooms were so clean and well decorated. The bed was very comfortable and made those 15 hours of meetings and walking in heels wash away. We had plenty of towels, which were also replaced everyday and we always came back to a tidy room. I really liked the staff here. Every single person I spoke to was very, very friendly and helpful and never appeared annoyed with us. The gym exceeded my expectations with their up-to-date equipment and clean workout area. The gym is essential to me because grease and fat in those Chicago style pizzas aren't gonna run themselves off my thighs. There's also a nice outdoor pool on the 5th floor. This is a great venue to host events because the rooms we met in were huge and the staff was very accommodating with everything we needed from setup to food. Great location, cheery staff, and clean rooms. All I really ask for. Note: No fridge/microwave and AC doesn't go below 78 degrees. Trade off: there's a bar in the lobby :)
