I recently ate here for brunch and was not really impressed. I got "scrambled" eggs that came in omelet-form (weird), fake bacon that was mediocre, and some very thinly sliced fruit. I eat meat, but can really enjoy veggie food when it's done well. Overall the flavor was not really there for me. Probably could have made something a lot better on my own. I DID, however, get a bloody mary that was spicy and delicious. Just enough alcohol to make going to work afterward pleasant.
