I dont really like stuffed pizza, but having said that, I also dont really like giordano's. Theres a lot of food involved, but all that cheese overwhelms the other things and the crust is terrible. Its too soft and absolutely dull. It took forever to get my giant hunk of cheese and I was so hungry I probably would have even worse things to say about it under other circumstances. The service was terrible. When I started writing this review I put three stars, but as I remembered my experience here I took a star off. Plus one star because for gods sake, its pizza.
