I am never dissapointed when I stop in this cozy place for some Korean BBQ. Whenever you have a big crowd of hungry people, we go to this restaurant. We order up everything on the menu starting off with some OB and the seafood pancakes, then some Kalbi and Bulgolgi and finally finishing off with some chilled buckwheat noodles. I can't imagine more comforting food and here' s the place to get the best Korean food. You have to check it out once, and you'll be hooked.
