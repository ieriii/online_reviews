I spent 4 nights at the Amalfi Hotel while in Chicago for training. The rooms are very nice and clean. There is a continental breakfast on every floor with good coffee. They offer free use of the business center for those of us behind the times without a Blackberry or laptop. There were also free cocktails from 5:30 to 7:00 pm every day. The rooms were clean and comfy. The fitness center was on the same floor as my room but there was nothing to wipe down the machines with after use so I suggest bringing your own wipes. All in all, after 4 long days, it was a comfortable place to stay.
