I can only give it 4 stars because there were 2 dishes (of the 26 they gave us) that I didn't eat because I didn't like them. "Didn't like" may be an understatement. I may have had my strongest reaction ever to a dish- at Alinea. Our 4th dish (after the first trio) was the salad course, and it was tomatoes in different forms, which was okay. But then there was the basil gelee (disgusting) and mozzarella foam puff (even more disgusting). I actually HATED it. And I've never had such a strong reaction to something before. I understand that Alinea is a different concept, but the food should still all be palatable. I did really like the chicken liver bite, and some of the deserts, but overall I wasn't super impressed like I thought I would be. I will say that the service was AMAZING and they all did a great job. A little irreverent at times, which is right up my alley. I don't know if I'll ever go back, but it was an interesting experience.
