I'm a lacto-ovo vegetarian right now, but it's my goal in life to eventually be a vegan. And it's places like this that seem to fuck up that goal.....one delicious decadent slice at a time. Oy, I don't even want to think about how many calories are in those slices! Oh well, everyone has their vices and mine seems to be gluttony (and cheese). The big deep dish pizza chains in Chicago are Uno's, Lou Malnati's, Giordano's and Gino's East. The pizza here is great to offer up an understatement. We ordered two deep dish pizzas: a spinach pizza for my veggie friend and me and a meat lover's type pizza for our two friends from Wisconsin (figures! j/k). I know, pretty much two ends of the spectrum. Pizza just tastes better when you dine in compared to getting carryout/delivery. The cheese is gooey-er, the crust flakier and buttery... This location is in the middle of tourist-y Near North Side, so prepare for a long wait if you come during dinner or lunch time. Here's a tip, come a little earlier (11am for lunch or 5p-6p for dinner) and you will see significantly shorter waiting times. In fact, we came at 5:30 and we were seated immediately! Believe me, don't go to this location and wait an hour to be seated and then wait another hour for your pizza!
