Returned for another visit to my favorite pig yesterday. I can't say enough good things about this place. Our server had fabulous recommendations (side note - I forgot her name. I have a bad habit of asking people's names without any intention of paying attention to what they say. Alas, this is what happened here) and guided us through a flawless meal.  The pork fried almonds were delicious, the taramousalata spread was much better than I was expecting - in fact it was downright amazing (I'm not a huge fan of it at most Greek restaurants but our server's glowing recommendation won me over), the octopus was smokey and tender, and the chicken thigh kabob - let me just say, I love it when a chicken dish blows me away because so often, there's something wrong with it. The chicken was juicy and moist, the skin was perfectly crispy and the tzatzki sauce was a perfect match to complement the chicken.  I went for Sicilian Iris part deux and this time got one that was chock full of chocolate. It was everything I was expecting and wanting it to be the first time around. If this place didn't have a crazy wait 24/7, I'd be here daily. It's well worth that wait though.
