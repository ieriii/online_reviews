Never been here, just ordered delivery. But I hear it's not the best place to eat in.  The best stuffed pizza in town. Actually, make that best pizza I've ever had. I get this at least once a week, usually more. Simply amazing. The garlic cheese bread is ok, a little dry. The bbq chicken wings are really good, but not the artificial chicken parts that I'm used to. They're actually wings (very skinny, mind you) from real chickens. Different, but still good. The pizza is also great the next day. Delivery usually takes about an hour, so keep that in mind. Still, if I never tried pizza from anywhere else, I'd be totally fine. Really, it's that good.
