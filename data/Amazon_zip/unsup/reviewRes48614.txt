We had a group of 13 people and our waitress while nice had too many other tables to service us timely. It was no less than 1/2 hour for me to get my first beer. She took some drink orders than went to other tables. The same thing happened for the food orders. We had to flag her down and ask if she could take the rest of our food order. I don't think she realized that she had missed some of our orders. The food was unique, full of flavor but a little pricey. The beer list has a handful of great beers at a reasonable $5. pint. But pay attention to the lengthy list or you could end up ordering a $33. bottle.
