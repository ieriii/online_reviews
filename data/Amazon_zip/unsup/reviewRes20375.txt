My only complaint of this place is the wait, the small space, and i didnt get to see rick bayless! We waited about 30 minutes and it was worth the wait. I love how everything's out in the open and we can see how the food is prepared. You can even see the veggies being cut and the churros being freshly made. The sandwiches were really good esp with the green salsa they provide. Tons of flavor and perfect for lunch. We also got the hot chocolate with the almond milk which was too rich for my taste. next time i'll probably try the authentic or classic. Maybe I'm used to non authentic churros but the churro here is more corny than others i've had. still good and goes great with the hot cocoa. FYI..this place is NOT good for big groups but perfect for a group of 2. I definitely recommend that if you do go with others to get different sandwiches and split it. I think i would have been sick of my sandwich if i had to eat all of it. Instead a friend and I ordered 2 different ones and split them. It was perfect!
