3.5! Ambiance: Nothing special and definitely casual. It's kind of funny that they have a bar next door and it's called "The Other side". It's good for 2 people, otherwise you'll have to wait a little while. The Good: The food was surprisingly good and fast service. Not to mention CHEAP! We ordered the garlic cheese bread and bruschetta and it came within minutes. You'll have to try the Farfalle Pollo - but with Alfredo to be extra creamy. It was tasty! Service was ok, but i think we just had a bad waitress because she didn't really know the menu. Their Lobster Ravioli was ok but for $12.95 +.075 cents for extra cheese, it wasn't bad at all. The Bad: They make their money off the usual "free" stuff such as a little side of fresh grated Parmesan cheese ($0.75) and Alfredo sauce ($2.00).  Expect to wait a long time if you have a group of people with you. Parking is horrible in the area so we actually ended up paying $11 to park in a lot. The Bottom line: If you want a cheap, fast service and casual Italian food, this is the place for you. Because the price is cheap, you can't expect a 4-star dining experience. Our bill was $35 for 2 appetizers and 2 entrees - not bad!
