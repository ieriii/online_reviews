We had to wait forever for a table even with a reservation but the food turned out to be delish! We went super carb heavy - got the bone marrow and the super fatty creamy cheese on toast. The truffle pasta was amazing. I pretty much had to be wheeled home afterwards. Ambiance was good - I recommend the tables at the back.
