There are a couple of things I know-great burgers and great beer. Lockdown has a good selection of both. I live right down the street and remember waiting for them to open to try these crazy burgers. I do admit, and despite the great service, I wasn't blown away (and neither was my foodie gf) the first night. However, I decided to give it another try. Lockdown is now a regular stop for my Monday Night Drinking Crew. I even convinced my gf to come back which is no easy feat. Plus, the service is great! If you're looking for a non-pretentious place with great service, great food, a great beer selection, and where you don't have to wait at least an hour for a seat, Lockdown is your place.
