Will never go back! My friend worked relentlessly with Jean to set up a private party to the point where we had already decided on the menu. She reserved the room in the lower level for a private party that would end up being a bit over $150.00/pp from 6pm to 8pm.  All of this had been set up a couple of weeks ago. Today my friend got a phone call saying that her reservation and room were no longer available because a bigger party wanted the entire night and Jean (whomever) decided to give them the space. She said that the other party had come in and signed the contract after my friend had already gotten a confirmation from her via email (ie. in writing). Jean had never mentioned any type of contract to her ever and the fact that they were going to make more money on the other party they decided that it was that easy to just cancel our party. We were going to have about 15 people for 2 hours that is not a small amount of money. Afterwards she proceeded to be so "kind" and said she would set up a table for us on the main floor. I think that is ridiculous. For a restaurant that is supposed to be high end, customer service should be number one. I'm glad to see it is just another restaurant that cares more about the bottom line then standing by business ethics. I will do whatever in my power to make sure people know that this is how they run things. It may not matter now because they are "hot" for the time being but I can not wait to see what happens if they keep this up.  I think the place is good, had no issues with it before other than the pretentiouss vibe as this would have been the 4th time going there but after this I would not go back. Its too bad but I like Girl and the Goat better anyways.
