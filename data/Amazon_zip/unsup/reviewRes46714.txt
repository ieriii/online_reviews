Since going to this small restaurant in 1976, it has always been great. Great salad bar that has been so all these years. When most restaurants are always trying to reinvent itself, Rich Melman knows not to mess with a great thing.  Yes it is a small place and it can get crowded at times, but you have to know that, especially on a Sunday at noon for brunch. Valet Parking is great. These must be the children of the orignal waitstaff......because the staff is still great and very into their servicing the guest
