Lovin' Glen's! Did you hear me.... "LOVIN GLEN's!!!" The bestest place ever for breakfast. New orleans scramble, Egg sandwich, Shrimp & Cheese Grits... you name it! The best for breakfast or dinner. I've had the mimosa in the morning! It's the business!!!! After it I had to head back home for a nap. Went for the crab one Tuesday and all I can say is, "call ahead" but it's so worth it if you get in! They keep em coming and everyone is a great size crab leg! Staff is wonderful. Not a large sized place but they make it work. Check it out ya'll!
