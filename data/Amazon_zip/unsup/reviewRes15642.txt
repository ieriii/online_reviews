We went there for a friend's bday. Service could have been A LOT better. He messed up on our checks 3 times. adding alcohol when a tab for alcohol was already made, and i feel like he knew he was going to get at least 18%, so he did the bare minimum. We tried the guac and arepas. The arepas was interesting, and 15 for guac? never again...i make better guac, for sure. The chips that came with the guac were super salty, maybe to make up for the blandness of the guac? main course i had ribeye. it was cooked how i wanted it, and the smoked brisket mofongo was sooooooo interesting... i couldn't place my feelings if i liked it or i didn't for awhile ahahahha, i decided i liked it in the end. Oh. My. God. There is this mango alcohol drink that WAS SOOOOOO DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!!!! i think that almost bumped my rating to a 5... it was.... seriously the tastiest drink EVER!!!! i would def. come to carnivale just to drink that drink again!!!!!!!!!!!
