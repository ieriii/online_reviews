Everyone covers this pretty well. I coat-tailed with a friend when I was just in town for a job interview (I moved to Chicago later.) Had no expectation, didn't read anything. Friends brought copious amounts of booze, wine and beer for every course, and we got sloshed. We had a great time, and the experience was sort of hilarious, but this is food as an art event, not as sustenance. I have only rarely experienced such indigestion, and others in our party felt the same or worse later, and it wasn't just the booze. The chefs lavished us with experimental extra courses, so we ended up with over a dozen different dishes served to us, and few of those potentially hundreds of materials were meant to be conjoined in the human digestive system (or my mouth - many if-fy moments). And chefs in some cases badly needed baths - I mean, the smell overpowered the food at times. As did the blaring Norwegian black metal or gangsta rap. As I say, I had a great time, but I'm not over eager to return. I would recommend it to any adventurous eater, however. A good time, but this is not food to please you. It's about experimentation and challenge. I respect it, but don't feel very warm or fuzzy about it, nor would they want you to I imagine.
