I liked it. Some things were off. The music was sooo loud and it was 90's hits. Little off from the modern ambiance they were going for. The waiter was ok, but didn't speak much about the menu.  Howard and I are on this new thing now where we get one appetizer and one entree. I know, sucks to be our waiter, but I'm trying to lose weight and we're always way too full after one app and two entrees. Plus I feel like we don't enjoy the food after awhile b/c we're just trying to finish it. All started with David Burke. Anyways, we got the scallops for the appetizer. Very flavorful and loved all the veggies that came with it.  The entree, we got the pork dish. Also very flavorful. I really like the sweetness of it, but I can see alot of people not liking it because of that. The great thing about both is that the chef did a great job in the combinations with everything. Each bite was amazing with the sauces or the accompaniments. Popcorn was yummy and no bread thru-out the whole meal. Love that.
