I love this place.  Okay, so there are a couple of flaws. For example, the no talking during performances thing. Umm, are we in school? And then they don't really enforce the rule. No, I wasn't shh'd but the people in front of me were talking incessantly. It wasn't their talking that was annoying. It was the fact that they were standing in front of me and every time they leaned in to talk, they blocked my view. The drinks were small and pricey but stiff! I loved the decor. I saw Dee Alexander and she was amazing. I definitely will be back!
