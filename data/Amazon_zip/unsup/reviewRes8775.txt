the best thing about this pizza is the fresh mozzarella... so deliciously good! i ate the leftovers for breakfast the next morning because i could not hold out for lunch! i probably could have ate the whole thing in one sitting, but i didnt want to out eat my date ... in retrospect, i should have eaten the whole damn thing and then ordered another one for breakfast
