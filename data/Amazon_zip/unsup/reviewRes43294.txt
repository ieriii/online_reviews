I've been to Milk & Honey about 8 times and in those 8 times I have learned these things: 1.) Stick with the BLT for lunch. I've tried about 4 other lunch items (about half, or more than half the menu), and everything else is not good.) The BLT is great though. And I like the homemade chips. 2.) The coffee's good 3.) It's really crowded 4.) Despite being really crowded, the service is fast and somehow there's always a seat, however you will be touching elbows with the table next to you. 5.) It's self-serve as far as silverware, napkins, ketchup and other fixin's, and coffee refills (free!) I like this, a lot. Now if only I can defeat the evil force that somehow always makes it so that I get there at 12:05pm (5 minutes after they stop serving breakfast).
