I love this place, Love the cuban at this spot. No matter where I am in this country I never order pork cubans, always steak. Which isn't traditional. They made that very clear when I ordered it b/c its not on the menu. Anyway the cuban here is nothing short of perfection. They really dont have a problem accomodating your special requests either. Now I've never been to Cuba. But I spend alot of time in Florida and NEVER have I come across cuban cuisine at this scale before. Whoda thunk it lol. The best Cuban restaurant in America is in the MIDWEST!!! The empanadas............. Try them beef or chorizo. OMG! I would just love to kiss whoever the genius is creating these mind numbingly delicious little pieces of heaven. This spot is so worth the trek from the southside. I was there Saturday and the new Armitage location is opening today! YAAYYY!!!!!
