Yes, this is a "joint" in every way possible. Yes, there is a bizarre military theme, but that's only fitting b/c they attack you with food. But these are some of the reasons why it's so good.  I've sampled from all parts of the Tank menu, and it's all pretty good, but I think I'm going to revert back to the pho which is what they do best. Why wouldn't I? First, the giant menu makes me nervous that I'm missing something (best to stay focused). Second: the pho is great. They mix up a powerful broth and dispense it from a giant coffee machine (how cool is that?). Plus, there are infinite possibilities of what goes into your pho: you like beef? Try the pho with the 6 or so different cuts. Don't like the bible tripe? Get it with the 5 cuts. Like cow penis?...er...you can get that here, too (if yer into that type of thing). The one with chicken, vegetables, dumplings, crab, a quail's egg and about 10 other ingredients is great, too. It's like a million tastes in one dish. Top your giant bowl with the greens and you're smiling for only a few bucks.
