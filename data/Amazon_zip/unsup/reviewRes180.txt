Went here with a fellow chef for dinner on a cold sunday night in November. When we walked in we were told the table wasn't ready for us yet, the GM then offered us a glass of champagne on the house. When we got to our table the server was wonderful and we looked over the wine menu, the sommlier came over and presented us with a bottle of there finest champagne on the house.  When we dined there sure there were a few dishes that were not the best, but hey two dishes out of 20 that were not up to standard were fine by me.  After the meal took a tour of the kitchen and noticed some people I knew.
