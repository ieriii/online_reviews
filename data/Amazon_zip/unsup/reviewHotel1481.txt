I didn't actually stay here but I dog sat for the last few days for an adorable little pup while her mom and sister took in the sights of our beautiful city. This was a great hotel complete with extra friendly staff, super clean rooms and when a hotel is dog friendly how can they not be good? The lobby smells terrific too, it could be the yummy candles burning when you first walk in that automatically put you in a soothing state. My clients told me that they would be back because they had such a great time so I gave the The Omni a star from them too.
