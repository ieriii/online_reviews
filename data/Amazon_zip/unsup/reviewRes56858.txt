This is a brewpub with a few outstanding beers and quite a few very good ones. The pizza is also quite good. We came for lunch, split a Caesar salad and got individual sized pizzas. It's always nice to see anchovies on a Caesar (at least I think it is, your mileage may vary). The pizza was a nice thin crisp pizza with a selection of sauce types and some interesting options for toppings. I've never seen clams as a pizza topping option before, but I wish it were available in more places. The beer was also top notch. The hefeweizen was especially delicious. Definitely worth checking out.
