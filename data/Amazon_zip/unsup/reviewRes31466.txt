WAY overpriced, mediocre service, decent quality food/drinks, but extremely poor value for the money. Also, my waiter made a mistake and charged our after dinner drinks to another table. After I had already paid and signed the bill, he came back sheepishly to request "re-running" my card for his error. Totally bad form, and made up my mind that I won't be going back. There are too many other excellent steak houses in Chicago.
