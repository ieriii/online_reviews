This place seems to get RAVE reviews from Chicago Food Critics and such. Frankly, I don't see the big deal, it's not bad at all or anything, but I think Reza's in Andersonville on North Clark is better, with a much bigger menu and much nicer atmosphere, don't get me wrong, this place has good food, if you're around there and want some nice dining, certainly stop in, but it's not worth a special trip there, go to Reza's instead....BUT, if you want BETTER and CHEAPER food, go to nearby City Noor Kabab (please see my review) just up the street......
