My second time there, both with large groups. The prix fixe were very good, especially the calamari and the gnocchi. BYOB and a friendly atmosphere. This is definitely a good place for groups and family. I wouldn't want to bring date here though, the tables are so close, you wouldnt be able to have any privacy!
