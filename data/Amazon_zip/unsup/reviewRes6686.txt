so now that i've been here a few times i'm going to go with a three. i'd go back, only for brunch. upscale, overpriced barbecue is not my style, though the ambiance and decor of this place is quite a delight. being a texan snob about bbq, this just didn't cut it for me. barbecue is not about bread, and q is ALL about bread. order anything and get a brick of cornbread. the sandwiches have more bread than meat. the sauces are fine and the meat is cooked well, but this was quite a peeve for me. if i had it my way, i'd just drink on their patio. if food was free.
