So. much. food. It's almost epic. The "baby" buddha bowls could easily feed me for 2 meals (granted, I'm a tiny person). I got one of the chicken sandwiches, because I couldn't commit to eating an entire half a chicken. It was a perfect amount of food, just enough to stuff you a little. I had it with the Seoul BBQ sauce, which was more sweet than spicy to me, but still a really good tasting sauce. Fries were pretty good - and there's a variety of sauces for you to try! We got the kimchi, which was pretty tasty, and the fried mushrooms for appetizers. Fried mushrooms were pretty delish. I will definitely be returning here when I want a huge meal for around $10.
