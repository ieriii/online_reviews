My girlfriend moved into the neighborhood recently and this is one of the places we've visited since, and we have gone a few times. the food is great. I would have to agree that the "diner" is just that, in the name. You can walk in with flip flops and shorts and feel at home but get the quality you expect from some place more stuffy. a new favorite and will visit more often since its only two blocks away
