The place is pretty cute for a bar, there is an outside patio, its a little loud inside especially on the main floor, we sat on the 2nd floor, it was loud too but not too bad. I didn't go in the lower level so cannot comment about that. Got this goat cheese appetizer, delicious! it was 4 pita wedges with round kinda seared/breaded goat cheese balls and it came with a salad with a honey mustard balsamic vinegarrete. I got the ceasar salad, it was good but i mean you can't really go wrong with a ceasar salad... I did get the berry shandy, it was really good and so was the 50/50 cosmo my bf got the bbq fried chicken and one rib, it was a lot of chicken! He said both were really good but it was really filling, he said he would have to share next time... The waiter was quite attentive, although my bf tends to think that he was bec he liked me since he gave him a thumbs up when we sat down... I did ask him what was better and he did say he was in training but he did try both the items I was debating on... its nice to know that the waitstaff/employees are trying all the menu items so they know how to answer your question about it... If I am in the neighborhood I would definitely go back and maybe try the veggie sandwich or a burger or the grilled cheese!
