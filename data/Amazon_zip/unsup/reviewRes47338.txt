They have great food, amazing staff, and a really original menu. Each day/night features a different era of rock music and has a tastefully simple decor that is perfect for their jailhouse theme. Every person that passed our table checked to see if we needed anything and they had some great rock videos/concerts playing on the flat-screens with a few screens tuned to sports. My husband and I had a wonderful time there today!
