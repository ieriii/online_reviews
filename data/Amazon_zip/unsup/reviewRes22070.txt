This is where I first tried the pickled green tomato. Not sure why I haven't had it before! It's yummmy.. then again, I love pickled veggies. Comes with all the orders. I've tried the superfish(basically a fried fish sammich w/fries and toasted buns) and the supershrimp(fried shrimp, dipping sauce, fries, and toasted buns). The quality of their food is surprisingly good. Open late. Their new location in Wheeling is huuuuuuge.
