Everyone we knows raves about this places which is why my husband and I made a resevation there, two months in advance, for my 30th birthday. We got there and it was a beautiful evening so we sat outside. From that point, it was all downhill. It took over 20 min for a server to come by and get a drink order. Once we ordered, the food took about 45 min and during that time the server never once stopped by to ask if we'd like another glass of wine. In face we wanted to order a bottle of wine but we hardly saw our server that by that point we didn't want to order a whole bottle and drink it on an empty stomach. I even had to stop our waiter as he was walking by to bring us our check and even then it took about 20 min for him to return a copy to us but only because I had to stop him again as he was walking by. I was very sad about the whole experience so I told our waiter very politely, once he asked how was everything, that I absolutely hated the service and it was my birthday and I would've appreciated if he at least stopped by at some point to get me a glass of wine. As we were walking out, the nice manager lady stopped us and appoligied for bad experience. They gave us a gift certificate but we'll give to a friend who likes the place because I have no intention to ever go back.
