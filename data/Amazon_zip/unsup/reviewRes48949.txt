I liked this place - awesome beer list, great food - all from small purveyors, much of it sustainable. The mussels beurre blanc were excellent, as were the fresh oysters. We also tried a number of meat and fish dishes - which were all good. Didn't get to the charcuterie - next time. Had the waffle for dessert - simple with compote and honey butter. The ambience was also great - full house. Will be back undoubtedly.
