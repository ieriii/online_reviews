My future in laws and my fiance went here for his birthday in August. It was my suggestion and I had a feeling we would all like it. Our waiter was very friendly and knew a lot about the menu items. We ordered several appetizers( rabbit pate, pretzel, meatball, cheese plate) They were good, but some I just never had a desire to try, like the rabbit. Everyone's entree was delicious. The wild boar sloppy joe/ beef fat fries. The chicken was tender, and I was told that the pork belly was simply amazing. For desert you have to try the donuts with this yummy cheese. It was soo mouth watering. For $23, we got 3 man sized shots of special whiskey/scotches which were so tastey. They even have rooms upstairs. All in all the prices were a touch more than I'd normally spend, but then this is not a normal restaurant. We all left feeling full and I will definitely be back. We were lucky because we got here at 5 on a Sunday, and they DON'T accept reservations??????, but by the time we left, this place was jumpin'.
