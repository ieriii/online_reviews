Katie, our waitress was cute...had a kinda Zooey Deschanel thing going with the dark eyeliner...went there with wife and son...tall guy cleaned a table outside for us right away...katie gave good suggestion's...food came pretty quickly and it was effing awesome. Son had mac and cheese with chicken which was crazy good...I had the buffalo bill and wife had something or other...great food...would go back again to be seated outside...kind of smelled funky indoors, like my old dorm room and wasn't bbq thing...went there about 7 on sunday and drinking crowd starting showing up...does everyone effing smoke on tha northside? Anyway, would definitely go back again.
