i loved it. i'm saving the fifth star for my return trip. i enjoyed it. i had the country skillet (i think that's it), at first glance i thought it had been sitting out for a bit, but when i slammed all the gravy over it, i fell in love. i shared a side of potato pancakes - a m a z i n g. my friend got the eggs benedict, it was delicious aswell. we also had the strawberry-oj, yummy! go, it's a moderately large space, decent service, add it to the list!
