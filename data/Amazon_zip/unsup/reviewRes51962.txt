I go to Chicago every two years for the Packaging Show. This has been my GO TO pizza place almost every time. I detoured to Lou Malnati's last time and had a really great pizza. This year, I was back at Gino's.  Have you ever spoken so highly about a place that the reality turned out to be total let down? Bingo. The wait was the usual 45 minutes for the fresh deep deep dish, but the bastards burnt my crust. It just sucked. It was like chewing a dry shoe. Every bite of the crust was just dust. I did not have the time to wait another 45 minutes for a new one. The waiter was all "bummer, dude.....maybe they overcooked it". That was it. Damn..... What a drag.
