Mmm, mmm, good. My wife and I are craft beer snobs and we're so glad that Revolution has added to the ever-growing beer scene in Chicago. Beers are top-notch (the generously-hopped pale ale varieties especially) and the food is pretty fantastic too. We actually came here for lunch after encountering a 2-hour wait at Kuma's and I must say that the huge burger was nearly as good (that says an awful lot for this Kuma's diehard). Also love that Revolution supports the best of the other local breweries by offering several of their beers as well. Classy bunch, those guys.
