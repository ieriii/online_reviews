Wow, this place was amazing! I went on Super Bowl Sunday and it wasn't that crowded, but I have tried to go 3 times before this and it was a 1-2 hour wait, but it's worth it! I got a Fillet with Parmesan crusted on the top and it was like nothing I have every had before. My girlfriend got the BBQ Chicken and Ribs and they were really good too. I have to say that the best part of this restaurant was our waitress. She didn't bug us too much, only when she saw we need something. Instead of asking if my girlfriend wanted a refill she would just bring it. As soon as the table of cleared someone came over right away to wipe it off. This is by far one of the best restaurants that I've been to in a long time. Dinner range from $10-$50, but I recommend a Fillet!
