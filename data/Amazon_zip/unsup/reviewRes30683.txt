wow! I am in love w/ the biscuit and duck confit (FAT) gravy. freaken awesome.. (I am an organic freak and my buds took me here for my bday dinner) We order: 1) po'boy sammie 2) soft crab sammie 3) roast pork 4) Sweet potato chips 5) Soy hot cocos 6) Caramel popcorn our entrees all came w/ two sides.. I am in total LOVE w/ biscuit and gravy.. so I got that as one of the sides.. I took two bites from my soft crab sammie (which was great) but I devoted all my attention and stomach room to the biscuit and gravy. (which only occurred to me when my she-bud made a witty remark on how I killed the biscuit and gravy and ignored the sammie). The biscuit was so flaky! Goodness! I had to run 2 extra miles to get that duck confit heaven outta my heart!  I had birthday cupcakes from Molly's waiting for me! so we didn't go all out crazy on the dessert menu .. but I did get a customized dessert: caramel popcorn w/ chocolate ganache and whip cream (I am those annoying customers that will ask for items NOT on the menu and always get my way..becos I say 'please' (smile) and 'thank you' (smile).) I have to say we had the best and funny waiter. I messed w/ him about the drinks being 'off', food looking strange, and demanding to talk to the pastry chef so he can customize my popcorn for me.. our waiter played it cool and pulled all the stops for us.
