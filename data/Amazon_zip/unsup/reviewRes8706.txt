We are total regulars. They are VERY quick to serve pizza, its great in the summer you can sit outside in the shade of the trees. The buffalo cheese is great and the pizza's are cooked in a clay oven. They change the specials every week. The owner often shouts us a glass of bubbly we go so regularly, Parking on Ravenswood is not usually a problem. The hours are not always easy to remember and they do vacation at times so always ring before you go.Its busy at times but we have never had to wait long for a table.Take stuff for kids to do nothing is provided.
