Yay I finally had your deep dish. I cannot remember the last time I dined at Pequod, it's been forever. Ordered delivery of a LG sausage and garlic deep dish pizza. It was great. The cooked cheese crust on the sides tasted like Saganaki, had a wonderful burned/cook cheese taste. Your sausage had great flavor. I usually hate pizza sausage as my wife usually likes it and I don't like the sausage that is typically used. Your's tasted savory all by itself. It was also well cooked.  Little bits of garlic goodness all over the pizza, you did it perfectly. Enough garlic to flavor the pizza, but not enough to scare the UPS guy and kill my small children. You've now made my pizza takeout shortlist, which includes Cafe Luigi and Piece. We also ordered a thin crust for my boys, I didn't have any but they tore into it like Andy Dick into a bottle of Wolfschmidt Vodka.
