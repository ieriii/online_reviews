Went Sat. night with a friend, excited from reviews. lousy meal. Tried the hot/sour soup with pork blood cakes. Soup was not hot (spicy) or sour, and the cakes were tofu (no real taste) - the soup itself was a clear cabbage broth, with too much salt and pepper (regular table pepper, not chili pepper). Silly us for thinking it would be a regular hot/sour soup with more interesting bits in it. Spicy eggplant with pork was good, average, hardly spicy, nothing special. His lamb w/cumin dish was okay, but lamb was not very tasty, and if you want this type of meal, go to a middle eastern restaurant where they do it right. I had fish with chili? sauce - recommended by waitress, and I swear it was a bunch of fish mcnuggets drenched in a ketchupy sweet bbq sauce. really bad. place was relatively busy, and it obviously shuffles people in and out fast. they'll come and stand by your table if they don't think you're leaving fast enough. if you go, maybe order only their 'specials', cause the other stuff is not so great, and don't expect them to be friendly.
