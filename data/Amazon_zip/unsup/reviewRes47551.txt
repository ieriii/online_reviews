I want to say eh but I feel that a-ok is better since I was there with Camp Groupon so I didn't get to experience everything they have to offer. For example we could only have the sponsored beers or soda. But I'll say something that I've said before, its not for me. We had a lot of the salad bar options which was good. They had interesting options. It was more of a foodie feel. The cheese biscuit w/ tangerine butter was over hyped. Was that cooked in an escargot pan? We were offered beef or chicken so like I said, not the full experience. The chicken was moist and had a great flavor. I just didn't want a whole lot of it. I was annoyed by the guy cutting the beef because he got blood all over my plate. If I were crazy about being a veg then I would have demanded another plate but as it was I just wiped it off. It did gross me out though. The service seemed ok. Its hard to judge with a big group. They were friendly and provided instruction and refilled our waters often. I can't see myself coming back though. To me its another Brizzaz. It is quite lovely inside and the outside deck is nice even though the tables and chairs are black metal.
