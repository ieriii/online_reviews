This last Saturday was a terrible day to wait in line for an hour, but we did. Here's what we got from good to best: duck fat fries: Just okay. The best "cooked in alternative fat" fries I've had are still the beef tallow fries from Sweet and Savories. Those were something special, these were a little too soggy for me and not flavorful or salted enough. Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel: Okay but the foie gras overpowered the other flavors. Once we took some of it off, it all went together better. Lamb and Pork Loukaniko with Artichoke Pesto, Kalamata Olives, Marinated Feta Cheese and Lemon-Dijon Foam: Great flavors and wonderfully salted - the feta was wonderful. Sally Vega (corn dog): I had no idea that a corn dog could be this good. Amazing. Chardonnay and Jalapeno Rattlesnake Sausage with Roasted Yellow Pepper Dijonnaise and Smoked Gouda Cheese: Yowza. I highly recommend this, a perfect combination of flavors. Cherry and Apple Pork Sausage with Sir William Pear Mustard and Vosges Bacon Chocolate: A dessert hot dog? Well, it works! There were three of us and this was more than enough food. We shared bites of each - never thought I'd eat hot dogs tapas style! Their customer service, from Doug taking your order to the guys that bus the tables, is excellent. The only complaint that I have is that towards the end of your meal you mouth gets tired from eating all those buns. The only solution would be to come here more often and get just one or two each time ... but the line makes that a bit more difficult to deal with!
