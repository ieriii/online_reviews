I really enjoyed this place. It is a really cool on an otherwise blah part of Milwaukee in Logan Square. Really, there is nothing else like it around there. The decor is great, alot of stainless steel in the kitchen in back and, unlike sports bars, only 2 TVs mounted above the bar. There are some cool seating areas to wait but the place is not totally packed but always full. I have been there several times for drinks and dinner. The 5 brews they have are all really good, and the IPA is the best (although the tulip glass they had I didn't like and the bar tenders would not put the IPA in a different glass??) The best thing there are the wings with the best blue cheese potato salad on the side and I NEVER like potato salad. I've tried the pizza and burgers, both were very good. I would recommend this for a date night or just having some good beer at the bar. Great addition to Logan Square!
