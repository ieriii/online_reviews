The Sunday brunch here is amazing! Think of the Brazillian steakhouse concept where they bring food to your table and convert that to a traditional American brunch and you get the idea! There are servers wandering everywhere with spits of ham, turkey, beef ... and platters of other unique creations. Additionally, there are extensive buffet stations with your traditional brunch fare. The ambiance is terrific with a centerpiece fireplace with bar-height tables radiating from the center! Amazing food, amazing ambiance and an amazing price for what you get. I only dropped a star because they could have used more of those roaming chefs. Sometimes it felt like the other tables were getting all the food!!
