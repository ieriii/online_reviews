Go for the duck. Who cares about anything else!!!! Accommodated our group of a billion people (15-20 people on a Sunday might as well be a billion). A few of us that got here early still had to wait for at least half our party to arrive. Service was good. Not very sociable but was a super hero for having all these people throw questions at her from all directions. Food came out staggered as Crissy noted but again, worked out well. I was sad I couldn't try any of their soups because they were all made with a pork broth. I've come to expect this from most Asian restaurants. Decor was like a Chinatown cafeteria, but when your food is this delicious, who cares where you'd eat it. Good experience over all.
