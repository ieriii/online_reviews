This is by far my favorite bar in Chicago! They have an AWESOME beer menu and a wonderful food menu too. It's the perfect place to grab a drink with friends and/or a bite to eat in either a social or intimate setting. They've just expanded so they now have another bar area (good thing because everyone loves this place and it does get busy), but they also separate their dining seating area so you don't have to eat dinner next to people who are *ahem* enjoying the beer menu a little loudly :P Awesome ambiance with exposed brick and vintage beer signs and posters. Whenever I'm having a friend visit the city or want to meet up somewhere "fun" in Andersonville, I will never NOT suggest Hopleaf. So great!
