Call me a fangirl. Dale was a favorite of mine on Top Chef and Top Chef Masters, so that's what brought me to Sprout, but you don't earn five Yelp stars by being adorable and charming on television. Chef Dale wasn't in the night we ate there, but it didn't matter; the food here was sensational and exactly what I hoped for from his Top Chef showing --complicated compositions and many conflicting ingredients working harmoniously.  We started out the meal with a couple of the best cocktails I've ever enjoyed and the meal just got better from there. My husband loved his foie gras an my scallop was velvety and succulent. We had the black bass and short ribs, respectively, and both were incredible. The wine pairings were thoughtful and did their job of making the food taste even better, but our favorite bites of all were the intermezzos. The cauliflower soup was one of the best bites of food I've ever eaten and the composed cheese course... oh my gosh. Our server called it the most "ri-goddamn-diculous" grilled cheese and it was that. So good! The only thing I didn't particularly enjoy was my dessert. If I'd known the chocolate dessert when we went was a jelly roll I'd have passed, but luckily my husband thought it was amazing and traded me his delicious apple pie dessert for it. (I prefer a more savory dessert, he prefers very sweet.) The black pepper gelato was heavenly and the coffee I enjoyed ended a really perfect meal.
