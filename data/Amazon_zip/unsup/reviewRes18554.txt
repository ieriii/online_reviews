I desperately wanted to go to Bad Apple to get a burger that I heard such rave reviews about. So I dragged my friends there for happy hour on a recent Friday, although I'm sure it wasn't their first choice (no drinks specials, boo.) I finally got there, ordered a slow burn, and, well nothing. I am super disappointed. The burger was okay, the bun was insanely soggy and the fries in my humble opinion were not good. They tasted a little overdone and bland. I can mark Bad Apple off my places to go and probably won't go back.
