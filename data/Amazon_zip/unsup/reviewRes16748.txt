This is the best Indian restaurant I've been to in Chicago. The staff was super friendly, the food was delicious, and the atmosphere was really pleasant. It's a big place, but it's laid out in such a way that feels very cozy and intimate. We ordered the palak paneer and eggplant tamarind, and some cashew-potato fritters (korma? I forgot what they were called) for appetizer - everything was outstanding. The menu is seriously about 10 pages long, and there are tons of vegetarian options. We arrived at about 6:15pm on a Friday, and it was no trouble getting a table, but the restaurant was getting quite full by the time we left at 7:45, so it would probably be smart to make a reservation for weekend nights. The staff were very attentive. I did feel that they were a bit overzealous with refilling our waters - I mean, I don't need a refill every time I take one or two sips of water. At times it got a little distracting. That said - I have had the opposite experience in an Indian restaurant, where my mouth is burning and I need water and no waiter is to be found, and it's quite unpleasant. Having too much water is always better than having not enough water. I look forward to trying out the lunch buffet. This place was more expensive that most restaurants I can afford on my meager budget, but for the quality of the food and service, we felt it was quite fair. Also the portions are pretty big, so you could cut costs by sharing dishes or just bringing the leftovers home for another complete meal.
