I've been to the Bad Apple several times because it's within walking distance of my apartment. They have an extensive beer list, with lots of interesting microbrews. Their burgers and fries are generally quite tasty, and I like their homemade ketchup. I'm really upset that the delicious cumin burger that was on the menu this summer is no longer there. It was amazing and should be brought back pronto. I've also tried their fall salad, which was good but had too many candied walnuts relative to salad greens, making it a lot richer than I wanted. I know I'll continue to be a regular at the Bad Apple, but I don't know if it's worth going out of your way for. Also, I HATE the logo. It looks really unprofessional, like it was done with early 1990's Clip Art.
