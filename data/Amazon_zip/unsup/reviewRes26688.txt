Came here on a Thursday night on a first date. We came at 7ish and the restaurant was pretty empty. I liked the setup though, the bar was small but nice with a lot of floor space around it. The food was good, pretty solid, nothing earth shattering. I was underwhelmed by the wine list, but was able to find a decent Barolo to try. I will definitely be back here, just not anytime soon. I suggest you try it for yourself to make your own assessment, I've definitely been to worse fine dining in Chicago.
