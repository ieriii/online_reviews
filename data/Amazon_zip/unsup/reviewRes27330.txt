4 stars for value alone: 1 leines pitcher + 2 side salads + cheesy garlic bread + small pan pizza = $48 with tax and tip. great deal and a pleasant suprise! we enjoyed the food, beverages, and service before seeing the worlds worst movie, paranormal activity on friday night. i wish i would have stayed at pequods and thrown myself down those super steep stairs for 1.5 hours rather than see that movie. lordy. sidenote: does anyone know what is on the whale's head? it looks like underpants or a boomerang...
