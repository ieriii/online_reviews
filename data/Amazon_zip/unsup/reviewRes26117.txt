As a visitor to Chicago, we had to try their infamous deep dish pizza and we decided to try out Pequod's. We loaded our pizza with toppings so it took a while to come out. When our deep dish pizza came out, the bottom of the pie was too soggy! It would've been a really good pizza if we ordered a medium instead of a large and went a little easier on the toppings. But regardless, we were a bit disappointed that the pizza was so soggy. The 3 of us could not finish the large pizza so we wrapped it up to-go and gave it to a homeless guy down the street!
