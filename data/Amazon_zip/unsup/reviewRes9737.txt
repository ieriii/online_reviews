My girl friend and I went there during restaurant week and on 'Date Night' another prix fixe dinner menu option they offer only on Wednesday evenings. We were a little disappointed with our options of the Date Night Menu so we elected to go with the Restaurant week prix fixe menu and we were extremely glad we did. The food was AMAZING. Seriously. We had banh cuon as one of our appetizers and nearly climaxed right then and there. It was that good. Everything we had was extremely good. The wait staff was very helpful and attentive. Beautiful place. A must try for any foodie.
