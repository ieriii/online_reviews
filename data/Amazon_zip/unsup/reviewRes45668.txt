I've been to Wilde several times before, but I've never been so disappointed in the "I could care less" attitude of the host and wait staff. After waiting for nearly ten minutes for my server, I approached a host who pointed towards my waitress and was surprised I was asking her for service. The place is pretty much "get em in, get em out" style. Standoffish and unfriendly. The food was ok, but pasta somewhat bland. When I asked for leftovers, he didn't give me a bag to put them in, expecting that I would be okay with having juice spill onto me or in my car. Just a disappointment. They seem content that the location will bring in customers and the cash registers will just keep on ringing. Fix it, or move on.
