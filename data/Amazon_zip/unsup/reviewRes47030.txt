Dinner was brilliant. On the coldest day, sitting down at a friendly table to hear someone say 'the special today is the lobster mac and cheese' was the best thing ever. Not overkill with a mix of tail and claw meat, but actually the interesting dimensions was the little arugula like greens and cauliflower in the mix added so much flavor and texture that it was just incredible. The whole place is so very great and so very Chicago.
