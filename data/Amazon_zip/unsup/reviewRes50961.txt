Waitress was cool and fun to hang out with. Dog friendly but the chef can't remember what was ordered. I ordered a sandwich with no lettuce but it came dry and gross but with tons of lettuce. Asked for pecan pie warmed up but got it cold, as in: Straight out of the fridge! They're lame in the kitchen. Music was right on though. I'm pretty sure the chef didn't pick Dr John.
