Great lunch specials. You can get the rice combo and it comes with all there different types of meat, side of rice, salty egg, some veggies, and soup. More than enough for two people. I think it's $5-6. It's scary to hear that they didn't pass the health inspection, it's pretty obvious it's not the cleanest restaurant out there. The service is rushed and rude, but it's a quick, cheap lunch.
