I am sad to say that they have fallen far from previously being on my list of favorites. We ordered red curry, paid thai, crab rangoon, and a sushi roll... and it was all bad. The curry was bland and unpleasant. The crab rangoon were gross - just off tasting and bad. The pad thai (so hard to get wrong!) wasn't good. The sushi roll was hard and crunchy (tempura fried to death) and then was set on top of the hot food for delivery so it was warm and gross when it arrived. I can forgive one bad dish, but not 4. Sadly, we will not be ordering from here again. First time I've ever thrown away leftover thai food...
