Okay. For $33, the pork chop should knock your socks off. Just didn't do it here. Decent piece of meat, but seems like the chef tried too hard with the preparation and fell short, particularly for the price. Brie potatoes just okay. Caesar salad just okay. So there, everything okay, just not great. And seven dollars for a Guiness?
