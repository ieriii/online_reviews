I SO wanted to like this place. New Orleans has such a wealth of killer restaurants, to find a place that has a Southern soul here in Chicago is so hard...but this place is really a miss. Best part of the two meals I've had here was the fresh squeezed apple juice. Everything is just...bland. Biscuits and gravy have no flavor, the sausage is gristly, egg dishes hit and miss, just not enough flavor here to encourage any kind of Cajun or Creole references. And how about getting a decent hot sauce? It's amazing to me that mediocre places like Wishbone thrive here in Chicago. Looks cool, but that ain't enough, sorry.
