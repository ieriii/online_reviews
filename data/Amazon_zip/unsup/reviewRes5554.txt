I have been to this restaurant 5 times since being referred by a friend that is somewhat of a wine aficionado. In short-it is wonderful & I have never had a bad experience. Some pointers-if you want to get in quick, don't go on the weekend. They don't do reservations & the wait can take up to an hour (although well worth it). A good time is a late weekday lunch. Also, much of the seating is group/family style (i.e. you might be sitting with people you don't know at a long, rustic table). The servers are very good at recommending wine pairings with the food. If they have the olive oil ice cream-order it, hands down.
