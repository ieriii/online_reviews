The gold coast isn't my favorite hood for brunch bets, but was at the 3rd coast for brunch and rather liked the scene and the fare. Low-key and laid back, loud yet welcoming,it's a perfect neighborhood hangout. The menu is diverse, extensive and it was hard honing in on the Greek omelet which I settled for, which was pretty good. Would like to try the wine-bar sometime here as well. Overall, I think this cafe does a nice job of offering a bit of something for all times of the day - certainly worth a few return visits at least
