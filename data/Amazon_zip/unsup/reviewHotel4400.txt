Wow - great spot for a party! I hadn't been to the Palmer House since I was a kid until this week for a work event. I have to say, it was one of the nicest work events that I've been to. From what I could see, everything was done beautifully. The meeting rooms/ball rooms we used were beautiful. The coordination of moving a large group through the hotel was done nicely - with staff members directing the group.  The sound for the meeting and the band later was fantastic. Everything was set up nicely in terms of food, bars, dance floor, tables.  Based upon the fact that most people stayed until the end of the night - dancing up a storm, I think that the party was a success and I think it was a great venue!
