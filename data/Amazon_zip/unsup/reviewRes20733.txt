This place was great! I would definitely eat here again if it was closer to where we live. The food was great, we started with the fondue. The bread was delicious and buttery and the fondue was soooo good. We both had the price fixe menu with the mixed greens salad and the pork. The pork was wonderful, my first bite seemed to be a tiny bit dry but it was fine after that. It was seasoned well and was so tender it fell apart. For dessert I had the chocolate pot du creme (I believe that was the name) and my fiance had the root beer reconstructed. Even though I thought my dessert tasted the best, the root beer dessert was really fun! I had no idea they had root beer flavored pop rocks. As far as booze goes, I had a kir royale and a margarita and both were delicious. They had a good amount of beers, wines, cocktails and hard liquor on their drink menu. Our server was really friendly and helpful with food suggestions and the atmosphere was also comfortable. I loved my entire dining experience.
