I was visiting a friend in Chicago and she'd mentioned the Violet Hour as a place she absolutely loved, so I was excited to try it. We got there soon after it opened (it wasn't busy at all), dressed up, and sat at the bar, where after getting our drinks, we were thoroughly ignored for the rest of the time there. Our bartender, Henry, walked by us multiple times, purposely looking away, with our beverage glasses sitting empty. After about thirty minutes of this, we called him by name to get our bill, and took off. We have no idea why he acted this way, but were completely unimpressed. The drinks were fine, but the experience was ridiculous. I've never been treated that way in my life, and I'll never go back, nor recommend it to anyone I like.
