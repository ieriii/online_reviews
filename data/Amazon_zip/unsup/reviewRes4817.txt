I'm so glad I'm only a metaphorical (foodie) piggy, or else I would definitely be scared of this place! Randomly spotted this restaurant as Liz K. and I were walking Michigan Avenue. When we entered, I definitely knew this would live up to its name. We weren't that hungry, so we ordered the following: Charred Cauliflower, Toasted Breadcrumbs, Cornichons and Parsley- SO delicious! It was pretty salty, but I loved that the charr brought new flavor to the cauliflower. I definitely have never enjoyed the usually bland veggie than I have at Purple Pig! Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes- My friend said that it was "life changing"...it was definitely delicious! The pork was seriously the most moist, pull-apart goodness that I have ever had. I'll never look at pork the same ever again :) Props for an affordable price point. College-wallet friendly yes! The service was super amazing. Our waitress checked in on us often and was very friendly and genuine. 25% tip for you! Need a break from all that walking/spending your cash? Step into The Purple Pig for a bit, and you won't be disappointed :)
