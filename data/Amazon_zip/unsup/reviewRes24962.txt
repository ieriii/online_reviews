Thank you Mercat for -excellent service -wonderful wine list -beautiful dates -Luscious Iberico Ham -Juicy Steak One small request. An authentic Paella Vallencia. I have tried Paella at many places in chicago...NOT A SINGLE one has met my expectations or reminded me of the paellas I have had in Spain. I have utter confidence that Mercat would easily achieve the authentic flavor and take it to a whole new level. I dream of the day that they make one. Paella Party? call me Mercat!
