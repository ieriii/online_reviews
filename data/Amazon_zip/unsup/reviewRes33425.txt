Dear Yolk,   I'm from California and I have a confession to make...I dream about you. I'd crack an egg and think about you, seriously, I do. I don't want to make this seem awkward because we rarely see each others but without you, my brunch in Chicago would never be complete. Not only do you make a damn good egg benedict, you also accept me for who I am. I'm an alcoholic, I really am, your BYOB and no corkage fee makes me happy. I miss you. yours truly, -Victor
