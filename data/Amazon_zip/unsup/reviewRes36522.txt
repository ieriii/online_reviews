I heard about Meli from friends at work and I decided to try it. Went with my girlfriend and we both had a great experience. I ordered the vegetarian omelet and thought it was delicious. To top that, two other items that I feel sets this one apart - A. The coffee (haven't tasted this type since I was in Europe), B. The Orange Juice (freshly squeezed or at least tastes like it is). Pricing is at par with other brunch places and I highly recommend it. My girlfriend has the croissant egg sandwich and she loved it as well. Tip: You can park on Jackson/Adams or by the meters opposite the Greek restaurant (Athenos/Roditys) and walk over if parking is an issue.
