My first visit here was on a Sunday afternoon, nice and slow. Something about the day, the service and the food made me incredibly happy with my Calo experience. I drink water real fast, and often feel like a pain at restaurants since servers struggle to keep my glass filled. Calo did just fine on this hot day. A guy was around the minute I needed a refill nd cleared our plates as soon as we were finished.  the portions were quite large and the pizza I got was loaded with cheese and generous on the toppings, both which I don't mind. On a second visit the pasta I had may not have been straight from Italy, but I was hungry and the size, heat of dish and price was just right. It's definitely a place to get a decent, filing meal that won't break the bank with great service.
