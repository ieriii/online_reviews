I recently celebrated my wedding anniversary at Publican. Whooa Buddy. The quality was exceptional. While I refuse to habitually expend the level of finances that my wife and I dropped on this meal, such an occasion warrants the money.  To begin, my wife and I had the pork rinds, or home made chicharon, with a couple of beers. She had a Belgian White and I a Three Floyd's Gumball Head. Beer with these sea salt and malted vinegar chicaron was simply bitchin'.  We followed that app up the Charcuterie plate and then with some Oysters. The Morteau sausage on that Charcuterie plate was bad ass. Smokey with a pinch of spicy heat, ooohh boy. Then, the Oysters. To give the Potter Stewart paraphrase, and front my ignorance, I don't know much about Oysters other than I know a good one when I taste it.  Wifey ordered two of each for a total of six with the Kumamoto ? being the final, and damn fine they were.  About this time we started getting into good conversation with our serve Joseph. He was knowledgeable and recommended anything pork. We, thusly, ordered the beet salad, the sweetbreads, and finally the Potee. Damn if the pork belly in that Potee wasn't some of the best I'd ever had. Also, the lightly breaded sweetbreads were out of sight. Even that little beet salad with home made ricotta was worth ordering two of.  Anyhow, we ordered a small cheese plate, and were comped the waffle desert. We ordered some small end plates just to have something to dine on as we finished our wine. So, to wrap it up, if you can get a two top or don't mind eating with strangers, I highly recommend this place.
