It really is as good as everyone says it is! My first time eating at hot dougs I considered getting out of line because I figured a $5 dog wouldn't be worth my time. I'm glad I waited it out, half and hour is a small price to pay for the most delicious encased meat available to man. Believe the hype, and try the duck fat fries!
