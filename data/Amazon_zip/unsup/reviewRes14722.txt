drive by this place all the time taking my son to school, anyways, stopped in today after work to pick up some dinner, got myself a cubano sandwich, and then decided to get a papa rellena. let me say that the papa rellena was great, i'm so glad i decided to add this item to my order, i was alittle disappointed with the cubano because the pork was alittle dry and had a slight off taste to it like it had been sitting around for awhile, but everything else about the cubano sandwich was great, especially how they cook the bread to buttery crispy texture and the melted cheese.....only if the pork was juicy and fresh, that would've done wonders for this sandwich. if they make all their sandwiches this way though, i'd like to try some of the different options because the bread and cheese were so good. back to the papa rellena, its basically a ball of mashed potato filled with ground beef with what i think is sofrito type sauce. i think its breaded and deep fried. oh man, this thing is dense and savory, and if you like meat and potatoes, this is what i'd recommend getting. The mashed potato had a garlicky sour taste to it which i enjoyed, the slight sourness kinda surprised me, but not in a bad way.  prices are reasonable, sandwich prices are alittle higher than what you'd consider fast food, but definitely reasonable for what you get. the papa rellena was only 2.50, i'd order a few of those next time, but these balls of goodness are pretty heavy, so be careful not to eat too many
