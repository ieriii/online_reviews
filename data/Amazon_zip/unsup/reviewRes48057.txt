My 2 friends and I arrived here on a Sunday morning at 10am with no reservation hoping to score a table at "one of the best brunches in the country." Publican did not disappoint. The decor is beautiful, and the communal tables add to the experience. Our waitress was helpful and friendly, surprising us with a delicious piece of coffee cake after we placed our order. HIGHLIGHTS OF THE MEAL: red wine poached eggs, publican bacon, asparagus omelette Everything was delectable, and I cannot wait to go back!
