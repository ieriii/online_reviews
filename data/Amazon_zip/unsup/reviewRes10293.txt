I absolutely love this place! I have been going there since they first opened, the patio is what I love so much! And yes the food of course.But every time I go there I feel like i'm on vacation! Seriously, it's a great place to go with your friends, or to go on a date :) my friend took me there the first time I went,and we sat by the bar and star it our evening with a glass of wine,and then we moved to the PATIO,that I enjoyed so so much !! we ordered appetizers to start with,and later had the main course.EVERYTHING and I mean everything from the minute we walked in until the end of our night was just FABULOUS!
