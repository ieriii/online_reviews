Giordano's is still my favorite deep dish pizza. I've only been to this location once, and got take out since my hotel was just around the corner, so I can't comment on the wait staff. I did have to wait in the takeout area for about 10 minutes. Apparently my timing was good, since there were a group of guys in the bar that had more than 1 singing lesson, and broke out in song. It even drew out some of the staff in the kitchen to listen. Getting back to the hotel, I got to enjoy what I consider to be the best deep dish pizza I've ever eatten. Of couse like a dummy, I ordered a large for me and my wife, and we weren't able to eat the whole thing. Good thing this pizza taste good the next morning cold for breakfast. If you get take out, don't forget to ask for plates and utensils. You'll need them.
