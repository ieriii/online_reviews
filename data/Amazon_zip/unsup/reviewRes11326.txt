This might just be my favorite brunch place. Of course, I know there are a lot of places I haven't been and so that is a crazy big statement, but I'm going to tick to it for the time being. I have been here a good few times and every time I am blown away with delight. The mimosas are fantastic, especially the one that they have that is like grapefruit pomegranate or something. And the coffee is also good. As for the food, it's all amazing. They have a BLT Benedict that is so so good and tasty. The ingredients are always fresh and it is just so good. SO GOOD. Then there are any of the special pancakes that are covered in yummy, sugary stuff. I think that it's pretty uncommon to find a place that does both savory and sweet really well, and the Bongo Room does it. Sure, there is always a wait, but the staff is nice and the service is always really good. And the food is SO worth it.
