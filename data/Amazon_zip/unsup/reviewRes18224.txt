This is one of my few 5 star reviews. Love the Bad Apple. Wish Summer wasn't over as once the nice outdoor patio closes, I'll have to start waiting for tables during peak hours, as the place isn't all that large. They have extremely creative burgers/toppings, and a variety of seasonings for their fries (Old Bay seasoning on fries is awesome!). The actual burger itself is tasty, but not as good as Jury's -- probably my only neg, and it's a nit-picky one. That being said, Jury's doesn't have the variety/toppings that Bad Apple has. I like both restaurants, but for different reasons. The Edmund Fig-Gerald, Frenchie, and Black & Blue are my favorite custom burgers. The Slow Burn burger definitely burned -- those who have spicy palates will enjoy. When the plates come out, they seem small at first. Then at the end, I feel stuffed. Because of that, I've never had an appetizer but my friends say the poutine is really good. The beer list is massive and well chosen, and the bartenders and wait staff are very knowledgeable. You will find a beer you like here, and probably many you've never tried.
