Hit the Lao up last week again; my 2nd visit, both times with at least one native Chinese speaker which is helpful but don't be intimidated if you don't have access to a beautiful Asian woman (just be jealous). The dry chili chicken which is fried and delectable and pretty spicy as a result of an abundance of chilies overflowing from the plate like the red army ready to assault Taiwan if Taiwan was your tongue. Had some sort of sesame filled rice balls in a sweet soup for dessert. There's over 900 menu items, try them all?
