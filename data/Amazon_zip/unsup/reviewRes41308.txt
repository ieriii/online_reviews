This place is a 5 star experience because: 1. BYOB - yet the servers know more about the wine you'll bring than you will (ask for a copy of the menu in advance and have the wine shop pair a few bottles for you). 2. Food is inventive, creatively prepared and delicious. 3. Not pretentious (which is what you tend to get at a Trotters-type place). 4. Romantic - few tables and intimate/lofty surroundings.
