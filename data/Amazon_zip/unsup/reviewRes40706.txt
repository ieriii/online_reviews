We went as a group of 6 on a Sat night and waited almost 2 hours. It was fine as it gave us a chance to drink t the bar and catch up. The hostess and manager were apologetic and gave us a cheese plate and amuse bouche as complimentary started when we sat down. We did not expect it but were appreciative. We ordered the scallops, port cheeks, tete du cochon and bone marrow for apps. They were all delicious. Then, we ordered the short ribs, pork belly, burger, pork shank and cod for dinner. Everyone loved their dinner but I thought the pork belly and shorts ribs were the standouts. For dessert, we had the chocolate tart and goat cheese donuts. Loved the donuts. They were crunchy and savory and unique. We probably spent about $45 per person, including tips, which is very reasonable for the amount of food we ordered. I would go back, but maybe not on a weekend evening because of the long wait.
