Great food for the price....nice alternative to the more formal sit-down places in Greektown. Original menu, great pizzas, sandwiches, and of course, cookies. My personal favorite is the lamb sandwich, the margherita pizza, and the Greek fries (comes with mustard and feta...mmm). Glad to have it as a choice to eat.
