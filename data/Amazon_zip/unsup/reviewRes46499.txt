I've eaten here a couple times with my family, and both times were great experiences. The good: The food is great and there are a lot of unique options to choose from. There is even a salad bar that has some tasty choices. The food is nothing like any other restaurant you might find. The waiting staff is very nice, they do a great job and are there when you need them. The bad: It can be really hard to find a parking spot near the restaurant. However, there is valet parking available. There is not a lot of space in this place. All of the tables are close together, with very little room to walk in between them. It amazes me how the waiting staff can carry food to tables and trip over somebody/something and drop the food everywhere. The good things far overshadow the bad, which is why I recommend this restaurant to all my friends.
