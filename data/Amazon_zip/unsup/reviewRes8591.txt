This was a very plesant dining experience.  The only reason I can't give it a 5 is because the salad bar is a bit lacking. Also, some of the items I got from the salad bar seemed a bit salty.  On to the good! The service was the absolute best I have experienced and I'm super picky and this. The manager stopped by when he saw he give the slightest twitch. MY DH loves his meat cooked a certain way so after I mentioned it, every single piece of meat that came our way was cooked to perfection. The caprinha (sp?) was excellent and not too sweet like I'd had elsewhere. Dare I say save room for dessert! That too was yummy! It's a big heavy for someone like myself that is not a true red meat eater, but it was well worth the experience!
