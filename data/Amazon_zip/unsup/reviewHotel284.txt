Stayed here with boyfriend in the middle of March2011. I have to say, this place is awesome, especially if you get a good deal on the rooms. It is a hotel and apartment building. It is right next to the Hancock Building, which is right on Michigan Ave. It's easy to get to the bus/eL from the hotel. Our room was not what I was expecting, it was totally awesome. They appeared to have been all apartments at one point, so it was like having our own apartment. Had lots of storage space, full fledged kitchen (that we didn't get to use), huge bed, nice sitting area and tiled in bathroom. I really loved this place and I plan on staying here in the future.
