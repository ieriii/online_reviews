why 3 stars? because I like to have a few drinks with dinner and the drinks here are expensive! A johnny walker black with soda is $9 - thats more that most clubs in Chicago!  My wife and I went with another couple and we spent close to $60 on just drinks. I wish they reconsider the price of their liquor.The food is good, but the price of liquor would deter me from going again .
