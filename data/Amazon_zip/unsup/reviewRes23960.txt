As a man who grew up with Sze Chuan food, I can tell with certainty that the cuisine here is more or less modified from the original to accommodate local preferences (believe it or not, the original dishes are generally spicier!). But still, they do a good job. Based on my experience, I recommend Bon Bon chicken, Jiao Ma chicken, jellyfish and squid (both appetizers), boiled beef in spicy sauce, Ma Po tofu, dry chili string beans, smoked tea duck, and spicy fish dishes. For first-timers, it's usually necessary to get a glass of iced water on the side. Don't get intimidated by the reddish appearance and chili smell of the dishes. After getting used to the flavor, you'll love'em!
