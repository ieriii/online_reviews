Restaurant Review Excellent decor, but the steak needs some work. I have never been to ruth chris to a company meeting in the upstairs private room. Our servers were very attentive and the wine glass was never empty. Our meal started off with veal osso buco ravioli which were flavorful and well balanced. The crabcake stuffed mushrooms were above par, but lacking seafood flavor. Our house salad was nothing to rave about with vinegerette dressing and leafy greens. My main course was the petite fillet which I was eagerly anticipating, however the waiter mixed up the ordered and instead of medium rare, I got super done. The plate was sizzling non-stop and continued to cook my filet. Unfortunately I did not have the courage to step up and tell them that this hockey puck was not mine as someone else in my group clamoured that their steak was raw.... The steak doesn't have a lot of flavoring except for the butter they used that crust around the outside of the steak. I finished the meal with the chocolate sin cake which was delectable and made up for my over cooked beef. All and all could be better but the over cook steak probably took away the rich meaty flavor... Maybe next time Pro- nice ambienance Con- super expensive, make sure you get your steak cooked right Hidden deal- none
