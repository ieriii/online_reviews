Ive been trying to get here for weeks now and it finally paid off. Rev Brew rules. The Cross of Gold brew is fantastic and the Bottom Up Wit is a 2nd runner up. I wasnt too into the Workingman Mild, but the Iron Fist pale ale was ok. In fact, I got a growler to go of the Cross of Gold because it was so damn good. As for the food, I didnt get a good sampling as I had already eaten, but I tried the roasted beet and goat cheese bruschetta which was really good and I had the best soup I have ever eaten. period. seriously. no joke...the cheddar ale soup knocked me on my ass. It was so flavorful and delicious. I would typically never order soup, but Im so glad I did. They should seriously use this soup for a sauce over chicken, fries, a burger...hell anything. Its that good. OK enough about that damn soup. Rev Brew is a great place and its going to be in my regular rotation. I joined the brew club and got a bunch of perks. I also get to drink out of this sweet, exclusive members mug when I go in there. Damn it, I wish they had ceremonial robes or something.
