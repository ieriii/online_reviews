XOCO, pronounced "Sho-Ko," is worth going to simply for the churros. They come in multiples of 3, and each churro seems like its bursting with sugar. Make sure you eat em warm! Delicious! Besides the churros, the food isn't that good. I expected more from Senor Bayless. The torta (sandwich) I ordered tasted like a very average turkey panini. It left me confused because I thought I was going to an authentic Mexican restaurant. Oh well, I probably ordered the wrong thing! Seating is kinda weird here too. They cram you in really tight, and you will most likely share a table with some lovely strangers.  It's always busy here, so be prepared to stand in line! 5 stars for churros! 2 for everything else.
