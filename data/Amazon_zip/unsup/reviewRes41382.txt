I brought in 2008 while dining here and it was a great way to start of the new year. A group of friends and I enjoyed the 11pm prix fixe menu. Every course was presented nicely and tasted great. It was additional bonus that every course was served by the owner/chef. Additionally, as a byob this place gets extra points in my book.
