I wanted to try a different restaurant other than Santorini (my favorite) in Greektown. I ordered the shrimp...bit in...and it was a little soft? I didn't quite know at this time it was a sure sign the shrimp had gone bad (ahem, because I've never HAD bad shrimp). I didn't eat all of it, maybe a couple and then sent it back telling them it tasted funny. Skip forward to 4 hours later...I think you can guess what happened. Needless to say, I'm not visiting the Greek Islands any time soon, at least the one in the West Loop.
