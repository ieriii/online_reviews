If you see the long lines on halted and Jackson in the mornings, do yourself a favor and get in it. This is one place where the food surpasses the hype. Meli by far is the BEST breakfast/brunch place in Chicago. When so many restaurants claim to be so good I am not sure how Meli managed to leapfrog them in its quality and taste. The crapes and chocolate pancakes are ridiculously good and we have never been here and not ordered the guyre crape. All the omelets and the eggs Benedict are perfect and their juices are heavenly. The staff is very nice. You owe it to yourself to eat at Meli cafe once to make up your mind and be blown away.
