Best Deep Dish in Chicago - beats out Gino's, Lou's, Uno's, and Pizanno's for sure.  Don't be scared by the awning that is falling apart or the ancient looking sign...it is all worth it in the end. I have had the thin crust - don't waste your time and stick to the deep dish (Go to Pat's Pizza for thin crust)
