This place is famous right? Right. I gotta say that I was a little disappointed. This place feels pretty shabby chic. A little more shabby than chic. The carpets were worn. The tiles were cracked. The bathroom was really quite sad. As I walked the corridors, when I wasn't thinking about Marilyn Monroe or Diana staying in the same place, I was half expecting to see some kid on a trike yelling Red Rum! Red Rum! Creepy corridors kids. All in all a bit disappointing. I don't know that I would stay here again. It would seem that the old hotel has lost its charm and needs a serious makeover. Stacey? Clinton?
