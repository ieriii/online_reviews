Best Sushi in Chicago- hands down!!!!! They always have creative rolls, tons of options with cilantro, avacado and jalapeno. But good rolls can be found in plenty of spots- Wakamono is the best because their SASHIMI is the best. I don't know if they get a higher quality of fish, if they have top-knotch sushi chefs, or both...... but either way their sashimi is amazing. Regarding the atmosphere, it is located in the heart of Boystown which means that it is pretty gay sometimes. Not really my scene, but the food is good enough that it does not matter. To miss out on Wakamono because you are afraid to go to Boystown is a huge mistake.
