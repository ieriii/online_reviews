We showed up at this restaurant with high expectations, given the quality at Avec and Blackbird. Unfortunately, we were sorely disappointed. We were told we would either have to wait for 40 minutes for a table (on a Monday night), or stand at the bar. We chose the bar, but it still took the waiter a half an hour to take our beer order, and then they would only offer a very limited food menu at the bar. By the time we actually got our beers, we had been there about an hour, and noticed several empty tables throughout the restaurant that they could easily have seated us at. finally, we had to ask for our bill three times. I think there are plenty of other restaurants in Chicago I'd rather spend my time at.
