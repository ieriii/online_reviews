The Purist is simple bliss: Wide swaths of garganelli pasta dressed with parmesan and pecorino. My nana called this little number "noodlies and butter." Though her version used boxed egg noodles and Country Crock, this dish is, and always will be, pure comfort food to me. I couldn't resist the deeply-ingrained urge to add tons of pepper and slurp it up down. Proof that the best dishes don't have to be fussy, but should (upon reaching the appropriate age) be paired with the Devil's Door cocktail. Delicious.
