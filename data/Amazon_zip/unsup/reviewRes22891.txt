Everyone in Chicago seems to love Lao...but they haven't won my heart :( I lived in Beijing for a while and used to frequent hot pot restaurants with large groups of friends...hotpot restaurants were all the rage in Beijing at the time...some of my fondest memories are from the hot pot joints and the food was always pretty good at them. I came to LSC with a group of people having hyped up hot pot for them for weeks...I order some meats, spicy broth...everything looked fine until I actually ate it. Frist of all the broth was missing one of the main ingredients which is the Sichuan Flower Pepper...it's just not the same without that ingredient and I have no clue why they omitted it from the broth! I ordered some tripe only to find out it tasted exactly like chitlins from aldis in the plastic container...:/ the dipping sauces were mediocre and the meats and veggies seemed low quality. On top of the bland food the check was super steep for what we ordered...had it been a good experience the price would have never registered in my mind but it honestly sucked ass. I asked a waitor in mandarin if there was a good hotpot restaurant nearby at the time, and he said "no...there is no very good one. Most restaurants around here are somewhat americanized so we can do business" After we left the place everyone got a ridiculous headache probably from all of the msg in the broth. Lao Sichuan was a massive disappointment for me :/ If this place was dropped in Chengdu, Chongqing, or even Beijing it would most definitely fail miserably.  Sorry Old Sichuan, but nothing about you reminds me of the old country :/ [Someone just told me that Sichuan Peppercorns were illegal in the states until 2005 and businesses still haven't added that ingredient into their dishes that traditionally have it...please add them to the spicy recipe now! lol]
