I've only been here once, but I was thoroughly impressed, and will gladly go back! I stopped by with my fiance and his parents after he had just moved into a new apt in the city, and we decided to try The Pasta Bowl simply because we were tired, and it was right next door; Good choice! Everyone enjoyed their meal, and we shared desserts at the end... my chocolate mousse cake was divine!
