Wow, I don't know if one star can accurately represent how disappointed I was with my experience at The Publican. Here's a summary: What the Publican describes as a "booth", I describe as a cage. The already small booths along the east wall have corral-like doors that trap you inside! Talk about claustrophobia! Fortunately, they reseated my very uncomfortable family. I noticed that several other groups of patrons were requesting to be moved for various and sundry reasons throughout the night. The atmosphere is so unappealing that it is incredibly distracting! The lights seem overly bright while everything else is exceedingly beige. If I'm noticing the atmosphere instead of enjoying my alcoholic beverage or food, you know it has to be bad! The service was shockingly awful. Our waitress did not explain the menu, and the complete lack of information architecture wasn't helping either (graphic design nerd comment). What she did explain was that even the fries (one of 2-3 "vegetarian" items on the menu were fried in animal fat). She also suggested a $30 beer when the $12 beer I was considering was unavailable. Saddest of all- the food isn't even worth mentioning! It did nothing to help the situation. No one in my group was satisfied with what they got, and you can bet we didn't stick around for dessert. I certainly like the idea of the place, but absolutely everything fell short for me. I won't be going back.
