Went there at lunch time on a Tuesday. Paid $20 for a Pepito sandwich and a 12 ounce beer (bottle). The wait was 15 minutes. There is no take out, you have to wait for a table. At the table I was asked by the hostess if they could seat a stranger at our table of six. We had 5 people so I said no. She told the people waiting that I said no. The sandwich was mediocre, it tasted like an Italian beef but it was mostly bread. The bread was crunchy. On the plus side, they asked my friend if she had a food allergy because she asked for no beans. They made sure to accomodate her. They also provide free sparkling water while you wait.
