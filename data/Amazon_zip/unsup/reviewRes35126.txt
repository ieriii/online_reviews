Second visit to Shaw's Crab House for brunch this year. 2011 has been good to me. I like to start with the breakfast items, the mini waffles and omelets to order make a great breakfast. Then I move onto the cold foods because I am a shrimp lover and a pasta lover and you can find both on the cold bar. Then because the word Brunch ends in lunch, I end with the hot buffet. Carving station with horseradish and crab cakes now that's my idea of lunch. I am not a big dessert guy but since the desserts are small I manage to choke down a few. Overall I have probably now taken in the caloric intake of some entire villages.  Time for a nap.
