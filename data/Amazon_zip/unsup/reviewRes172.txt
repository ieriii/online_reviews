Best meal I've ever had in my life. Each of the 20 courses were innovative and thoughtful, perfectly executed. I felt like a child, receiving each course like a surprise birthday gift. You all will not be able to choose your dishes and the element of surprise is so delightful that I'm not going to reveal any of them. Just enjoy true artistry.
