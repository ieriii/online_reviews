I forget which number I had during my single visit here; it had meatball, tripe, regular beef (maybe flank...). The meet was delicious. The broth was OK-good at first, but condimentation made it pop a bit more. The noodles were fine in texture but something was just slightly lacking in them flavor-wise: good, but not great. Service was quick and friendly. I would definitely come here again; it was a good bowl of pho at a good price. It is much better than some of the "only pho in town" spots I've eaten in small cities of the Midwest. But the broth and noodles were just a touch ordinary compared to some my favorite high-volume pho places in Seattle, Twin Cities, and other medium-large cities. The meat, though, stood out. I'm wavering between 3 and 4 stars, but I'm biased upwards because I don't currently have access to a place that pumps out a lot of pho, haven't had anything better in half a year, and love getting down to business eating pho in a place like this. On the other hand, not everyone comes here for pho, and I think the non-Asian strangers with whom I shared a table were looking at me sideways as I quietly slurped my noodles; maybe I gave them a spray of broth accidentally.
