I have to thank this place for humbling me. I had decided to check this place out because my usual wicker park cafe (Lovely Bakery) was becoming a bit.. pretentious. Or at least that's what I thought. But Alliance.. they take pretentious to a level I'd never experienced before. As harsh as this sounds, I think of all the coffee shops I've ever visited in Chicago, it is here at Alliance where I received the worst service ever. And let me tell you, I've been to A LOT of coffee shops in the 5 years that I've lived in Chicago. A lot. I'm not even going to write about the specific incident that made me decide to never return here. It's not even worth the effort to write anything more than I am already. Yes, the pastries and coffee are good but they don't stand out. Go to Lovely Bakery or Just Indulge down the street. Their bakeries taste the same if not better. Alliance's baked goods are pretty small too. So if you're a bang for the buck type of person, I'd stay away. And if it's about the distance and you're looking for a cafe/bakery within walking distance, check out the Starbucks across the street... The place is messy. There is never an actual line. It's just a free for all. When it's busy, it's HORRIBLE. And the employees. They actually complain about not only their job and their stupid lives, but about you and how much they hate you in front of your face. Very classy Alliance..very..classy. I just don't think it's worth supporting a business that treats their customers like crap. It's really not worth it. Bad service, ok baked goods but extremely expensive.. just.. don't bother.
