Very huge assortment of unique burgers that were fully customizable. You want a turkey patty? Sure! Vegetarian? No prob. Feel like chicken? Chicken burger it is! Their cheese fries are freakin' awesome. I want to steal the recipe of their cheese sauce and dip everything in it. And their pork sliders... ohmigah. I LOVE their pork sliders! I ordered a turkey burger topped with a fried egg, kimchi, cheese, and bacon with a Ceasar salad as my side. Side note: I love that they serve burgers on a pretzel bun. At the time, I thought my turkey burger was just okay. I asked for my patty medium, but it was a bit closer to medium rare. And the kimchi on the burger was kinda warm, which is perfectly understandable since it was on the hot patty. But I like my kimchi cold straight from the fridge! Since I was so full from the cheese fries and pork sliders, I ended up doggy-bagging this sucker for lunch the next day. I ended up taking the kimchi off when I warmed the burger in a toaster oven, then put it back on so it stayed cold against the nuked burger. OMG, the burger was SO good! Am I the only person who thinks burgers taste better nuked the next day for some odd reason? Well, it does! And the Ceasar salad didn't go soggy either! YES. So I give this place 4 stars because I'd definitely come back to this place and take my burger to go so I can enjoy it nuked the next day. :P I'll stick with the pork sliders and cheese fries for my meal there.
