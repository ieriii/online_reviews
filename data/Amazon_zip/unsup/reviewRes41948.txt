This past Saturday was a very special occasion for my husband and I. We always choose to spend our special days/Nights at Ruth's Chris Chicago do to the fact that we always feel very special when we are there. Though, our most recent experience had to be the absolute BEST! The Hostess Erica greeted us with a warm hello as soon as we escaped the frigid weather. She was refreshing and ready to assist. While I was checking my coat my husband informed Erica of our special day, with a warm response she said "I have just the table for you, it's actually my favorite!" She sat us immediately (15 minutes before our reservation) and sent us on our way. Assuming she says this to all the guests, I quickly changed my tune upon arrival to the table. It was right underneath the stairs, quiet, romantic and above all, PERFECT! I can't believe we have been eating here for all these years and have never had the opportunity to discover this table. Erica really knows a thing or two and really set the bar high for the rest of our night. The food and service never fail to impress. Although may go unnoticed due to expectations. What a great night! We are so pleased to go back!
