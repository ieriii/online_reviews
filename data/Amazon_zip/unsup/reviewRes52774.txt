i used to be in here like every other week. every time i drive by, it looks busy. the food is good, atmosphere is cool, but they always seem to play the same movie in the back. the passion tea is that ish. its a cuban place, so lots of meat, they have choices for the veggie's too. avocado salad is no joke. i wish they had veg tamales. its BYOB, so you can make mojitos to your strength. tostones are mi favorita, try it with black beans.
