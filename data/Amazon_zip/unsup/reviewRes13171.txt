We were seated in about 20 minutes. I liked the woman in the tight red spandex who's on cables that grab wine bottles over a 2-story stocked shelf behind a glass case. The food itself was not that great. It seemed as if the quality of the meat was quite poor, and even if you turned over your card for green, as in "YES" for meat, the meat guys don't even pay attention and pass you on by. Hmph. Our server, Richard, was barely checking up on us - I had to wave down another server to get me some steak sauce (which took quite a while). When our server came by and the request was made, he let us know that they don't have steak sauces anymore - um, okay. And then a few minutes later, he comes back with a little pitcher and said he found some. Kind of confusing, but at least I got my sauce. The salad bar was not that impressive, and some of the dishes off to the side were dimly lit, so you could be a bit apprehensive in trying them out, not knowing how the food looked like.  Towards the end, Richard saw how we downed those sauteed bananas, and he replaced them quite well (that's the 1 star). However, the value of this place (about $45 without tip per person) is quite horrifying - you can go to Brazzaz when they have a lunch special for just under $20 for the same thing (better service with a better salad bar), or use this dinner money and go to Fogo de Chao which is a bit more cleaner and classier. Parking can be done about 2-3 blocks away, metered.
