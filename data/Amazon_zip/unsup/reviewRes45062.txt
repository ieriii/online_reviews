3.75 stars. Can't do half stars (or quarter stars) on here. We took my parents here on their bi-yearly visit...our first time around our waiter was kind of a jerk and we had a meh time, but since the reviews of Anteprima have improved we gave it another go. Right off the bat, they kind of pissed me off. I had a res at 7, but they said the table wouldn't be ready for 15 minutes. Well, you know, that's why I make a reservation....so we don't have to wait. If Anteprima had a bar inside I wouldn't have minded so much, but we had to go next door to Acre (there's nowhere to stand in Anteprima). What made the situation a little better is that since Anteprima owns Acre, we could carry our drinks back from Acre to Anteprima (so we didn't have to slam our beers...yay). But still. The res starting late got a bit of an eyebrow raise from me, but it wasn't a dealbreaker. Especially after I had a beer. Ha. Our waitress was really nice. She kept our drinks full and brought us delicious breads and olive oil. I ordered the polenta app (on greens and tomatoes) and a ricotta gnocchi with an arugula pesto with sundried tomatoes. The polenta was kind of blah, it wasn't terribly flavorful....which is really unfortunate, since I LOVE a good polenta (Terragusto is pro at this). However, the gnocchi was freaking awesome. I was so full I couldn't eat it all, but I wish I could have eaten more. It was cheezy, salty, arugula-y (my favorite type of greens) and delicious. We didn't have any room for dessert, but everyone enjoyed their meals and had a good time.
