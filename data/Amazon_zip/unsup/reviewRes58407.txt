All I can say is WOW!!!!!!!!!!! This has easily moved up as my favorite restaurant in Chicago.....service was like no other i have received; the chef came by our table to make sure we were enjoying our meal and so did the owner. The patio was a beautiful escape from the otherwise non-scenic Halsted st; lets just say they lived up to their name, this place was really a little dream :)
