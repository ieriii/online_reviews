A good friend was hosting an event in the new upstairs event space and I was very excited to visit Sunda for the first time. Throughout the event there were a few appetizers brought around and they were so good. So good in fact that a few friends and myself decided to stay for dinner. The food was really good and not priced bad at all. I am somewhat obsessed with Escolar and could eat it daily so I got that and Organic Miso Soup w/Crab. It was all so good. I think this was by far the best Escolar I have gotten. It was so buttery and delicious!! I look forward to coming back!!
