wanna feel rushed? eat here! it was 10am on saturday morning... my friend and I met up after not seeing each other for a couple of months... we sat down and started to catch up... right away, our waitress asked us if we wanted something to drink.. we both got coffee... not even 2 minutes later, we had our coffee and was asked for our food order (we didn't even glance at the menu yet)... by the third time she asked... we decided to hurry up and figure out our order... she comes back and we are just about ready, not quite, but order anyways, since we sense her annoyance. We get our food maybe about 15 mins later. I had ordered a variation of eggs benedict with mushrooms and beef. I had requested the beef to be cooked at medium.... it was well. not even pink in the center... super tough and hard to cut through. On top of that, we were given our check after 2 bites of our meal... and after our plates were taken away, we were harassed by 3 different people (1 person twice) 4 times checking on us... basically giving us huge hints that they were ready to turn over the table for more customers. The food was okay. (i didn't even finish my potatoes cos they were sub par... and that's coming from someone who almost always finishes everything on her plate)... I was not impressed with the food nor the service. So much for a nice relaxing brunch with a friend I wanted to catch up with!
