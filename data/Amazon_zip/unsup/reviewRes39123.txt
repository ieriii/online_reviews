FLAVORFUL, AND PLEASANTLY RUDE. It takes a lot of guts to attempt to run a place that puts burning hardwood charcoal within reach of the general public. It takes even more guts to also make sonju, and big ass bottles of beer available while you're playing with fire. I personally enjoy the rudeness very much and prefer it over insincerity. Their BBQ meat is the most flavorful, tasty shit around. The panchan (banchan?) -Most generous!!! It seems like 25+ little dishes spilling over the edge of the table...crazy yummy -all of them...tasty as all get out. I am never ashamed to waddle home smelling like beer, garlic, smoke and kimchi. "You been here too long, time to go!"  Hell yeah! I love this place. Food and EVERYTHING ROCKS. +1 star for authentic rudeness.
