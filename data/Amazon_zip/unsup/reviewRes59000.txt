Great food! Great atomosphere! Great Experience!I went with a group of six, and it was surprisingly cheaper than expected, especially after sharing 4 bottles of wine. The food was delicious, our server was great, and we really enjoyed ourselves. I plan on going back sometime soon, with my roommates in tow. It is definitely worth checking out!
