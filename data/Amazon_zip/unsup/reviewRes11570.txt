One of my favorite places to drink and eat. They've got great pizza with a very large variety of toppings and a sports bar like atmosphere. Their beer (Cameltoe, Captain Kick-Ass, Dysfunctionale and Wingnut are my fav) is some of the best I've ever tasted, and the 64oz take home growler for $16 ($12 for refill) is pretty sweet. The Sunday take-out large pie and growler for $25 is also a great deal. Only downside is that it gets incredibly busy around dinner time (because yes, it is that good) and the Thursday/Saturday live band karaoke gets kind of annoying (just my opinion).
