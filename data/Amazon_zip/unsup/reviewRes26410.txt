Based on the food alone it was a 4 and probably one of the better tapas in the city. However, the prices were way too high. After 100 dollars of tapas and sangria, I was still hungry. I had to keep ordering. Three 2x1 inch raviolis for $9...Really, really?! Otherwise the space is pretty cool with a view of the park. I would rec. grabbing a high top in the rather large bar like area, ordering a pitcher of sangria and just a couple of tapas, and enjoy the view out the huge windows. Don't go for dinner. It's a little touristy with the prices to match
