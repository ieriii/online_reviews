This is our favorite steakhouse in Chicago from all the ones we have been to! We have never been disappointed with either the food or the service! I have to rave about the service in particular...I believe it is the best service we have gotten ANYWHERE! Period! And the food...AMAZING! We have tried a bunch of things of the menu...for appetizers we have tried the stuffed mushrooms and the crab cakes, both were excellent! Entrees we have tried include, filet, ribeye, lamb chops and one time I tried a special which had filet chunks and grilled shrimp. Everything, again, was delicious! The sides we've had are the au gratin potatoes, mashed potatoes and mushrooms (which were just okay). But the potatoes were yummy! I don't even think we have ever gotten a dessert from here because we were too full from everything else! A definite must try!
