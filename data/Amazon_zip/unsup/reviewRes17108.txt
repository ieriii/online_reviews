I could be one of the rare few that appreciates a place that has a "no cellphone policy". I felt comfortable and completely engaged in my conversation with whomever I have graced Violet Hour with. A great place to take a date, family, or co-workers you would like to impress for a nightcap. The ambiance is low lit, contemporary, and intimate.Trust your mixologist, you are in great hands.
