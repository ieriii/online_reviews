Went to Tru with some friends (including Elisa O.) recently. I was super excited to go back but the dinner was a really big miss. First and foremost the dinner took nearly 4 hours! for the 6 course menu. So technically we got super bored and hungry! They apologized etc and gave us some truffles at the end - which btw where super delicious - but what can you do, the experience was marred. Second the food was rather good, I did not like the halibut, the chicken was not really interesting (though I liked the presentation). The caviar is awesome and I was happy to have it again, dessert was great too. The ham pasta with a fancy name tasted like ham pasta, it was good but kinda rustic. Ok and then there was the sake. First we paid $50 for a very small bottle of sake that costs $11 online. It was good, but wtf?? 400% mark up? That's ridiculous. The second bottle which was less crazily marked up just tasted like white wine... not what you want when you order sake... My friends were disappointed and me too. Would have rather spent my $180 somewhere else! Oh I was forgetting, a staff member explained to me what fish utensils were, because I was saying the fork looked weird. I know what fish utensils are thanks very much, the fork just had a really weird shape... last time I went they explained to us what a prix fixe menu was... It's not because we are under 30 that we are ignorant... The monkey was a little ridiculous too...
