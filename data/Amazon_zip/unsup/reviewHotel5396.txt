Stayed at this Hotel Indigo (Gold Coast) during a weekend getaway with friends. Our accommodations could not have been more perfect! Great location, convenient to popular shops, bars and restaurants. Loved the atmosphere and decor. A refreshing change from the typical hotel chain. Clean room and great, attentive service staff. I look forward to our next visit.
