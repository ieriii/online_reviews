Dear Bad Apple, Thanks for allowing my friends and me to patronize your establishment. The service was exceptional, the beer list was endless, and the quality of the burgers was extraordinary. My pals went with the Slow Burn, I chose the BLT & BC burger. We each ordered different toppings for our fries so we could sample a few flavors: truffle, Old Bay, and firecracker. All were quite good. The peeps at the table next to ours ordered the garlic fries and they smelled divine, so I will be trying those on a future visit. Your pickle martini was all I hoped it would be, and your inclusion of O'Fallon Wheach on the beer list made my night. Pardon me while I wipe the drool from my face and keyboard while I write this. Kuma's has NOTHING on you - NOTHING!!! I can't wait to return to the warmth of your arms, Bad Apple. Will you be my lover? Love, Me
