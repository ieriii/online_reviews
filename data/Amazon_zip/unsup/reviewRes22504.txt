My GF and I decided to give this place a try since we were from out of town and heard good things about this place. We ordered through the drive thru only to come up to a Sonic style ordering process. Nonetheless, we both ordered hot dogs with fries. The buns were steamed and had poppy seed coated on the top. Not really a fan of poppy seed, but won't even notice they're there. The hot dog had a nice snap to it with each successive bight. And the fries were of crinkle cut variety and they were cooked in a way that left them really crispy on the outside and warm and soft on the inside. All in all, this is a place to visit if you are craving a hot dog.
