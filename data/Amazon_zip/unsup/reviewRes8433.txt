I am a huge fan of red meat, so it's always a treat to come here. I think the meat is good, but not as good as Brazzaz. However, their salad bar is better. The service is generally really good and everyone is pretty attentive. One thing to be mindful of is that even though they take reservations, you still end up waiting.
