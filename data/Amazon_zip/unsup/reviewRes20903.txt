I LOVE this place! This is one of my favorite places ever! The combination of the atmosphere, food and service gives this place a true 5 star rating! I have been here 8 times in the past year and it has been fantastic each and every time! This place is so wonderful that once I brought a potential new boy there and after being there for 5 minutes he was instantly way more appealing and attractive than his normal self. The bottle wine selection is lovely and the wine by the glass selection is delicious. My perfect dinner here consists of the wonderful, brie-blessed fondue and splitting the fish and chips.
