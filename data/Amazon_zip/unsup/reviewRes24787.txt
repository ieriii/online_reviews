This place is oh so good. I had the potato tacos; my palate hadn't been that satisfied in months. The guacamole and beans complimented the crispy tacos, that were more like tacitos. Fried plantain is the best treat to end the meal on. My partner had the tilapia, which was delicious as well. We washed everything down with an oatmeal shake (soy), and it was one of the best dinners I've had in the neighborhood. Very affordable too!
