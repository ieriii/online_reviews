Oh " Keira Knightley" (formerly the Jennifer Garner and the Britney Spears) the unspeakable things I would love to do to you right now... Hot Doug's is probably the best Hot Dog joint I have ever ate at. I first heard about this place on the Food Network and decided to check it out while I was in Chicago. I read horror stories of 2 hour waits, so I decided to get there by 10:30 am. To my surprise, there was still a 45 minute wait in the cold, winter day of Chicago, but it was worth it. My fianc and I ordered 3 different hot dogs between the 2 of use and shared an order of the duck fat fries with the other couple we were with. I forget what we ordered, but the dogs were delicious. They serve the standard Chicago-style hot dog or for the more adventurous they have exotic hot dogs made of other animals and fancy cheeses. I also like how the owner has a sense of humor of naming his creations after celebrities. This is a definitely a hot spot of newbies in Chicago. Highly recommend! A little about my credentials: I first got into cooking & food when I was in college. After being rejected by numerous girls and getting zero action, I decided it was time for a change. I needed a new makeover to boost my geeky, engineering image. I applied for a cooking position at a Mediterranean-Italian Restaurant near my home and learned to cook all sorts of pastas and dishes. I never became a professional chef, but I continue to enjoy & love food. 8 years later and 55 lbs heavier, I am now an engineer that travels all over the world trying new foods and learning about different cultures.
