This review can not possibly add anything significant to the Yelp/Hopleaf discourse as everything great about this place(and everything really is fantastic) has been said. The superb food(you must try the Belgium style mussels!), splendid beer selection, timely service and friendly staff has all helped to ferment an unrelenting love in my heart for the Hopleaf. If only it was located in Logan Square...but its well worth the trip!
