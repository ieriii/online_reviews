I went to Piece for the first time this weekend and wouldn't say I was happy with my experience. The pizza was alright, but nothing impressive. The worst part was trying to get in. I knew there would be a wait and 1 hour and 15 min seemed worth it, but when we got to the two hour mark and watched our friends with a bigger party who came an hour after us get seated first, I started getting frustrated. With all of the great pizza options in Chicago, I probably won't be heading back to Piece any time soon.
