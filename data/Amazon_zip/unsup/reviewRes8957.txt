Had a long day at work, and considering the day went swiftly well, I did NOT want to cook after driving back from Schaumburg (I live in the City). This commute took me in the Kedzie & Lawrence area, and I was yearning some serious Persian / Mediterranean food for dinner. Came home, logged on to Chub Hub and ordered from this authentic Persian restaurant. Hummus...very tasty. Chicken/Steak Kababs...very juicy and tender. The rice was great. The Lamb stew...nothing I have had before, but it was very good. Oh, and the food came with TONS of bread and rice, along with condiments and cheese that went great with the meal. I may have to venture to this place some day to check it out in person! The food was outstanding!
