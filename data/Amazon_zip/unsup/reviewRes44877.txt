I dont know much about the deep-dish but the pizza from this place was really good. Front desk from our hotel told us that its better to order and pick up, cause it gets pretty packed and crazy in there and so we did. The pizza was very fresh, ton of cheese and the dough was just so good. Cheesy garlic bread was ok.
