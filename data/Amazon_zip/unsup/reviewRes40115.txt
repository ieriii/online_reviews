pretty damn good. the service was not up to my standards but honestly who cares if the food is as fantastic as this place. the risotto under the chicken was to die for and the ravioli steak and egg was creative and awesome. im pretty sure we had about 4 of the 5 desserts on the menu (fat) and they were all phenomenal as well. two thumbs up. oh also -- no reservations. we went at 6pm on a sunday and waited. so go with one other person or be prepared to wait for a bit.
