Very cool. And a local microbrewery. Popcorn, bacon and cheese-- yes, please. What a creatively cholestrolic delicious combination. As with the rest of the nation this place is swept up in IPA craze. IPAs are good but can we diversify justttt a little. Revolution was totally devoid of lagers. Except for bottled. I settled for a Russian Imperial and a Belgian white beer. And speaking of which, Iron Fist, their signature IPA, they were out of the night I was there. There was also some generic, overpriced, 'political' artwork, "Down with the man!" Ok... I guess it's part of the whole 'revolution' schtick.
