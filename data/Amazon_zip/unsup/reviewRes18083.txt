Of course we had a long wait, but it was to be expected given the chef associated with this lunch hot spot. Moreover, I have no problem waiting for a meal, if it is delicious, and XOCO certainly delivered. My girlfriend and I each ordered a torta and shared half so we could try more of the menu on our first visit. I ordered the Cochinita Pibil, which was a beautiful medley of pork, pickled onion, and habenero salsa (served on the side). My torta was absolutely delicious and definitely brought the heat. Midway through my half, I immediately began to regret splitting it with my gf who ordered the Pepito. While the Pepito was good, it did not have the same depth of flavor that the Cochinita had. Furthermore, as one who LOVES spice, the Pepito was lacking in heat. My only gripe with XOCO was the bread. I'm not sure if it is the traditional bread used for tortas, but it cut open the roof of my mouth pretty bad. I've eaten at other torta restaurants that also use a real crusty bread, but XOCO's was definitely the toughest. Would definitely return again, if i am in the area!
