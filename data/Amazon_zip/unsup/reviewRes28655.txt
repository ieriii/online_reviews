Stay away from this apparent Yelp scam (or scam on Yelp?)! The food is gross. There is no reason to eat here when you could just as easily microwave Spaghetti O's from a can. Their garbage might appeal to college freshmen. Maybe. Let's go over the important details: stay away, scam, stay away, scam, gross, scam, gross, stay away,... I've been encouraged to be more descriptive by a Yelper. Here is what I told him: Hi Jack - The ability of The Pasta Bowl to maintain their 4-star rating on Yelp suggests that they are engaging in some form of aggressive rating maintenance (perhaps via emails like the one you sent me). I ordered a fairly standard pasta w/ meat sauce dish, my friend ordered a sandwich, and someone else ordered the Penne Bolognaise. All three were boring and underwhelming. As Yelpers like to say, they were meh, a far cry from what typically earns 4 stars overall. My focus is largely on the sauce. With ingredients like garlic, parsley, onions, peppers, good olive oil, sea salt, etc., sauces have a lot of upside potential. And when restaurants don't take the time to cook them properly, or don't spend the money to gather fresh, high quality ingredients as they should, you can taste it in every disappointing bite. The Pasta Bowl is surely taking advantage of the young and inexperienced eaters of Lincoln Park - that's probably their business model. But Yelpers are usually a little more seasoned on average. There is no way that they all love the Pasta Bowl's mediocre efforts as much as the 4-star rating indicates. My fiance just piped in: "It was worse than meh, it was disgusting.'
