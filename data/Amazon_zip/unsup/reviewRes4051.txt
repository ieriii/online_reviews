Inventive combinations, elite quality ingredients, searing culinary focus, entertaining and informative staff. We had a HORRIBLE table in the corner, under a speaker next to a HORRIFIC table of loud and sloppy drunks shrilling all night. I brought a case of Peroni for the kitchen, which didn't get me any special treatment. The food was worth the price, the cheap decor and noise level was more harangue than Mr. Beef.
