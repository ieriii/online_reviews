Violet Hour has a lot of really delicious cocktails. It's not cheap, but the cocktails are fantastic. However, they also have kind of pretentious and slow wait staff. It's just kinda douchey and lame in that sense. I'd rather grab drinks at any of the other great mixology places - Sable, Gilt, etc. - but I don't protest too much when I go to Violet Hour once or twice per year.
