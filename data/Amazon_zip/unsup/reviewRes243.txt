I've only been to Alinea once, so I can't give an all-encompassing take, but I will definitely be going back at some point, despite the 800 dollarish tab for two. Without spoiling anything, Alinea was full of unexpected twists and turns from before we even found our way inside. While the restaurant provides a novel approach, full of science-meets-cooking gastronomy, the distinct flavors have the substance to ensure that the experience is not gimmicky. Alinea has a vast wine list that is filled with treasures that are surprisingly (relatively!) reasonably priced at a fraction of the markup of many high end restaurants. Sadly, though, unless you're dining with a big party, it's pretty impracticable to limit yourself to a single full bottle for a meal that covers the entire spectrum of familiar flavors (plus some that are totally new to even well experienced first-timers.) We instead opted for the wine pairings which included about 12 half-glasses for the Tour menu and incorporated a few familiar and many obscure varietals. However, at least on this particular occasion, neither of us felt like the pairings were truly on, and got the impression that a lot of the wines were selected more for their gross margins than their compatibility.
