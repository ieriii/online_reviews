This pizza is ok. It's not the best, but when you can get a Lou Malnati's deep dish for 10 bucks that's twice as filling, why go here? Oh, that's right...the bar. They have a bar and if you happen to walk in, you might get run over by a stampede of smoking 20 somethings hanging out on the corner or getting out of cars. Overall, apart from the price, this pizza isn't too bad, I just think it's overpriced. The pizza place next door that features new york style pizza offers more for the money (though that place is expensive as well, but the new york style pizza is authentic). Piece's claim to fame is that it's a Connecticut style pizza from New Haven, I think. So if you've ever wondered what east coast pizza is like, you have two options almost right next to each other. If you're not in the mood for pizza, then my recommendations are to head down to Division and try either Smoke Daddy or Picante - two of the best restaurants in this area. If you're looking for dessert, there's a cold stone creamery directly across from Piece.
