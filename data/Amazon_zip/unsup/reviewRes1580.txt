- outrageously delicious sausage - friendly and helpful staff - short line on rainy days - free refills on fountain soda - not inexpensive I finally made it to Hot Doug's. It definitely lived up to the hype and since it was rainy, the line wasn't long. I had the Saucisson Alsacienne and duck fat fries. Loved the sausage, liked the fries (too much hype?). Also, go with a friend if you want fries, there are way too many for one person and it will cut the price.
