I have only had the mussels and they are great and more than enough.The fries are awesome and extra good because I always forget they come with the mussels!Unhappily, I don't care much for most of their beers, I'm not a big Belgian beer fan. There's one I like but I can never remember which one.But I love this place! Its a great joint to have a pre-drinking drinking snack.
