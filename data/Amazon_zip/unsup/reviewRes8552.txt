I must have gone on an off-night, because my bufalina pizza was pretty soggy, as if they poured the entire carton of buffalo mozzarella on top--water and all. We waited about 20 minutes, while we were served samples. That was a nice touch, but they really do try to get you in and out of here, so don't plan on lingering at your table.
