You won't find tourists or suburban folks at Sabatino's. This is a neighborhood place that is hugely popular with locals. There is always a wait and the bar is always crowded with folks waiting to be seated in one of the three dining rooms. Locals flock to Sabatino's because the food is excellent. From the appetizers, soups, salads, main course and desserts, there are few Italian restaurants as good and as consistent as Sabatino's. Wait staff is not always so good. I've been here and felt like my waiter had something better to do than earn his tip. Though on my most recent trip, I had excellent service. Also, the tables are close together and the place is crowded. So if you are stuck in one of the tables where the two main rooms meet, you are in for an uncomfortable evening. On my most recent visit, we started with pizza bread and bruschetta, both were very good. I had the pumpkin bisque soup which was awesome. For main course, I had flounder smothered in garlic and stuffed with crab meat and shrimp -- it was oh, so good. Overall, my most recent dining experience at Sabatino's was excellent and I highly recommend this restaurant. Main drawback here is the wait. I hate waiting for tables and you are in for a 45 minute to an hour wait if you hit Sabatino's on the weekend. The wait is also tough on kids. Big plus is parking. Few Chicago restaurants have a parking lot and Sabatino's is one of these few.
