Went here with a group for my birthday... the Peking Duck was the draw and it didn't disappoint, scrumptious! However, what was a little disconcerting was the slightly greasy feel underfoot. This plus the fact that the place was closed down in Nov 2010 by the Dept of Public Health due to failing a surprise inspection made me feel uneasy. The Peking duck was good, but it makes you wonder... not an easy one to score.
