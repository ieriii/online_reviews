The Bongo Room rocked my socks off! The wait for a table (and the food once we ordered) was minimal, the atmosphere was laid back, the service was OUTSTANDING, and the price was warranted. My waitress was awesome! I couldn't decide between two of the pancakes, and since you get a total of 2 pancakes as your entree', she offered to bring me one of each without me asking. *Brownie points!!* So I got to enjoy the orange ricotta pancakes AND the lemon berry pancakes for the price of one...I had died and gone to heaven. They were both equally delicious, creative, and overly generous on the portion. As the Terminator says, I'll be back!!!
