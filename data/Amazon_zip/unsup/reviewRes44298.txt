The lovely Kellie K. got me a brownie from here last week to fix a bad day. It definitely did the trick. Today I find myself sitting in the Alliance Bakery 'computer lab' searching for jobs, sipping coffee, and mowing-down a cheesecake brownie. My roommate said she once got food poisoning from eating here but I don't care; I am trying to lose weight before swimsuit season and there is nothing like a week of diarrhea to get me into a smaller size. The brownie was awesome. The coffee is piping hot and the internet is fast and free. Plus, there are enough hottie dirrrty boys in here to keep me from being bored. I expect to have to continue searching for jobs until my balls drop or for the next 20 years, whichever comes first. For that reason, I will be back here when I need a change of pace from my home internet and crappy homemade baked goods. I took one star off because the music in here makes me want to slit my wrists.
