Ugh, I agree, seriously overrated. I tried this place last weekend for the first time. I suggest they learn how to make regular pancakes right before they drown the bad pancakes in way too much chocolate and cream. If you love Orange's ambitious pancake flights, don't be fooled into thinking this is similar. I was totally disappointed, as was my unadventurous boyfriend, whose bacon and eggs were not great either. One last note to the host - what is your problem? I know you're standing by the freezing cold door all morning, but don't take it out on every person to walk through the door!
