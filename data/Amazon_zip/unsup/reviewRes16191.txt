Beautifully simple. What a concept...spend time on the cocktails and they will be delicious and creative. I have wanted to come here for months for the pure culinary experience of the drinks, I was not disappointed. Being in the industry I also appreciate the beautiful menu design and layout, as well as the staffs attire. Next time I must sit at the bar to learn a bit... And for $12 a cocktail, I would say that is more than fair for the time and effort - I've spent more for a vodka cranberry. If you are into gin, you must try the juliet and romeo
