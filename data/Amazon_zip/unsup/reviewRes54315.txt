Hands down the best Chicago style pizza around!! The pizza sauce is so perfectly seasoned it makes you want to ask for extra so you can smother your slice with it - Yes I am guilty of always asking for extra sauce. As for the dough - Finally!! You can eat a Chicago style pizza without feeling like you are eating a loaf of bread!! Highly Highly recommend.This review would get five stars if it weren't for their lack of service.
