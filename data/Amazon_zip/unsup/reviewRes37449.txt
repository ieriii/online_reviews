Hopleaf never ceases to amaze me. Its wide range of beer and its delectable selection of food are top-notch. And you never get tired of the menu as they frequently change the entries. Unfortunately, that also means they've long removed my favorite Pork Chop with Applesauce entree. If you have not been here before, it's worth the trek. Because it is a bar and restaurant, you may have to wait quite a while to eat for big groups during busy hours. But it's scrumptious.
