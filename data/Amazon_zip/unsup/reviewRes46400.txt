Food here is really good and they give you so much that you will have enough leftover for another meal later. Prices aren't bad considering the amount of food. They have a combination appetizer which is good if you have a group of 4 because it's pretty much a sample of every appetizer on the menu. Waitress was a little on the slow side but she was new so I guess I can give her a little break on that. Atmosphere was nice and restuarant seemed very well run.
