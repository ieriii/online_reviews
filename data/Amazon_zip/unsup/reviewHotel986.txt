Note to self: When planning a last minute trip to Chicago, don't choose a weekend when 60,000 doctors are in town for a medical convention. For a quick family trip (my mom, dad and brother), we decided to head to Chicago to visit old friends. Unfortunately, because of the convention, every last hotel room in the city was booked. Finally, we were able to find one last room at the Amalfi Hotel. As a 20 something, the prospect of sharing one hotel room with my parents and my younger brother was frightening. Fortunately, the Amalfi made it an amazing experience. The room was spacious enough with it's 2 queen sized beds and large bathroom to accomodate us and our stuff. Upon check in the concierge remembered my mother from their phone conversation a few days prior and was so sweet, friendly and helpful. She gave us great recommendations for places to go for dinner and drinks which really made the trip all the more worthwhile. One of the best perks is the free happy hour from 5:30-7pm every night. They served tons of antipasti appetizers - cheeses, breads, olives, bruschetta, etc. They also had a bartender making any drink you wished. The complimentary breakfast was great too! They had one on every floor and served standard croissants, bagels, yogurt etc. The gym was also great - plenty of cardio equipment, free weights, and fun movies playing on the tv to keep you entertained. The location was great too, which a few bars and restaurants within a few blocks and the Magnificent Mile a few blocks more. This hotel had everything you needed and wanted for a place to stay in Chicago and great staff and amenities to make the trip even more pleasant. It's more of a boutique-y hotel then say, a giant Hyatt, but for me, that was exactly what I wanted. Thank you medical convention for forcing me to stay at what is now one my favorite hotels!
