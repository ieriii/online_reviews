So I was at Q this Saturday night for a friends birthday. We had an 11 person reservation for 9 pm. I arrived at 8:45 so I could set up the table for the bday girl. It was obvious that they were crowded and overbooked. We ended up not being seated until 9:30 pm. We were asking the hosts for updates on timing when the manager decided to lie to us and tell us that they were running 15 mins late and our reservation was at 9:15 not at 9:30. This was a complete lie as I even looked over his shoulder and saw that it said 9 pm. Finally we were seated with no apology, no complimentary appetizer for our delay but fine, I let it. Then our waiter was completely overwhelmed and took about 20 minute to even get our drinks. I will say that the food is great which is I gave them 3 stars but their customer service in no better then 1 star.
