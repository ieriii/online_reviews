The restaurant is absolutely gorgeous and the food is usually very good. Nonetheless, I feel as though it is over-priced for what you actually get. I went for dinner with a friend and we got two entrees and one appetizer (no drinks) and the bill was close to $80(plus tip), somehow! I think that in this economy, it's important to at least make places a bit more affordable...or at least give better portions.
