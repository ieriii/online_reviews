The Food = yummy. I always find that whatever I order tastes amazing. The owner seems to want to ensure you have a great time here, he even brings around this straw with some sort of crazy Romanian liquor for you to take shots from (major germ factor-ICK! I'm hoping the alcohol kills the cooties from everyone else sucking on the same nasty straw!) Music = Scam. I know many musicians who have played at the Bucharest, and the owner pretty much under pays each time. He also passes out envelopes to all the diners for tip money for the band - where the envelope clearly states the money will go directly to the musicians. Guess what? He pockets it! Nutty.
