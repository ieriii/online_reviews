dined in the other nite with some friends and their baby, previously had gotten takeout. this experience was very nice, pretty white lights on their little covered outdoor patio seating area was nice. BYOB always a plus, not crazy about drinking vino out of a plastic cup, but whatev, i understand the situation i guess. and don't get me started on henry, OH HENRY, what service you provided. need more chips? need recommendations? we asked for guac, he asked mild, hot? we waffled, he said, don't worry, i'll make it happen. i was goin back n forth between steak and tilapia, told him to make my decision for me. he gauged the temperature to be a bit on the more humid side, so he felt the tilapia was the better route to go. tilapia was great, girlfriend's ceviche was average. this watermelon shake concoction was really delicious. my buddy ordered one and let us all have a taste, and my gf got one to go. henry (of course) packed up her ceviche leftovers and threw in some extra chips to go, henry's tip fell somewhere between 25 and 30%, he was that good. overall a very nice experience, they run a pretty good operation over there with carryout and delivery too. think i saw three or four delivery people workin on friday nite. reasonable prices, good food, friendly staff. i'll be back.
