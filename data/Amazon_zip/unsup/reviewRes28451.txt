I feel like I don't have enough information, having only had brunch at Frontera Grill. However, I've heard a lot about this place for a while, and I wasn't disappointed.  Great guacamole, and fresh chips, lots of chips, and great salsas. I especially liked the green one (tomatillo?). I had a pozole soup with a poached egg. It was spicy, and rich, with shredded pork, hominy and shredded cabbage to garnish. I was really hungry, and could have had a larger portion, so kept eating the chips. Something I would regret later. Overall, it is a rather pricey Mexican restaurant, but the quality of the dishes are good, and the service lends a more upscale feel. I would be interested in trying dinner at some point.
