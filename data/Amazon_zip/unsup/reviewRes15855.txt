Violet Hour does what it sets out to do with near flawless precision. A quiet, intimate environment that provides a feeling of privacy for you and your group while still making you feel a part of the space. The drinks are inventive and delicious. Don't be scared off the $11 dollar a drink price tag; these drinks are made for savoring over good conversation. The food menu, while very limited, shares the ingenuity of the drink menu. Small plates and some sandwiches that all display a twist on traditional themes. The space is beautiful, and Violet Hour never contains more people than can be seated. A good spot for a pre/post dinner drink or to just pop in for a random cocktail. This is the kind of gin joint that makes me think Chicago isn't hopelessly behind NY and LA in the culture wars. I will most certainly be there again.
