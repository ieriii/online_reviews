I can't believe after years of driving past this place, I finally got to check it our after my cousin from out of town invited me to meet them. The place is pretty cool....they have their own beers which I usually question all the time, but the first one I tried was very light looking but heavy...I tried a darker beer and it was lighter with more hops. The Pizza was yummy....spinach and goat cheese was the bomb. the sausage pepperoni was a lil salty but fresh. I definitely would like to go back again and try more of the pizzas out and try more of the micro beers also. The guy singing karaoke wasn't bad either. Lots of girls for a Thursday nite. I hear its even more crowded then it was last nite.
