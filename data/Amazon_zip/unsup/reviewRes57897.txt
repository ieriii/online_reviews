What a wonderful surprise. Went to Demera just because we were hungry after a concert at the Riviera and they were close and open. Had only eaten Ethiopian food once, long ago, but I was hungry enough to give it another try and I was not disappointed.We were seated within five minutes despite the flood of patrons coming from the concert. Service was prompt and super nice. Just as we were about to place our drink order, the owner came by with a tray of free samples of the homemade honey wine. It was so good, we ordered a bottle.At his suggestion, we started with some chicken sambussas - crispy, flaky turnovers with a sweet spicy sauce (move over empanadas).We let our server - who was also from Ethiopia - decide the rest. There was lamb and tilapia, lentils and collard greens, some spicy some not.It was all wonderful. Then at the end, another surprise. When they found out we had just come from a concert nearby, they took 5 dollars off of our bill. Some kind of ongoing promotion.We will definitely be back. With friends.
