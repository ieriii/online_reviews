If I had to rate this place on looks, it would get a very high rating from me. It has a very fun atmosphere. Lots of bright vibrant colors. The decor makes me feel like I just left Chicago and entered some fiery hot restaurant in Miami. The food is mediocre. Started with the guacamole. It's your typical guac, nothing special. Something you can make at your home. For dinner, the arrachera. Something about the seasonings were just off. It was so so. I've had much better arrachera at bbqs in the summer. My friend had the jibarito from there which is usually one of my favorite sandwiches but I don't think Carnivale was able to prepare it right. I'd rather pay $6 for it from little Puerto Rico where it tastes delicious. Carnivale has a lot of potential but I think they need to put some work into their dishes.
