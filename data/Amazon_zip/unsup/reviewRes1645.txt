This place has traditionally tracked as one of the greatest hot dog places in Chicago and the world.  Enough people have written reviews but I'm going to throw my two cents in and please don't be offended: If you want a delicious meal be ready to spend a little bit more money. If you can't afford $10 (hahahaha) to $20.00 on an awesome meal and experience don't waste your time coming here. Don't wast your time in line. Just don't go. If you are in a big hurry to get somewhere or do something don't come here. They sell a $2.00 hot dog when I was last here two weeks ago. Don't stand in line for a $2.00 hot dog (and then complain that its just a hot dog)!!!! Its just a goddamn hot dog, what did you expect? If you want hot dogs go to Gene N Judes or parky's or buona or something. This place is not for regular wieners. If you're going to stand in line and its just you order a couple of things you've never tried before off their specials: Duck Foie Gras (I always get one), rattlesnake, crayfish, rabbit, elk etc. If you're with people who can spend money ($10-$20) or are worth spending money on ($10-$20 per person) : share several different items off their specials. Theyre totally delicious. If you're here on Friday or Saturday then get the duck fat fries. They're delicious. Don't waste time. Don't waste money. Do it right.
