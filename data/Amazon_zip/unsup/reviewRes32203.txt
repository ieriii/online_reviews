I like the way the menu is set-up more than the food. I like to eat a variety of foods rather than a single entree, and Demera allows you to mix and match dishes to your heart's content. Each dish is explained with a fair amount of detail and you can order 6 different items to split with 2 people. This way you get to try a wide swathe of the menu with every visit. The food is good, but they take it easy on the spices. It makes sense to keep the food as accessible to a wide range of palates as possible but it makes the food taste kind of plain. It's not bland, but nothing really excites either. Also it's not a lot of food for the money. They're counting on you filling up on bread since you use it to scoop up the food.
