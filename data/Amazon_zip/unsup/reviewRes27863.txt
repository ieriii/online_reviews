I've visited Chicago twice and only for three-day trips both times but I've managed to dine at Frontera Grill four times. I heart this place. My last trip was at the end of September and I was worried that I wouldn't be able to get a table since Rick Bayless recently won Top Chef Masters. Luckily, I was able to score a reservation for the night I arrived. But that's because I called 5 weeks in advance and it was for a Thursday night dinner @ 9:00 p.m.. The food is fantastic - both at dinner and brunch. At dinner, we split a bunch of small plates and all were seasonal, complex, and delicious. Loved the sopes, tortilla soup, and anything with mole sauce. Service was very helpful and friendly. We sat at the bar for brunch and every so often Rick Bayless would pop out of the kitchen and survey the dining room just a few feet away from us. I swear, I did my best Linda Blair imitation that morning, whipping my head around every time I heard the door to the kitchen swing open. Yep, I am a crazy foodie/stalker. I don't love that the tables are packed REALLY close together and you still need to wait at least 30 minutes even with a reservation. That being said, I will still make a beeline here the next time I visit Chicago.
