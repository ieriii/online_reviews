My coworkers and I stopped in here for lunch today. I'd never been here before and I was very excited to try it because i love Mexican food. The chips were great and they brought us 3 different types of salsa. Very tasty. They also brought us a free appetzier, it was like a beef flauta...also delectable. We all had horchata as well and this was some of the best horchata that I have had in Chicago. For my entree, I had the carne asada burrito. It came with a side of rice and the burrito was so large, I was only able to eat half. Good cheap food. Our bill for 4 people was only 36 dollars (including tip). I will be back! The enchiladas look amazing!
