new garcia's = no bueno. ever since they remodeled i keep going back, and everytime i go back , i am disappointed. i think that i am finally done with you, garcia's. the remodel took away the ambiance that garcia's once had. it sounds like a cafeteria. i found myself saying: "what? huh? what did you say?" over and over while eating dinner and attempting conversation with my husband.  they jacked the prices up, removed many of the vegetarian options (i know you can choose to make many mexican dishes vegetarian, but it was so much easier to choose "vegetarian combo 1, 2, 3", etc.). they apparently eliminated the use of tequila in their margaritas. i kept taking sips hoping that it would get better. it never did. the food is halfway decent, but only halfway. it's not enough to bring me back. adios, garcias.
