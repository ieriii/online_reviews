We were so excited to try. Have lived in neighborhood for 10+ yrs. We went for lunch today and had the fried chicken family lunch. Sounded so good. Was so flavorless, well actually one flavor FLOUR. From the home made biscuits, breading on the fried chicken (very crispy not greasy), to the rue in the gravy. Raw uncooked flour! For southern cooking it was flat. Accept for the snicker doodles that finish the meal, we skipped them as they were burnt on the bottom and sides. Another recent reviewer -  (F D.) - put it best - "This was one of the worst examples of southern cooking I've had. The only thing they did superbly was the little cornbread muffins they put on the table." - we wont be going back.
