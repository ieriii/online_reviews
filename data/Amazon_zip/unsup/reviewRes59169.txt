If you blink, you would drive past this place. Located in a very obscure place is the blue glowing sign of Sushi X. Parking is everywhere because..well there just isn't anything else nearby. We parked right in front at meters. Its a small restaurant with a huge project screen of anime, and the lighting is very dim with an atmosphere of a trendy lounge.Two of us ordered 3 maki rolls which was more than enough. Each roll is about 10 or more pieces with each piece being the size of my palm. Ok its not that big, but its big enough that you are embarrassed to put the entire thing in your mouth at once. Good creative rolls, around $12-$15 each. You aren't here for the sashimi, you are here to stuff yourself with good maki rolls till you puke. Come around 6:30-7pm, it started getting busy around 8.- Doug Phillabaum
