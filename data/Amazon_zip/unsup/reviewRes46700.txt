Mmmmmmm..... I really love this place. I never go here as often as I want, but every time I do I find something else to love. The decor is a old 70's feel/wood cabin/ Regal Beagle flavor to it, yet this is not a bad thing. Staff is friendly and they really try and get you seated as quickly as possible. Sometimes when the crowd is packing the place, service can get slightly slow, but nothing agonizing, but I really expect that. Food is just wonderful comfort food. The burgers have that smokey charbroiled flavor, the chili is great, really good salad bar, in fact a lot of things are great.... except the cottage fries. The only other problem I have is figuring out what to order. Although I have heard the margaritas and martinis are great, I've never made it out there when I could get one.... maybe one day. (Sigh)
