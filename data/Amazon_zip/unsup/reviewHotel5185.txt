The single best experience I've ever had at a hotel. The room was in a prime location and was beautifully decorated. The views were fantastic. I got to tour the 39th floor party room where part of The Dark Knight was filmed, which left a lasting impression of beauty and the best city view in Chicago. But the most outstanding thing about this hotel what its incredible staff. They went above and beyond every hotel i've ever stayed in. Most were multilinguial as well. They were so friendly and helpful, it makesbme want to go back again and again. I loved this place so much, anyone looking for an awesome Chicago experience should come here.
