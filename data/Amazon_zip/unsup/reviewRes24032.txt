I LOVE this place! I would say this is a definite local's favorite. Cash Only, but well worth it. They have the best plantans. Having sauces on the table the way they do is what I love. The chips are always warm and delicious. BYOB cannot be beat. It's a small place, so there might be a wait. I say it's well worth it. They also have a couple parking spaces out front. My boyfriend and I have always been able to grab a spot when we've driven there. Their smoothies are also a must if you didn't bring your own booze. I had the tamarind one. YUMMY! Very well priced as well.
