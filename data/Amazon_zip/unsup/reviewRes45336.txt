Ok, I'm a literary person so I completely appreciate the references here in the menu, on the walls, etc. The food is very good, and people rave about the pretzel buns on hamburgers (extra 25 cents, fyi). My lack of stars is for the atmosphere, and I teetered between 3 and 4 stars. It is so fricking loud you can't talk. For example, when friends and I ate here recently, we ended up at a round table. For the love of the witty dinner conversations that haven't yet been born, don't do it! We spent the time screaming over the music and barely being heard. On the up side, it you are forced to not speak with your dinner companions, at least the music selection is good. As a side note, you can opt to have a gluten free bun with your burger, so pluses there.
