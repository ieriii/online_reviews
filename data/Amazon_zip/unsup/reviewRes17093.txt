This was my first time at any kind of speakeasy, and I was pleasantly surprised. We came late Friday night around 1am, and there was no line. We waited a few minutes behind the purple curtain and then we were led in to a cozy little booth. The decor was according to my girlfriend, very "Victorian goth ". And I totally agree. It was packed yet quiet. The darkness contrasted with the fireplace and candles, and the well dressed bartenders looked like vampires in disguise. And finally the drinks. The drinks were delicate and delicious. The egg white was a very different taste I've never had before, but it was good. And the alcohol was strong, but tasty. It was definitely worth the $11 we paid for each drink. I could've stayed here all night. Just chiling out, chatting and trying more drinks, but last call was like at 2. *sigh*
