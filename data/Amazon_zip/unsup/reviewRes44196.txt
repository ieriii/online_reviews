I really wish I could be obsessed with this place since Iive right around the corner but I'm not a bready baked goods type of person so it fails me every time. The cookies are crunchy so if you're into that sort of thing this is your place to go, and their bars are not as gooey and delicious as they look, in fact they are rather dry and bland. It depresses me to be writing this, because like I said if I could just freaking like this bakery my life would be so much simpler. However, the lounge aspect of the bakery is pretty neat. You can pretty much stay in there for however long you'd like and not buy anything and they will never know because its not connected to the bakery. Unfortunately, I like be surrounded by some sort of pleasing design and the lounge is essentially an outdated college cafeteria lounge. Their coffee however is delicious. So if you are walking past and would like a down to Earth simiple coffee than jump on in. Also, their window displays really make me smile. Have I mentioned I would really love to love the baked goods from this place?
