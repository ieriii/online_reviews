A very delightful and intriguing meal. My FI and I came here for valentine's day and had the 8 course prefix menu. Love the complexities of flavors and the details in every course presentation. This restaurant is very intimate - like 10-12tables! There were 2 courses that deserve big time kudos...1 the mushroom salad (it wasn't called a salad but that's what I'm calling it) whoa nelly! It's a bunch of mushrooms, what could they possibly do to mushroom to make them that amazing!...2. abalone! They steamed the abalone for 12hrs. This is my first abalone experience, so I have no abalone history to compare it to, and it was fascinating! I have never eaten anything so texturally unusual and undescribable. My first abalone experience that will be forever the bench mark for all other abalone! can't wait to go back!
