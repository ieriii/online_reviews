Demera has been one of our favorites for quite a while. We went yesterday. As much as it pains me to say this because I have a fondness for the place, everyone in our party of seven (we've all dined there numerous times) was disappointed. The food seems to have diminished in quality and portion size. The doro wat was all sauce with two very small chicken legs. Food cost must be 50 cents for chicken legs that small. The food tasted good, and the service was essentially the same as before. Still, we'll probably take a break for a while and go to one of the other Ethiopian places we also like next time.
