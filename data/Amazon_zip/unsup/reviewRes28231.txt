Went for lunch, and it seemed the menu was basically the same as in Topolobampo at this time. Was pretty full but tables were available, which I'm told is not the case at dinner time. We had the appetizer sampler, of which the epazote Mexico-city style quesadillas (more like cheese empanadas than quesadillas), and the jicama/pineapple/cucumber salad were the standouts. The rest was just ok, i'm not really a fan of Mexican-style ceviche (no coconut milk). The Florida shrimp in mojo entree was really delicious, with celery root 'noodles' that was similar to the jicama salad but very good as well. The mashed potatoes and salad were pretty flavorless and unnecessary in comparison, but the noodles & shrimp made for delicious tacos. Also the tres camotes soup was very interesting twist on typical butternut squash soup with wheatberries and sunchokes giving an interesting and unusual flavor. Unfortunately it wasn't served especially hot on this very cold day in Chicago. But by far the best part of the meal was the dessert. Duo of flans, one was pistachio, the other a vanilla with apricots soaked in brandy really stole the show.  It went great with a cafe de olla, which is coffee with orange zest, cinnamon, cloves & piloncillo (brown sugar). Service was also excellent and helpful. All in all, I cleaned every plate and there were definitely other things on the menu I would like to try.
