I LOVE this place. I have never had a poor experience here. The staff is really nice and the presentation is always fantastic. The food is delicious and fairly priced. I usually cannot eat sushi of any kind but they have a really good mango and avocado roll that I cannot resist. The will also use rice paper by request if you aren't keen on seaweed. I think everyone should go here.
