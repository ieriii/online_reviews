We went to the grand Lux Saturday night and it was a great experience. They sat us down in a timely manner (for a Saturday) and the waiter (I think his name was Thomas) did a great job. The menu tosses a lot at you, but overall picking an item under the subcategory you want makes it easier. I know they are similar to the Cheesecake Factory but I think for being more upscale, the prices were not too bad. It's great for a meal after a day of shopping, but definitely not an every weekend thing.
