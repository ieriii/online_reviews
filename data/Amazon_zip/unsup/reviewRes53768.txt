The poetry slams on Sundays guarantees an awesome time! Every slam is different and original in its own way! At yesterday's they had a band from New Orleans with some members in full Mardi Gras Atire. The decor inside makes you feel like you are stepping back in time into another era. At only $6, this definitely has to be the best value for live entertainment in the city! The Green Mill is a bastion of originality, urban culture, and personality!
