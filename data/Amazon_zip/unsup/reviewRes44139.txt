My fiance ordered a birthday cake for me from here. It's a Funshine birthday cake (Funshine is the yellow Carebear). He sent them an image via email for them to draw on the cake. When we got it the cake, it was so cute! The cake was moist and not too sweet, just the way we like it. I must say that the artwork of Funshine and the sunshines surrounding the cake made the cake so appealing! I love my birthday cake...and I know it costs a lot of money, too. They made my Funshine bear in a fondant.
