I'll be honest - the people who only gave this 1 or 2 stars sound like douche bags that I wouldn't want to hang out with anyway. Does that make me a snob? Perhaps, but this place was fantastic, and the 1 and 2 star-ers would only drag this joint down. That said - we showed up around 10:30 on a Friday and there was a small line. While waiting in line some guy named Joe came outside for a cigarette and we engaged him in conversation. We exchanged some "how is it in there?" "is it worth the wait?" etc. Joe convinced us it was worth the wait, but not to worry - he would get us past the line. And he did. We survived the eye-daggers from the gaggle of Asians that were in line in front of us, but once we were inside and seated at the bar, the eye-daggers were forgotten. I asked the bartender for a recommendation, and he did not disappoint. I wish I could remember the drink - but it was on the whiskey list. I loved how they did not pack people in. There was not loitering or shoving at the bar for service, it seems like they only allow as many patrons as they have seats. How civil. Anyway - the beverages were tasty and the place had a unique charm. I will be back.
