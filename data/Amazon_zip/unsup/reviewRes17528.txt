India House is really good. I went in with my family for the brunch. Everything we had was tasty. I tried at least a bite of every dish they had out. They bring a plate of tandoori chicken to your table along with fresh baked naan. By the end I was absolutely stuffed. The desserts were good as well... so make sure to at least save room for a bite of the mango sorbet. The only reason I take a star off is because the staff runs you out at the end of your meal. They definitely keep that place working like clock work. They don't want you sitting around for a bit to let your food settle and go up for more. Which is the the point of going to a buffet. Before we knew it our table was cleared and the check was in my Dad's hand. I did not like that.
