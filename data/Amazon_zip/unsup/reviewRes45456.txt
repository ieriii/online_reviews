So, I really like the look of this place. I can't believe this used to be an Ace Hardware! They did an amazing job fixing it up. Dark wood, subdued lighting, a fireplace and bookshelves (with books...or at least they look like real books). There are two bars, a long one up front and a smaller one in the back. Decent number of tables and an outdoor section for people watching. I wish I could rave as much about everything else. The food is pretty decent. I've never had anything that wowed me or inspired me to order it again. Last time I was there I had a burger and it was pretty unexciting, not to mention not cooked to my order. I asked for medium well and the burger was pretty clearly pink all the way through. However, I was voracious at that point so I didn't send it back. As it turned out, I didn't die so all's well that ends well. The service here... well most of the time it sucks, at least when they're busy. Our waitress was a bit of an absentee last time. I was about ready to go refill my own water glass but luckily a busboy finally took care of it while I was in the bathroom (I mean refilling my water, you pig!). When I was there for brunch one time we waited around 10 minutes for our drinks. They have a full bar, an reasonably good beer selection and some decent drink specials. The crowd is generally pretty mixed. Gay and straight dates and groups of friends of various configurations. I think that this place could really be something if they improved service and got a new chef to add some pizazz to the menu. Basically they need better management, in the kitchen and out.
