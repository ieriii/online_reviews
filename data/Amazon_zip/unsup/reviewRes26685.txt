Best Mexican Food EVER! Seriously, if you live in Chicago and love Mexican food, you need to go to this restaurant ASAP. Since I work in Pilsen, I have been lucky enough to frequent this adorable, authentic place often enough to know that: *It is BYOB. Go ahead and bring a 12 pack like we did. They even give you limes and refrigerate it. *Get an appetizer. I am usually not big on meal starters, but they are all incredible here (especially the one that was like saganki, only a Mexican version). *Please tip your server generously :). They work SO hard (you never see any sitting/standing around- they are always cleaning or serving). I am a teacher in this area, and I know how hard a lot of these amazing families have it in life.
