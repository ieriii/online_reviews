I love this place! My friends and I went there on Sunday night and got a great booth in a back corner. You can order 3oz (or is it 2 oz, don't remember) of beer for $2.00 each so you can try all the beer you want in little bits instead of ordering a glass full. But of course you can also order glass full. I had all of the beers on the menu, but 2 and I only had a beer and a half or so in total. Some of the beers are potent and have a high alcohol content, but overall they were excellent! I'm usually a wine drinker, but I've been getting more into beer tasting this summer and I would highly recommend this place. It's not in the most convenient location (California and Milwaukee), but I rode my bike there from Uptown and thought it was a nice ride there, but on my ride back it stormed, but I can't blame Revolution for that. We all had great food there too! I had an excellent burger with Pull pork on it. And my friend order a fabulous chocolate dessert. Check it out - it's definitely worth it. I heard it's takes forever (more than an hour) to get a table on a Fri or Sat night, so be prepared to hang at the bar if you go during primetime.
