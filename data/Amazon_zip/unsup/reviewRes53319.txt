This was the single best, most memorable, eye-opening, and flavorful culinary experience I have ever had. As a teacher, my salary does not allow for frequent dining splurges, but I try I find a way to visit some of the country's best restaurants when I can (Chez Pannise, Fench Laundry, etc.). My visit to Alinea was SO worth the penny pinching needed to go there. So if you are like me and wondering if it is worth the money....DO IT. Also, for so upscale a restaurant the service was friendly and playful, not stuffy at all. We ordered the smaller tasting menu, which did not include the truffle explosion. When I called in advance to see if I could add that dish (indicating I would be happy to pay more) they said it was no problem. Not only did they include the extra dish, they didn't even charge anything extra. I won't go through the long menu dish by dish, I will just say that every one of them was just amazing. Most of the time I was eating, my eyes were closed so I could focus in on the unusual flavors and textures. Not sure my review adds anything to everything else that has been said about Alinea, but I wanted to write a review to emphasize that if a dinner here is a big splurge for you, you won't regret it.
