Absolutely phenomal. I've been back twice in one week. The first time I had the seafood caldos (about $12) and it was incredible. I would've paid twice the price for this dish. The ingredients were very fresh and the broth was seasoned to perfection. We followed up with a churos and soft serve, which was excellent. Rick Bayless was also there working hard behind the counter, which was great to see. He literally tasted everything before it went out and was working just as hard as anyone in the restaurant. To say this guy is passionate about his work is an understatement. The second time I had the choriqueso sandwich and instantly fell in love. It's under $9 and is probably the best sandwich I've ever had.This place is probabaly the greatest deal in Chicago and a must-try for anyone!
