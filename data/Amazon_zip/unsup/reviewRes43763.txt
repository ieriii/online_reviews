I hadn't been to Kinzie in a while, but my wife and I had a fantastic meal. We started with a delicious goat cheese appetizer. My wife then had the best chicken she's ever had (her words, which don't come lightly). I had an excellent filet. The mashed potatoes were good; the spinach, fantastic. The desserts were also above-average (at least there was homemade whipped cream, unlike too many other restaurants). All in all, efficient service (because we had a show), and a nice atmosphere. Highly recommended!
