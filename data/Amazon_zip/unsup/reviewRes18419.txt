They have every beer you can think of and the staff knows about them which is good. I love beer but thats not why I was brought there. The burgers are out of this world. MUST TRY THE CHEESE CURDS! I recomend the red dragon burger, so freakin good!! GO, dont be scared by the douchey hipsters in tight jeans, they will not harm you. The cheese curds are worth it!! GO!!
