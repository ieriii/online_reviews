honestly, the pizza wasn't that great. But the sauce blew me away. This has to be the best sauce that I have tasted on a pizza- great herbs as well as texture, and just the right amount. Other than that, deep dish is the way to go here, for value, as well as for the amazing sauce. And I'm a thin crust girl. Ambience is diner-y and its pretty cheap, less than $5 per slice. Oh and they let you get by the slice, which is the best part of the experience, then you can try multiple slices.
