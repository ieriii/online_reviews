I recently went back to Tru for the third time for a special occasion (anniversary). We wanted a truly special dining experience, and based on our previous two visits there when in Chicago, we thought this would be the place to go. I must say that I was disappointed. Compared with previous dinners there, the service seemed not as good as in the past and the menu was spare on fresh fish and vegetable choices. So while I would have rated them a 5 in the past, this time I can only give a 3.5. It is still a very good restaurant, but I don't think we will go back there. There are too many other outstanding places to try. I reserve a 5 star rating to mean that I recommend a place without any reservations at all and will certainly plan to return the next time I am in town.
