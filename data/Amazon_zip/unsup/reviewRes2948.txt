This meal was amazing! My boyfriend and I opted for the prix fixe menu and decided to share everything so that we could create our own tasting menu. To start we had the swashimi and the scallops. Sashimi was wonderful, however the scallop dish really stood out. The broccoli and peanut flavors complimented the scallops very well. For the main course, I wanted to try the lobster, however they were out. I expressed my disappointment to the server as I had been looking forward to the lobster all day. To make up for my disappointment, they brought both of us a lobster bisque with huge chunks of lobster. This was a nice touch and tasted great as well. We also had the ribeye and the halibut. The ribeye was delish and cooked to perfection. The puffed potatoes that came with this were yummy and tasted like little potato donuts. The halibut was the standout of the main courses though, very tasty sauce and the leeks tasted awesome with the fish! Amongst our courses, several amuse-bouche came out and I can't remember what they were, but all were little bursts of flavors! Bread they served was also awesome. For dessert, we choose from the cheese cart, and split a chocolate bar. They also brought out a little chocolate treat with candles, as we were celebrating our anniversary. Overall, a ridiculous amount of food, I have never been that full...and everything was right on. Service was good, but the food is what really stood out. Very expensive meal, but very worth it as it was an experience I will remember forever.
