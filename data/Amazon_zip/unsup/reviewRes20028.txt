BYOB places hold a special place in my heart. But it's not enough to win me over with this only; my wine needs to be paired with a fine meal. Coast, you deliver. A note to all interested in trying this place out: Make a Reservation. Came in at 630pm with a reservation and most of the tables were already filled. By the time I left around 8, it was even more packed. The good news has traveled fast apparently. The rolls are phenom. They have their specialty maki and a few others on their regular menu that I've never even seen at other places. Ordered the Ceviche, Spicy Scallop, Rainbow, and Spicy Sweet Potato. My favorite out of all of them? The sweet potato. It's their vegetarian best seller and I'm not even a vegetarian! It had a hint of spiciness balanced by the sweetness of the potato and I really liked the crunchy texture. The other rolls were just as delish and were well rolled so I didn't have to worry about my amateur chopstick skills butchering the presentation. Our waitress was very friendly and good about making recommendations and asking any questions. I liked it because she was there when we needed her, but not overbearing and hovering.
