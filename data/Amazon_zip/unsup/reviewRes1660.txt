Waiting builds character. You will build a lot of character here. When you are done building said character, you are in for a full-on kicking screaming sausage assault of the second-best kind (let's be realistic here). I had the rosemary chicken sausage with garlic-rosemary mustard and camembert cheese. At that point I had gotten mildly freaked out from being in an enclosed space with a lot of people, so I was a little upset/frazzled and just wanted to sit down and have my food without being stared at by people in line as I ate (I KNOW IT'S HARD BUT STOP PLEASE JUST LOOK AT THE MENU BLANKLY), but I'm not letting my own psychotic hangups get in the way of expressing how good that mother effing sausage was. My partner in meat crime got the Alsacienne (bacon sausage with creme fraiche and triple creme brie, pile some more dairy on this death machine please), and I almost bit the tips of my fingers off in excitement when nom nom nomming on his culinary choice (I am doing my best to avoid further 4th grade innuendos and it's not that easy, throw me a bone...er cut me some slack?). He loved his meat choice and was thoroughly satisfied. Brilliant marketing with the "cash-only-open-till-4" thing. You can afford to do shit like this when you've got amazing food to back it up. Smart, smart, smart. I will be back.
