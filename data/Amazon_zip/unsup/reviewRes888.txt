I would actually give this 4.5 stars if I could. Excellent variety of unique offerings. My dog was awesome. I had the duck fat fries, and I couldn't tell the difference. But good fries nonetheless. Doug was at the register. Very friendly. Once I ordered, the food came out quickly. The hour plus wait...not so cool.
