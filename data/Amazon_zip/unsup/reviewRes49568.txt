My feelings on Bin 36 are very mixed. I'm going to lay this out with pros and cons: PROS Very accesible wine list Pairings with each item on the menu Affordable flights Ability to buy the wine you just had with dinner to take home if you want Free cookie/coffee at lunch CONS Weird atmosphere at lunch time Food is a little "meh." Menu is limited Service is only okay Very loud at dinnertime I do love getting flights of wine here and trying new things. I wish the lunch crowd were actually there, so that it wasn't such an odd experience to go here for lunch because that free cookie is pretty sweet.
