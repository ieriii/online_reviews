The place is delish! They give you way too much food so be prepared to unbuckle your belt.  I would come back here again just for the legendary oatmeal shake with milk. No additional flavors needed. It tastes like an icy horchata... much better than horchata though.  Wasn't too big of a fan of their salsas, as i like mine a little bit chunkier but still delilsh. Good intro to costa rican food, as i've never had it b4!
