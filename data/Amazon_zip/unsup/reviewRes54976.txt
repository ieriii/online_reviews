i'm easily going to roll with two stars for this restaurant. very surprised to see all of the four star ratings of bonsoiree on yelp because this is one of the most disappointing experiences i've had in chicago. nothing went horribly wrong and i actually enjoyed myself quite a bit; however those joys exclusively reflected the wine and my company. the service was not very good, not atypical in this town, but i was really deeply disappointed in the flavor of the food and the price i paid. no course produced any harmonious quality. each was either under seasoned or overcomplicated. i actually went out for a real dinner after this one was finally finished. i will neither recommend this restaurant to a friend or ever eat here again.
