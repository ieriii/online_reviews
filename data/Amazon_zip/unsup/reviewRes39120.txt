I haven't had one bad meal at Longman and Eagle. A couple weeks back I had brunch with a friend and instantly fell in love. It has a cool atmosphere and the waitstaff is pretty friendly. For brunch I got the fried chicken and waffles. The chicken was moist and well seasoned and the waffle was perfectly cooked. There was also this sweet potato and pork belly hash on the waffles that was delicious. My friend got the french toast and loved it as well. Last week I returned for dinner with a friend and again had a great meal. I got the melon and fig salad along with the burger. The salad was fresh and creative and a great starter size. The burger was well seasoned and perfectly cooked along with the fries. I cannot wait to return and try some other dishes.
