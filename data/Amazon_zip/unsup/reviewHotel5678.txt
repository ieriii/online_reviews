Very friendly, clean and classic rooms that have an old town feel. The doormen and front desk were very polite and courteous, and offered me assistance with everything from luggage to taxi's. Returning at night, the maid service even left chocolates on the pillow. Little details are very important to me and the Talbott Hotel paid attention to all of them.
