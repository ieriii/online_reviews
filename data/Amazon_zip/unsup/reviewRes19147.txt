This city hot spot came highly recommended, and it did not disappoint! I used to find it sad to sit alone at a restaurant, but this spot was anything but lonely for solo chick. I parked it at the bar and ordered a beer (their list was rather intimidating). The grilled octopus on a bed of arugula with watermelon and goat cheese was to-die-for, as was their sweet corn and lobster soup. I was nowhere near hungry after those and a couple of beers, but was told that I "simply cannot leave without dessert". I'm not one for sweets, but the waitress said that the baklava, fig and Greek yogurt drizzled with honey and almonds basically made the other deserts look like a scoop of vanilla ice cream, so I tried it. For someone who doesn't like sweets, I finished every bite. I made new friends at the bar, just for ordering that dish- everyone wanted a bite! This was one of my favorite meals in Chicago.
