Hoooooooo mama! THAT is some freakin' MEAT right there! I've lived pretty close by for almost 4 years and have never made it here because I don't stand in line for nothin'. Finally got motivated on a weekday to head over there before 11 AM and beat the lunch rush. There was a little line, but it went quick. Was ordering for a few so we got the hot dog, thuringer, polish, and a jerk pork sausage with plantains. It was relatively cheap considering all of it was of the highest quality, and I mean all of it. Whoo! The cheese fries were good but were way overshadowed by the meat.  I would maim everyone in this room for another polish from Hot Doug's. Right now.  Worth the wait, I will be back for sure.
