This was a 4* Priceline win, but I will not be bidding that zone (River North) again. Generally, I find Priceline's star levels to be accurate. Not this time.The hotel is far from a 4*. The Felix has wholly inadequate--almost ludicrously small--rooms. I was initially placed in a tiny room; but asked to be moved. This was done. The second room was marginally larger but, like the first, it lacked a closet; instead, there was a curtained-off niche which served as a kind of closet, though the bar for hanging clothes was a mere 15" or so in length. There was no dresser; indeed, there was no space even to leave a suitcase open on the floor. The room had sufficient room for the bed and almost nothing else.I have been in many hotels in Europe, so am accustomed to rooms that are small by American standards. I have never been in rooms there as small as those at the Felix.There were housekeeping problems, too. The rug in the room was filthy; when I pulled back the bedding to sleep, there were long blond hairs on it. (I have dark brown hair.) "The laundry must have missed it" was the explanation offered by a staffer.Never again.
