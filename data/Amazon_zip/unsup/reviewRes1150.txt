My friends have been members of the Hot Doug cult for years - they'll stand for hours in the cold, rain, snow, or heat to pay their respects to the encased meet god (Doug) and worship / eat his sausage offerings. I knew is was just a matter of time before I would convert and join the following.  I had to write the obligatory Hot Doug's review, but I don't really know what else I can add that the 1,400+ reviews on here haven't described in detail. It's delicious and unique food, a great experience, a fun time, and one of those places you just have to try if you're in Chicago.
