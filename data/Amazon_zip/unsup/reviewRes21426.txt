How could you not love the artery clogging goodness of a Whoppercheesie? Two beef patties smothered with melted American cheese brought together to make me die a little younger. Maybe try your luck on the Superdawg a half hot dog half mutant that will bring you to your knees. No matter what you try you are in for a treat. I have tried pretty much everything on the menu; even the tamales and I haven't been disappointed once. I have been going here probably since the womb, so that is a magnificent feat. Opening up that box of holiness stuffed with your food and a crisp delicious pickle is like Christmas in July. Superdawg reminds me of summer and what it's like to be young without a care in the world. The perfect summer night activity is to jump in the car with the windows down and cruise on over to Superdawg. Order some grub and a milk shake from the classic DriveIn. Throttle that food down your throat and bask in the glory if only for a moment of what it's like to eat like a kid. Thinking about the two monster sized Hot Dogs atop the roof and I instantly salivate. Saturday night can't come soon enough.
