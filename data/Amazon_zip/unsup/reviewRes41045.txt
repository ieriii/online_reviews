I have never written a bad review yet, but I have also never felt discriminated against when I have gone to a restaurant besides tonight. I went in to order take out tacos and was second in line. The two girls that were helping the gentleman in front of me could not seem to help him place his order, so i waited. No big deal. But then other customers came in that spoke Spanish and stood in line behind me. I had thought that that may help speed things up. And then a third lady who worked there came up, I thought to help. Great. But then with a quick few words in Spanish, the patrons behind me stepped up to the counter and ordered. I really thought that they may know those people, but by the Spanish I know, they did not. And so orders were taken, money was exchanged. .... and then instead of helping me they went to prepared everyone elses food. Not a word or glance in my direction to say "Ill be with you in one moment," or give any other explanation to way I was not being served. Used to go there alto, but refuse to go there anymore after that service. Good thing there are so many other Mexican taco places to choose from!
