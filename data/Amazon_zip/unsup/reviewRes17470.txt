It's a nice place but a little overrated. The food is very good and not as pricey as I had anticipated. Drinks are decent enough. Nice servers. I wish they had room to dance in the dining area itself. We were seated right next to the balcony (and it's deadly stairs after a few mojitos) and it would have been nice to look down and see people busting a move.
