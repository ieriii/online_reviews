I went here for lunch with a colleague one Friday and LOVED every minute of the experience. Unfortunately, it was during Lent, so I had to skip some of the delicious things I was planning on trying, but I enjoyed branching-out and trying a green curry (SPICY!) I also got a spicy tuna item which was delcious and one of the special sodas that you basically create yourself at the table in a fun beaker. It is not a quick lunch, but when you have a litte extra time, it is well worth the trip from the loop and the time!
