This place is great. Definitely one of the best Francesca restaurants. The only downside is that it can get quite loud and almost claustrophobic. If you don't mind noise and cramped-ness, then you will love it. The food is great and the desserts are probably my favorite part. They had this apple bread pudding that was to die for and their tiramisu is one of my favorites.
