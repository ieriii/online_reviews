Fogo has to be the best Brazilian BBQ I've been to, there is nothing more I could have asked for. Within five minutes of walking in the door, we were seated, given the welcome spiel, and had our plates full of around $30 worth of meat. I've been to a few Brazilian BBQ's before, but nothing like this. The quality was superb, and the meat was non-stop. I guess when you're paying $50 per person, they can afford to keep sending out the freshest cuts. Normally the longer you stay, at a BBBQ, the more likely the are to send out the older, lesser cuts of meat. Not at Fogo. Halfway through my meal I ventured to the salad bar to see what I was missing. The selection of vegetables and cured meats was as vibrant as the presentation. I ended up returning with some slices of meats, cheeses, artichokes, and tomatoes, and built a sick roast beef sandwich with some bottom sirloin from the skewers. I also liked the caramelized bananas that came as sides. A lot. I ended up asking for another serving to accompany my dessert. Yeah, that's right, I'm the guy that goes to a buffet, blows it out, and still piles on dessert. I'm sure it's been said before, but Fogo de Wow.
