When Fox & Obel first opened years ago, I had high expectations. Having lived in Boston for school, I was a tad bit spoiled by the wonderful J Bildner. I went seeking savory prepared foods and was disappointed with the congealed mess that met me and never returned. So on a lovely Saturday, I decide to venture back with a friend who really wanted to get some freshly made sammies before we hit the movies. Context: Saturday, beautiful weather, 12:30pm. Read: Busy lunch time with many patrons. I saunter up to the register to place my order for a roast beef and blue brie.  Cashier: "It's a 15-20 minute wait for sandwiches." Me (incredulously): "It's a 15-20 minute wait to get a sandwich to go?" Cashier: "Yes." I walk out with my friend to forage elsewhere. Are you kidding me? It's Saturday and you don't have enough staff or resources to deliver a sandwich in under 15 minutes? You can keep it.
