if you brew your own beer, most likely i like you. piece is an awesome local lil pizza joint with simple thin crust pizzas and some good homemade brews! they also have live-band karaoke some nights, so you can drink beers, eat 'zza and 'zigga zigga ahhh' on the microphone... b/c obvs, that's all 'you really, really want.'
