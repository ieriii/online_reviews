One of the most overrated restaurants in Chicago. This place is pretty good, but the price is ridiculous. I like variety when I go out to eat and not have endless amounts of nothing but meat and an over-hyped salad bar. For the price for 2 people including drinks and tip you could go to a very nice place in Chicago and leave feeling just as full and way more satisfied.
