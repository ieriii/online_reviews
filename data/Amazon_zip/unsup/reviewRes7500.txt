One of the best places in the city for the money. Sometimes it takes a little while to be seated and there is not much room to stand while waiting. The food is excellent, especially the veal with all the cheese...not sure on the proper name. There is nothing extremely special about this place, but the food, service, and great price are as reliable as they get.
