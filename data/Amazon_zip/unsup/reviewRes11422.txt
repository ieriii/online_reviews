By far one of my favorite brunch spots in Bucktown! (1470 N Milwaukee Ave, Chicago 60622). If you go between the hours of 10:30am-12:30pm be prepared to wait for at least 30 minutes or longer. But I'm telling you... it's worth the wait IF you are a huge fan of breakfast. Favorite top two dishes from The Bongo Room: If you are feeling ravenous- order the Breakfast Burrito which has a jalapeno tortilla with guacamole and scrambled eggs topped with melted cheese and sour cream, salsa on the side served with hash browns. Might I mention, I don't know where they get their salsa ingredients, but it's very fresh (every time).  And there is something about their hash browns too. Crispy, but not too crispy. Just love and I don't even need or want ketchup with them! If you crave hollandaise, the way I do from time to time... you should try the Eggs Benedict. The eggs are cooked to perfection, the toasted English muffin provides a good base and I substitute the ham for spinach. It's ooey, gooey, wonderful.  I'm a huge fan of Bongo Room.
