heaven heaven heaven for omni's and carni's alike. ooooh my goodness, i could never eat again and be satisfied...until i pass by again and am lured into its heavenly gates! everything was pure delight from the organic spirits to beers to the desserts! i'll be dreaming of this place for years to come. It was THE highlight of my visit to Chi-town! Wish they would bring it to Philly!
