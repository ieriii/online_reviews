Disclaimer: I visited this restaurant on Monday for their family style weekly special.The Monday deal is fantastic: $21 per person gets you choice of 2 apps, 2 soup/salads, 3 entrees, and dessert. If you have more than 2 people, they just increase the portions. So much food for the money.The atmosphere, service and price all get A's, and the food a solid B. I would definitely return.
