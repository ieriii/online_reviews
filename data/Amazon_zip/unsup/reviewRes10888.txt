If I got a nickel for each time I've been to this place.... There's no way to lose with Piece. If it's a casual night out, go to Piece Karaoke? Piece. Late lunch on a weekend? Perfect for that as well. The pizzas are always reliably good (I'll take thin crust over deep dish any day of the week). Service has always been good and I enjoy the selection of beers available. All in all, it's part of the Wicker Park experience and a must-go if you are in the neighborhood.
