My experience here was very enjoyable. Our server was really wonderful and it started getting to the point of comical because our water glasses would be filled up if even a sliver of space was available. I know some people might be annoyed by that and feel that it was intrusive but I take it that they just want to provide the best service. :)  On to the food. Wow, I loved the bread! It was delicious and warm and went perfectly with the butter they provided. I saved some to dip into my lobster bisque, which by the way was superb. The veal ravioli was good but didn't have as much flavor as I would have liked. The rib eye was delicious and I'm not even a big steak eater. The asparagus was also good but I didn't understand why everyone was raving about it so much. For dessert, we had the banana cream pie which was sweet but not to the point where we couldn't finish it, which happens sometimes with overly sweet desserts.
