Okay, I am a meat eater. I have been here 3 times, and would eat here all the time if it were a bit closer to me. I've had 3 different things...and all were totally awesome. Friendly staff, super food, and its healthy!!! The reuben is as good or better than the real thing...which is an amazing feat!
