Service is great! Garlic.....with oil...awesome. Add it to the bread and tomato bread that comes with every meal. We have been here twice. Skip the Jalapeno Poppers....go for everything else. The pizza is great, the pasta is really good. The BF got the Lasagna and loved it. Highly recommended!  It's old school at its best.
