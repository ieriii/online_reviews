Wow, how the heck can I come to this place as often as I have and not review it? Perhaps I'm losing my mojo but I'm sure glad this place hasn't. I've been here a handful of times for Sunday brunch and once for cocktails on the rooftop patio. The patio is such a great place to have drinks with friends when the evening is nice. Unfortunately, I'm not the only one who figured this out as it is not easy getting up there on most evenings. Now that Spring is coming, hopefully I can swing a happy hour visit once the patio opens up this season. As for brunch, well it is definitely divine and really not a bad deal price wise. Of course, the visit could be a bit costly when you factor in great drinks they have to offer. The last time I went, they did have a good deal on Mimosas and hope they continue to offer similar deals. Nonetheless, the food offering was very nice and ample thanks to the stations they have set up in the middle of the restaurant. Then throw in their awesome rotation of meats and dishes that come table side and you have a good recipe for an awesome brunch experience! This is one place I like to come back to for special occasions or when I need to impress out of town visitors.
