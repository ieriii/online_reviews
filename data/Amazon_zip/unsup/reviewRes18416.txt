I give the food here a solid 5 stars. The location and splitting fees are the only reason I knocked my review down to 4 stars. Food: The menu here is fantastic. The menu is very diverse, making it great for a meat-eater or for a pescetarian like myself. Their pasta dishes are very inventive and combine a wide variety of flavors, which I am a huge fan of. We started with the bruschetta topped with fresh mozzarella. Best bruschetta I've ever had, hands down. The bread was perfectly toasted and the tomatoes were ripe and fresh. We then split the pappardelle con pomodoro seco - homemade pappardelle pasta topped with sun-dried tomatoes and a mascarpone cheese sauce. It was out of this world. The homemade pasta was a noticeable difference from dried pasta, and the tartness of the sundried tomatoes with the rich, creaminess of the cheese sauce was perfectly balanced. We were, however, charged an $8 splitting fee to split this dish - I thought was a big over the top. And the best part of it all - it's BYOB so you don't have to deal with being charged 3x shelf price for a bottle of wine! Atmosphere: Besides the obscure location of the restaurant, the atmosphere within is eclectic and interesting. It has a romantic feel, as most tables consisted of couples on dates. It gets very crowded, so be sure to make a reservation in advance.
