Oh My God. I love Shaw's and will not stop talking about it. I suggest it for my birthday, Valentine's Day, anniversary, 4th of July. Anything. The food is exceptionally good. You can tell their seafood is fresh and they will tell you that you can't order something if it isn't. (kinda annoying if you really want it but at least you know you are eating good food) The waiters make me feel like a princess and I constantly have more wine, water, food. And I am comfortable in the cozy, lightly lit Rat Pack-type atmosphere.  I would love if they lowered their prices but you definitely get what you pay for so it is alright-I understand.
