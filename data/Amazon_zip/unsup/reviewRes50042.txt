I LOVE this place. I first came here several years ago, and hadn't been back in quite some time. I was so excited when I found out I'd be returning for my friend's birthday party. I started with the cheese empanadas. Yummm.... Then I went for the steak/octopus combination. First of all, if you don't get the steak, you are simply insane. It is so flavorful and delicious. I tried a bit with the chimuchurri sauce, which was excellent, but the meat itself was so flavorful I decided I preferred it plain. The octopus is so delicious as well. It has a yummy charred flavor and is really delicious. And if you like yucca (which some people don't), this is one of the few places I've found it since my trip to Peru. And you can't go wrong with some plaintains as well. I also like the atmosphere here. It's got a great ambience, and they really seem to have thought of everything. The menu FAQ section is really cute. I especially enjoyed Q: "Where are the chips and salsa?" A: "At the Mexican restaurant down the street." They did forget my friend's entree, who, unfortunately, happened to be the birthday girl. Minus a star for that. But the manager offered us a concession off the bill and a free drink for my friend, so at least they handled it fairly well. He also said it was the kitchen's fault, not the waitress's, and I believe it, since our waitress was nothing but super nice and helpful the whole evening. From this and from reading the other reviews, I'm guessing this place just doesn't QUITE have everything in a row for a busy evening, but oh well. Few places are perfect, and the here food is worth what I'm sure is just an occassional slip.
