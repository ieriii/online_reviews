Lao Sze Chuan is one of my favorite Chinese restaurants based on the quality of the food alone. There is not a lot to distinguish most restaurants in Chinatown for ambiance, theatrics or for that matter flavors so their direct take on Szechuan cuisine is why I like it so much. I tried their House Special Hot and Sour Soup for the first time. For a totally vegetarian version, this soup was rich, flavorful and surprisingly complex. Crumbled peanu mixed into the soup was a yummy twist. Their Dry Chili Chicken is still my must-have dish. Lightly breaded crispy coated, tender chicken, all spicy and salty. This would be so good in a bucket with a beer while watching a movie. The Mongolian Lamb was an excellent second dish. One of our friends ordered the Kung Pao Shrimp, not exactly Szechuan but still very well executed. Like most Chinese restaurants, the dessert options are lacking to non-existent but if you know this ahead of time, there are places for bubble tea like Joy Yee just a few doors over and they have something like 80+ sweet options on their drink list. This was a relaxing meal after my group had spent the day at the Museum of Science and Industry. Today was a good food day, the meal was just perfect.
