Came here during the opening week because we were intrigued by the massive long line outside the door. Rick Bayless himself was working at the counter so there were some added incentives. I had my doubt walking in because I didn't enjoy my dining experience previously at Topolobampo. Plus, I didn't exactly understand the whole "quick service" concept being an amateur consumer. Boy, was I in for at treat. Decided to share Shortrib Red Chile Soup and Cubana sandwich with my friend and they were both fantastic. I've always been a fan of Mexican caldo and this one was definitely on the top of my list. Ended the dinner with some churros, hot chocolate and regular coffee. My friend was not a coffee drinker and you should have seen her face when she took the first sip. She loved it so much that she immediately ran over to Rick Bayless and shared the experience with him. To her delight, even Rick was surprised that they could woo the diners with their coffee. Churros were amazing as well, which has become my stable of comfort food every time I walk. All in all, even though I'm not a Rick Bayless fan, this indeed is a wonderful restaurant.
