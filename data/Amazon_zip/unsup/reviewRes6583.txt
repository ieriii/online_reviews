This place is the eccentric millionaire of restaurants -- it looks fancy as hell but it serves down home comfort food at reasonable prices. We split the Kobe brisket, a half rack of St. Louis ribs, a side of fries and cornbread.  First, they come out with complimentary chips and pickles, which is like if Olive Garden brought you unlimited soup and breadsticks as a free appetizer. Both were goddamn delicious and (ostensibly) free. The Kobe brisket is not Kobe obviously, but only pedantic assholes like myself know or care about that sort of thing. Everything was tasty as hell if not mind-blowing, but I'm definitely down for multiple trips. The spicy BBQ sauce and the South Carolina mustard made good dishes great.
