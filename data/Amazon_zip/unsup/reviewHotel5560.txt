We chose this hotel based on a combination of location and sale price, and could not have been more pleasantly surprised. Should we ever return to Chicago we will most definitely be staying here. The rooms are delightfully furnished and decorated - none of the tired, drab and faded decor we would expect from a hotel in this price range. The entire place has this charmingly David Lynchian lounge atmosphere. Just across the street is Lincoln Park and Lake Michigan. We found the surrounding neighborhoods excellently suited for walking and architecture viewing. Oh, and the restaurant downstairs? Heartbreakingly good food.
