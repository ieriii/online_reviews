Kind of a smaller place, very nice inside-Clean/Modern/Communal Tables. Very diverse menu options as well as Liquor/Wine list.. Literally not one thing from the US on Wine/Beer list. Draft beers consisted of some German and Italian choices- some pretty obscure choices- tried a few and they were very good. As far as the food, Had a really fresh great salad that was dressed with Cabernet Mint Vinaigrette--It was Great! Also really liked the "Shaved Asparagus App".. kind of a place where you really have to give it some time because there are lots of options and everything is served "Tapas" style..
