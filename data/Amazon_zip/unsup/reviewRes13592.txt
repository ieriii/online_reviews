The husband read about Glenn's Diner & has been wanting to go for a long time. Finally, the husband, elder daughter & I went for a late lunch on a weekday. Wow, the hoopla is accurate! We each had a different version of the fish special. All of us loved it. The decor is unique. The service is attentive. But $15 for a huge (8 ounces) portion of fish --- including soup, salad, veggies, and potato! Wonderful---all available according to website from 11 AM to 5 PM Tuesdays through Saturday!  The menu is extensive and everything we ordered was savored, sampled, and shared! Delicious. Well worth a special trip! I recommend this place highly.
