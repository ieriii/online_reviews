I'm only giving 3 stars because I have a really hard time finding a table or a seat at the bar, but I would assume that's almost a positive thing as it's a testament to their popularity. If you like wine, this is a great place to go, and they have some fun events here as well. If you don't like wine, still a great place to go, as their food is pretty good and they have a full bar with just about anything else you could want to drink. It has a great happy hour crowd most nights, but again, be prepared to wait for seating. I think it's worth the wait.
