I must start by saying that the service was excellent. Our waiter was very friendly and efficient. You can tell that this restaurant tries very hard to make its customers feel comfortable. Now for the food... The cheese fondue is amazing. It was a delicious combination of spices and cheese, but the Gruyere and nutmeg really stood out. It was the highlight of the meal. The vegetables and meat were fresh, crispy and delicious. I really liked that they gave us a variety of sauces to dip them in. Dessert was very fun. They give you a flame with which you may roast marshmallows, and then dip them in the chocolate. The fruit, like the veggies, were fresh and tasted good.  The wine list is very unpretentious. In fact, it is downright user-friendly.  I give this restaurant 4 out of 5 stars. The prices are a bit much, but the service was great and everything was well-prepared, fresh and generally met my expectations.  Quick Notes: Gejas does *not* wreak of oil The cheese fondue is Gruyere (not some *weird* taste) Bread served with fondue is *supposes* to be slightly crunchy/crispy instead of soft When using a Groupon you *always* tip on the pre-discounted amount
