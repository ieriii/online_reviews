Try HUM it's awesome. Few blocks for our first place in Chicago and we keep coming back for takeout and dinning. They just recently started accepting takeout orders on their site and you get 10% off your order if you order that way (although the online ordering can get buggy). The food is amazing and reasonably priced. Love the paintings and decor.
