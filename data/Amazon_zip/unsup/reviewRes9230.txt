While unfortunately Dee w.'s review is 2 1/2 years old - we took our chances as our newly acquired addiction to Vietnamese cusine and decided that we should try the top shelf/cream of the crop restaurant - and it did not disappoint... The French/Vietnamese fusion should not be surprising to anyone familiar with the history of Vietnam - and in any case - the food here is mostly of Vietnamese persuasion... And it is very good and well presented too, It's just that I couldn't stop thinking of all the delicious Vietnamese meals I've had around Argyle Street that cost like a fraction of the cost here (not that the ambience and presentations aren't worth the price - they are - especially for a special occasion.) But for everyday Vietnamese goodies - head over to Argyle and BYOB...
