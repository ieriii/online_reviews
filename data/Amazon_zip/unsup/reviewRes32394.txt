This is one of the better spots in vanilla River North. I read a review in TOC that panned the entrees, so i wasn't sure what to expect. Overall, I was impressed from the cocktail list to the starters and rolls we ordered to share. The little Bao buns are not to be missed, and the sushi is of fine quality. There is also a very nice wine list, if one is not in the mood for the festive cocktails. If you are in River North, and in the mood for an infused, asiatic experience, Sunda is not be overlooked. Oh, also, our server Rae Lyn is one of the best in the biz!
