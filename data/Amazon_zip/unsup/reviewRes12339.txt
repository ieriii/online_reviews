Just got out of this place and I'm not happy. I enjoyed the pizza but what killed my night was the stupid waiter who charged my credit card on someone else's tab and didn't even bother to tell me. All he said was that my card didn't go through on my tab. I spoke to the manager and will be checking if I'm charged for that waiter's mistake. If you eat at this place make sure to check your accounts or pay cash!
