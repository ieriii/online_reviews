I came here on a whim. We were in need of food, and dammit, this place had an open table. The atmosphere is great, makes you feel like you're not in the city anymore - so this helps out a lot in creating a relaxed atmosphere.  I tried one of their signature drinks the nanhattam (something like that, it wasn't really spelled "manhatten" in the menu - just try it, damn you! it's good). While I did not order the shrimp and grits for myself, I was assured they were quite tasty. I had a pork dish (can't remember it right now) but it was most excellent. In all, trust this place, you won't be disappointed.
