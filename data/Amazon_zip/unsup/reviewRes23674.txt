So good. Go hungry you will leave stuffed. I've never been to Costa Rica but am a lover of all Latin food and was very satisfied. We ordered tostones, which were good, but I like my mojo to be olive oil with garlic in it, this was more of a chunky garlic mixture on top, but it was still really good. We also tried the Aveno milk shake- SO delicious, I had it with soy milk and it tasted like drinking an oatmeal cookie...YUM! Next was the Casado dish with chicken, wow, huge plate of rice and beans with the most tender, yummy chicken with carmelized onions and roasted tomatoes. We left stuffed and happy, and the best part is it's cheap!
