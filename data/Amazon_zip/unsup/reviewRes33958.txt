I have not eaten here in a while, but when I did, it was some of the very best in Chicago Italian. Once it caught on, you couldnt get a table for daze so be prepared to cocktail for some time. I do not embibe, so it was a long sometime. We did apps instead. Nice tomato basil and mozzarella. Just perfect. The pasta is to die for and the sauces always great. I always send people here. I hope it still holds up. I noticed that it now has a bunch of locations, but Clark and downtown are the only ones I have attended and appreciably. There it is. Ciao!
