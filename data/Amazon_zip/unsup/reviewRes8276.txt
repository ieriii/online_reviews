I find these all you can eat places overwhelming because I have zero self control, but I would say that this is the best of the Brazilian steakhouses in Chicago. Texas de Brazil's meat is a bit too salty. and Brazzaz is not that great. Anyways, come here when you're good and hungry and you'll be a happy camper! The plaintains and cheese rolls are yummy!
