Loved Glenn's Diner. It has such a traditional diner feel and the food is wonderful. We had the crab cakes for an appetizer which were filled with lumpy crab meat and absolutely delicious. For lunch, my boyfriend and I both got the Po'Boys. I had the shrimp, which my boyfriend said "was the most amount of shrimp he's ever seen on a Po'Boy" and he had the catfish. Both were cooked well and not served with fries which was surprising, but something I liked about the place (sides include fruit, asparagus, potato pancakes, coleslaw, etc). Most special about Glenn's is that it did not feel like Chicago - it felt seaside, like a Maine diner. I will definitely be coming back here for the large Bloody Mary's, hotcakes and dinner. Did I mention it's also BYOB?
