I recently got a chance to check out The Chicago Diner. I was moderately disappointed, but it wasn't a bad place. I just expected more. We ended up sharing appetizers around the table rather than ordering entrees. Most of our meals actually end up that way, really. We had the hot "wings" (hunks of seitan in a spicy sauce), fried ravioli, taquitos, and potato skins. Everything was definitely edible, but nothing stood out as amazing. I enjoyed my food but it wasn't memorable or exciting, just solidly okay vegetarian fare. The "wings" we a little dry and there was more spice than flavor (and I love spicy food, but this was more like spicy vinegar sauce to me), the potato skins were filled with a cold, uncooked "cheeze" mixture (I'd expected those to be warmer, I guess, like traditional, non-vegan potato skins), and the others were just tasty without standout flavors. We also had one Mexican and one hazelnut hot chocolate and one apple cider at the table. All of them were good, though I think they could have spiced my Mexican hot chocolate up a bit. The food was good, and the service was friendly, but it wasn't a place I want to spent 45 minutes on the bus to visit and then wait 30 minutes to be seated at, so I doubt I'll be going back unless I'm already in the neighborhood.
