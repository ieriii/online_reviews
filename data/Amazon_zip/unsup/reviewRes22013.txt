If you like to shout over dinner, this is the place for you! Since it's BYOB the shouting comes naturally after your first sip, so don't forget the alcohol. My friends and I started with a few apps, guacamole and empanadas. I think guacamole can be a generic Latin appetizer so I wasn't impressed. This was the first time I've had fried empanadas which felt really greasy going down but they were indeed tasty. I'm not a fan of unsweetened plantains - I wouldn't order that as an app again based on personal taste. I ordered the chicken and rice dish non-spicy but it came out spicy. My friend ordered her dish spicy and hers came out regular. One mistake there. I've actually been to Costa Rica and I will say that the flavors and preparation are pretty darn authentic. That was impressive to me. Since there are no reservations and a long line out the door, this isn't the type of place where you can casually eat your meal and laugh and drink with your friends after you're done. Irazu relies on fast eating and quick turnarounds so slam that beer, get out of there and continue your shouting elsewhere.
