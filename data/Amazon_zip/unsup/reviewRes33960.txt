I went to Sulan's Market about a week ago, so this will be a good test for my memory. Here's what sticks out in my mind: I LOVED the lentil soup. It's top notch, in my book. The ambiance was cool... the little booths are quite charming. I was worried about getting a booth when I arrived at 7:00pm, but was pleasantly surprised that a few booths opened up right away so there was no wait to sit down. I also like that you can choose which booth you would like to sit in, as opposed to being seated by a host(ess). If you're a feng shui chick like me, you'll appreciate being able to choose where you sit. The Chicken something-or-other was really really good. Portions are HUGE. All in all, this is a great place!
