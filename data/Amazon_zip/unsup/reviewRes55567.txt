I had the most tasty Bloody Mary followed by a greater than great Egg white omelette filled with the most delicious and extraordinary colorful vegetables... I thought it was a bit loud in the space but no complaints!! of course it is gonna be loud, it is wonderful morning food and I wasn't the only one that would wait in line for a plate filled with an artful and mother-kissed feast... :)
