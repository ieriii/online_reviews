I probably would have given Zed 5 stars but I reserve those for amazing culinary experiences (i.e. L20, etc.). I found Zed's dinner service to be fantastic, I found the meat and options (salad bar) to be way better than a fogo de chao and other brazillian steakhouses I have been to. As good of quality meats, and more options (it's a bit pricey but worth it for a nice night - or out on the company card). But i REALLY love their market cocktails. Yes they are expensive, but truly some of the best tasting cocktails I have ever had (and I work for a liquor company). The infused bourbon lemonade it just amazing.
