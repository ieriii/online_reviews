Sigh. Excuse me, but I'm still coming off my egg sandwich high as I write this. So, I ordered coffee (hot, fresh and strong) as well as the egg sandwich with cheddar on multi-grain bread. My dining companion and breakfast renaissance man, Rob L., ordered an egg white omelette with provolone and spinach as well as a short stack. Even the healthy fare looked tempting. My egg sammie was HUGE. Thick slices of bread crammed with perfectly scrambled eggs, crisp bacon and cheddar. So big, the sandwich required a fork and knife approach. The owner seemed a bit crabby but hey, I like his stuff so we're cool. I'll have to come back and try the fish that they're known for. And I'll gladly fork over $10 in cab fare anytime to break my fast at Glenn's.
