At a fundraiser this Feb, I won a gift certificate for 'brunch for 4' at Big Jones, and after months of planning, we finally went today. I felt like a queen the whole time. The waiter and bartender took really good care of us, and as the gift certificate stipulated, we got a three course chef's brunch. The goat cheese and balck pepper biscuit was very tasty, the eggs benedict with popovers was great, and the dessert was amazing. The chef sent out one of each of four desserts, and we coulnd't decide which was our favorite, the bread pudding or the red velvet cake.My girlfriends kept thanking me for inviting them to this wonderful experience, esp each time the waiter brought us another drink. The Autumn 76 was great, and the Rose Mimosa was very tasty. Overall, it was a wonderful brunch out- I will totally buy a raffle ticket for it again if offered at this year's charity event. Great afternoon!
