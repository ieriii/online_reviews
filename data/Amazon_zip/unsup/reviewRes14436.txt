Really nice people operating a really good establishment to bring you some good cheap Cuban food. Very simple foodd, but they do it as well as anyone. There are just a handful of outdoor tables and counters inside for dining. It's more of a quick stop place, but the new location on Armitage where Calvin's BBQ used to be has more of a dining room and outdoor patio. I look to try it out soon, as it is very close to me.
