LOVE this place! I really thought I was going to be annoyed by the Violet Hour. The whole no sign, hidden door thing seemed pretty pretentious to me. However, after finally going in the early evening on a thursday night I loved the whole experience.  You definitely feel like you're walking into a speakeasy when you step through the door and push aside the velvet curtains. It really feels like you're about to do something secret and wrong. Once inside the decor is so much fun - violet walls, low lights, chandeliers. The best thing is the dramatic high-backed chairs that make you feel like you have your own room within the room. I definitely recommend sitting at the bar so you can watch the bartenders at work. Their get-ups are great- vests, shirts, ties and for some reason every bar tender that night had a beard. weird. They are all very into what they're doing, extremely knowledgeable about all the tinctures and bitters and house-made potions lined up behind them. It's like they're alchemists mixing up the perfect potion. I love how they use a straw to sample each concoction before they give it to you just to make sure it's perfect. Our bartender actually added more vodka to my friend's drink after testing it. When does that ever happen? We also ordered some snacks which were pretty good. I definitely recommend the mini hot dogs. Kind of a strange thing to have with a cocktail but they were really fun - two were chicago-style and two had a yummy coleslaw on top that tasted like it had chilies in adobo sauce and toasted almonds. Yum! I'll definitely go back and think this is a great place to bring friends visiting from out of town.
