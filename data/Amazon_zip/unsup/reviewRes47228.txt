Went to Lockdown just yesterday, and let me tell you, it was AMAZING. if it's a nice day out and you're looking to sit outside on their patio, you definitely want to get there early. we got there around 4:00 and they still had a couple patios open. The servers were very nice and personable (although it DID help that my friend whom I was with lives 4 doors down and knows 90% of the staff). They're all very chill and try their hardest to make sure your dining and drinking experience there is a good one. If you're going there, make sure you're able to handle loud rock music -- and lots of it -- because they blast it quite loudly inside. Not exactly a place to bring children, although we did see two parents bring their kid. He looked about 12 years old. But take it from me and keep it 21+. As for the food, I generally get skeptical of places known for burgers, so I was curious to try one of the many options Lockdown has. I came across the "Citizens Arrest" burger and OH. MY. GOD. INCREDIBLE. it was thick, juicy and absolutely flavorful. I paired it with mac 'n cheese and a PBR and it was unreal. I'm used to burgers being dry on the inside or burnt a little on the outside, but not this one. It was THE best burger I have EVER had. Definitely going to back here when the summer gets here.
