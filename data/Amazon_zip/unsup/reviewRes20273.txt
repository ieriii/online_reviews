Went to this place for my 18th birthday and will be returning for my 21st because of the expansive, seasonal menu. This place is my first experience with a menu that changes with the seasons which is both a blessing and a curse (curse because I dont know when i will be able to get the salmon with latkas and capers again). The crowd is very trendy, the bar is huge and the regular items on the menu feature great American/Anglo-Saxon flavors such as their creative use of brie and their legendary fish and chips. This place is expensive, no joke. So if you're going to do the whole bar then aps then dinner thing, be prepared to spend over 70 a person, but like most things in this world, you get what you pay for.
