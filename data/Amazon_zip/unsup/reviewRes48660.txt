I brought my husband here for his "man Valentine's Day" date the week before Valentine's. Brunch was pretty fabulous. We loved the bloody marys, they come paired with a beer chaser. A little pricey but totally worth it. I still have dreams about those bloody marys now that I can no longer drink because there is a full on alien invasion of my body aka pregnancy going on. The good was good, I don't eat bacon but I did give theirs a try and though it wasn't my thing I still thought it was delicious. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because we were the first ones there and we were seated next to the loud kitchen at the end of the long table instead of in a pen like I had requested and we had reservations. Definitely make a reservation if you plan on coming here.
