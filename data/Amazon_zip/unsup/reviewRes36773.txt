I love the Japanese menu here, the Thai is good but there are other places I'd go first. The seaweed salad is the best I've ever had. It has enough kick without being too spicy. The sushi is also really great and reasonably priced. The decor is creative and fun for a date or other celebration. Everyone has their favorite neighborhood Thai or Sushi joint, I find they get pretty passionate about which is the best. This place will definitely give them a run for their money.
