I don't know what to say. Perfection in a Hot Dog? Can such a thing exist? Is this the land that I've dreamed of? I look at the rating breakdown and someone gave this establishment two stars. They is an uneducated fool whom can't write good! This restaurant is astounding. He can combine tastes that expand at hit every part of the palate while achieving whatever style desired. Jack Daniels and fennel? Check. Sriracha and seaweed? Check. Forget the fancy just give me a Chicago dog. Check. Oh and by the way, come back again and again. Check. I declare Doug the Master of Hot Dog, the Sultan of Sausage, the Prince of Portable Meat (don't read into that one).
