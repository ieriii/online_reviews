I was in Costa Rica for a few weeks a couple years ago and have been craving the food for awhile now. Naturally I dragged my boyfriend out to Irazu for dinner.  I like the feel of the restaurant. To me it felt like a really high-end soda (which is basically a small Costa Rican diner). You can see into the kitchen and sort of walk through it to get to the dining area. The dining area is very small with tables pretty close together. There is a large outdoor patio area and tented area in addition to the indoor dining area.  The biggest test for me was the gallo pinto and plantains - which I ate at least once a day in Costa Rica. Irazu's were awesome. Though honestly, if a restaurant couldn't do gallo pinto and plantains it wouldn't deserve to call itself Costa Rican. The guanabana and oatmeal shakes were both delicious, as were the potato tacos and the beef and potato empanada. The fried yucca and the ceviche were good, but not amazing. I left Irazu full and happy, I will definitely be back.
