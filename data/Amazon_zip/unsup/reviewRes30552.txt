Loved my late night dinner! So I was on a date, saw a play at lookingglass theatre and wanted a later dinner. He has been to Sunda before and claimed to know excatly what I like so I let him order the entire meal for us.....Typically this would be all sorts of wrong, except is was all sooo bleeping fantastic! I swear I had to force my chop sticks down and walk away for fear of becoming obese at the table. From the sticky rice wrapped in leaves to the pork belly in adobo with a side of the garlic rice...all wonderfully satisfying to the eyes, nostrils and taste buds. Left a full, happy woman with another date in the making.
