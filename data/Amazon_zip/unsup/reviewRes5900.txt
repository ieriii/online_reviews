Very pleasantly surprised. Went in on Friday and I had the French Onion Soup (good not great), the Parmesan-crusted New York Strip (awesome), the BBQed sweet potato (awesome, but I think it's kind of chinzy there's an upcharge just raise the price and let people get whatever side they want), and the chocolate peanut butter pie (amazing, I didn't expect much based on the previous dessert reviews but it was really great).  My husband had the cream of chicken and mushroom soup (he loved it), the salmon (ok), the double-baked potato (awesome, had a touch of horseradish that really set it off), and the skillet apple pie (amazing!! sooo good).  Additionally, the bread was very good. The drinks were brought promptly and refilled quickly as well. Our server was very good and knowledgeable (he reminded us of Robin Williams). Overall a great experience, we will definitely be back.
