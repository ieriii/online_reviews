My bantam boxer friend Eric, who is from Chicago, recommended The Gage on my query, "I eat breakfast there every time I'm in town." So in between tourist destinations, and on a time crunch near Millennium Park, this place promised something more local than Pot Belly or Bennigan's. "What's good?" "The special is a Pastrami Sandwich" answered the solicitous pretty waitress.  And yes, it was a good pastrami sandwich, but when the bill came, $15.50 it seemed a bit steep, but after all, I was on Michigan Avenue in the thick of it all. A hotel restaurant with business people all around you. Decent lunch. Food is better than average but there was a faint whiff of BS going around.
