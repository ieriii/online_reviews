Walking into Hot Doug's after seeing many reviews and pictures via Time Out Chicago, Check, Please!, etc... the place still enchanted me with the atmosphere. Braving through the lines and going for the first time w/ my girlfriend last year we were lucky to get there early and missed the growing line. The rotating specials entice you to come back for multiple visits, the Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage being my personal favorite. The game of the week seems to be a bit more of a riskier eat, and the regular menu provided some of the best tasting brats I've ever eaten. The staff is energetic and fun without being frazzled by the busy crowd. In the end Hot Doug's in my eyes has carved itself as Chicago mainstay and has reinvented the ways people view hot dogs and how they can taste. For that experience and talking to Doug himself every time I order his equally creative and great tasting hot dogs I am grateful. P.S. the fries sometimes upstage the hot dogs and that's just the regular ones not the duck fat.
