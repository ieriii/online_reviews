The food at Glenn's Diner is definitely five-star. No standard diner food here...fresh produce, fresh seafood, wide menu variety, not to mention the fantastic all-you-can-eat specials they have going on the weeknights (crab legs, ribs, and peel-and-eat shrimp). Their breakfasts are fantastic...I am particial to the Gonzo Corned Beef--comes with corned beef, eggs, toast, huge fruit cup, fresh-squeezed orange juice, chocolate milk, coffee...and pancakes...what more can you ask for??? The ONE thing keeping me from giving five stars? The service is always rather ambivalent. Maybe it's the fact that it's not really a diner and you don't get that "diner charm" but of the handful of times we've been here, our servers have been very short of friendly, and although adept, missing that oomph that makes you feel really taken care of.  In any event, the service won't keep me from coming back for my "add some more meat to the wagon I'm draggin'" known as the Gonzo....sigh...
