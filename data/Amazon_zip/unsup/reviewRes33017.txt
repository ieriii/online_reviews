I'm not usually into this kind of food. But great value for what you get, I had a falafel, hummus, pita, and cucumber sandwich and that was good, the buffet style lunch looked solid, hot, and had a good variety as well. The vegetarian friendly/cheap nature of the place lent it to a pretty hardcore hipster hangout spot which I liked the change of pace.
