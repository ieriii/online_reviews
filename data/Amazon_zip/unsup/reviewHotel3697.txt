I stayed at The Drake with my family for about 5 days in June 2009. We LOVED it. I booked my hotel on Priceline and was SUPER excited when we landed here. I love staying at older hotels like this. Everything was very clean and elegant. The restaurants are expensive, but that is to be expected. We even got a bit of a room upgrade just for asking. Everyone we interacted with was really enjoyable and helpful. Oh and my 3 year old daughter loved the couches in the elevators.
