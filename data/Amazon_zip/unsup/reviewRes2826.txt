I am not a food groupie, I don't fawn at some pretentious display of food. If you are easily swayed by that, and you have dining plans immediately before or after your visit, Tru might be the place for you. I went in a group, and went along with the consensus, not knowing what to order. I had about six kinds of caviar in very small amount. Next, was some kind of foam or reduction, not really sure what the hell that is, but it was unique. After, I had what looked like glazed salmon and blackened chicken, without their respective flavors. The service was rude and condescending, which I suppose is obligatory for a restaurant of its type. A few of us went out for gyros after the Tru experience. We were really hungry and frustrated.
