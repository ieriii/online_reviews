This place was great! I absolutely loved it. I went with two other people and we each got the two meat/two veggie combo. We decided to get it on one huge platter though so we couldn't exactly tell each other's orders apart but it didn't matter--we all shared and everything was SUPERB. We had ground chickpeas, cooked spinach, spicy and mild lamb and beef. The flavors were so varied that each bite was something new. The bread that it's served with (and on) has a crazy texture but it works perfectly with the food. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants to try something new and loves food with a lot of flavor. Go with a bunch of people, everyone get something different, and then dig in--you'll savor every minute of it.
