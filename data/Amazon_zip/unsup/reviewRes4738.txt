Hands down my favorite place in Chicago. I even ate there twice in one week recently. The wine list has a good variety and reasonable pricing. My picks for food - neck bone gravy, pig ears, turkey leg, grilled octopus and of course the bone marrow! I've had the marrow undercooked on one occasion but they replaced it. I've never had to wait more than 10 min for a seat.
