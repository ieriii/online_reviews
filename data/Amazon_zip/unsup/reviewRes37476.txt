The sheer friendliness of the bartender really pushed this place into a 5 star rating, but this place wins all around. Been here twice. First time had some beer, had some mussels, and both were top notch. A little pricey, but nothing to write home about. Second time - brought my Mom, Aunt and the lady here. My Aunt decides she wants a Cosmo. I can only assume this is because it's always been her dream to publicly humiliate me by making me order her a Cosmo at a crowded bar. Worse yet, Mom wants a gin martini and the lady a vodka martini, dirty. I suck it up, order the drinks and to my sheer surprise, the girl behind the bar looks actually HAPPY to do it. Having bartended for years and acknowledging that this is almost strictly a beer bar, I was shocked by her peppy approach to shaking 3 totally different martinis on a crowded Friday night. The food was solid (brisket, mussels and sausage platter VERY good) but the venison was dry and over-cooked. Steer clear of that and you should be fine. Back to the beer - they've got a wide selection (especially of Belgians) and a fairly good description of all of them so you know what you're getting into. The bartenders I've talked to seem to know their stuff as well. If you're not in the mood for beer, their wine list is brief but solid and comprehensive. If you haven't been yet, go. Get some beer, get some mussels (the chorizo style are better) and enjoy it.
