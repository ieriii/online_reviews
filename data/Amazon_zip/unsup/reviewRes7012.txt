I came here with a friend who was visiting and it did not disappoint. There's a fine line between casual pizza-n-pasta-in-a-silver-to-go-container places and the fine dining places that my parents usually enjoy but I'm still too poor to afford (unless I can scam a good Groupon or it's Restaurant Week). Sapori was good food at a good price. We split the fried calamari (not too heavy and nice and crispy with a very good gravy) and I had a chicken special that had a bunch of goodies on it. The wine wasn't bad either and was also decently priced. It was a little cramped for my liking but it was a nice atmosphere. The service was also accomodating. I would go back for sure.
