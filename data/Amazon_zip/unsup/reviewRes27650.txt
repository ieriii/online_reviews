The food was great, but I'm not sure it's worth a 2+ hour wait if you don't have a reservation. If you find yourself with no reservation and wanting to try frontera, your best bet is likely hovering behind people seated at the bar, waiting to grab a seat. It worked for me, but still took about 30 minutes before I could grab some seats at the bar. Food and drinks were great. After dinner I stopped at Xoco (next door) for chocolate churros. If you're not interested in waiting for a seat at the bar, I recommend trying either Maya del sol in Oak Park or Xni Pec in Brookfield. You'll probably not have a wait at either place, unless it's a Friday/Saturday night.
