Geja is one of the best restaurants I've ever eaten at. The romantic experience is the highlight of the night, MOST of the food is very good, complimenting that. With a Premier Dinner you get 3 courses. I'm not a huge fan of the cheese fondue, it's too sweet for my liking. They also don't give you the best things to dip in it...apples, bread, and grapes? Not my idea of what I'd like to put in cheese, but I'm sure it's a traditional thing. For your main meal, you have your choice of lobster, beef, shrimp, scallops or chicken along with potatoes and vegetables... DELICIOUS! The plethora of sauces they provide you with make the meats all the more enjoyable. It's great that you can cook the meat to your liking...the chicken is kind of difficult because of the darkness of the restaurant, so make sure it's cooked fully! Then comes the chocolate. I'm usually far too full by this point, but still manage to get some pound cake and marshmellows down my throat. yumyumyum. Great for date nights or just taking out someone special, not a frequent thing seeing as you'll spend over $100 for just 2 people. It's definitely a hidden gem in Lincoln Park!
