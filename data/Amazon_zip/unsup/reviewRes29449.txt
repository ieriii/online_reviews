HOLY CRAP! This place was AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I cannot BELIEVE that I used to live in Chicago for 7 years, and it is now, 5 years later, that I am hearing about this place! as a vegetarian, it is so nice to finally have a place where I can go for some delicious vegetarian breakfast food! We were in a group of 6, so there was a bit of a wait, but I can tell you that it was completely worth the wait! Now, I have never actually eaten meat, as a life-long vegetarian, so I cannot truthfully compare the meat-less options to the real thing. However, that being said, I was extremely impressed with the taste of the seitan patty (that I actually stole off of my sister's plate...). Everyone in our group had something different and no one left unsatisfied! I ordered the Hazelnut coffee with whipped cream, the potato skins, and the Huevos a la Mexicana. (I stole part of the seitan patty from my sister's French Toast Combo). I cannot WAIT until I'm in the Chi again so that I can have breakfast at the Chicago Diner. :)
