A friend of mine recommended Garcia's so I am here to do the same for you. The food is superb and it is a bargain to boot. I usually opt for the burritos, which are huge and the best burritos I have ever tasted. They are so filling too. They contain generous portions of meat, beans, cheese, lettuce, tomato and - this is key - avocado. You have to get avocado, especially if you order chicken. They are also open late which is key for those nights when you have been out late and want something to eat before heading home. I suspect Garcia's is the reason there isn't a Chipotle within miles of Lincoln, Western and Lawrence.
