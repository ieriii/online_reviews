I was here New Year's eve before heading out to a party. It was a good idea since the food was plentiful and not over seasoned. A few of the other restaurants I've been to of this type have over seasoned the meat ruining the experience. My favorite here was the bacon wrapped filet and chicken as well as the lamb. It 's not something I could or should do on a regular basis but for a special occasion such as the new year it was nice. I did like the salad bar but when you come to a place like this you are here for the meat. I wouldn't want to bring a date here but would be good to go here with family and friends. Definitely worth checking out1
