Really should be 4.5 stars. My second favorite place for deep-dish pizza, after Giordano's. Came here on a weekday night with two friends and we had to stand outside to wait for a table. It felt like a line to get into a club. They don't pre-order, so when you finally get seated, you'd order and then wait the 30-45 mins for the pizza. I hope they add the pre-ordering option soon, although it is worth the wait. We got a medium, half Gino's east supreme, and half meaty legend. Again, two slices each was almost too much. But it was so good we couldn't stop eating. You'd say "no more!" But then you see there's a slice left, and you don't want the tastiness to go to waste, so you suck it up and scarf down your third slice of the night. It's not super cheesy, but the toppings made up for that. Pricing is acceptable. The medium pizza, some sodas and a pitcher of beer came out to $60 after t/t.  The walls are covered in notes and writings from previous customers. I didn't know you could add your own personal touch to it until after. I'll definitely have to come back to leave my own legacy, and have one more slice...or three...
