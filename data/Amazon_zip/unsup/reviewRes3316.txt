I lost the will to write reviews, kind of sad really. But Crisp is making me make an exception because I have been thinking about their wings since I had them yesterday. Don't pass up the wings. But wait, you say, I've seen the menu, they serve more than just wings. That is true, but nothing else should occupy room in your tummy when it can be filled with these wings! And, filled it will be, these things are monstrous. When gauging how many to order 1 Crisp wing = 3-4 standard bar wings. The Seoul Sassy is out of this world delicious. And the heat of the Crisp BBQ is great, but just based on flavor Seoul Sassy is where it's at. And to think, I let this place sit on my bookmark list for over two years! What was I waiting for?!?!
