OMG, Welcome to my new weakness. The burgers here are amazing! I got the Ponzi Scheme with apples, fried prosciutto and Swiss cheese and I added a fried egg (don't forget the pretzel bun!). I don't know what kind of meat is in these burgers, but I have not had a burger this good since I was in Miami at LaTub. The beer list is extensive which I really like because I like to try out new imports. I think my favorite thing yet though was the Mac and Cheese!!! It has cheese imported from Ireland and it has a little kick to it. I wanted to take an order home. The music here seems to get heavier at the night goes on, and I think the food is offered until close. I will be tipping a few back here and can't wait to try other items on the menu. Highly recommended! :)
