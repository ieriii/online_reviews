I spent the fourth of July weekend here and I enjoyed my stay immensely. The Fairmont is an ideal location for an out-of-town visitor. It is on a very traffic street itself, but surprisingly central to everywhere you want to go. I ate in Aria and enjoyed my dinner very much. The staff were invariably friendly and competent. I was upgraded to the Gold Level and enjoyed mytime in the Gold Lounge. Christopher is a super nice guy and will do all he can to accommodate your request. The room was clean and spacious. The bathroom was just beautiful and there was a nice roomy closet. I was very satisfied. Join the President's Club and wifi is free with the room.
