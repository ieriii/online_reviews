Welp let me say I ate here with Sean D. I will echo his eliquent statement regarding the food: "HAM SANDWICH=SECKS in MOUTH DUCK REUBEN=SECKs IN MOUTH." We ordered both and each had half of each. I didn't realize a ham sandwich could be so good. SECKS IN MOUTH is right Sean. (the good kind of secks that is, the kind you actually want in mouth) The beer selection was pretty great. All served in the proper glassware bearing the respective brewery's emblems. They had some uncommon stuff but nothing I'd call extremely rare. I wish the place was a little larger, or that at least the bar was. There really aren't many spots, luckily we snagged a pair of them for our dinner. Its definitely a good place to hit if you are a craft beer lover.
