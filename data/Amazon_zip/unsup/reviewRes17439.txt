I can't believe I haven't reviewed Carnivale! Mike and I went here on our first date long ago, and we need to go back before he moves to Pittsburgh in July. Carnivale has some of the best decor of any restaurant I've been to. It is huge and loud and fun. The drinks are amazing - I love the raspberry mojito! Expect to wait. Even with our 9:00 reservation, I don't think we were seated until almost 9:30. it's okay, the drinks made up for it. Guacamole was great, and we've been back for just drinks and guac. For dinner, I had shredded pork with plantains. I remember it being good, and I also remember not being able to finish even half of it, there was so much food on the plate! A great way to spend our first official date, and I know we'll be back before he moves.
