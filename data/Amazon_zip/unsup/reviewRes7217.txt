This past Saturday, the boyfriend and I decided to give Sapori Trattoria a try. We had passed by it countless times, btu had never eaten there. We are regulars at Alive One and Mayan Palace, so I am not sure what kept us away before. Anyway, Valentine's Day Dinner seemed the perfect oppportunity to try it out. We had a reservation for 8pm. We were addressed at the front, and asked to wait 10 minutes. We are laid back, so we were fine with waiting a few. Plus, it was PACKED, which only increased my confidence. After about 15 minutes of waiting, the host (I think he may have been the owner?) handed us the wine list and asked us to pick out a glass of wine on him to appease us for the wait. It was a very nice personal touch. I was already in love! The great customer service didn't stop there. Our server was friendly, knowledgeable, and prompt. And the food? The mussels in white sauce were huge, succulent, and probably the best I have ever had. The Insalata Stella was also delicious. I had the Pumpkin Ravioli, and it was divine. Such a unique flavor combination, but soooo good! The boyfriend had the Spaghetti allo Scoglio. It was also delicious and a HUGE portion (seriously enough to feed four.)  I cannot wait to tell more people about how awesome this place is. It is also easy to find coupons and they have specials, making it a more reasonable price.We will most certainly be back, especially in the Summer when the outside dining option is open.
