This is a great place. There are three locations right next to each other so you are going to get served. Its amazing. The tacos are so meaty and the cilantro is phenomenal. I would recommend this place to anyone visiting Chicago who wants really really good late night Mexican food. I always try to end up here when I am starving late night. I would recommend La Pasadita to anyone!!
