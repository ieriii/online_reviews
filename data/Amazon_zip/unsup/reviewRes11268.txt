Must say this is my favorite place for two of my favorite things: pizza and beer! The beer being the important part because to me Revolution's beer is sub-par to that which I can have at Piece! The pizza is good too; although I can't make my favorite combo of spinach and pineapple. A waiter explained that the owner hates the "hawaiian pizza combo" and therefore neither pineapple or ham are on the menu. Oh well, I will live! And it says it's not a good place for children; but they do accomdate.
