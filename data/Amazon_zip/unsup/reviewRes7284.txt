We visit Chicago often but when our friend said she was taking us to a BBQ place I was a bit suspicious. I mean KC is for BBQ, Memphis, Nashville, etc. But it didn't take long for us to be won over. While we were seated I noticed the Chef/owner looked familiar. I asked our server if that was the girl from Food Channel's Pitmasters. Yes, it was Lee Ann Whippen. Lee Ann stopped by our table several times during our feast. She was very friendly, discussing our favorite KC spots. Her Dad is from KC and she is familiar with Arthur Bryants, Gates, and others. Q's ribs are dry rubbed and served with a choice of sauce on the side, my favorite way. We had a combo platter and an extra slab of the competition ribs. Both rib styles are excellent, the competion seemed a bit meatier. It was all excellent, great service, friendly staff. Pricey? Hey it's Gold Coast, it ain't Murpheysboro, but very reasonable. Try it.
