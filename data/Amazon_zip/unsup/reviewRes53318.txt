Over the top food experience - Grant Hachatz is a little cuisine genius. The experience he offers is incredible, intense, surprising and delicious. The food would deserve its 3 Michelin stars. The 16 courses Menu is extraordinary. We unfortunately followed the advice to do Wine-Pairing (probably most people do that as they don't know what wine to chose). Poor decision. This is outrageously expensive and the wine do not make up for it. Our sommelier was like a robot, had no passion (or not time to share it) about the wines, border-line rude wine portions were ridiculous. On top of this, paired-wined are just OK... Go there but pick you're own wines. Don't listen to their purely economically driven advice that you should do wine pairing. Pick one white and one red and you'll be good for the experience.
