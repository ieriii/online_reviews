I was pleasantly surprised by the food and service after a morning spent at the Art Institute across the street. I was originally going to have lunch in the museum's cafe and am glad I didn't after a hearty and nicely prepared burger-lunch at The Gage. A recent addition to the South Loop dining scene, the staff didn't miss a beat and were more than gracious to a solo lunch diner preferring a table to the bar. I'll be back.
