Always great to dine in a Italian restaurant and Italian food is my favorite. Sabatino's deserves 5 stars. The steak is perfectly marbled and grilled and the amazing crispy French fries)are simply destined to go.They have excellent soups. On my last visit we had a lovely cold Tomato puree that was to die for. The flavors were perfect, and I am not normally a fan of cold soups with the steak on this plate.The pasta dishes here are always the measuring stick for me and Sabatino's has some very appealing choices. The meat and seafood courses have always been impressive. The chef has a light hand and one rarely sees anything overcooked. Last time I was here 3 months ago tried the Agnello Casalinga which is a grilled lamb chop done with shitake mushrooms and julienned bell peppers in a white wine reduction with balsamic vinegar. Oh my! What flavor. The lamb was amazingly tender but most importantly, it was very mellow tasting, just like I prefer it. If you like lamb, try this dish!
