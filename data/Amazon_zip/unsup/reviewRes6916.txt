A great neighborhood gem! I recently threw my Fiance a last minute surprise birthday party for 20 people here and it was executed beautifully. Everyone absolutely loved the food and the wine was wonderful. Ricardo and Anthony B were a dream to work with and our waiter Jeff handled the group perfectly.
