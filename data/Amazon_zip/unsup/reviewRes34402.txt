They have the best falafel I've ever had! They have a great salad bar (phenomenal but pricy) and amazing soup (chicken noodle & lentil). It's cash only but they have an ATM inside. They're a great choice for vegetarians and vegans and meat eaters alike. In the summer, they set up tables outside. Very easy on the wallet. You've got to try this place at least one!
