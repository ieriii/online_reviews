I like the Hopleaf. Delicious beverages and a saucy menu makes a happy C Fu. So many good dishes here. I recall their Thai Mussels, which were mussels in coconut milk, kaffir lime leaf and other goodies...so good. Great combo. Oh, and how could we forgot about their frites. Their crispy, greasy, salty potatoes that go so good in their delicious aiolis. Their Mac and Cheese is great (if not a bit stinky...remember...it's Stilton Cheese) and I've had some great entrees there. It's really a great place to hang out in the 'ville, though it can get pretty friggin packed. Our latest attempt here was totally bamboozled by the Hopleaf barring food on their outdoor patio. On the first 80 degree day of the year. Why, Hopleaf, why? I still love you though.
