I was thoughly impressed the first time I went here and have been back several times since then. I'm currently attempting to try all the crepes that they offer and I haven't been disappointed yet. The Marrakesh Crepe has been my favorite so far. Most crepe places tend to be French, which is cool too, but you don't find many that are north African themed, so that adds an element of individuality to this place. All the crepes are reasonably priced especially since they are the biggest, most filling crepes I've ever had.
