If you go to this place on a weekend or during dinner-time on any day, you would never believe America was going through a recession. This place is always crowded but there are plenty of good reasons why. If you haven't gone to Grand Lux Cafe on a weekend, you must. What people do not realize is that they also have some of the best breakfast food that you can find (in my opinion of course), and you can only get it here on Saturdays and Sundays from when the restaurant opens until about 2:30pm. The brioche french toast plain or with strawberries are amazing and the pancakes are so good, they can stimulate the economy. The different types of omelettes are not a bad choice as well. If you are a fan of burgers or even pasta, you should love this place. One problem I have with this place is accessibility obviously, it's in the middle of downtown so your best bet is to park in the parking facility on Ohio street, because if you use the valet service you will be waiting about 15-20 minutes for your car. It will take you 5-10 minutes to walk to the parking lot and get your car while paying less at the same time once you get your parking validated. Other than that, you won't find it too much different than the Cheesecake Factory, which was created by the same people. The atmosphere is just a little better here.
