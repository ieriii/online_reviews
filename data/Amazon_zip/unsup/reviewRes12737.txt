Been to Brazzaz and Fogo; thought I'd try Texas de Brazil. Service is the best of the three but food wise Brazzaz has a better selection. Texas de Brazil's meat was salty. Salad bar was descent.  I loved the seared tuna (not sure if it was Ahi or not). I would only recommend if you have a coupon. If you are going to pay full price go to Brazzaz.
