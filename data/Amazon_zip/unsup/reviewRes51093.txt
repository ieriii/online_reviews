My husband and I tried this place for brunch this morning. We met two friends there who have a 15-month-old, and it was a great choice for families with small children. The staff was so friendly and accommodating, and really went out of their way for the child. Our server was experienced and so friendly and helpful. Andersonville is a competitive neighborhood for brunch places but this one was refreshingly low key, classy, and uncrowded (we did sit down at 10:30 and it got busier as we ate). I had the crab cake salad and mimosa (ok, 2 mimosas) and everything was delicious. I definitely recommend.
