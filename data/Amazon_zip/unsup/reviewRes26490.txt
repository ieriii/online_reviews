Went to Pequod's last week and ordered their thin crust for the first time. The pan pizza is much better, but we wanted to give their thin crust a try. Definitely stick with the pan.  The pizza is pretty expensive, but good. We go for the atmosphere and love their 2 people booths. We also ordered the zucchini sticks as an appetizer, and that was a rip-off. I agree with Frankie J., just only order the pan pizza. Their pan pizza takes a while (30-35 minutes), so if you're hungry, pre-order your pizza over the phone, and it'll be ready for your when you sit down!
