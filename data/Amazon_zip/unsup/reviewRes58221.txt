Let's see, where to begin...I made reservations a month in advance for some friends visiting from Boston - old friends. This place was recommended by two good friends, one who works at a restaurant and one who has even helped the chefs prep. Highest recommendations - allegedly a great time.I was contacted yesterday to confirm my reservation. Today I was contacted again to confirm my reservation (by the same person - Seth) which is kind of retarded considering I specifically confirmed my reservation the day before over the phone. At 5pm I received an obsequious call - we're sorry, the chef has been called away, we have to cancel for the night. Is there anything we can do so that you don't hate us? This was at 5pm for an 8pm reservation, after I had confirmed twice. I asked what that meant - the chef has been called away? The same phrase was repeated again to me over the phone. We can't run when the chef's not in. Um Duh. Is he in the CIA? Is he a raging non-functioning alcoholic? I don't know. Is he a poor businessman? Yes, unfortunately. Perhaps he's a childish artistic savant. Who knows?I ended up cooking in house and it was great. Probably the idea of what Schwa is going for anyways. Not at all a disappointment. However, if you care about your guests and don't want to be embarrassed by the poor manners and mercurial adolescent stylings of a spoiled savant. Please, please, please pay attention to these reviews and go elsewhere.
