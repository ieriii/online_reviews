Deliciously unique twist on Southern food Wonderful atmosphere Good service Nice place to take friends Surprisingly veggie-friendly Went here with a friend on his birthday. Turned out to be a great experience. We decided to go here after the girl behind the counter at Bleeding Heart Bakery recommended it. Had no idea what we were in for...but it was a pleasant surprise. He's originally from Texas so we had plenty to talk about as we were served, what the owners have coined, "southern reconstruction food." Afterward, we spent a couple hours coveting guitars at Chicago Music Exchange. What a fun day!
