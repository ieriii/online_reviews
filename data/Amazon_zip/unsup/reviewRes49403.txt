I experienced the worst case of price gouging over a Michael Jackson cookie at Alliance Bakery. Michael Jackson cookies were being sold at Alliance Bakery out of the case for $2.95. Later on I called to price / time check a special order. I was quoted $2.95 with a two-day notice. I requested for the icing "skin color" of the cookie to be brown instead of white like the original design. I was told this would be done with food coloring not chocolate and the price would remain $2.95. I said I would call right back so I could figure out how many cookies to order. I called back less than two minutes later to order two-dozen cookies and was told the cookie was now $3.95. I talked to the owner of Alliance Bakery to share my experience and was yelled at and hung-up on. My question is...Is brown Michael Jackson more delicious than white Michael Jackson? Why did the price increase a dollar for a change in skin color???
