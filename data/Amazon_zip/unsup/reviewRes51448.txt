I don't really like this place. The service is great, but the food is bleh. Ginormous portions, but heavy, and I would be scared to find out the calorie and fat counts. I guess if one likes Mexican food and has a lot of people, it would maybe be a good place to go, as it's very spacious and has some large tables.
