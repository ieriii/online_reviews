So many beers, so little time... Their beer menu is hugenormous. Ranging in price from $5 to $20+. High recommend checking it out, their food menu is sort of small, and not very veggie friendly but their 'frites' (which are fries) are delicious. My only complaint is that its too packed, and there is minimal seating. Other than that this place is awesome!
