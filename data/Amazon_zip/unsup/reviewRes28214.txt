HORRIBLE!!!!! A damn disgrace!!!! Went for lunch on November 1st with friends and the beef(Carne Assada - spell??) was so tough that I couldn't cut it or chew it!!!! When I mentioned this to the manager he said "I tried it myself and I stand by my food."  He did not offer to substitute a meal or refund my money.  What happened to THE CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS RIGHT???????  NUEVO LEON is not what it is hyped up to be. UGH!!!!!!
