It was in a dream that I imagined a heaping plate full of succulent, flavorful meat, accompanied by Cuban black beans, rice, and perfectly cooked plantains. A grand Cuban feast, topped off by a perfect mojito. Although it wasn't exactly the meal of my dreams, I got close this week. I've always felt that Ropa Vieja is a dish that should be used to judge a Cuban restaurant. I admit I've had the homemade stuff, so I have high standards! Cafe 28 does it right. The meat was tender, flavorful, and a lot of it. The black beans that accompanied the dish were cooked and seasoned nearly perfectly. And the plantains...oh, the plantains, so sweet and tender. I could've eaten a plate of those alone.  I also shared the ceviche appetizer. Ignoring the under-ripe avocado garnish, it was pretty damn good. Not an overwhelming lime flavor and with seafood pieces bigger that I expected. My mojito was done just about right. Not perfect. Just about right. I do prefer them a little stronger than what was served, but what else is new? And what was in that flavored butter? Honey, garlic, red pepper flakes?...all good stuff and a nice addition to the bread. This is a cozy little spot that's good for going out with friends, or could be a great date destination. Either way, I'll be back again for sure.
