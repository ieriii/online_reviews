I appreciate the beer selection here, but for my wife and I it's a bit of a hike to get there and I'm sad to say the last two times we made the trip it was absolutely not worth it. This was one of the first places I took my now-wife back in 2004, given her love of Belgian beers. We were able to sit quickly, the food was great, the beers were great. And then the Check Please episode aired. Still, with great food and beers, we could handle a bit of a wait. However, the last two times we made the trip, the mussel were absolutely vile. Horrible. Unspeakably bad. Unmitigated fish bait. However you want to put it. And the waits are longer than ever -- over an hour and a half on a weekend for a 2 person table (i.e. the easiest to seat). The beer is still great, but I think it's cheaper to drink at the Map Room, and given our proximity to the Map Room we don't bother to make the trip anymore to Hopleaf. After two bad experiences in a row with the food, we weren't about to take the time to go up there to wait forever only to have the same thing happen yet again. One of the owners is really nice (I haven't met his wife), and supportive of the beer community here. I'm glad for them that the place is so popular. But I can't in good faith recommend it to people anymore for anything other than drinking Belgian beers. 3 stars just for the beer selection alone and for their support of Drinking & Writing, among other things. If you go, go on a weeknight where at least your wait will have a half-decent chance of being under an hour. Weekends are a lost cause, as it's even worse than Kuma's wait - you're going to wait forever.
