This place excels in inconsistency. The hubby and I love brunch, so we went here for his birthday breakfast last week. We ordered the Fried Green Tomatoes to start, which were fabulous, but we asked for them to be served with our meals, which they were not, which I could deal with if it weren't for what followed. I ordered the Creole Creme Cheese Omelet and he had the Big Jones Square Breakfast. It must have been birthday luck because his was a simple breakfast cooked to perfection. Mine, however, was not. The spices used in the omelet completely overtook the thing, but that still was not my problem. The omelet was so rubbery you could bounce it off the floor and I am entirely convinced this was due to the fact that it had been kept warm in the oven for eternity while waiting to be served. The cheese grits suffered the same rubbery fate. I just wish they would have been served when they were made so I could write an accurate review. So, alas, my experience was not great but the hubby was perfectly pleased. We returned this weekend in need of a pick-me-up after a Halloween party. I thought I would give something simpler a go and got the Two-Egg Breakfast with Fried Green Tomatoes on the side. My poor tomatoes were burned to a crisp, but the rest was delish. The hubby repeated his breakfast, but found his sausage and bacon to both be way overcooked.  You might luck out and get the good stuff. Or you might not. Head here if you're a gambler. And just on a personal note, I enjoy my Southern food with a touch of love of comfy coziness. This place is not as fancy as it thinks it is. And with the crazy inconsistencies, it's way overpriced. It's a shame, cause it could be so good.
