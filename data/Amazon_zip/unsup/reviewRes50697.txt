I know, 5 stars for wishbone? Yep. The only thing I would change about this place is their Cola (they have pepsi...ew). I have been here twice so far. The first time I got a thanksgiving dinner complete with turkey, stuffing, mashed tators, cranberry sauce, coleslaw, and green beans. It was awesome. This time I got the pulled pork with slaw mac and cheese, and asparagus. It also came with corn bread and rolls. Great pulled pork. It's not in a sandwich, but you can make your own with the rolls provided. The BBQ sauce is fantastic. The menu is great, there are so many options, and so many specials each day, it's great. My southern boyfriend also thinks is great!
