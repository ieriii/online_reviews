I'm not a fan of Chinese food. The only reason I went here was because my friend was intent on Chinese (and I picked last time) and Yelpers seems to love Sun Wah, so I thought I'd give it a whirl. First. Service was very friendly. The minute we put our menu down someone was over to take our order (I love that).  Friendly, unobtrusive, and courteous. The previous reviewers prepared me for the starkness of the dining area (so much so I was half expecting a cockroach to run across my food while a rat danced under my table), it's really not bad at all. It looks like any restaurant on Argyle Street, clean but minimal.  We got the roast duck (a medium for two people), a plate of the mixed vegetables, eggrolls and wonton soup.  The eggrolls came out almost immediately (thank you...I was really hungry). Deep fried deliciousness without greasy fingers, what more could you ask from an eggroll? Next came the wonton soup. Huge portion of soup with about 6 or 7 big wontons. Very tasty. Next came the stir-fry of mixed veggies (chinese broccoli, napa cabbage, mushrooms, baby corn, carrots). Good. I slathered the spicy mustard sauce all over mine and enjoyed. Then we waited. And waited. Our server came over and looked in shock at our table that we had not received our duck. She sighed, ran back to the kitchen and came back with our plate of duck. It was good. But cold. Eh. I'll come back and try again. Maybe next time with a larger group so we can get the special with the duck and steamed buns...but this visit was just ok.
