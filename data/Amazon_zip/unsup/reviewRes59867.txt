We arrived at Kinzie Chop House very late (10:30 p.m.), just returning to Chicago from South Bend. Even though we were "under-dressed" for this restaurant, we were welcomed with open arms. Our waiter was very gracious and provided us with information that the kitchen would be closing within a short time period and about specials and great recommendations. We started with a Manhattan and Lemon Zest Martini. Both were prepared as requested and very tasty. With our waiter's suggestion, we ordered the Rock Shrimp Rissoto Cake with Lobster Sauce. It was excellent with a crunchy crust and with sauce with a touch of heat at the end. Our party enjoyed the Steak Rissoto, Apple Wood Smoked Pork Chop and the Steak and Shrimp special. The steak special was cooked to a perfect medium rare. The Pork Chop was very juicy and tender. All in all the food was excellent, full of flavor. We ordered a bottle of Barbera wine which the waiter said was still a bit young, and he was correct. Once it had time to breathe, it went well with our meal. We would definitely recommend this restaurant for dinner.
