Sad - it's a beautiful space, but geez, weird and bad service. I had a reservation for a room with a king bed, there was a queen bed. There were holes in one of the sheets and comforter cover. When we turned out the light to sleep, there was loud base beat and our windows were shaking. Vertigo is on the 25th floor and we were on the 18th floor. We called the front desk and asked to be moved but were told they were full up and nothing they could do (no apology or anything but attitude). They said they'd send up security to give us ear plugs and they didn't show up until 45 minutes later. There was also this periodic knocking noise in the hallway or in the walls. Breakfast seating not good, we sat at the bar because we were seated at a huge community table where it appeared people were waiting a while to even order. Staff were running around like their heads were cut off. Food wasn't very good and we had to ask for the usual salt, pepper, cream, etc. that you'd expect from standard service. Just too much bad stuff to shake off when you're paying over $200 an nite for a romantic weekend.
