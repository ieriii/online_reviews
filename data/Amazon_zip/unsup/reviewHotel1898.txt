Rooms here are actually much nicer than the lakeshore location. Rooms seemed larger, BUT you have no views...but you are in the heart of the financial district. So it all depends on what you want. I like the rooms better. I will say SERVICE WAS SLOW EVERYWHERE. RESTARAUNT WAS HORRID SLOW, TOOK 40 MINUTES TO GET SCRAMBLED EGGS AND ANOTHER 10 MINUTES FOR KETCHUP. I think this can be a swank place, good location for theatre etc..but the service here is way below par and please expect to wait for everything here.
