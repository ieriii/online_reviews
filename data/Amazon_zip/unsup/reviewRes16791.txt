Oh Carnivale, oh carnivale! The food is just delightful! (sung to the tune of O Christmas tree) This is my new favorite place to dine at the moment; even though it's not new, and I've been there several times. It was, however, my first time in the dining area. Perhaps that's what rekindled my love? Let's start with the decor, shall we? I love the large spacious dining area. My kinda style with bold colors and whimsical fixtures with warm lighting. Color makey me happy! Very sophisticated vibe sans the snobbery. The music is always on jam. I don't know why I haven't made it there for Salsa night yet. What am I waiting for? The food? OMG, the food! My favorite is the ropa vieja appetizer. I couldn't tell you what all is in it (steak and plaintains I know, for sure), but man, is it good! This weekend I traipsed away from my usual and tried some different items. T'was by far, the best meal that I've had in a while. Their raspberry mojito: the good kind of memorable. I'm a sucker for truffle fries so that was a treat. Let me say this: I've always been indifferent about asparagus. Think it tastes like a cross between grass and something good for you. No mas! The asparagus was unlike any I've ever tasted. The flavors of the seasoning mixed with the cheese on top? Que bueno! Lastly, the steak that I had was out of this world. Please sir, may I have s'more?  The crowd is a nice mix of yuppy and mature. I like that you can throw on a cocktail dress and not feel out of place. The only drawback is that everytime I've been, there's ALWAYS a wait so we usually end up eating in the lounge area which tends to be extremely loud so you're yelling your conversation the entire time. Other than that, I think Carnivale is a cut above the rest of some of the other popular restaurants serving up Latin cuisine.
