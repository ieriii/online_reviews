Def fan of Publican. Chose to dine here on V-day knowing full well how awful the cliche "v-day" tables can be, one right on top of another. When I made the reso I even asked to have a 2-top table and not be seated at their extensive selection of communal seating. They couldn't promise, but they did deliver. That made the night for me right there! Our waitress was friendly and knew the menu very well. Also she was able to suggest beers which was very helpful and appreciated. The food was def not my thing but my bf loves pork so that is why we went. The ribs were really good tho. He loved the blood sausage and the brussel sprouts. My fav was dessert. Def do not skip! The carrot cake was fantastic!!  Oh and I loved the decor. Everything was great, so different and unusual. I would def recommend Publican.
