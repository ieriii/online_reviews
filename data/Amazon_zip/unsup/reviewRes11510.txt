Hands down, best pizza in the city. The microbeers are phenomenal and the staff are all rock stars. I can't remember the last time I've had such attentive service. Andy, the Assistant Brewmaster, actually took the time to give us a little background and education on all the beers we were tasting and even encouraged me to try a dark beer that I never would have normally even considered tasting and...i'm a convert! Thanks to owner Bill Jacobs for treating us like celebrities. Can't wait for my next Piece.
