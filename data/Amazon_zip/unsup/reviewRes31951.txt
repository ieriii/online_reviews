I thought it was weird that a non-vegatarian friend of mine insisted we go to this place for brunch but now I fully understand why. This place is a delicious vegan mecca with everything good. Their vegan milkshakes are a delicious treat on a hot day and the sandwich I had nearly made me lick the plate.
