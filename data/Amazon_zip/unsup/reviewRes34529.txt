A powerful breakfast. For not much more than $10 you can get an omelette, fruit *and* pancakes, something I could only have imagined before moving to Chicago. It's not the place for an intimate and quiet brunch, and the line is long on weekends, but it will give you the strength of a bear right through the afternoon.
