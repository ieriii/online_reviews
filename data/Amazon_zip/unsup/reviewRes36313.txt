I went to Meli once with a friend and I was only expecting a standard sandwich/breakfast place similar to a Denny's. However, the food was much better than what you'd get at a Denny's. It was busy during the time we went, but it is still a good place for lunch, getting a tasty sandwich, and just hang out in Greek town. Reminds me of Le Peep, I suppose, where the food is solid and the service is good.
