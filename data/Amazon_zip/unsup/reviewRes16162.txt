Pros: 1. Fantastic interior design (if you're into the days of yonder) 2. Lovely and charming server 3. Great drinks Mehs: 1. Music volume is still a bit too loud for a proper conversation not involving yelling. Cons: 1. Ugly men. I'm sure that these douches equate amount of gel usage with amount of testosterone and thus, overdose on the former. (Or maybe I should just come to terms that Wicker Park is dead to me. DEAD.) 2. Door man. If it's a Friday or Saturday, prepare to see large groups of man-douches and hooknasties cutting in front of you, with the help of a twenty and/or with the nestling of your tatties onto his. Actually, I take that back, this man is super smart.
