One of my favorite restaurants in Chicago with my favorite drink of all time!!! Dante's Paradise- smoky citrus with a kick. Affordable with a fancy Michelin star on top! Trendy without a pretentious atmosphere and great down-to-earth service. I absolutely LOVE small plates because you get to try so many things. Creative, playful menu with great flavors and spins on old favorites. Delicious bone marrow, soft gougeres, kentucky fried quail, and amazing scallops. I'm not even a fan of rabbit but enjoyed the deconstructed rabbit pot pie. Drool! Can't wait to try this place out for brunch!
