The first time I came here to browse on my way to heading to Navy Pier, they were offering prime black angus steak for the samples. The next time I came there, they were offering luscious dark chocolate truffle samples. I would be surprised if the next time I visited they would start offering pieces of lobster meat as their samples!  This place sure beats any other grocery store I've been to. Yes, their prices are higher than the average, but they cater to the rich and so you pay extra for that 5 star service and freshness. The workers at this store are very friendly as well, so feel free to stop by.
