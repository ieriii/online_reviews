Definitely good Indian food! Most of the customers were Indian which is always a good sign. Only things of concern was the service. Our waiter seemed to care more for his Indian customers than other races. Also, this place is very expensive for Indian food. They even charge $5 for a basic bowl or rice and $9.95 for a King Fisher beer too. Cmon people!
