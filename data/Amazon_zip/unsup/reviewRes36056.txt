This place is definitely worth the trip up to Argyle. The BBQ Duck alone is worth the trip and I love that you can get as much of it as you want small, medium, or large (5 bucks for a decent sized plate, the "small", is simply a steal). However, everything else at Sun Wah is just as good as their famed BBQ. The vegetables in oyster sauce are perfect and taste like homemade. The hot and sour soup is clearly made fresh and is the best I've had in Chicago bar none. The stuffed eggplant (note: this is a landmine for vegetarians since it's stuffed with shrimp) and the straw mushrooms with bean cakes are incredibly fresh and delicate. You just can't go wrong at this place. The "specials" menu posted awkwardly on the wall on paper plates is filled with winners. I love that you have to crane over other diners to read the damn thing, now that's authentic. My favorite special is the shrimp with walnuts tossed with asian mayo. We've been probably 10 times, and we're never disappointed. Especially since the bill is always less than we expect. Kelly, the goofy owner and head server, is lots of fun, especially when she makes fun of the customers. She visibly cringes when people ask for crab rangoons. And her carving of the Beijing duck is a pleasure to watch. Especially since she's so absent-minded you're sure she's gonna cut herself. Favorite dish:  BBQ duck and stuffed eggplant
