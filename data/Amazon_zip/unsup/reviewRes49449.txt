Went here 2 weeks ago with a friend and had a great experience. I had been here back in 2005 when they were at their old location so this was my first time at the new place. Still terrific food. You can't go wrong with the churrasco and the sangria was terrific. Really friendly service and great decor. This would be a great place to bring a group of people.
