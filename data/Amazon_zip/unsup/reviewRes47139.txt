Uncommon Ground - amazing in so many ways. I've always been a fan of the back rooms - coffee house (with ridiculously good spiked drinks) and live music, fabulous art on the walls. It took me a while to warm up to the newer restaurant in front, but I like the bar and the variety it adds. Just had brunch there for the first time - $5 bloody marys and chilaquiles to die for! I love that they are going local/green and cant' wait to check out the space on Devon.
