My friend and I went here on a Monday afternoon. Having seen this place featured on Man v. Food, I wanted to try it out. The place did not seem packed, but we had to wait about five minutes for workers to clear a table. Upon being seated, the waiter advised us that the deep dish pizza takes approximately 45-60 minutes to cook. Normally, I don't like long waits for food, but it was understandable, and I appreciate the fact that they at least made us aware. My friend and I split a family style salad. It was enough for about four small bowls of salad. It tasted good, but it was pretty typical. Our pizza came out quicker than I thought it would. We ordered a medium cheese deep dish pizza. The pie was overflowing with cheese, with the sauce on top (unlike what I am used to back on the East Coast - sauce, then cheese), and I enjoyed the pizza. Although slices are thick, my friend and I each ate about two pieces and brought the rest home as leftovers.
