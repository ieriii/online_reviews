A victim of watching cable television hungry and seeing the hot dogs and fries deep fried in duck fat made this a must try when in Chicago deal. Read about the lines, and found out they only serve the duck fat fries on Fri and Sat. So got there around 10:30 on a friday morning. Line wasn't to long. I'm assuming the person at the front was Doug, whomever he was, He was very friendly and proffessional. Most places, once they are featured on a tv show they appear nice on the show, but when you end up going there, they are usually rude. Not the case here. I ate a selma hyack and boy was she hot. The duck fat fries....couldnt tell the difference between them and regular fries. Oh well, I came for the novelty. Now I can check this off my list of places I've eaten at.
