yes ive come, yes ive eaten, and yes ive been satisfied, however this is a place ive wanted to like so much more than i actualy do. now im not saying the food here is bad as i did give it 4 stars... im just saying if this place battled the pita inn for the best falafel crown i would be the idiot in the crowd screaming "pita inn for the take down" now after saying that i feel like i shouldnt leave the house without some form of disguise on.
