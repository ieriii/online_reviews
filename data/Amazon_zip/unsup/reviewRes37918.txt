The Hopleaf is home to Chicago's finest beer selection. Wonderful Belgians and Belgian-likes, and tasty craft beers from around the world. The staff is friendly, knowledgeable, and fairly speedy. If you are lucky enough to get a seat at the bar, you will be in beer heaven. If you are not, you're kind of screwed. The place is tiny, and they won't let you sit in back because it "for dining only." I have actually got carded, then promptly walked out after seeing how crowded it is more times than I have drank there. I will go to Bar on Buena instead since the selection is almost as good and it's spacious and the service is better. HOWEVER, the dining at Hopleaf is excellent. If you are going to eat, you will have a much better experience here. I highly recommend the Steak Frites. Hopleaf is also home to the BEST MUSSELS in the city. The combination of bread, mussel broth, and garlic aioli can't be beat.
