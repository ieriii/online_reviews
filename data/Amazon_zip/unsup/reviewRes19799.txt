This place was fantastic! Our waitress was very attentive and helped explain everything on the menu. Their wine buyer happened to be in the restaurant that evening and our waitress got her to come over and explain the wine list to us and help us make a fantastic choice. I ordered the Elk which was AMAZING. My friend got the Lamb which was equally AMAZING. And the carmelized lobster was FANTASTIC. I can't wait to go back!
