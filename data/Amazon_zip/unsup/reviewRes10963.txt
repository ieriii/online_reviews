So adding on to the hundreds of reviews is my take on the place: Atmosphere: Can get busy during prime hours so expect a wait for a table or eat at the bar. It can get loud as well. Food: The pizza is definitely something to write home about. It's unique super thin crust is delicious no matter what you add as a topping but just be sure not to get carried away or your pizza will easily fall apart. Beer: This is the reason why I come. High ABV craft beers that are delicious and reasonably priced. They do run out of the ones I like a lot but they have a wide selection so it doesn't really matter. If you come here frequently or live close I highly recommend investing in a growler. $16 the first time and $12 for refills.
