OMG, I could cry! I just found out tonight that my fav ethiopian rest closed and so I went to Demera instead for take out and it was HORRID!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Honestly the worst food I've had in ages! We spent $30 on two entrees and only one was edible, and I'm using the term loosley. The other was the worst zil zil tibs I've ever seen. I knew, even before I dared to taste it, that it was going to be the toughest, worst beef EVER and I was SOOOOOOOOOOOO right. Wah! This was a MAJOR let down and total waste of money! BOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!
