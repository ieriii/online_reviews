i went here for the first time last week with my coworkers before an afternoon movie. the boss said the place is great, and i couldn't agree more. the lunch specials are an excellent value: it comes with salad, soup, entree, rice/noodles (usually, it depends on what you order), egg roll, dessert, and all you can drink tea, iced tea, or lemonade. a group of seven of us ate for under $70.00. i had the steak bahn mi, which was excellent. not amazing in the same way that a more traditional (and pork-centric) bahn mi usually is, but i was seriously craving this sandwich and it delivered. plus the egg roll, though small, was excellent. i will definitely eat here again, and get a lunch or dinner special when i do. only doing four stars here because i really didnt eat or try any of the "real" entrees, so i don't know what to expect, except that everyone seems to love what they serve here and i doubt i will be disappointed.
