LOVE the fact that... - Coast is BYOB, perfect for sushi because that's where half of the money goes when eating sushi with friends...well that's if you drink like we do. - The lighting is so dim, like 'film noir' dim...careful if you are on your first date...but could be good for a blind date I suppose (ha, that's terrible...but true). - Open til 12a! REALLY like that fact. I can tend to eat late...like a Spaniard, but with out the handsome black hair and sexy accent. We ordered... Hamachi Carpaccio Spicy Scallop Miso soap Spider Roll Sunny side shitaki ...and after that I lost count. All of it was appetizing and the presentation is slick. Coast has consistently offered a good experience and I will definitely find myself on its dark shores again.
