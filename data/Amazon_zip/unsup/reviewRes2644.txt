Excellent food, good atmosphere, friendly service, be ready to wait though. We got there on a weekday just after they opened and the place was already relatively full. I once passed by on a Saturday and saw a ridiculously long line so i would advise going early unless you don't mind the wait. The food came quick so I can imagine the line moves quickly. The alligator dog I had was certainly worth it and i would recommend to anyone in or coming to Chicago.
