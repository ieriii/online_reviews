I went here Saturday night with a large group of friends and wow - this place is popular! Street parking was a breeze and we took advantage of the BYOB ($8 corkage). If you have reservations, this place is great for group dinners - birthday, etc. Due to the size and volume of people, I wouldn't say this people would be quiet enough for a date but it was very fun for a get together with friends. The food is really the highlight though - like most, I had the combination plate with chimchurri skirt steak, grilled shrimp, yuca, potatoes and fried plaintain. We skipped appetizers and I still had leftovers. YUM! Will be back!
